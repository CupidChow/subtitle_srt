1
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,900
Compassionate at Heart.

2
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,210
Exceptional in Skill.

3
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,490
He insisted on that.

4
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,380
I just tell the truth.

5
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,490
I hope this does not sound silly to you.

6
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,410
No.

7
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,130
Every word is accurate.

8
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,460
If those three words were bigger, it would be perfect.

9
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,690
Hurry, put it up on the wall.

10
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,180
Sure.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,930
Transferring hospital today, right?

12
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,620
Your flap recovers well.

13
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,290
Transfer to a rehabilitation hospital for follow-up

14
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,770
can save a lot of money.

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,690
How do you feel now?

16
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,900
Still stuffy when you breathe?

17
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,690
Feel better.

18
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,620
Thank you, Dr. Qiao.

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,740
It's thanks to you

20
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,930
that I'm still alive.

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,050
You're welcome.

22
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:07,900
Right.

23
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,170
Don't forget to thank Dr. Wei.

24
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,060
Sure.

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,060
She is the reason you're able to have the surgery.

26
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,890
She took such meticulous care, without her,

27
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,130
even a miracle wouldn't have saved you.

28
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,730
Sure.

29
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,780
Doctor,

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,100
you're so skilled.

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,980
It doesn't hurt much.

32
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,690
Do you think I should go for a comprehensive nose procedure?

33
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,940
The effects of the injections don't seem to last.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,380
You can do some slight adjustments.

35
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,780
Here.

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,450
I inject a bit into your nose tip,

37
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,410
and you can see how it looks.

38
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,980
Once it's fully absorbed in about a month,

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,940
you can come back to see me.

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,450
May you book it for me now?

41
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,610
I'm worried it might be hard to get an appointment during the holidays.

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,730
No need.

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,340
Add me on WeChat later,

44
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,340
and just come and find me directly.

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,500
Here is the drinking.

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,220
Who are you messaging?

47
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,690
Don't ask anything you shouldn't.

48
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,690
I'm afraid you'll be sad.

49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,820
Okay, leave you some space.

50
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,690
Who bought the fruit basket?

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,730
Can I eat it?

52
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,100
Ding Zhike.

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,100
You can eat.

54
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:17,940
By the way,

55
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,570
director asks me to organize the client files these days,

56
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,610
including those of the left doctors.

57
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,730
I'm just wondering,

58
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,060
hasn't Qing been fired?

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,060
How come the surgery loan doesn't finish yet?

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,940
It feels like something big is going to happen at the hospital soon.

61
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,820
When a hospital's operations start failing, they begin infighting,

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,100
all to shift the blame.

63
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,820
Don't.

64
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,340
Keep it down.

65
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,340
The walls have ears.

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,130
Look at how scared you are now.

67
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,940
Two tigers cannot share one mountain.

68
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,130
It's not a secret in Gemu.

69
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,940
The loan plastic surgery was a trigger.

70
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,100
You're making me nervous now.

71
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,290
Not sure if I've got clients

72
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,260
like that.

73
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,100
There's definitely some,

74
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,660
you just haven't noticed them.

75
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,690
When I was with Mr. Du,

76
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,410
there was one too.

77
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,410
Also one of Qing.

78
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,730
She thought we didn't know.

79
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,500
Why I never heard from you?

80
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,340
What's the name?

81
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,940
She seems to have the same name as one of my high school classmates.

82
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,540
Zhang Jie.

83
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,130
Jie with J.

84
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,290
Zhang Jie.

85
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,660
I heard you're getting married.

86
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,580
Just plan to take advantage of the New Year holiday

87
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,850
to go home and get married.

88
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,170
I just wondering,

89
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,250
you usually go for burgers and pizza,

90
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,170
but today eating salad like me.

91
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,980
It's all about the beautiful wedding dress.

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,100
I really respect you

93
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,170
to keep such a great figure all these years.

94
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,170
So disciplined.

95
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,610
I just ate for one week,

96
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,610
and I can't stand this.

97
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,250
I feel like I'm turning into a rabbit.

98
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,170
I can't believe you're getting married.

99
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,370
I still remember when you first joined Gemu,

100
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,490
that was right after you graduated, right?

101
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,170
Time really flies.

102
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,610
The one you want to ask,

103
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,850
I don't participate.

104
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,810
I'm not here to accuse you.

105
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,020
Actually, I want to ask you something else.

106
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,370
Loan plastic surgery,

107
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,370
Cheng Dabao is not the first customer, right?

108
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,700
Do you know someone else?

109
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,140
I can't find any client files now.

110
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,340
It's impossible to find that.

111
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,850
Been erased?

112
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,780
Ji Jie,

113
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,170
could you do me another favor?

114
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,220
God.

115
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,170
The pharmacy, the operating room records,

116
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,540
and the medical records are all here.

117
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,140
Li Qi is very cautious.

118
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,050
All the useful files have been taken care of.

119
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,340
She probably guessed

120
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,700
that Guo Xuan would come and tell me.

121
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,140
So many files.

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,980
You want to cross-check them

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,290
and find out the potential clients?

124
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,340
This is a good idea,

125
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,850
but it's definitely a tough and tiring job.

126
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,900
Also,

127
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,170
why is he here?

128
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,020
He comes to help.

129
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,340
And he is one of yours, right?

130
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,050
Think carefully.

131
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,660
Doing this tiring job

132
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,900
is not paid by this cheapskate boss.

133
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,900
The only benefit is that

134
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,340
we don't lose our conscience.

135
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,810
My heart and conscience are all yours.

136
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,020
Stop that.

137
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,340
Gross.

138
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,340
Start working now.

139
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,340
Okay, let's do it.

140
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,020
Two things.

141
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,900
Recently, there's been a lot of gossip at the hospital,

142
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,410
making people uneasy.

143
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,290
I'll give you a clear answer today,

144
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,490
Gemu will soon have no consultants left.

145
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,610
Why?

146
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,020
Have we done anything wrong?

147
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,410
What does that mean?

148
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,780
Where are we going?

149
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,730
You guys can't sit still, can you?

150
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,340
Never learn.

151
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,980
Everyone is being upgraded to a client manager.

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,290
Client manager?

153
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,490
30% increase in per-order split,

154
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,020
and 50-50 split with doctors.

155
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,900
Mr. Tang agreed.

156
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,660
I know

157
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,610
Jiao Ai is poaching you all.

158
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,460
To be honest, poaching me, too.

159
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,810
The offer is indeed tempting.

160
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,220
Gemu doesn't value the consultants,

161
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,370
and you all feel frustrated.

162
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,540
I know that.

163
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,140
But let me reassure you today,

164
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,290
what happened in the past is the past,

165
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,610
and things will be different from today.

166
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,460
Think it carefully.

167
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,660
Once the investigation starts,

168
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,980
we'll be completely at odds with Li Qi

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,930
and the others.

170
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,700
The consequences will be serious.

171
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,610
You afraid?

172
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,100
Quit now is not late for you.

173
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,250
What am I afraid of?

174
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,660
I can go anywhere if leave Gemu.

175
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,290
But you? Where do you think you'd fit in?

176
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,540
You've been an attending surgeon for a few years now.

177
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,810
With your experience and skills,

178
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,370
you could easily qualify for associate senior doctor

179
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,810
and be able to do more surgeries.

180
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,700
Drifting around like this,

181
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,100
don’t you think it's a bit of a waste of your talent?

182
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,100
The push never stops, huh?

183
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,610
Don't brush me off with that.

184
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,490
If you were really as laid-back as you say,

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,610
your ear surgery

186
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,170
can't be that perfect.

187
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,930
Honestly, I'm curious,

188
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,490
what's really on your mind?

189
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,700
You all have been

190
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,340
working with me for a long time.

191
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,930
Today, I just want to

192
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,020
speak from the heart.

193
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,610
I've never seen consulting

194
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,780
as just a job to make a living.

195
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,940
Consulting is an incredible job.

196
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,130
If we think of a hospital as a human body,

197
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,220
and doctors might be the hands and feet.

198
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,060
But us?

199
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,820
We're the brain,

200
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,980
the central nervous system.

201
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,100
Without brain, humans can't live.

202
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,530
No matter how skilled the hands and feet are,

203
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,100
can they do anything without brain?

204
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,820
Honestly, I worry for you sometimes.

205
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,300
You're in the medical aesthetics industry,

206
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,980
such a booming field,

207
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,010
already ahead of so many of your peers.

208
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,850
That's even more reason to think about your future.

209
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,060
You should be asking yourself:

210
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,420
how can I secure my place

211
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,850
in this industry?

212
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,460
how can I become

213
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,420
a true leader in the beauty economy?

214
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,730
Life,

215
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,060
its only true tragedy is death.

216
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,420
And the only one desire?

217
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,530
To slow down aging,

218
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,130
to resist the death.

219
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,650
I died once when I was 13.

220
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,650
There's a story?

221
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,060
Have you ever heard of rip current?

222
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,940
Heard thousands of times on the news.

223
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,130
I was surfing at the time,

224
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,010
and I got caught in a typhoon wave.

225
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,940
My leash snapped by the wave,

226
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,010
and I was just tossed around in the sea,

227
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,730
over and over.

228
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,580
It felt like being in a washing machine roller.

229
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,300
You know that feeling?

230
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,010
My nose and ears

231
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,460
were just getting flooded with water.

232
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,580
I kept thinking about

233
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,340
how to swim back to shore,

234
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,820
but the harder I swam, the farther I got.

235
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,700
The rip current just kept pulling me further out to sea.

236
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,060
I could feel many huge fish

237
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,490
swimming past me few inches away.

238
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,650
Terrifying.

239
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,490
When I woke up,

240
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,650
it was already the next day.

241
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,610
But that feeling of being in the sea

242
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,730
stayed with me for months.

243
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,820
When I was a child, my parents kept telling me:

244
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,980
study hard now,

245
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,610
and you'll have all the things you want in the future.

246
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,580
Back then,

247
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,980
if I had really died in the sea,

248
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,180
I would have lost everything.

249
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,130
My life would have come to an end.

250
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,700
But what I want now is

251
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,300
countless amazing moments.

252
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,420
I'm not like you.

253
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,100
You've got this sense of mission about your work.

254
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,730
I don't.

255
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,010
I just want to put my passion

256
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,130
and energy

257
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,980
into the things I actually love.

258
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,610
I used to think it was really shameful

259
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,770
when people your age kept talking about laid-back.

260
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,420
But after hearing what you just said,

261
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,460
realize I was the one with the narrow mindset.

262
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,730
I won't push you anymore.

263
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,370
Just go ahead and laid-back.

264
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,300
I used to think that people like you,

265
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,940
the workaholics who give up life

266
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,610
just to compete

267
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,100
were really laughable.

268
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,610
It seemed like you couldn't find meaning in life,

269
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,250
so you used work to boost your sense of existence.

270
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,460
But now?

271
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,180
I think you are adorable

272
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,850
sometimes.

273
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,340
Don't you think today

274
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,060
we kinda understand each other a bit too well?

275
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,010
I can't get used to it.

276
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,980
Is that?

277
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,220
Don't we always like this?

278
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,980
Someone outside.

279
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,940
Where?

280
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,580
It's in your mind.

281
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,370
Everyone here,

282
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,100
I'm sure many of you will surpass me

283
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,250
in the future.

284
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,730
I have full confidence in you.

285
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,700
But there's one condition,

286
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,250
you've got to be smart enough

287
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,250
to know what to do

288
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,130
and what not to do.

289
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,010
That's the second thing I'm gonna say today.

290
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,010
I know some of you

291
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,580
are close to the doctors in the private,

292
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,850
but personal life is just personal life.

293
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,490
You've got to keep it separate from work.

294
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,220
I won't say much more,

295
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,820
just ask you one last thing.

296
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,220
You help the doctors out,

297
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,370
what do you think she can give you?

298
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,370
The one I told you last time is great!

299
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:21,940
Really?

300
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,850
Come with me next time.

301
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,650
Sure.

302
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:24,980
I told you,

303
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,700
the color you made last time is great.

304
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,420
Let's go.

305
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,370
Let's go.

306
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,730
Ji Jie, come on.

307
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,850
You go first,

308
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,250
I have to buy something.

309
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,370
If you want it, just buy it.

310
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,610
Don't make yourself feel bad.

311
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,100
No, thanks.

312
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,300
If you're in a hurry, I can pay for it.

313
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,420
You can head back first.

314
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,060
No need.

315
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,610
I've got a client coming over soon.

316
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,250
The last time I asked you for a favor,

317
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,300
about Zhang Jie...

318
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,700
Sorry, Ms. Zhou.

319
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,490
I can't help you.

320
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,100
I was one of the first batch of consultants at Gemu.

321
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,340
When I first came here, I knew nothing,

322
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,650
and stumbled when talking to clients.

323
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,250
It was Ms. Li taught me everything.

324
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,460
What's up?

325
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,370
I value this job.

326
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,100
Hope you can understand me.

327
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,460
Zhang Mijie, Huang Ning.

328
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,650
They are my clients.

329
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,060
I will go contact them.

330
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,100
She is coming for shot today,

331
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,770
I can just ask her.

332
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,100
The others

333
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,100
can only be contacted by Wang Qian for now.

334
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,010
Zhang Jie

335
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,370
must have taken out a loan for it.

336
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,340
Wei Xiaoxi seems to know something.

337
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,610
You go ask her.

338
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,370
Tell me if something new.

339
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,980
It's a combination of collagen and reshaping,

340
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,100
so it can both define our contours

341
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,820
and fill in any sunken areas.

342
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,010
Plus, it doesn't involve any incisions,

343
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,300
and there's no recovery period.

344
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,980
Understood.

345
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,250
The Christmas tree will be arranged.

346
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,610
Why didn't you tell me Ms. Wang was coming?

347
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,490
Xia said she wanted to talk to Mr. Dong.

348
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,420
I always use the green one.

349
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,250
-The green one -The green one is good for oil control.

350
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:43,610
I break my record.

351
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,300
Wei Xiaoxi.

352
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,850
Come to my office.

353
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,610
Ms. Qiao called you.

354
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,420
What happened?

355
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,340
Let's leave.

356
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,610
What's going on?

357
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,490
Nothing.

358
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,820
If you want to talk, talk here.

359
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,100
Zhang Jie, what's happening to her?

360
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,010
I don't know Zhang Jie.

361
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,700
You fight with Chen Mingjie,

362
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,850
or have a problem with me?

363
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,490
Tell me about it.

364
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,980
Alright, I will tell you.

365
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,130
Ms. Qiao,

366
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,580
you're a talent,

367
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,370
so you can be a good doctor

368
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,180
without trying so hard.

369
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,250
I admire you too,

370
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,250
but you've never seen me.

371
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,490
Yes, you're talent.

372
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,100
But you know what?

373
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,060
The more talent you have,

374
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,650
the harder for those who work with you.

375
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,010
I'm really tired.

376
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,250
I don't want to be your student.

377
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,890
I have talent,

378
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,340
but that doesn't mean I can just slack off.

379
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,940
The reason I work hard

380
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,650
is because I'm truly passionate about it.

381
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,060
Wei Xiaoxi,

382
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,890
you're a talent doctor.

383
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,650
But you overthink it.

384
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,420
These thoughts

385
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,340
are also burden for you to improve

386
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,730
to be a great doctor.

387
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,060
There are plenty of doctors in this industry who make money,

388
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,980
but only a rare few can perform surgeries well.

389
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,370
The kind of doctor you want to be

390
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,460
is up to you,

391
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,010
not me.

392
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,100
Great.

393
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,250
I come to help.

394
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,100
No need, Ms. Zhou.

395
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,530
We do all the dirty and tough work,

396
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,530
you don't need to get involved.

397
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,940
It's okay, I do it with you.

398
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,850
Ms. Li.,

399
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,130
did the Ms. Wang come?

400
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,370
I just someone really like her.

401
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,250
But she didn't make appointment today.

402
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,250
You don't know?

403
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,140
She called Xia directly

404
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,140
asking for another doctor.

405
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,900
Xia asked me what to do.

406
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,090
I said we can do nothing.

407
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,660
She is VIP

408
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,810
and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year here.

409
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,180
The only thing we can do

410
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,490
is doing what she asks.

411
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,980
I was going to ask you.

412
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,530
Did you offend her?

413
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,490
Probably not.

414
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,770
She just sent me a Christmas present few days ago.

415
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,250
It's okay.

416
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,290
I will give her a call

417
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,570
and ask if there's been a misunderstanding.

418
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,330
You've been busy, haven't you?

419
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,050
You can't be that smart

420
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,380
but not understand this, right?

421
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,490
It's embarrassing for both of you if you call.

422
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,700
I also told Xia,

423
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,900
Ms. Wan is rich enough

424
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,220
to be able to go any hospital

425
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,700
or contact any doctor.

426
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,050
She called you

427
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,570
meaning she trusted you.

428
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,770
The ability to gain the trust of clients

429
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,140
is most valuable thing for Gemu.

430
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,180
Right.

431
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,050
That's why I need to ask it clearly.

432
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:56,810
Ms. Li,

433
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,700
we share the same thought,

434
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,490
which is client first.

435
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,530
So we can only provide the best service

436
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,250
when understand their needs.

437
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,570
It's okay if you're busy.

438
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,140
I can deal with it by myself.

439
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,700
I was just about to say that.

440
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,420
You and Qiao Yang have been investigating client files lately

441
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,220
and called everyone.

442
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,900
I've already received several complaints

443
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,530
said Gemu was harassing her.

444
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,050
Complaints?

445
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,180
From who?

446
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,380
I have to investigate that.

447
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,460
That's not important.

448
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,140
I don't worry about you.

449
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,730
You don't

450
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,490
lose your temper when you talk to clients.

451
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,460
But the temper of Qiao Yang,

452
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,860
I know better than me.

453
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,980
You'd better talk to her

454
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,180
that all of us should be settled.

455
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,010
Don't piss off the client

456
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,530
and end up letting us consultants take care the troubles.

457
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,460
Perfect.

458
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,660
Ji.

459
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,860
Mr. Du,

460
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,530
It's been a while.

461
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,860
It's been a while, Ji.

462
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,770
How's everything going?

463
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,700
Great.

464
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:12,940
Where's your kid?

465
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,290
Playing leaves with his mother.

466
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,380
I come in first to book a seat.

467
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,140
Sure.

468
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,860
Let me introduce.

469
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,250
Ji Xuefeng,

470
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,250
the backbone of the plastic surgery of Third Hospital,

471
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,380
a rising leader among the youth.

472
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,460
I can afford that, Mr. Du.

473
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,490
You're kidding.

474
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,380
He missed one,

475
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,290
the future director of Third Hospital.

476
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,770
Yes, yes, yes.

477
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,050
It's even more exaggerating.

478
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,050
Not at all.

479
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,770
I don't need you

480
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,050
to introduce such experts to me.

481
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,180
Gemu has been trying to invite him for many years,

482
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,250
but have no chance.

483
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,940
We have a lot of mutual friends.

484
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,980
Your are?

485
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,770
Li Qi, from Gemu.

486
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,530
I've heard so much about you.

487
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,250
Nice to meet you, Ms. Li.

488
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,860
You've got it! Du.

489
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,220
You're going to scoop up all the top talent

490
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,180
from the country, huh?

491
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,770
You're trying to poach the backbone of Third Hospital.

492
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,460
No, no, no.

493
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,940
I don't think I can catch Mr. Du's eye.

494
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,380
Join us, Mr. Ji?

495
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,180
No, no, no.

496
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,250
We got a bunch of families.

497
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,380
You two keep talking, Mr. Du.

498
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,380
I'll go ahead.

499
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,420
I talk with you another day.

500
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,090
No problem.

501
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,180
I saw you at the industry gathering that day.

502
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,810
Why did you leave early?

503
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,810
I just went to check it out,

504
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,570
see how rich Jiao Ai is.

505
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,770
I thought I was prepared,

506
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,290
but still shocked.

507
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,290
Is the headquarters in Dubai now?

508
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,810
What's the point of having money?

509
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,980
We're short on people.

510
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,900
There are still

511
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,290
plenty of empty spots in the office.

512
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,140
In the aesthetics industry,

513
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,570
is it a tough job to fill up the office?

514
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,940
Finding people is easy,

515
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,810
but finding experts is hard.

516
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,180
Got any ideas?

517
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,290
You're getting a bit full of yourself over at Jiao Ai, huh.

518
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,570
Trying to recruit me?

519
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,220
Do you think that's possible?

520
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,570
I think there's still a chance.

521
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,730
I'm not the type to fight a battle I'm not sure I can win.

522
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,010
Bite down hard.

523
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,730
I want to have jawbone surgery.

524
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,810
I feel like my jawline is too wide

525
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,220
and looks too harsh.

526
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,530
I want to make it a bit softer.

527
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,660
I suggest you try Botox first.

528
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,420
The main issue right now is your masseter muscles being too big.

529
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,220
Do you think just Botox will work?

530
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,050
I want to get it done all at once,

531
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,380
don't want to go through pain again.

532
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,010
It will work.

533
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,290
If you go for jawbone surgery,

534
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,900
the risks are higher

535
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,420
and the costs are more.

536
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,460
You can try Botox first,

537
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,660
and if you're still not satisfied with the result,

538
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,180
then we can think about jawbone surgery, alright?

539
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,250
Okay.

540
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,380
You're the doctor, I listen to you.

541
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,050
Good.

542
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,570
Have you had any allergies

543
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,010
or any past medical history?

544
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,140
No allergies.

545
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,730
I had a rhinoplasty surgery

546
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,570
done here before.

547
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,770
Which doctor did it?

548
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,530
Your former director,

549
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,140
Du Jun.

550
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,770
Oh, Mr. Du.

551
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,980
No record.

552
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,050
Which year?

553
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,980
It was when your hospital first opened.

554
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,570
Dr. Lu,

555
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,050
do you still have that project?

556
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,250
Which project?

557
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,900
Loan project.

558
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,700
Loan project?

559
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,860
You know

560
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,860
why I left GeMu back then?

561
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,460
I always felt like there was something wrong with Gemu's structure.

562
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,140
A family-run business

563
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,810
with a strange

564
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,220
and unrealistic vision.

565
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,490
They have no real ambition to grow or expand.

566
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,290
In this industry, that's not going to take far.

567
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,460
I've always felt like

568
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,380
you and I share the same view on this.

569
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,570
No, no, no.

570
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,140
We're still different.

571
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,700
I believe that

572
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,530
if a flight route faces issues,

573
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,050
we should try to turn it around,

574
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,050
not just abandon ship.

575
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,730
Before I left Gemu, I talked to you.

576
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,290
I even tried to convince you to come with me.

577
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,420
But you failed that.

578
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,050
But you don't tell anyone

579
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,980
that I talk to you.

580
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,090
I think you just want to leave a chance

581
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,180
for yourself.

582
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,620
You're really jumping to conclusions.

583
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,770
I just don't want any

584
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,420
unnecessary misunderstandings.

585
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,420
Besides, if I were really keeping my options open,

586
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,250
do you think Jiao Ai is the only choice out there?

587
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,420
Of course.

588
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,180
Your talent in this industry

589
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,380
is undeniable.

590
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,860
Wherever you go, you're a legend.

591
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,900
If I could've taken

592
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,810
just one person from Gemu back then,

593
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,900
it wouldn't have been Dr. Yuan or any of the doctors.

594
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,220
It would've been you.

595
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,530
Only you.

596
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,010
Do you think I would buy that?

597
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,570
You make it sound like

598
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,220
we got along so well at Gemu.

599
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,490
We kept fighting back then,

600
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,220
all because of Zhou Jingwen.

601
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,380
You were at odds with her every day,

602
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,050
but when it really mattered,

603
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,530
you'd still stand up for her

604
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,330
for no apparent reason.

605
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,810
I never figured out

606
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,490
what was going on between you two.

607
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,140
Your logic never be the same.

608
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,290
Is that?

609
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,900
Whatever happened

610
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,220
between you two,

611
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,380
only you guys know.

612
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,180
Your relationship is weird.

613
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,530
Now that I'm gone,

614
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,770
then Qiao Yang showed up.

615
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,730
I seriously doubt things have been

616
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,380
going well for you at Gemu recently.

617
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,810
Yeah, we had a bit of a rocky start,

618
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,700
but now it's all going well.

619
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,620
Really?

620
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,980
Then I'm relieved.

621
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,250
Gemu's been doing really well lately.

622
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,050
Qiao Yang and Zhou Jingwen

623
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,050
done some great surgeries together.

624
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,380
But those are more about reputation than making money.

625
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,770
Still, your numbers didn't drop.

626
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,420
That's really impressive.

627
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,250
In my book, you deserve the most credit for that.

628
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,900
Who can know that?

629
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,860
I can.

630
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,090
Come to Jiao Ai.

631
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,770
With our personalities,

632
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,380
we can never be friends,

633
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,460
but we can definitely be comrades.

634
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,940
We're both the type who can

635
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,860
separate work from feelings.

636
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,980
Just imagine the impact we'd have

637
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,900
if we teamed up.

638
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,290
Du.

639
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,660
If you think digging up

640
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,420
some half-baked gossip

641
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,940
from your sources at Gemu

642
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,050
is enough to convince me

643
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,420
to be your subordinate,

644
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,660
then you really don't know me at all.

645
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,290
I don't even care about you.

646
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,380
Bye.

647
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,180
Then who do you care about?

648
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,810
Tang, right?

649
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,900
I might not know you,

650
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,810
but do you really know Tang?

651
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,660
When we're looking for women,

652
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,860
try to find ones who want something from you.

653
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,490
She could love bags,

654
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,660
love jewelry, or money.

655
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,980
That's easy to deal with.

656
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,810
But don't,

657
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,810
don't be like me

658
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,730
and end up with someone like Li Qi.

659
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,860
With such a woman,

660
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,290
who doesn't want anything from you,

661
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,140
doesn't care about money,

662
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,980
and is all about her career.

663
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,090
Who cares about her career?

664
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,050
Women's career

665
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,700
still need us men to live, right?

666
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,290
Tian Feng sent me

667
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,620
her payment records from back then,

668
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,250
and the chat history with Qing.

669
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,570
As long as compare them,

670
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,250
we should be able to figure everything out.

671
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,180
Solid.

672
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,900
I sent a copy to Ms. Zhou, too.

673
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,330
Du Jun is having dinner with Li Qi.

674
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,140
Interesting.

675
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,140
Isn't it?

676
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,900
I need to answer this.

677
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,530
Mr. Tang.

678
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,330
Sorry, coming right now.

679
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,010
What's wrong?

680
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,570
Mr. Tang booked a small surgery with me.

681
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,860
I should go now.

682
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,700
Lu,

683
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,290
it's just a boil,

684
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,330
you don't need to make such a big deal out of it.

685
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,180
What good stuff have you been eating,

686
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,530
and end up with such a big boil?

687
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,010
Nothing,

688
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,940
just been drinking a bit too many ginseng tablets lately.

689
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,730
Then tablets lead you to here.

690
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,380
Such a small thing,

691
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,700
does it really need to take up our operating resources?

692
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,330
Such a small thing,

693
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,250
does it really need you to handle it personally?

694
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,220
Who are you?

695
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,090
I have to personally administer the anesthesia,

696
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,180
so I can feel at ease.

697
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,380
And report my work to you.

698
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,860
You should go out.

699
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,900
I knew it.

700
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,290
You're going to tell me about the loan again, right?

701
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,140
I heard that

702
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,730
your schedule is full all day.

703
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,290
Yes.

704
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,380
Where do you get the time?

705
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,290
Why are you still

706
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,420
focusing on this all day long?

707
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,530
I got new progress.

708
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,420
I've got a witness. At Gemu right now.

709
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,420
Where did you find that witness?

710
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,380
You're a plastic surgeon,

711
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,010
not a forensic scientist, right?

712
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,660
Why are you all day long...

713
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,730
Don't you give me anesthetic?

714
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,980
Lu, you are so quick.

715
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,770
Or I can do it for you one more time?

716
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,660
No need.

717
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,530
It's okay.

718
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,730
Both of us are doctors of Gemu.

719
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,380
We are all skilled, relax.

720
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,460
I told you, Qiao Yang.

721
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,220
I'm not protecting Li

722
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,660
because she's dating with me.

723
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,090
You see, yes,

724
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,900
you doctors are working hard.

725
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,620
But she is also working hard

726
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,940
for better Gemu, right?

727
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,570
Both of you are for Gemu,

728
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,090
why can't you understand each other?

729
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,490
If you are free,

730
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,090
you should spend it more on the business, right?

731
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,090
If you keep investigating like this,

732
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,730
and mess up someday,

733
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,810
doesn’t it still end up with Ms. Li cleaning up after you?

734
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,090
Mr. Tang,

735
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,420
that depends on how you define

736
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,530
what is better for Gemu.

737
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,530
Do you feel anything?

738
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,180
That's it?

739
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,250
What are you being so sarcastic for?

740
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,490
What exactly are you trying to say?

741
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,570
Do you know Li Qi

742
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,380
is having afternoon tea with Du Jun right now?

743
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,090
Who?

744
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,570
Meeting now?

745
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,620
Got it.

746
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,380
Ms. Li.

747
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,250
Yes.

748
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,730
And it's an all-staff meeting

749
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,620
hosted by Tang.

750
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,660
When you arrive?

751
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,860
I'm stuck in traffic.

752
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,460
Can't be there for a while.

753
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,090
Why is this so sudden?

754
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:18,900
Ms. Li.

755
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,220
Mr. Tang.

756
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,530
See, I told you.

757
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,770
Put on some ointment, but no.

758
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,050
You just had to do that surgery.

759
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,140
Where have you been?

760
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,290
I said it before.

761
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,730
Fan from Zhenjiang, who is in charge of supplies, is here.

762
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,700
I turned him down a few times, but have to meet him eventually.

763
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,380
Don't keep looking at your phone.

764
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,940
My daughter's homework.

765
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,090
Mr. Tang,

766
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,860
what's wrong? Are you okay?

767
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:52,860
Sit.

768
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,460
Sit.

769
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,290
Qin,

770
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,460
I've got work to do later,

771
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,460
won't wait for you here.

772
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,420
We're starting now.

773
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,490
Alright, I'll go first.

774
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,290
The whole loan plastic surgery is mainly my fault.

775
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,730
When Ms. Qiao's video came out,

776
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,420
my first thought was to quickly

777
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,490
minimize the negative impact on Gemu.

778
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,900
I didn't take the time to give everyone a detailed explanation,

779
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,380
causing a lot of confusion and misunderstanding.

780
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,700
So, now that we have this chance today,

781
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,050
let's make it clear.

782
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,380
If there's anything you want to say

783
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,530
or ask,

784
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,010
feel free to speak up.

785
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,770
Usually at the hospital,

786
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,250
everyone's talking like crazy.

787
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,490
Now that I've said speaking freely,

788
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,730
no word, huh?

789
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,860
Zhou Jingwen, our director,

790
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,460
don't you investigate?

791
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,620
How about you go first.

792
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,730
Okay.

793
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,730
I just heard about someone called Zhang Jie,

794
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,250
who was regular customer of Du Jun.

795
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,330
The cost of her previous plastic surgery

796
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,050
was a loan recommended by Zhang Qing.

797
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,700
I can't find her medical record

798
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,530
in the files compiled by our hospital.

799
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,330
Can't find?

800
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,530
Ji Jie,

801
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,490
clients of Zhang Qing are all yours now.

802
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,420
What's going on?

803
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,980
Anyone

804
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,420
remember this client?

805
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,090
Ms. Zhou,

806
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,380
how do you know about this client?

807
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,900
Is it possible you're remembering it wrong?

808
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,460
Dr. Wei,

809
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,530
you know that?

810
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,090
Yes,

811
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,490
she was one of Mr. Du's clients,

812
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,380
and Zhang Qing received her.

813
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,180
But everything else was so long ago,

814
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,290
I really don't remember.

815
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,460
This is getting a bit out there.

816
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,090
Even if I wanted to explain, I wouldn't know where to start.

817
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,620
I'll say a few words.

818
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,810
During my time at Gemu,

819
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,900
the person I respect the most is Ms. Li.

820
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,900
Her ability to lead the team is truly unbeatable.

821
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,980
Just look at our consultants,

822
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,980
everyone of them is an elite,

823
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,010
and they're all on the same page as Ms. Li.

824
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,220
No matter who in the team

825
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,420
is off track,

826
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,940
they were quickly spotted.

827
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,570
Take Zhang Qing for example, she messed up,

828
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,420
and before we even had time to react,

829
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,010
she was already fired.

830
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,140
Now, if we want to ask more,

831
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,250
there's no chance.

832
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,090
Ms. Li really is someone who acts decisively.

833
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,330
Ms. Qiao,

834
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,900
sounds like there's more to that.

835
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,380
No, I mean it.

836
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,980
Sorry to interrupt,

837
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,330
let me introduce,

838
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,860
one of our regular clients,

839
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,010
Ms. Tian, Tian Feng.

840
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,460
Hello, everyone.

841
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,380
Just in time.

842
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,220
Ms. Tian was regular customer of Du Jun.

843
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,140
What a coincidence,

844
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,050
she was also received by Zhang Qing,

845
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,660
Just like Zhang Jie,

846
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,530
we also can't find her medical records

847
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,980
in the hospital system.

848
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,090
We can't wait,

849
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,090
make us another appointment.

850
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,290
How much longer?

851
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,900
I've been waiting for almost two hours already.

852
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,700
Sorry,

853
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,140
take a seat, please.

854
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,620
I took the day off to come here.

855
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,490
You know it's hard to get time off, right?

856
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,900
We have an emergency meeting today.

857
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,740
Sorry for waiting.

858
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,490
Here's a little snack.

859
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,650
You can take some.

860
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,650
What liposuction?

861
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,650
Haven't even seen the doctor yet.

862
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,460
This is crazy!

863
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,420
This is the chat history of Tian Feng

864
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,860
with Zhang Qing.

865
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,820
And here are the payment records.

866
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,420
All information is correct.

867
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,300
Zhang Jie, Tian Feng, and Cheng Dabao

868
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,940
were all received by Zhang Qing.

869
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,380
Zhang Qing lied, saying that

870
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,170
this loan was a special project in collaboration with Gemu.

871
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,050
Ms. Li,

872
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,650
what do you think?

873
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,860
That's really messed up.

874
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,740
For something like this to happen

875
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,260
right under my nose, at Gemu,

876
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,690
I really need to take a step back and think.

877
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,690
I wasn't paying enough attention.

878
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,980
Ms. Tian,

879
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,050
I just wanna ask one question.

880
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,980
Besides Zhang Qing and Mr. Du,

881
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,340
me,

882
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,340
and the consultants behind you,

883
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,490
do you know anyone else?

884
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,610
No one.

885
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,090
Zhang Qing did

886
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,090
all the paperwork for me.

887
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,780
That's strange.

888
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,010
Zhang Qing, just a little consultant,

889
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,530
how dare she.

890
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,780
I just really wonder that

891
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,740
who supports her to do that?

892
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,130
Ms. Qiao,

893
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,900
I don't know if you've noticed

894
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,530
that these two patients

895
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,130
are all clients of former director, Du Jun.

896
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,460
That's a problem.

897
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,690
Zhang Qing and Du Jun,

898
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,570
both of them left Gemu.

899
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,490
This is pretty much a case of no evidence, right?

900
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,570
Have you noticed

901
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,050
that Ms. Qiao is just like you?

902
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,530
Speaks in such a harsh way,

903
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,780
but pretty thrilling to listen to.

904
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,460
When Du Jun was here, who dared to manage him?

905
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,610
Forget about clients,

906
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,650
even his visiting surgeons were not secrets.

907
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,690
Especially the last few months before he left,

908
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,530
he was flying to Shenzhen almost every other day.

909
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,690
He was just going there to talk about the Jiao Ai project.

910
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,460
My friend in Shenzhen sent me pictures, and I was shocked.

911
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,300
I just thought that

912
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,690
when he gets back, I'll have a word with him.

913
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,610
Who knows that

914
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,210
as soon as he returned, he just quit.

915
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,820
When Du Jun was about to leave,

916
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,820
you were also very shocked.

917
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,650
But the way you're saying it, you must have known all along.

918
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,010
I only realized it when I reviewed everything afterwards.

919
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,090
Hindsight game.

920
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,570
Tang.

921
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,490
-Tang. -Tang.

922
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,490
What's going on?

923
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,690
What happened?

924
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,210
Here.

925
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,210
Full of questions.

926
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,210
Take a good look, is this a question face?

927
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,460
This is a shocked face.

928
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,090
Thanks to me, right?

929
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,380
How do you plan to thank your partner?

930
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,690
Bullfrog.

931
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,170
I had bullfrog last week,

932
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,210
can we have something else?

933
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,610
What, you want to eat me instead?

934
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,010
Tang, Tang.

935
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,570
Tang Jun.

936
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,610
Don't dragging me.

937
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,490
What's up with you?

938
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,090
Can't we just talk about it when we get back?

939
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,940
Why stay out here in the cold?

940
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,900
I have nothing to say to you.

941
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,610
What's going on with you?

942
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,050
Yeah, I met with Du Jun today.

943
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,460
He wanted to poach me, but I didn't agree.

944
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,090
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to overthink it.

945
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,050
What else? Loans for plastic surgery?

946
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,820
That's something Qing and the others did behind my back.

947
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,010
Even if I turn a blind eye to it,

948
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,570
I have leadership responsibility, I didn't manage things properly.

949
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,010
I'm not doing this for myself,

950
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,820
that is for Gemu's performance.

951
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,210
Everyone of you,

952
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,170
all act so high and mighty,

953
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,380
so who's gonna do the dirty work and tough stuff?

954
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,980
Me, I do.

955
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,340
So they did it behind your back, huh?

956
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,460
All these people are yours, Li Qi.

957
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,210
You can fool them up

958
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,050
at meeting with this nonsense.

959
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,940
You know I'd overthink it

960
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,900
if I found out you met with Du Jun, right?

961
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,610
But you still met with him, didn't you?

962
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,050
I only found out today, Li Qi.

963
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,530
You knew Du Jun was leaving long before he actually did.

964
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,610
Now I'm starting to wonder

965
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,090
if his leaving Gemu at that point

966
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,210
had anything to do with you.

967
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,420
Gemu

968
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,820
is just one of many projects of mine.

969
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,610
I just do it

970
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,940
for letting Qin Gui, my friend, to be happy,

971
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,820
letting you to be happy.

972
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,690
If I mess this up,

973
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,940
I can always go back and inherit the family business.

974
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,650
But for you, Gemu is different.

975
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,460
It's where you realize your self-worth.

976
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,690
So please, do me a favor and get this straight.

977
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,050
When I'm laughing and joking in front of you,

978
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,010
it's because I'd like to.

979
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,170
But don't take me as a fool.

980
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,530
Who's really treating who like a fool here?

981
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,900
How are you talking about me behind my back?

982
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,010
What do you really think of me?

983
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,420
But don't be like me

984
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,300
and end up with someone like Li Qi.

985
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,530
Who cares about her career?

986
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,420
Women's career

987
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,130
still need us men to live, right?

988
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,210
This woman, even if she really wants to be Queen Victoria,

989
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,340
she still needs to see if I'm willing.

990
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,210
Where do you get that?

991
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,570
Who did that?

992
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,090
That's correct. Come on, come on.

993
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,570
Remember that,

994
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,170
you can swear an oath, but you can't post it on social media.

995
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,050
When we first dated,

996
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,940
what did I tell you,

997
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,530
do you remember?

998
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,860
Of course I remember.

999
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,460
You said you don't want to rely on anyone.

1000
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,210
You're on your own.

1001
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,340
You want to be an independent woman.

1002
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,010
No just when we are dating,

1003
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,210
you always said that.

1004
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,900
So?

1005
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,420
You've said it so many times to believe it, haven't you?

1006
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,490
Me, Tang Jun, I'm the reason that

1007
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,610
you're where you are at Gemu.

1008
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,210
You are nothing without Gemu.

1009
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,420
Filming a video, that's low.

1010
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,460
No brains,

1011
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,340
believing everything said at the dinner table.

1012
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,010
I said it,

1013
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,490
it's the one that lasts the longest.

1014
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,090
It doesn't make it till tomorrow.

1015
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,340
The fish here are delicate.

1016
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,010
Where I come from, there's a fish called Bamiao,

1017
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,460
it can climb trees and walk.

1018
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,380
It can even survive out of water.

1019
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,570
I came to this city when I was 18,

1020
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,860
at the intersection near Zhongfu Department Store,

1021
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,980
where I used to apply lipstick for people.

1022
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,090
Just the other day, I went to Zhongfu again,

1023
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,650
and one of them is still there,

1024
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,650
now a manager,

1025
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,210
still doing the same thing, applying lipstick.

1026
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,690
Back then, there were 16 of us

1027
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,010
squeezed into one dorm.

1028
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,940
Each of them had big and small bags,

1029
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,130
several pieces of luggage.

1030
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,460
They wouldn't even throw away an old water cup.

1031
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,420
But me,

1032
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,980
I only brought this.

1033
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,940
When I got there, I had only one thought,

1034
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,820
where would I go when I leave?

1035
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,380
But I never expected

1036
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,610
it would end up because of you.

1037
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,420
Will you go to Jiao Ai this time?

1038
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,530
Mr. Qin a good person,

1039
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,690
just too righteous and cares too much about his image.

1040
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,340
You know Tang.

1041
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,130
And about Zhou Jingwen,

1042
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,050
she's just like a broken wheel,

1043
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,210
the more you push, the faster it spins.

1044
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,650
Think about it yourself.

1045
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,380
Have you ever wondered

1046
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,010
how Zhou Jingwen made a comeback

1047
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,490
after dropping out?
