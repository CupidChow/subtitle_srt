1
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,460
Dr. Qiao.

2
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,930
Is Mr. Ji here?

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,930
He's in Consultation Room 9.

4
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:49,900
Come.

5
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,020
Where's Qiao Yang?

6
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,100
Ms. Qiao has a surgery.

7
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,930
She'll be here soon.

8
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,180
We can start talking first.

9
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,050
As per your request,

10
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,740
we've already terminated our contract

11
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,290
with Zhou Jingwen.

12
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,850
We invited you here today

13
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,060
mainly to discuss

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,170
the compensation.

15
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,500
Didn't Qiao Yang tell you?

16
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,380
We agreed on this before.

17
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,940
Miss Xu,

18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,410
we're fully aware

19
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,170
that no matter the amount,

20
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,610
it cannot truly make up for

21
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,450
the harm done to your body.

22
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,260
But we'll do our best to compensate you.

23
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,340
However, regarding the amount...

24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,100
I knew it would be like this.

25
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,340
I already posted about this when I came.

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,010
My followers are all waiting.

27
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,850
Ms. Xu,

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,980
let's keep this discussion private.

29
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,540
Live streaming isn't appropriate, is it?

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,380
Do you want me to put you on the stream too?

31
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,540
Ms. Qiao.

32
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,660
Ms. Xu,

33
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,500
sorry for being late.

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,850
You finally showed up.

35
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,260
All this talk about sincerity...

36
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,730
but when it's time to pay,

37
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,980
everything goes out the window, huh?

38
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,890
Mr. Qin,

39
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,730
it's not about you giving me 30 million

40
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,100
to leave your son.

41
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,500
That's not what this is about.

42
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,730
Now, I've lost my eyesight.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,660
Do you think asking for 30 million is too much?

44
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,690
Stop lying, Ms. Xu.

45
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,690
You're not getting a penny today.

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,410
I watched your livestream the other day.

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,450
You have a lot of followers.

48
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,940
But it's interesting,

49
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,780
your followers asked you plenty of questions,

50
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,690
and you answered them all,

51
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,730
except for one.

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,570
Can you tell me

53
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,820
why you suddenly stopped streaming

54
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,410
from December to January?

55
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,340
Where did you go?

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,220
Didn't my fans already say?

57
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,730
I was in a relationship!

58
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,690
Is that a problem?

59
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,340
Hold on.

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,450
It's shut.

61
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,570
Everyone's gone.

62
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,410
Look, is this person you?

63
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,130
The worst part is, they blocked me on WeChat.

64
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,820
I called them, and no one picked up.

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,340
Because of them, I‘ve completely lost vision in my right eye.

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,290
Here, take a look.

67
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,060
This is the medical report from the hospital.

68
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,060
The diagnosis—

69
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,410
my right eye is completely blind.

70
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,660
How am I supposed to live like this?

71
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,100
How much will it cost to fix this?

72
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,100
What about people like us who just want to look better?

73
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,290
This clinic is absolutely outrageous.

74
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,290
You guys should expose them.

75
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,610
Hurry up and make it public!

76
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,410
So unreliable.

77
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,700
Just the day before, they promised me on WeChat，

78
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,490
agreed to everything,

79
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,540
told me to come in for a follow-up.

80
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,020
And now, look.

81
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,140
It's shut.

82
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,220
Everyone's gone.

83
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,020
This was all over the news in early December.

84
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,780
And coincidentally, that's exactly when you stopped streaming.

85
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,220
If I'm not mistaken,

86
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,410
that's when you had your eye injury

87
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,140
from an injection, right?

88
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,980
Wow, what a story.

89
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,050
The video is so heavily blurred,

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,340
they even altered the voice, and you still want to pin this on me?

91
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,580
Is that so?

92
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,660
If you don't wanna compensate me, just say it.

93
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,140
No need to smear me like this.

94
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,290
Enough talking.

95
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,220
See you in court.

96
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,050
December 20th.

97
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,980
Third Hospital, Ophthalmology Department. Yan Jin,

98
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,410
VIP Clinic, Room 16.

99
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,340
Patient: Xu Yuan.

100
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,140
At that time,

101
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,660
your eye was already close to going blind, wasn't it?

102
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,660
You wanna look for ophthalmology records?

103
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,020
Check from last December

104
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,460
to last month.

105
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,930
Patient name: Xu Yuan, female.

106
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,370
In her twenties, I'd say.

107
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,730
You know this isn't allowed, right?

108
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,340
Just tell me if there's a record of her or not.

109
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,050
Don't tell me you had a botched injection?

110
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,340
Can you at least hope for something good for me?

111
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,490
Unfortunately,

112
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,730
the shady clinic that injected you

113
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,730
has already disappeared.

114
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,460
You spent over a month trying to fight for your rights,

115
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,490
but in the end, you lost hope.

116
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,100
So you decided to find someone else to take the fall

117
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,730
and pay for your eye.

118
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,780
And that "someone" was Zhou Jingwen.

119
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,050
Ms. Xu,

120
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,410
30 million.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,220
For extortion,

122
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,020
that amount is considered extraordinarily high.

123
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,930
If this goes to jail time...

124
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,460
you're looking at at least ten years.

125
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,930
Why does this have to be discussed here?

126
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,140
Feels like some kind of secret agent meeting.

127
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,810
Thanks for looking into Xu Yuan's case.

128
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,660
You're welcome.

129
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,660
I spoke with Mr. Yan.

130
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,250
Xu Yuan's eye can still be treated.

131
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,100
It'll just take a long time,

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,340
around two to three years.

133
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,810
It's up to her whether she wants to go through with it.

134
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,250
Got it.

135
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,250
Personnel management, equipment procurement,

136
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,050
all the major and minor hospital matters are in here.

137
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,250
This is top-secret hospital information.

138
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,900
I'm entrusting my piano to you.

139
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,370
You're the one who handed it over to me.

140
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,170
That means I can play it however I want.

141
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,810
I'm best at playing nonsense.

142
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,340
I've already informed Mr. Wu about your case.

143
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,340
Just take your registration slip and go directly to him.

144
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,340
Why are you helping me?

145
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,730
You knew all along that your eye could be treated,

146
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,900
it would just take time and cost a lot.

147
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,050
For someone like you, a mid-tier influencer stuck in between,

148
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,660
money is an issue.

149
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,580
Trying to extort a sum would be the fastest solution.

150
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,100
Did someone tell you to do this?

151
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,980
Before coming to you, I visited Jiao Ai.

152
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,100
There was someone there

153
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,410
who seemed to know a lot about my situation.

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,460
They strongly suggested I come to you,

155
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,730
telling me that Gemu is a great hospital,

156
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,170
one that values its reputation.

157
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,850
If a medical dispute arises,

158
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,100
they are always the most generous,

159
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,660
willing to pay real money to settle it.At first,

160
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,930
I didn't understand what they meant.

161
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,540
They just smiled at me

162
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,850
and told me to think it over at home.

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,290
Later, when I got home, it suddenly clicked.

164
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,020
I knew what they were trying to do.

165
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,170
I kept thinking about it for days,

166
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,580
found myself an excuse,

167
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,170
I was a victim too,

168
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,370
and I just happened to need money.

169
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,460
So, in a moment of impulse...

170
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,930
My apologies.

171
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,980
The person you're talking about,

172
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,050
was it Ms. Li?

173
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,610
I only started live streaming early last year.

174
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,730
Back then, there weren't many streamers on the platform.

175
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,580
I got a taste of success,

176
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,770
so I quit my job.

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,580
But this year, so many celebrities joined the game,

178
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,370
all live streaming.

179
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,340
For mid-tier streamers like me,

180
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,530
it's been tough.

181
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,250
Who knows

182
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,490
what will happen next year?

183
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,890
I'm not saying this to gain sympathy,

184
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,610
Dr. Zhou,

185
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,770
when my eye had problems,

186
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,100
I panicked completely.

187
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,130
I'm sincerely apologizing to you now.

188
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,610
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,580
If you really feel sorry,

190
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,180
then let's talk business.

191
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,220
Even as a mid-tier streamer,

192
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,980
you still have some fans, don't you?

193
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,890
Mr. Du is our most prestigious guest.

194
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,820
As long as he comes, he'll be the center,

195
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,700
seated right in the middle.

196
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,770
Among private hospitals,

197
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,490
Jiao Ai is undoubtedly a top player.

198
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,100
We have another

199
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,370
important task this time,

200
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,460
to confirm your availability.

201
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,650
My availability?

202
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,060
Besides doctors,

203
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,580
marketing operations, investors,

204
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,530
and upstream manufacturersare

205
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,890
all crucial parts of this industry.

206
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,610
Our goal at this Rongchuan International

207
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,530
Medical Aesthetics Conference

208
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,100
is to present

209
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,250
the full ecosystem of our industry.

210
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,420
You're an expert in marketing operations.

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,980
Of course,

212
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,610
we'd love for you to share some real insights.

213
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,250
I don't have any insights to share.

214
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,010
All I have are painful lessons learned.

215
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,730
Then I'll just talk nonsense up there.

216
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,060
That's great!

217
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,850
In our industry,

218
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,580
the more real you are, the more people resonate with you.

219
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,890
Mind if I add you on WeChat?

220
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,610
Of course.

221
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,980
You said the summit is at the end of next month?

222
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,580
That's right.

223
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,460
Who from Gemu will be attending?

224
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,820
Are you concerned about something?

225
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,100
No, just asking.

226
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,650
Should I scan you, or you scan me?

227
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,460
I'll scan you.

228
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,610
Step back.

229
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,100
What do you mean?

230
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,980
What did you tell us before?

231
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,100
That Jiao Ai and Gemu aren't in the same league?

232
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,490
That developing here would be great.

233
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,490
And what happened?

234
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,340
Doctors have no say in anything.

235
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,980
I was totally deceived by you.

236
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,300
Did you already negotiate a deal with Li Qi?

237
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,980
Are the three of us

238
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,610
just bargaining chips for your promotion and raise?

239
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,180
Her office isn't locked.

240
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,220
You can go talk to her yourself.

241
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,180
I didn't stop you, did I?

242
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,980
Besides, you've got legs.

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,100
If you're unhappy, you can leave.

244
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,220
Easy for you to say.

245
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,100
The contract penalty is so high,

246
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,340
are you gonna pay it for me?

247
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,420
Come on.

248
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,460
You made the decision yourself.

249
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,850
You signed the contract yourself.

250
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,980
The high salary went straight into your pocket.

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,490
And now you want to quit,

252
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,580
but somehow the penalty is my problem?

253
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,530
Jiao Ai's services,

254
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,180
like the "Barbie Eye Package"

255
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,300
and the "Overnight Rejuvenation Package",

256
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,100
aren't even legitimate indications.

257
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,220
It's all just about making money.

258
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,460
They even bundle

259
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,460
unrelated treatments together.

260
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,180
Can't you see that?

261
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,980
What's the point of scolding me?

262
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,340
Just to make yourself seem morally superior?

263
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,730
Fine. You have a conscience, I don't.

264
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,850
I just wanNA make money.

265
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,420
Happy now?

266
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,220
Wei Xiaoxi!

267
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,850
You're a doctor.

268
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,580
And you're willing to throw away your principles for money?

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,340
I have no respect for you.

270
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,820
Dr. Wei,

271
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,460
I've already scheduled my ear repair surgery

272
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,250
at Gemu.

273
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,340
I didn't tell them you were the one who sent me.

274
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,130
Thank you for stopping me that day.

275
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,220
If I had gone ahead with the surgery,

276
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,890
I might have ruined my face completely.

277
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,250
You're a good doctor.

278
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,610
The upgraded European Star RF machine

279
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,730
won't arrive this month.

280
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,220
I sent the update in the group chat.

281
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,100
So basically, it's delayed indefinitely?

282
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,530
That won't work.

283
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,100
I have several VIP clients

284
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,610
who booked their appointments ages ago.

285
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,650
H-

286
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,060
How am I supposed to explain this to them?

287
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,100
We paid the final installment before the New Year,

288
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,940
then we got hit with Xu Yuan's situation after the holiday.

289
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,130
Now the suppliers are worried about our financial stability

290
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,250
and don't wanNA ship to us.

291
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,980
The worst part is,

292
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,100
I reached out to suppliers for consumables and equipment,

293
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,820
and they all said the same thing:

294
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,490
They don't know when they can deliver.

295
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,820
They're hitting us right when we need supplies,

296
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,980
catching us completely off guard.

297
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,010
Someone who knows Gemu's suppliers this well...

298
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,130
There's no need to guess.

299
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,010
The person who leaked the information must be...

300
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,580
that person.

301
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,250
Oh, you're all here.

302
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,340
Didn't we order the mousse sutures

303
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,650
and dressings last month?

304
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,850
Why haven't they arrived yet?

305
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,130
I just checked the inventory.

306
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,250
At our current usage rate,

307
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,770
if we don't get a restock by next week,

308
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,250
our surgeries will have to stop.

309
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,060
We were just discussing that.

310
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,010
Here's the plan.

311
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,130
Let's split up and negotiate with the suppliers.

312
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,180
We need to solve this within a week.

313
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,820
Just because of a little setback like this,

314
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,770
Zhou Jingwen actually left Gemu?

315
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,490
She's been through way bigger storms before.

316
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,300
Take Qin and Tang, for example,

317
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,060
I'd believe anyone leaving Gemu,

318
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,100
except Zhou Jingwen.

319
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,220
I just can't wrap my head around it.

320
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,650
What's there to not understand?

321
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,130
What's Zhou Jingwen's feelings for Gemu?

322
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,100
That's pure love.

323
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,530
Gemu is her life's work,

324
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,530
practically like her own child.

325
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,460
That's exactly why,

326
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,250
a woman in love

327
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,940
is willing to sacrifice anything.

328
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,530
I totally get her.

329
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,850
Too bad you men

330
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,370
will never understand.

331
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,530
Weren't we talking about work?

332
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,340
How did we get onto men?

333
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,490
True.

334
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,700
She's just sacrificing a pawn to save the king,

335
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,180
laying low for a while.

336
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,490
Even the great Michael Jordan

337
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,650
retired and made a comeback twice.

338
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,610
It seems like we have the upper hand now,

339
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,980
but that's just because of financial backing.

340
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,340
If we talk about actual strength,

341
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,460
Jiao Ai is nowhere near Gemu.

342
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,700
I don't see it that way.

343
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,850
That's not an objective assessment.

344
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,460
If it doesn't generate profit,

345
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,010
can you even call it strength?

346
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,340
A price war works in the short term,

347
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,460
but in the long run, quality wins.

348
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,340
What worries me

349
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,130
is their steady reputation.

350
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,770
In the end, it's us who will take the hit.

351
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,820
I always saw you

352
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,700
as a strong, decisive woman.

353
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,460
Why are you suddenly so hesitant and cautious?

354
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,250
Getting timid now?

355
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,770
Me? Timid?

356
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,700
I actually have a bold plan.

357
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,650
Are you in?

358
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,340
Even Dong and Mr. Chu couldn't reach a deal.

359
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,820
The wholesale price for Class III injectable treatments

360
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,370
just went up by 15%.

361
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,060
That Mr. Liu really showed me

362
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,220
what a businessman's greed looks like.

363
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,250
The price hike is outrageous,

364
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,980
and yet he acts like it's totally justified.

365
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,850
You doctors

366
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,650
are usually oblivious to the cost of injectables

367
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,580
and consumables.

368
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,460
The suppliers have always

369
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,940
wanted to raise prices.

370
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,010
But pricing power

371
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,130
is in the hands of a few major manufacturers upstream.

372
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,180
Now, with Jiao Ai backed by capital, launching a price war,

373
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,300
they're willing to pay higher to secure supply.

374
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,700
Of course, suppliers are thrilled to take the deal.

375
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,220
They're driving up costs like crazy.

376
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,100
Once other hospitals can't keep up,

377
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,420
Jiao Ai will effectively achieve a monopoly,

378
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,010
right?

379
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,060
The worst part is,

380
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,770
Li Qi is over at Jiao Ai now.

381
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,130
She knows our operational costs inside and out.

382
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,420
Right now, we're in the open, and they're in the dark.

383
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,460
If they wanna take us down,

384
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,490
it'll be effortless.

385
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,010
Let's check with a couple more suppliers.

386
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,220
If there's no other way,

387
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,490
we'll just have to tough it out at this price.

388
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,700
Thanks for the hard work.

389
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,140
By the way, Ms. Qiao,

390
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,090
there's something I've always been curious about.

391
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,620
Go ahead.

392
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,090
You're someone who's always been

393
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,770
completely focused on surgery.

394
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,900
Before Jingwen left,

395
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,900
why did she entrust the medical operations to you?

396
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,250
And why did you agree?

397
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,220
What's so surprising about that?

398
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,460
If the medical side isn't handled well,

399
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,980
I wouldn't be able to perform surgeries anyway.

400
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,220
So now you're basically doing

401
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,010
everything Jingwen used to do.

402
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,330
Do you understand her a little better now?

403
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,010
Now that you two are apart,

404
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,250
do you understand her even more?

405
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,380
Mr. Qin.

406
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,140
Ms. Qiao.

407
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,220
What's that?

408
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,460
Why so mysterious?

409
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,330
A housewarming gift.

410
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,900
You said you haven't seen the stars in a while,

411
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,810
so I brought you a way to camp indoors.

412
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:14,810
Eh...

413
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,700
I got a star projector.

414
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,940
A star projector?

415
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,010
This looks more like a disco ball.

416
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,980
The address is correct...

417
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,090
Did they send the wrong item?

418
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,330
Just put it back,

419
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,420
I'll return it.

420
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,530
No need, it's fine.

421
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,050
I'm staying home anyway.

422
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,180
Maybe clubbing at home

423
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,660
suits me better than camping.

424
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,530
Clubbing?

425
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,140
That's not very you.

426
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,380
What do you mean "not me"?

427
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,530
If there's one thing I have plenty of now, it's time.

428
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,140
I can finally enjoy life.

429
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,010
Eat more.

430
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,140
I ordered a lot today.

431
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,380
All your favorites.

432
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,620
Even duck tongues.

433
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,460
See,

434
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,660
everything you like, right?

435
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,810
It's been a while since I've seen you this relaxed.

436
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,900
With today's step count,

437
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,570
I must be first on your WeChat rankings, right?

438
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,250
Let me check.

439
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,980
Nope, first place is Qiao Yang.

440
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,730
You're second.

441
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,530
You're only a few dozen steps behind.

442
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,700
Where did you two go?

443
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,010
Still dealing with that supplier mess.

444
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,140
Jiao Ai stirred things up,

445
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,860
and now they all decided to raise prices together.

446
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,530
Being a shareholder is great, you don't even have to

447
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,620
leave the house.

448
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,220
This is the life I dream of.

449
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,380
While we're the ones running around exhausting ourselves, huh?

450
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,010
You shareholders shouldn't have it too easy either.

451
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,330
Come on,

452
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,490
time to pull out your brilliant plan.

453
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,330
Brilliant plan, huh?

454
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,330
Well, Jiao Ai's goal

455
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,900
is to crush us

456
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,770
and dominate the market.

457
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,330
We're not the only ones affected.

458
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,530
If we want to hold out,

459
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,460
we need to unite with other medical aesthetics companies.

460
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,180
Everyone needs to compromise a little

461
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,180
to agree on a middle ground price.

462
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,140
Find one supplier to break through.

463
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,010
Galloway, maybe?

464
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,490
I just attended Mr. Ma's

465
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,770
daughter's wedding last month.

466
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,860
I'll message him later.

467
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,140
Next week's industry summit,

468
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,330
they're the main sponsors.

469
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,290
Why don't you come with me?

470
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,330
We can talk to them in person.

471
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,860
No need for me to go.

472
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,860
You can handle it.

473
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,620
Qiao Yang specifically said she wanted you to come.

474
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,900
I see how it is.

475
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,530
When it comes down to it,

476
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,730
you still trust Qiao Yang

477
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,250
more than you trust me.

478
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,140
Do I?

479
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,900
That video of Xu Yuan,

480
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,700
did you send it only to Qiao Yang and not to me?

481
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,460
Why would I send it to you?

482
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,770
I didn't want to put you in a tough spot.

483
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,810
Do you really think our hospital

484
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,770
would take the initiative to sue a patient?

485
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,380
Well, you're the shareholder.

486
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,090
Whatever you say goes.

487
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,730
As long as you're happy.

488
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,250
Alright then, I'm happy.

489
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,980
Qin,

490
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,330
we discussed the plan

491
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,530
you proposed,

492
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,250
and we all agree it's the best option.

493
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,980
That's great!

494
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,180
I actually have a meeting set up with Galloway today.

495
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,460
I'll talk to them properly

496
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,140
and try to get this settled.

497
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,660
That would be ideal.

498
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,770
But...

499
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,140
But what?

500
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,250
Rumor has it that you and Ge Mu have already...

501
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,810
Are you really bringing up gossip in person?

502
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,460
No.

503
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,530
That we've already gone our separate ways, right?

504
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,420
That's what people are saying.

505
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,220
Though personally, I don't quite believe it.

506
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,530
You're welcome to believe it.

507
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,620
"distance makes the heart grow fonder, but proximity breeds contempt."

508
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,330
People have nothing to talk about when they're together,

509
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,420
but once they split, suddenly they're in perfect sync.

510
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,860
Isn't that right, Mr. Qin?

511
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,620
You all know the procedure, right?

512
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,380
Yeah.

513
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,490
I might not have time to look after you.

514
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,660
Just find a seat.

515
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,250
Alright, no problem.

516
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,220
You're here.

517
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,530
Mingjie, Ms. Qiao.

518
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,250
Hi.

519
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,010
You're early.

520
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,530
Been here for a while.

521
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,330
What are you looking for?

522
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,380
What do you think?

523
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,250
Has Wei Xiaoxi come?

524
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,900
Haven't seen her.

525
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,770
Ms. Qiao,

526
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,250
looking good.

527
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,420
Mr. Ji,

528
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,490
- looking sharp! - Not bad, huh?

529
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,530
Did you lose weight just for today's event?

530
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,180
Regretting it now?

531
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,250
Ziyou!

532
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,620
Feng!

533
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,530
I saw your post yesterday,

534
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,010
where is that koala park?

535
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,490
I wanna take my kid, Xiaoniu, to see it.

536
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,980
Do you know Luhu Park?

537
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,490
The one where you can kayak?

538
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,090
Yeah, I know it.

539
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,330
Next time, you bring Xiaoniu,

540
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,530
I'll bring Dadan, and we'll go together.

541
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,330
Sounds good!

542
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,460
But this weekend,

543
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,220
I'm planning to take Dadan to see

544
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,010
fireflies at night.

545
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,860
Interested?

546
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,490
Yeah, sounds great!

547
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,050
Send me the location.

548
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,940
Alright, I'll send you a link.

549
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,660
Xiaoniu will love it.

550
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,050
Last time I took Dadan,

551
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,010
he caught a huge stag beetle, this big!

552
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,530
Really?

553
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,010
Let me show you,

554
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,330
I took pictures.

555
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,530
Xiaoniu will definitely love it.

556
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,530
What are you guys talking about?

557
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,980
Men's topics.

558
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,250
Fatherhood bonding.

559
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,460
Mr. Ji.

560
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,530
Over here, Mr. Ji!

561
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,140
Alright.

562
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,010
You two chat,

563
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,660
I'll go greet some people.

564
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,730
Sure, let's keep in touch.

565
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,460
Sounds good.

566
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,700
Men's conversations

567
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,250
have gotten this interesting now?

568
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,770
You wouldn't understand.

569
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,250
Touching, isn't it?

570
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,010
If more fathers

571
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,730
were as dedicated as you two,

572
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,290
the birth rate

573
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,700
would definitely skyrocket.

574
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,940
Take notes, Mingjie.

575
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,620
Stop teasing him.

576
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,180
He's looking for Xiaoxi, isn't he?

577
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,220
You closed the deal with Galloway already?

578
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,900
How much did you negotiate?

579
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,220
Six percent?

580
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,380
Gemu still relies on you.

581
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,810
After Mr. Chu speaks, it's your turn.

582
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,660
Your topic is industry malpractice.

583
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,140
I'm curious.

584
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,860
Unlike you, I don't have a professional background.

585
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,420
You can talk about case studies and innovations.

586
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,460
The only thing I can share

587
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,660
is the real-life stories I've witnessed over the past twenty years.

588
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,250
Guess which story I'm gonna tell?

589
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,730
I actually have a bold plan.

590
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,770
Are you in?

591
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,860
The fact that Zhou Jingwen injected polyacrylamide into her patients,

592
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,900
basically, no one knows about it anymore.

593
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,050
She and I have worked together for so many years,

594
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,290
and we've barely ever talked about it.

595
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,090
Because we both know,

596
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,660
for her and for me,

597
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,810
this was the most painful lesson.

598
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,090
But if necessary,

599
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,290
I'm willing

600
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,980
to share this story

601
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,530
at the right moment.

602
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,010
For patients seeking beauty,

603
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,380
the most important thing is the doctor's reputation.

604
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,570
If sharing this

605
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,050
can help Jiao Ai...

606
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,090
Actually,

607
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,010
in this half-face transplant surgery,

608
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,050
we encountered

609
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,980
some difficulties in the operating room.

610
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,700
Things like vascular suturing,

611
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,530
nerve reconnection,

612
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,250
and severe intraoperative bleeding.

613
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,570
Of course,

614
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,090
these are all technical challenges.

615
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,140
Today,

616
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,180
I wanna focus on something else,

617
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,620
the psychological aspect.

618
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,090
How do we support

619
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,460
and guide a patient's mental state?

620
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,420
Mr. Ji,

621
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,810
we were all part of this surgery.

622
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,620
After the operation,

623
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,140
the patient's first request was:

624
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,050
"Please give me a mirror."

625
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,900
Why did they want that mirror?

626
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,180
They wanted to see if the face after surgery

627
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,180
was still their face.

628
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,380
This is a psychological issue,

629
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,980
every individual's

630
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,900
identity recognition.

631
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,900
Our external appearance plays a huge role in that.

632
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,700
Let me give you an example.

633
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,860
One morning,

634
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,250
I got up, brushed my teeth, washed my face,

635
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,660
and looked into the mirror.

636
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,460
Suddenly, I saw that the face in the reflection

637
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,220
was Mr. Ji's face.

638
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,810
Or one day, I wake up and find

639
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,620
that this body I'm in

640
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,250
is not my body.

641
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,770
That would drive anyone insane.

642
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,050
That's why I believe

643
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,730
surgery and psychological counseling

644
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,940
must go hand in hand.

645
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,090
Sometimes, I even think

646
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,660
the counseling should come before the surgery.

647
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,460
A huge thank you to Mr. Chu

648
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,290
for his incredibly insightful and valuable sharing.

649
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,730
It was both fascinating and humorous.

650
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,490
Now, let's take a ten-minute break.

651
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,770
After that, we'll have Ms. Li from Jiao Ai

652
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,250
share her insights with us.

653
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,140
Let's go, take a break.

654
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,090
He's awesome.

655
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,570
I'll grab a cup of coffee. What do you want?

656
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,730
I'll go with you.

657
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,250
Let's go.

658
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,010
Dr. Chen,

659
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,420
can I add you on WeChat?

660
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,180
Sure.

661
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,460
It'll be convenient for learning and communication in the future.

662
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,940
How have you been lately?

663
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,570
Not bad.

664
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,620
I've been a bit worried about you.

665
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,140
Are you adjusting well at Jiao Ai?

666
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,460
Maybe you should worry about Gemu first.

667
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,050
What's wrong with Gemu?

668
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,980
Back when I was at the Third Hospital,

669
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,980
I already told them

670
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,330
that psychological issues

671
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,570
must be taken seriously.

672
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,810
Ji Xuefeng,

673
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,380
I need a favor.

674
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,460
What is it now?

675
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,220
Qiao...

676
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,770
Leave it to me, don't worry.

677
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,140
Alright, I won't keep you.

678
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,290
See you later.

679
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,940
A while ago, a doctor friend of mine

680
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,810
shared a joke with me.

681
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,860
He said a young woman came to his clinic.

682
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,250
She had breast implants and now wanted them removed.

683
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,730
My friend told her...

684
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,940
Isn't Qiao Yang next?

685
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,180
As long as there's no infection

686
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,010
or necrosis,

687
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,050
there's actually no need to remove them.

688
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,620
But the young woman insisted,

689
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,530
"No, doctor, I must have them taken out.

690
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,810
Because they're moving.

691
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,530
Right now, my breasts are on my stomach."

692
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,530
After examining her, my friend said,

693
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,140
"Yes, you do need surgery,

694
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,050
and it's not a minor one.

695
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,980
Because part of your breast tissue

696
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,180
is now on your ribs."

697
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,980
I'm sharing this as a story,

698
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,620
and I see everyone laughing.

699
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,010
But for the patient,

700
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,250
this was actually a very serious medical incident.

701
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,180
Your story

702
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,530
reminded me of something from years ago.

703
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,490
Even though many years have passed,

704
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,660
I've only recently

705
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,570
come to understand the full truth.

706
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,810
I'm sure you all remember

707
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,380
that in 2006,

708
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,460
our industry faced a major event.

709
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,860
Polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAAG)

710
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,220
was banned nationwide by the National Medical Products Administration.

711
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,330
However, due to its low cost,

712
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,290
it continued to circulate in the market despite the ban.

713
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,730
In fact, a large number of counterfeit PAAG injections

714
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,220
were disguised as hyaluronic acid products.

715
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,180
Ms. Qiao,

716
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,220
speaking of counterfeit hyaluronic acid,

717
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,380
I remember it vividly.

718
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,050
Back then, the market was a mix of genuine and fake products.

719
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,140
Many clinics paid a high price

720
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,530
only to be scammed,

721
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,330
purchasing batches of substandard products.

722
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,050
If doctors injected such products into patients,

723
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,250
the consequences would be severe.

724
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,810
You're absolutely right.

725
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,140
I know a doctor who experienced this firsthand.

726
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,380
And coincidentally,

727
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,900
she's here with us today.

728
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,530
If someone really injected PAAG into patients,

729
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,050
how could they still have the nerve to attend a forum?

730
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,810
This is no laughing matter.

731
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,980
What is she getting at?

732
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,250
Who is she talking about?

733
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:55,860
I have no idea.

734
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,180
Ms. Qiao,

735
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,380
you're making me more and more curious.

736
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,860
Everyone in our industry knows,

737
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,570
Ms. Qiao has always been direct

738
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,490
and bold in her speeches.

739
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,530
She tells it like it is.

740
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,940
Every time I host an event with her,

741
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,770
my heart races with anticipation.

742
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,770
Let's keep

743
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,530
this discussion professional.

744
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,140
No need to name specific individuals,

745
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,940
okay, Qiao Yang?

746
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,570
Mr. Ji, don't be nervous.

747
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,700
I wasn't talking about you.

748
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,490
It's a long story.

749
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,050
This person and I were once university classmates,

750
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,570
and best friends.

751
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,570
But because of this issue, we became strangers.

752
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,530
At one point, I even believed

753
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,420
that the resentment between us

754
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,290
would never be resolved in this lifetime.

755
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,290
Yet, fate had other plans. More than a decade later,

756
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,460
we were drawn back into each other's lives.

757
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,460
Over the past year, we've worked together,

758
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,730
performing several high-risk reconstructive surgeries.

759
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,770
We've saved lives side by side.

760
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,180
Funny how fate works,

761
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,570
turning us from enemies

762
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,860
back into allies.

763
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,220
Through this, I've come to understand her better.

764
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,250
And I can say with certainty,

765
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,010
she's a good doctor.

766
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,290
Even though I still don't like her,

767
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,810
I have to admit,

768
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,620
she's a good person.

769
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,730
I've always believed that good people deserve good outcomes.

770
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,220
So, I hope that one day, at the right moment,

771
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,770
she'll finally tell the truth about the past,

772
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,380
let go of the pain

773
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,380
she's carried for years,

774
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,330
and dedicate herself fully to being a great doctor.

775
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,380
Ms. Qiao,

776
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,180
who exactly are you talking about?

777
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,420
It's me.

778
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,980
It was her all along?

779
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,980
Give this to Dr. Zhou.

780
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,180
Don't worry,

781
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,010
I've kept this inside for over ten years.

782
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,140
Now, I finally have the chance to speak up.

783
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,050
Thank you, Ms. Qiao,

784
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,570
for giving me this opportunity

785
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,940
to explain everything to everyone here.

786
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,660
Fifteen years ago, I was a graduate student.

787
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,940
Young and reckless,

788
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,530
I had learned only the basics,

789
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,620
but I secretly performed injections for my classmates at a clinic.

790
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,940
Back then, I couldn't even distinguish

791
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,140
between PAAG

792
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,660
and hyaluronic acid.

793
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,380
I thought the differences

794
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,570
in the syringes

795
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,660
were simply due to different batches.

796
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,770
It wasn't until later that I learned

797
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,220
that counterfeit hyaluronic acid had thicker needles.

798
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,090
Through this incident,

799
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,330
I came to understand,

800
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,050
the clinic owner at the time,

801
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,700
just like me,

802
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,380
was also a victim.

803
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,340
You can't leave!

804
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,490
You have to explain this to me!

805
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,530
Explain it to me!

806
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,780
I gave you the injection, and you used it.

807
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,610
Now you're saying there's a problem?

808
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,740
Why didn't you say it earlier?

809
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,340
Get lost!

810
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,460
What are you doing?

811
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,010
I paid you so much money for the syringes,

812
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,170
and you dared to scam me?

813
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,860
And as for me,

814
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,340
this incident

815
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,980
changed my life forever.

816
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,130
I was expelled from school.

817
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,740
But I had it coming.

818
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,820
I have no complaints.

819
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,650
After all these years,

820
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,340
I can finally

821
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,460
let go of this heavy burden.

822
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,610
Saying it out loud now, I feel relieved.

823
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,940
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

824
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,530
Here,

825
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,300
I wanna say sorry

826
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,130
to all the victims of PAAG.

827
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,650
I truly admire

828
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,940
Ms. Zhou's courage.

829
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,900
Honestly,

830
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,300
if I were a doctor,

831
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,860
I wouldn't have the guts to admit it.

832
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,530
Because once I did,

833
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,460
society would have a hard time forgiving me.

834
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,460
It would be difficult to continue in the medical field.

835
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,980
Not only would my reputation be ruined,

836
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,260
but I'd also bring shame to my hospital.

837
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:35,780
Ms. Zhou,

838
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,210
I actually believe that

839
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,380
a doctor

840
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,090
who has the courage to face their past mistakes

841
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,490
is incredibly valuable.

842
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,530
Doesn't this just prove even more

843
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,010
that she's a good doctor?

844
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,780
Sorry, let me add something.

845
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,010
The PAAG crisis

846
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,170
was a terrible social incident.

847
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,050
I was not the only one who made mistakes.

848
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,380
There were tens of thousands of victims.

849
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,530
We need to face this issue head-on,

850
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,690
and more importantly, help those affected by PAAG.

851
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,610
Taking this opportunity,

852
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,260
I would like to announce a public welfare initiative,

853
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,780
the Starlight Project.

854
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,650
I'll join hands with volunteer doctors

855
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,690
to assist me

856
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,050
in helping the victims of PAAG

857
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,170
by providing reconstructive treatment.

858
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,940
And as long as they come to me,

859
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,740
all these procedures will be completely free of charge.

860
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,260
Here, I officially announce

861
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,980
the Starlight Project starts today.

862
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,780
All of you here are professionals in the industry.

863
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,210
You are welcome to scrutinize me with the strictest standards

864
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,090
to see if I'm truly committed to this cause.

865
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,780
Of course,

866
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,780
if there are any volunteers

867
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,940
willing to join us,

868
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,900
I would be more than happy to have you on board.

869
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,690
Thank you, everyone.

870
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,490
Why are you always eating junk food?

871
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,860
I like steak too!

872
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,010
Why didn't I see this earlier?

873
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,980
Eat more.

874
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,210
A sudden "Star Project" out of nowhere?

875
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,650
Am I being used by you?

876
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,690
It's called the Starlight Project,

877
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,940
not the Star Project.

878
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,980
I've been planning this for a long time.

879
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,380
Now that I've left Gemu, I finally have the time,

880
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,740
and the funding is in place.

881
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,940
In another week or so,

882
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,780
I'll have my first surgery.

883
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,170
Silently working on something big, huh?

884
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,340
But that little act of yours on stage just now,

885
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,570
you really overdid it.

886
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,610
Welcome, dear colleagues, to supervise and guide me.

887
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,210
I almost burst out laughing.

888
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,380
Forget the others,

889
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,610
I'll be watching you closely myself.

890
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,490
Be my guest.

891
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,490
Your performance on stage just now was quite something too.

892
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,780
The moment you started speaking,

893
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,260
my heart clenched.

894
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,490
Scared you, didn't I?

895
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,530
Did you see Li Qi's reaction?

896
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,610
I never told you this,

897
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,940
but back then, the clinic I worked at

898
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,650
was owned by Li Qi.

899
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,570
So that means Qiao Hui's incident is connected to her too?

900
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,050
More or less.

901
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,900
Well,

902
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,420
now everything that didn't make sense before is finally clear.

903
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,010
But didn't you just say on stage

904
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,780
that she was a victim just like you?

905
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,010
Then why is she using this to blackmail you?

906
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,130
How would I know?

907
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,130
Guess we just see the world differently.

908
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,380
Now I should be the one asking you,

909
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,210
how did you know what Li Qi was gonna say?

910
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,570
Simple, calculated it with my fingers.

911
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,780
You wrote that note, didn't you?

912
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,570
What note?

913
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,460
Come on, drop the act.

914
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,690
How many doctors have handwriting as neat as yours?

915
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,940
Judging by your outfit,

916
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,260
Jiao Ai must be treating you pretty well.

917
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:35,650
Yeah.

918
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,740
Jiao Ai treats me quite well.

919
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,170
Lots of clients, good money.

920
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,780
They value me there.

921
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,130
After all, I was once your apprentice.

922
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,780
But are you happy?

923
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,740
Ms. Qiao,

924
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,690
honestly, from the very beginning,

925
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,980
I knew I was different from you.

926
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,610
Among the young doctors at Gemu,

927
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,130
I was probably the most hardworking one.

928
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,490
You wouldn't deny that, right?

929
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,170
But professionally, things that you grasp effortlessly

930
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,690
just by glancing at them

931
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,980
I have to spend ages figuring out.

932
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,740
Times have changed.

933
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,980
My goal is simple,

934
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,340
to make a name for myself quickly,

935
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,900
to have plenty of clients,

936
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,610
and to at least

937
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,980
own a place of my own in this city.

938
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,690
But the things

939
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,650
that come so easily to you,

940
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,690
for people of my generation, they're incredibly hard.

941
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,300
Do you understand that?

942
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,650
I do.

943
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,090
That's why going to Jiao Ai

944
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,690
was almost my only choice.

945
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,780
I know I've disappointed you.

946
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:05,780
I'm sorry.

947
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,940
If it's your own choice,

948
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,010
then there's no need to apologize to me.

949
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,650
Besides, choices can change.

950
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,530
If one day you stop enjoying it there,

951
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,010
you're always welcome back.

952
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,780
Here's our consultation form.

953
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,130
Please take a look.

954
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,490
Mr. Qin, please sign here.

955
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,460
Alright, done.

956
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,380
Now let's look at the camera.

957
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,260
Dr. Lu.

958
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,940
Did you sleep well last night?

959
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,300
I barely slept.

960
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,690
I'll give you full anesthesia later.

961
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,050
Get a good rest, alright?

962
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,260
Don't be nervous.

963
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,780
Gosh.

964
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,460
What are you doing? You scared me!

965
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,420
I'm nervous.

966
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,860
I thought this pen was gonna bite you.

967
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,170
Ms. Qiao,

968
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,780
I've scheduled

969
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,690
a few of Ms. Zhou's former clients.

970
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,780
Would you mind taking a look at them?

971
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,530
Sure.

972
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,530
Let's see them one by one.

973
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,010
Alright, this way.

974
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:22,260
Okay.

975
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,260
You two, please wait a moment.

976
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:23,820
Okay.

977
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,610
Let me explain it to you.

978
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,420
Basically, the removal of polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAAG)

979
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,570
can't be guaranteed to be 100% complete.

980
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,980
But don't worry.

981
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,820
All the doctors in our Starlight Program

982
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,940
are highly professional

983
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,650
and very experienced.

984
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,780
We'll do our best to remove as much of it as possible.

985
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,460
For patients over 45,

986
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,300
they are considered high-risk cases.

987
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,170
Even if there aren't any apparent issues,

988
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,170
it's generally recommended to have it removed.

989
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,460
If left untreated, the risk of breast cancer

990
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,650
will continue to increase.

991
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,780
I suggest you

992
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,570
take your mother for a check-up first

993
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,170
to determine whether PAAG was actually used.

994
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,130
From what I can see,

995
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,900
in your case, the PAAG material may have migrated

996
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,650
below the inframammary fold,

997
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,780
possibly reaching the abdominal wall or even the perineal area.

998
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,650
Look,

999
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,170
only by removing this material

1000
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,820
and the fibrous capsule inside,

1001
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,300
or using electrocautery,

1002
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,940
can we close the cavity properly.

1003
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,900
Especially in this area...

1004
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:20,980
Excuse me, just a moment.

1005
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:25,900
What is it? I'm in a consultation.

1006
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:29,690
Who?
