1
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,380
Ms. Qiao,

2
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,100
Liu Miao has been in the bathroom for a while.

3
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,740
I don't know if she's still in there.

4
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,820
I'm a bit worried.

5
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,980
What if she's not recording

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,100
because we broke the deal?

7
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,020
Should I contact her?

8
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,780
You sure are carefree.

9
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,290
Did you need me?

10
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,450
Pour me a glass of water.

11
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:23,820
Sure.

12
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,060
Sit.

13
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,780
So far,

14
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,850
they haven't admitted to the production team

15
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,850
that there was an issue with Liu Miao's surgery.

16
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,730
They probably want to keep it under wraps.

17
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,780
Is the video of Zhou Jingwen's surgery

18
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,660
ready?

19
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,450
Of course.

20
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,660
I arranged for a few extra cameras.

21
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,220
When the video plays, we'll zoom in.

22
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,540
The behind-the-scenes footage will be even more exciting.

23
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,660
For these two surgeries,

24
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,100
we've recorded everything.

25
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,170
To be honest,

26
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,660
watching the surgeries up close

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,610
really is challenging.

28
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,340
Once the show airs,

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,170
you'll understand what I mean.

30
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,660
Actually, during these two surgeries,

31
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,010
we faced quite a few more challenges.

32
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,610
Any thoughts to share,

33
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,340
doctors?

34
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,850
The surgeries went smoothly.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,780
The skin grafts took well.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,060
Everything met expectations.

37
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,940
Both patients are recovering well.

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,940
Ms. Zhou, do you agree with Ms. Qiao's view?

39
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,290
Yes, everything went smoothly.

40
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,170
You two are truly the perfect duo,

41
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,570
so in sync!

42
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,850
I'm sure the audience like me

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,220
is already shipping you two.

44
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,260
Yeah.

45
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,290
But something we have filmed

46
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,850
seems different from what you told us.

47
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,060
Here, take a look at the screen.

48
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,380
Sorry, just a moment.

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,540
I need to clarify something.

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,290
Actually, on the day of Liu Miao's surgery,

51
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,660
there were some issues.

52
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,690
In the end,

53
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,820
it was Ms. Qiao and I

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,130
who completed the surgery together.

55
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,130
Mingjie.

56
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,290
What are you doing?

57
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,890
Can you help me play this video?

58
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,410
Can't we play it?

59
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,140
As long as it's about surgery,

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,460
there's nothing we can't show.

61
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,780
Let's play it.

62
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,580
I have no idea.

63
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,220
As we can see,

64
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,540
when we opened her face,

65
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,410
the extent of her bone decay

66
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,980
was worse than what the scan showed.

67
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,700
You might find it unbelievable,

68
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,540
but for us surgeons,

69
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,660
this happens often

70
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,050
on the table.

71
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,780
Of course, I could decide

72
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,020
to shave off her bones,

73
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,610
and use 3D bone reconstruction.

74
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,140
But I didn't do that.

75
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,700
Because the shape might not turn out as expected.

76
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,780
I took a piece from her seventh rib.

77
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,580
Hostess,

78
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,660
let me add something here.

79
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,930
This approach works better.

80
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,140
But it requires two people to work together.

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,980
One for bone shaving,

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,250
the other for bone harvesting.

83
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,810
Yes, Mr. He.

84
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,250
So I asked Ms. Qiao for help.

85
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,850
Honestly,

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,700
at that moment, I wasn't thinking much.

87
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,540
I just wanted to do the surgery well.

88
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,930
But now, thinking back,

89
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,580
since it's a competition,

90
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,410
this isn't fair.

91
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,290
So I need to clarify this.

92
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,100
Sure.

93
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,610
What do the experts think?

94
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,730
I understand.

95
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,050
It's all for the patient.

96
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,370
Ms. Qiao volunteered to assist you,

97
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,050
but you're still the lead surgeon.

98
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,140
There's no issue with the process.

99
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,700
So, is the competition still on?

100
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,170
Should we consult

101
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,220
Ms. Qiao's opinion?

102
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,170
I have no problem with it.

103
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,370
Then we'll leave it up to the audience.

104
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,020
So,

105
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,580
do you want to keep watching?

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,610
Yes!

107
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,980
Since that's the case,

108
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,730
let's show everyone

109
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,370
Hao Xin's pre-op photos.

110
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,460
And welcome Hao Xin on stage.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,580
Please welcome Hao Xin.

112
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,140
I'm sure everyone can tell

113
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,580
with makeup on,

114
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,170
her scars are barely visible.

115
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,370
-Almost -Beautiful.

116
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,540
no sign of injury.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,610
Mr. He, please share

118
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,780
your professional opinion.

119
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,370
The skin graft was done with great precision.

120
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,610
And the facial symmetry

121
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,340
is well-balanced.

122
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,370
Dr. Qiao has amazing skills!

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,290
I'm sure everyone has formed their own opinion.

124
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,490
Just now, Dr. Zhou also showed us

125
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,140
Liu Miao's pre-op photos.

126
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,580
Let's welcome Liu Miao again.

127
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,100
Everyone, please look at the audience.

128
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,810
Liu Miao, say hi to everyone.

129
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,050
Liu Miao has hemifacial atrophy,

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,290
commonly known as facial imbalance.

131
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,410
With standard fat grafting,

132
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,250
it usually takes years

133
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,340
to see full recovery.

134
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,140
But for this surgery,

135
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,700
we used a free fascia-fat flap transplant.

136
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,050
In just one month,

137
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,050
Liu Miao has recovered

138
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,730
to how she looks now.

139
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,050
Liu Miao,

140
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,700
do you have anything to share?

141
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,460
I'm actually not happy with the surgery.

142
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,460
Before the operation,

143
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,980
Dr. Zhou and I signed an agreement.

144
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,290
I was supposed to fully recover

145
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,780
before school started.

146
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,540
Since I was a kid,

147
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,460
I've never attended a school opening ceremony.

148
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,410
This time,

149
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,980
I really wanted to be like a normal girl,

150
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,140
standing in the heat,

151
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,900
listening to speeches on the field,

152
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,900
whispering, complaining with friends.

153
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,540
-But... -As far as I know,

154
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,660
your university has been in session for a while now.

155
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,700
You're in military training now, right?

156
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,020
Yes.

157
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,850
Because of Dr. Zhou's decision,

158
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,340
I completely lost that chance.

159
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,780
From the moment I woke up after surgery,

160
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,890
I've cursed her a million times in my head.

161
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,300
Poor girl.

162
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,130
Close-up shot.

163
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,980
But today, sitting in the audience…

164
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,700
Not a single person

165
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,300
looked at me differently.

166
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,850
I finally feel like a normal girl.

167
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,370
Honestly, I dare to say,

168
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,890
I'm the most beautiful girl here.

169
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,530
Yeah!

170
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,730
Thank you, Dr. Zhou.

171
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,220
You're great.

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,890
I believe

173
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,010
there will be many more ceremonies

174
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,060
waiting for Liu Miao in the future.

175
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,130
And you will be the most dazzling one

176
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,530
in the crowd.

177
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,340
You've all seen both cases.

178
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,850
You're beautiful too.

179
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,610
I think

180
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,180
-both results are stunning. -I know.

181
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,490
Do you think so?

182
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,980
Yes!

183
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,980
The rankings for the first round of the competition

184
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,820
haven't been officially announced yet.

185
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,300
Now, let's see which case

186
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,220
our audience prefers.

187
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,130
Dr. Qiao!

188
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,180
Dr. Zhou is the best! Dr. Zhou!

189
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,610
Dr. Qiao is the winner!

190
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,770
Dr. Qiao!

191
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,250
Dr. Zhou! Dr. Zhou!

192
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,100
Where's the car?

193
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,770
It's fine. Let's wait a bit.

194
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,980
Still soaking in your victory?

195
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,770
Can't snap out of it?

196
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,370
I saw Hao Xin looked a little down.

197
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,100
I talked to her.

198
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,490
Told her that Ms. Qiao

199
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,850
doesn't care about winning.

200
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,890
You really wanted to win, huh?

201
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,730
It's just a competition.

202
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,100
Is it that important?

203
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,820
Yes. I wanted to win.

204
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,060
There are so many plastic surgeons online now.

205
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,370
Patients don't know who to trust.

206
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,180
And don't know if their cases

207
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,610
are real.

208
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,460
Do they have real skills?

209
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,730
We finally have

210
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,980
a professional competition

211
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,530
on such a great platform.

212
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,490
Of course, I want to show

213
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,890
what I can do.

214
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,010
I can't just let these scammers

215
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,010
take over the conversation.

216
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,490
You're right.

217
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,340
But what you really should do

218
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,610
is help those curious about plastic surgery

219
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,220
but lack proper knowledge.

220
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,060
Give them real, valuable information.

221
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,770
Not just an emotional story

222
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,770
to grab attention.

223
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,700
You can't expect everyone watching

224
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,650
to come to Gemu.

225
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,010
But you do have a responsibility

226
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,130
to help them

227
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,250
make the right choices,

228
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,490
and the right doctors.

229
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,460
Yeah.

230
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,890
But those things don't contradict each other.

231
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,300
Like us.

232
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,490
We have different views,

233
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,890
but we work

234
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,060
well together.

235
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,610
When I had trouble,

236
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,220
you stepped in to help.

237
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,610
I was just there for the drama.

238
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,850
Couldn't stand it,

239
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,250
so I stepped in.

240
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,250
Or you'd embarrass yourself on TV.

241
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,770
If Gemu's business suffers,

242
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,700
it'll affect me too.

243
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,060
Thank you.

244
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,420
You're welcome.

245
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,770
These people have been through what I have.

246
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,010
These are the clothes they wore when it happened.

247
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,820
She was only six.

248
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,340
Here, look.

249
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,180
Someone even sent three at once.

250
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,650
When they first asked me,

251
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,580
I said no.

252
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,010
After what happened,

253
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,060
I regretted it so many times.

254
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,490
If I hadn't gone to that club,

255
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,580
if I hadn't stayed out so late,

256
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,010
if I hadn't worn that dress...

257
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,820
Would it still have happened?

258
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,060
Go to hell!

259
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,650
But now, I don't care anymore.

260
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,980
Or maybe...

261
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,530
I've accepted it.

262
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,650
I was just

263
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,100
an ordinary person with bad luck.

264
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,250
Life is full of ups and downs.

265
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,420
That's just how it is.

266
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,340
Lose a job? Find a new one.

267
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,940
Looks like my surgery was a success.

268
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,700
Not just your face,

269
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,980
your heart was also cured.

270
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,220
Now you truly have a brave heart.

271
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,700
Thank you, Dr. Qiao.

272
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,650
You're welcome.

273
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,060
Come on, let me show you around.

274
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,610
Has your dad come looking for you?

275
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,370
Once he's out of money.

276
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,850
But it's fine.

277
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,580
I know how to handle it now.

278
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,340
Nice.

279
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,250
I'll take you boxing someday.

280
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,610
How'd you sleep?

281
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,420
Great.

282
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,460
-You? -Me?

283
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,940
I couldn't sleep at all.

284
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,770
Our score in the first round

285
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,650
was among the top five nationwide.

286
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,060
Yet we still lost the live vote.

287
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,980
I just don't get it.

288
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,220
It's a competition.

289
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,850
You can't be too noble.

290
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,730
I'm not that high-minded.

291
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,130
As long as Hao Xin is happy,

292
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,890
I'm satisfied with myself too.

293
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,370
The patients are my real judges.

294
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,580
Nothing else matters.

295
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,580
Round two: A Different Me.

296
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,420
In this round, doctors must perform

297
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,850
transformative repair procedures.

298
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,580
Dr. Lu.

299
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,650
why are you always here?

300
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,890
I'm really interested in the show.

301
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,980
This competition

302
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,850
used to be so boring.

303
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,130
But now, with the show,

304
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,100
it's way more fun.

305
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,890
Look at

306
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,980
Ms. Qiao.

307
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,460
On the operating table,

308
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,250
her facial muscle movements alone

309
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,850
could be a research paper.

310
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,850
Just don't air his words, ok?

311
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,460
Dr. Lu, you're free today?

312
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,580
No patients?

313
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,250
Check your email.

314
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,180
What?

315
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,580
Neurofibromatosis?

316
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,460
Elephant Man disease?

317
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,060
Like the one in

318
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,610
David Lynch's film?

319
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,420
Is this our patient?

320
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,650
It's Ms. Meng's patient.

321
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,250
She's looking for an assistant,

322
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,130
so I recommended Ms. Qiao.

323
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,420
Well done, Dr. Lu.

324
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,660
You're actually being useful.

325
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,940
This case

326
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,770
fits the theme perfectly.

327
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,700
You won't find

328
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,940
a case this rare

329
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,900
anywhere else.

330
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,980
Elephant Man...

331
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,420
A 3 in 100,000 chance,

332
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,460
Honestly, I'd rather believe

333
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,700
Liu Xinfang found her son,

334
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,460
or Liu Miao made it to her school ceremony.

335
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,180
I don't believe

336
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,730
we can find a better case.

337
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,220
We'll lose this round.

338
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,220
Thank you.

339
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,380
I didn't even know about my failed cases

340
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,940
until you mentioned it.

341
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,980
Should we still record this?

342
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,140
Of course.

343
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,420
This is our routine.

344
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,570
Aren't we aiming for the show's effect?

345
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,530
That will be good.

346
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,490
Alright.

347
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,860
You should

348
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,730
stop focusing so much on big cases.

349
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,180
Change your mindset.

350
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,220
Yeah, change your way of thinking.

351
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,140
Sorry to interrupt.

352
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,980
Thanks for your hard work.

353
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,140
Come on, have some snacks.

354
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,730
Thank you!

355
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,620
Thanks, Ms Li.

356
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,330
Check this.

357
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,010
Mingjie,

358
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,460
take them to the break room.

359
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,330
Get them something to drink.

360
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,010
On my bill.

361
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,940
I'll take you up on that.

362
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:11,940
Ok!

363
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,330
Here.

364
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,660
Let's go. Let's take a break.

365
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,620
-We're off then. -Thanks for your hard work.

366
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,220
Let's go.

367
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,660
My treat.

368
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,980
Qiao Yang decided to take this case?

369
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,660
This is Ms. Meng's patient.

370
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:28,940
She said

371
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,940
she wanted to find the right colleague to collaborate with.

372
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,700
Nothing's decided until the patient's

373
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,940
on the operating table.

374
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,860
Why are you so interested in our case

375
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,010
all of a sudden?

376
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,730
Xuan watched the competition replay.

377
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,860
She said Geme's part was the most exciting.

378
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,250
In the future,

379
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,570
the show's team will focus more on us.

380
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,570
The potential impact of this show

381
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,290
is beyond what I've imagined.

382
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,220
If it goes well,

383
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,730
it could become a new breakthrough

384
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,860
for our hospital.

385
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,250
To be specific,

386
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,940
I'll support you all the way.

387
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,860
Doesn't matter if I do the surgery or Qiao Yang,

388
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,420
it's the same for Gemu.

389
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,050
You told me that day that

390
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,860
you strongly opposed the merger.

391
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,570
I was upset for days after that.

392
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,730
I just thought

393
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,810
we both have the same goal.

394
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,530
How could we have such a big disagreement?

395
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,090
A few days ago, I was giving a training session

396
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,660
on management principles.

397
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,900
And one key principle: clear roles and responsibilities

398
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,940
hit me right away.

399
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,290
An obvious management flaw

400
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,530
has been present in Gemu for a long time.

401
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,180
That is...

402
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,810
Jingwen,

403
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,180
you've been working hard to run this hospital,

404
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,860
but you're not the director.

405
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,050
And this causes

406
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,180
the management to be unclear.

407
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,250
It's hard to

408
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,460
have true teamwork and trust.

409
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,620
So, Ms. Li wants to

410
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,700
support me to be the director?

411
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,940
Off course.

412
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,330
Only when you're the director

413
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,570
can we cooperate better.

414
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,180
Things like transformation

415
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,700
and merger can proceed.

416
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,490
So at this point,

417
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,050
who does the surgery

418
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,730
really matters.

419
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,250
Looks like Ms. Li is confident in

420
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,090
collaborating with me.

421
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,330
I know Gemu is your child.

422
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,290
And my mission

423
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,810
is to help it grow strong.

424
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,570
Look at all these honors on the wall.

425
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,530
Did I ever tell you that

426
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,860
the first time I saw you,

427
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,250
I knew you could make it.

428
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,860
Even during our darkest times,

429
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,860
I never doubted that.

430
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,700
It's okay.

431
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,330
Rain or shine, we're open.

432
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,250
Just come,

433
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,010
I'll wait for you.

434
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,770
Jingwen.

435
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,810
Can you give injections?

436
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,860
Of course.

437
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,860
Injections are

438
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,940
basic skills.

439
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,570
I've even done surgeries already.

440
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,010
I knew I didn't mistake my judgment.

441
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,730
Our clients are increasing.

442
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,530
You can give them the hyaluronic acid injections.

443
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,660
Will there be any problems?

444
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,010
How?

445
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,250
Your professional certification

446
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,860
was registered in our clinic a long time ago.

447
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,570
If Dr. Qiu weren't here,

448
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,940
you'd have started earlier.

449
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,490
But...

450
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,050
Jingwen,

451
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,530
I've always felt

452
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,050
we're the same kind.

453
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,940
We can only

454
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,700
rely on ourselves.

455
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,050
When opportunity comes,

456
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,660
we have no right to give up.

457
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,460
It's like we're children without an umbrella,

458
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,290
having to run full speed in the rain.

459
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,620
Why so shy?

460
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,530
I'm your mom's age.

461
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,140
Just relax.

462
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,980
Under male hormones,

463
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,140
a man's chest

464
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,860
is a vestigial organ.

465
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,140
I know.

466
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,620
I looked it up on the internet.

467
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,050
If you

468
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,420
really can't accept it,

469
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,460
you can consider

470
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,810
breast reduction surgery.

471
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,420
Stitches out in a week.

472
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,460
Even if you gain weight after,

473
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,620
train a bit,

474
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,900
you'll still have a man's chest.

475
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,570
Please schedule the surgery ASAP.

476
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,420
Sure.

477
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,180
Call your parents.

478
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,090
I need to talk to them.

479
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,900
Why?

480
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,220
I'm an adult.

481
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,330
I...

482
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,220
How old are you?

483
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,420
I'm 23.

484
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:18,980
See?

485
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,530
Oh,

486
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,940
sorry.

487
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,770
Here.

488
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,180
You

489
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,570
look like a kid.

490
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,090
So, can I have the surgery?

491
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,220
Of course.

492
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,460
I'll go pay now.

493
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,180
Take this.

494
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,330
Thank you!

495
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,700
Thank you, Dr. Meng.

496
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,530
I'll take you there.

497
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,140
Okay.

498
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,770
Ms. Qiao.

499
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,860
I'm in my office.

500
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,620
You can come.

501
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,570
The registration for the school

502
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,900
ends this weekend.

503
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,860
Did you ask your friend

504
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,660
for a spot?

505
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,980
I'll say it again.

506
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,570
This isn't just a tour.

507
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,220
Admission rules change yearly.

508
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,140
If we miss this, who knows what next year will be like.

509
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,290
Take it seriously.

510
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,380
Seriously?

511
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,050
What am I supposed to do?

512
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,900
Ms. Meng.

513
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,290
Sorry to interrupt, can we chat for a bit?

514
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,220
Ms. Li.

515
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,660
What brings you here?

516
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,530
What's keeping you busy?

517
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,730
Gynecomastia.

518
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,570
These kids today

519
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,010
are all over-nourished.

520
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:42,660
True.

521
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,730
Unlike your daughter.

522
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,770
She looks great.

523
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,050
Please take a seat.

524
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,250
Look.

525
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,860
She's grown up.

526
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,530
She's 12 now, right?

527
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,490
She must be moving on to junior high soon.

528
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,940
Have you decided where she's going?

529
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,620
Which school?

530
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,860
High School Affiliated to Normal University.

531
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,900
I'm actually worried about this right now.

532
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,980
What's the name

533
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,730
of the head of admissions there?

534
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,330
What was it, Mr. Yu or something?

535
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,290
You know him?

536
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,330
I saw him last week at a dinner.

537
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,900
Oh, Yu Guang.

538
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,180
My poor memory.

539
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,180
Should I give you a heads-up?

540
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,810
Would that be too much trouble?

541
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,380
No need to be polite.

542
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,900
My job is to help make things easier for you.

543
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,250
Anything you need, just say the word,

544
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,140
whether it's personal or work-related.

545
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,420
I can talk to Yu Guang.

546
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,180
That'll be great.

547
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,570
Actually I'm being a little selfish here.

548
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,180
If I help you take care of this

549
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,940
you'll be able to focus more

550
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,660
on your work at the hospital.

551
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,050
Wow,

552
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,940
that's awesome.

553
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,770
I've been stressing over this lately.

554
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,490
I didn't know what to do at all.

555
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,530
Ms. Li, you've really solved my problem.

556
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,860
What were you going to talk to me?

557
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,490
It's nothing.

558
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,490
I heard from Jingwen when I arrived

559
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,010
that you had a case.

560
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,860
The patient is Sun Xiao.

561
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,250
I think it's quite suitable

562
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,980
for the surgery competition.

563
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,050
You're looking for someone to collaborate, right?

564
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,010
Isn't it a perfect match with Ms. Zhou?

565
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,620
Just my suggestion.

566
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,090
You make the final call on the professional stuff.

567
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,770
I'll contact Mr. Yu.

568
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,660
Well, then I'll really rely on you.

569
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,570
Sorry to trouble you.

570
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,730
Ms. Meng.

571
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,660
Ms. Li.

572
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,460
I'll come back later.

573
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,330
It's fine. Come in.

574
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,460
I sent you the reference case

575
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,330
for Sun Xiao.

576
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,980
Take a look.

577
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,290
Ms. Qiao,

578
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,700
there may be some misunderstanding.

579
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,770
What?

580
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,290
Sun Xiao's case is a collaboration

581
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,770
with Ms. Zhou.

582
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,770
The case you're working on is...

583
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,380
Cheng Dabao,

584
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,530
a male breast reduction.

585
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,980
He wants to look like an idol.

586
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,860
It matches our theme perfectly.

587
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,010
A Different Me.

588
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,620
Right, Ms. Meng?

589
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,490
Have some candy.

590
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,860
You and Ms. Qiao

591
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,380
are not just work partners,

592
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,940
but also old friends from grad school.

593
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,900
It'd be nice to film some behind-the-scenes stuff,

594
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,530
showing your personal side.

595
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,420
It'll be great.

596
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,090
Well,

597
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,770
didn't we already film enough behind-the-scenes?

598
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,180
Why go back to school?

599
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,090
How about I dance with Qiao Yang

600
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,940
and let you film it?

601
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,770
No...

602
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,810
Ms. Qiao,

603
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,900
I sent you the proposal for filming at school.

604
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,660
Did you see it?

605
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,810
Which school?

606
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,250
Your school, of course.

607
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,220
Ms. Zhou disagrees.

608
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,290
You should talk to her.

609
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,180
Why does Ms. Zhou disagree?

610
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,330
What's wrong with visiting our alma mater?

611
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,290
Let's go.

612
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,380
It's decided then.

613
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,700
What are you afraid of?

614
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,940
We're just chatting.

615
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,420
You can relax a bit.

616
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,090
We're not disturbing anyone, right?

617
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,730
No.

618
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,700
The school arranged these actors to

619
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,330
cooperate with us.

620
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,250
They're all actors.

621
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,140
They're really into it, huh?

622
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,380
Alright, let's start.

623
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,770
It's been years.

624
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,220
The school hasn't changed much.

625
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,290
You didn't stay here long.

626
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,660
Why are you feeling nostalgic?

627
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,700
Seems like an old friends' reunion full of playful teasing.

628
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,140
You two were top students back then.

629
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,860
So, were you good friends

630
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,050
back then?

631
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,330
Not really.

632
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,420
Not really.

633
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,250
Do you have any story

634
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,250
about your friendship to share with us?

635
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:15,940
Nope.

636
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,380
Nothing special.

637
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,330
We just drifted in and out, normal.

638
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,180
Did we?

639
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,900
Come over here.

640
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,700
I heard Ms. Zhou had excellent grades

641
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,980
in grad school.

642
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,770
Why did you suddenly go abroad?

643
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,250
I went to Germany.

644
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,660
I found the education there

645
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,860
different from here in China.

646
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,940
-I adapted better there. -Qiao Yang?

647
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,330
Are you Qiao Yang?

648
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,220
Did you invite her?

649
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,730
Also an actor?

650
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,010
This wasn't in the script.

651
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,380
I'm Qiao Hui's classmate.

652
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,530
Here, take this.

653
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,460
Take this.

654
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:52,940
Sure.

655
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,490
Send the water over.

656
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,490
Just have some rest.

657
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,810
Give me one bottle.

658
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,940
Hua.

659
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,620
Ms. Xuan.

660
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,980
What are you doing back here?

661
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,530
They ran into someone they knew and chatted.

662
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,250
So why did you stop filming?

663
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,860
They told me to come back.

664
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,700
She told you to come back,

665
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,220
so you just did?

666
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,050
They're avoiding you because there's a story there.

667
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,530
Can you think for a second?

668
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,050
Alright.

669
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,730
This is great material, go shoot it!

670
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,660
Okay.

671
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,620
I'll go now.

672
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,810
Stop eating.

673
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,730
Let's go.

674
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,810
Qiao Hui and I were roommates.

675
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,180
Now, I'm a teacher here at this school.

676
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,050
I didn't expect to see you.

677
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,940
About Qiao Hui...

678
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,940
Her incident has haunted

679
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,090
our whole class.

680
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,770
After all these years,

681
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,380
whenever I think of her, I can't sleep.

682
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,140
I always feel like

683
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,730
I'm the one who caused her death.

684
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,700
What?

685
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,810
We were very close in the dorm.

686
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,220
Everyone got along well.

687
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,460
Before graduation, she started getting surgery.

688
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,250
At first, no one dared to ask her about it.

689
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,050
I was the one who asked.

690
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,250
She admitted it.

691
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,180
The atmosphere in the dorm

692
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,420
changed immediately.

693
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,660
Then she ruined her nose.

694
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,220
A lot of people noticed.

695
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,570
There were rumors all over the school.

696
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,810
People were saying all kinds of things.

697
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,420
Many people were

698
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,460
pointing fingers at us.

699
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,330
We all felt so embarrassed.

700
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,050
She often cried alone in the dorm.

701
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,810
She wanted to talk to us.

702
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,220
But we didn't want to talk to her.

703
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,140
Be careful, it hurts!

704
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,620
Sorry, sorry.

705
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,420
What's going on at your hospital?

706
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,010
Can we have some doctor with experience?

707
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,810
Sorry.

708
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,530
Sorry.

709
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,420
Have the blood test results come out?

710
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,050
Not yet.

711
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,460
Your mentor? Go get it.

712
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,050
Got it.

713
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,700
Hello?

714
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:07,940
Qiao Hui?

715
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,420
What happened to your nose?

716
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,900
Hold on.

717
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,140
Hello, is this the Laboratory?

718
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,860
I never expected this.

719
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,380
Really.

720
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,530
After it happened,

721
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,700
I felt sad and guilty,

722
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,420
and really angry.

723
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,140
I remember she told me

724
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,900
she went to one of your friends.

725
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,490
I forgot the name.

726
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,250
She got the injection at their clinic.

727
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,050
I felt like I had to do something for her,

728
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,770
so I went to your hospital and talked to the leaders.

729
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,940
Later, that person got fired.

730
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,770
I thought after doing all that,

731
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,620
I would feel better.

732
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,140
But I didn't.

733
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,570
Do you regret what you did?

734
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,220
Never.

735
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,220
I think that person deserved that.

736
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,620
Been looking for you for a while.

737
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,490
I always thought it was you.

738
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,810
Now I realized

739
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,290
I don't even have anyone to hate.

740
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,570
Why do you never deny it?

741
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,530
Because

742
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,900
I hope the one who reported you was me.

743
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,140
Here.

744
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,860
Behind you.

745
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,420
This way.

746
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,660
Done so soon?

747
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,090
I was thinking of filming something.

748
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,700
Wanted to film us fighting.

749
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,900
Sorry,

750
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,770
we're good now.

751
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,900
We still have stuff to record.

752
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,570
Sorry, there's surgery.

753
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,050
Ms. Xuan's gonna kill us.

754
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,660
Thanks for the reminder.

755
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,220
Last time you didn't inject me.

756
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,380
So I found someone else.

757
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,140
They're way worse than you.

758
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:01,900
See?

759
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,620
My nose is crooked.

760
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,290
You definitely overdid the hyaluronic acid.

761
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,700
The injection should be moderate.

762
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,770
Doing too much at once causes problems.

763
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,620
Do you know plastic surgery is addictive?

764
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,770
You can't focus all your attention

765
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,050
on this.

766
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,420
It's just I didn't get what I wanted.

767
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,570
I want a small adjustment.

768
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,810
I'm really worried about you.

769
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,140
And Qiao Yang is my best friend.

770
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,570
I have to tell her.

771
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,620
Please don't.

772
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,180
Why tell her?

773
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,660
I came to you,

774
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,010
so I'll listen to you.

775
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,220
I swear

776
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,700
I won't touch anything else.

777
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,900
Except my nose.

778
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:35,940
Please.

779
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,180
Just help me one more time.

780
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,900
Please.

781
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,380
It's the last time.

782
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,700
No more after this.

783
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,570
Qiao Hui!

784
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,770
What are you doing?

785
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,940
I'm a doctor too.

786
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,330
Get out!

787
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,140
Qiao Hui has a surgery addiction problem.

788
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,010
Don't cause trouble.

789
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,090
Do you have a certification?

790
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,980
It's illegal to perform surgery without one.

791
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,810
Stop talking nonsense.

792
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,490
Get out.

793
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,050
Don't let them fool you.

794
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,490
They're an unlicensed clinic.

795
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,490
Get out.

796
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,050
Looking back now,

797
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,460
I haven't known Qiao Hui for long.

798
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,940
Only two months.

799
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,490
What kind of person was she?

800
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,530
When I was in middle school, I had a crush.

801
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,010
My dad cut my hair in anger,

802
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,860
using the big fish scissors.

803
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,210
I can still smell the fishy smell.

804
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,740
He cut my hair like a dog chewed it.

805
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,780
It was a disaster.

806
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,570
I locked myself in the bathroom and cried.

807
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,300
I even wanted to kill my dad.

808
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,860
Qiao Hui found out and

809
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,010
she rushed to my house.

810
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,490
Without a word, she took me away.

811
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,860
There was a popular song back then.

812
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,490
Liang Yongqi's “Short Hair”

813
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,690
Do you remember?

814
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,570
Of course.

815
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,690
She had that album poster on the wall

816
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,490
in her bedroom.

817
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,090
She styled my hair little by little,

818
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,570
just like the hair style

819
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,980
on the poster.

820
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,780
Later, with that hairstyle

821
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,260
I became super popular at school.

822
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,380
All the girls copied it.

823
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,980
I had even better luck with guys.

824
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,860
My dad was even angrier.

825
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,820
Hearing you say that,

826
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,090
Qiao Hui was a really good girl.

827
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,570
She was so wise,

828
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,610
and she cared about you.

829
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,570
Yeah.

830
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,820
She is the most outstanding child

831
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,090
in our family.

832
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,460
She was my idol when I was young.

833
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,210
She always knew what she wanted,

834
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,860
loved trying new things

835
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,340
She was so brave.

836
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,340
I really don't get it.

837
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,130
Why would someone so full of life choose to end it?

838
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,780
How desperate

839
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,380
must she have felt back then?

840
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,820
Qiao Hui,

841
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,340
I understand you.

842
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,340
Because just like you,

843
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,260
I want a perfect look,

844
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,650
and a perfect life.

845
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,340
If you still hate me,

846
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,340
then keep hating me.

847
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,460
I can't forgive myself either.

848
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,650
Sorry.

849
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,530
Hui,

850
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,780
don't drink to much milk tea.

851
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,820
Keep healthy.

852
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,300
I miss you so much.

853
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,340
Don't be mad at me.

854
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,420
Come visit me in my dreams,

855
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,650
okay?

856
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,690
That's really unfair.

857
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,650
Didn't you promise to wait for me for a week?

858
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,980
And now it's rented?

859
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,570
I'm not going back

860
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,170
Go home.

861
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:22,940
No!

862
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,010
Listen to us, let's go home.

863
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,780
I'm not going home.

864
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,820
What's wrong with this kid?

865
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,460
Go.

866
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,210
Leave me alone.

867
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,650
Fine. I'll talk to you later.

868
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,690
Go home.

869
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,530
If your grandma hadn't checked your phone,

870
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,980
and called us,

871
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,980
you were planning to get the surgery done

872
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,090
without telling us, right?

873
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,170
You're still a kid.

874
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,980
I'm not a kid anymore.

875
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,010
I'm 23.

876
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,210
Anyway, it didn't cost you anything.

877
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,260
It's none of your business.

878
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,570
How embarrassing.

879
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,260
Look at yourself now.

880
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,820
Do you look like a 23-year-old man?

881
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,820
Hello.

882
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,530
Sorry,

883
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,610
I'm Li Qi, the Operations Director at Gemu.

884
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,980
If you have any problem,

885
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,210
we can talk in the office.

886
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,610
No need, we can talk here.

887
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,530
You're Ms. Li, right?

888
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,610
I'm Cheng Dabo's father.

889
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,820
His mother and I

890
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,260
have been working away from home for years.

891
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,980
After he graduated from college,

892
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,260
he couldn't find a job.

893
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,050
Now he's living with his grandma.

894
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,260
His grandma found out that he's been

895
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,340
secretly coming to your hospital for plastic surgery.

896
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,130
We absolutely cannot approve of this.

897
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,050
Ok, I got it.

898
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,010
Please calm down.

899
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,260
I'll have someone arrange it right away.

900
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,530
We'll refund you immediately.

901
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,300
I won't refund.

902
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,340
I want the surgery.

903
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,820
What?

904
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,010
I've already made an appointment with Dr. Meng.

905
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,340
Cheng Dabo, are you taking me for a fool?

906
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,460
Please calm down.

907
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,170
Here's the thing.

908
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,050
Look, your parents are already here.

909
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,740
Since they don't agree,

910
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,530
we can't do this surgery.

911
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,490
It's none of their business.

912
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,820
This is my own decision.

913
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,050
How dare you!

914
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,210
Look how sad your parents are.

915
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:34,940
Qing,

916
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,210
take them for a refund.

917
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,010
This way, please.

918
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,690
I'm sorry,

919
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,690
let me apologize to you all.

920
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,820
Where are we going?

921
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,050
Refund?

922
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,340
It's not about refund.

923
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,690
I just want to know

924
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,490
who convinced my son

925
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,820
to go for plastic surgery?

926
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,340
He even took out a loan for it.

927
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,820
Everyone, please tell me,

928
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:50,780
what would you do

929
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,570
if it were your child?

930
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,690
Would you let him do this?

931
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,010
Encouraging patients to take out loans for surgery?

932
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,300
That's a serious accusation.

933
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,300
It's crossing the line.

934
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,420
That's absolutely not allowed in Gemu.

935
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,820
No matter what the patient's family says,

936
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,260
we need to investigate ourselves.

937
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,940
Who had the first consultation with Cheng Dabao?

938
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,940
Tell me.

939
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,820
Mr. Qin is asking.

940
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,340
Who consulted Cheng Dabao?

941
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,340
It was me.

942
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,570
Sorry, Ms. Li.

943
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,050
Did you talk to him about loaning money for surgery?

944
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:32,980
No.

945
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,010
I thought his family was in business.

946
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,210
They probably aren't short on money.

947
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,860
I never expected this to happen.

948
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,260
Dr. Meng,

949
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,740
did you know anything about this?

950
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,980
Well,

951
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,780
he never mentioned money to me.

952
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,820
Besides, I couldn't even discuss that with patients.

953
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,050
But at the time,

954
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,170
I did notice he looks young.

955
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,090
So I checked his ID.

956
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,820
He's definitely an adult.

957
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,820
So he has the right to make the decision.

958
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,050
We can't just

959
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,820
refuse him because his thoughts

960
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,340
are immature, right?

961
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,300
That's how I saw it, too.

962
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,740
He doesn't have a job, but his pride is strong.

963
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,740
He didn't tell his family about the surgery.

964
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,980
And there's no way he would tell us about the loan.

965
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,740
Besides, his parents are always far away.

966
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,170
When something goes wrong,

967
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,050
they blame us.

968
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:15,690
Zhang Qing,

969
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,530
you can't talk about our client like that.

970
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,010
Well, this is clear.

971
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,860
This kid.

972
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,340
Well, not even a kid.

973
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,090
Cheng Dabaot wants surgery,

974
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,570
but the family doesn't understand.

975
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,820
This is an family issue.

976
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,090
Accusing us of pushing loans for surgery

977
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,090
is just a misunderstanding.

978
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,820
We'll clear this up with them.

979
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,530
Are we jumping to conclusions?

980
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,900
Isn't this a bit hasty?

981
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,170
Ms. Li, you might have forgotten

982
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,530
Dabao is my patient too.

983
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,570
Ms. Meng and I are partners.

984
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,570
If something happens to the patient,

985
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,010
I'll be responsible for that.

986
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,690
How about this?

987
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,490
I'll take full responsibility

988
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,130
and investigate this properly.

989
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,210
I'll make sure

990
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,900
the patient get a proper explanation.

991
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,340
Well, since Ms. Qiao has spoken.

992
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,530
Ms. Zhou,

993
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,740
you've always been in charge of the medical affairs.

994
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,340
What do you think?

995
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,650
The problem is, Dabao's parents

996
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,050
are demanding a resolution.

997
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,460
We must give them an answer

998
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,820
that will convince them.

999
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,490
I suggest we suspend the work of everyone involved

1000
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,610
until this is resolved.

1001
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,340
It'll be better for everyone.

1002
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,780
And I hope you understand.

1003
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:38,980
Ms. Li.

1004
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,690
-Ms. Li. -Enough.

1005
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,820
Come to my office.

1006
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,740
So,

1007
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,820
do you really think someone at Gemu

1008
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,610
is encouraging clients to take out loans

1009
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,980
for surgery?

1010
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,340
It's not that I think so.

1011
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,340
It's the truth.

1012
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,010
Gemu's success is built on its reputation.

1013
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,210
Loan surgery is a serious matter.

1014
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,050
This is a big issue,

1015
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,570
no room for doubt.

1016
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,170
If we're going to investigate, we need to get it clear.

1017
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,940
Qiao Yang's approach is good.

1018
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,610
I didn't expect her to be so proactive.

1019
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,340
Is this what you agreed on?

1020
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,210
I know her.

1021
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,570
Why are you doing this?

1022
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,820
What does it have to do with you?

1023
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,050
Why get involved?

1024
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,170
Don't thank me.

1025
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,170
I know what I'm doing.

1026
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,820
Don't worry too much about the suspension.

1027
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,980
It'll probably be just a day or two.

1028
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:33,300
My daughter's got a lot going on at school.

1029
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,740
My parents are sick.

1030
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,740
My husband seems to have vanished.

1031
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,820
Everyone is counting on me.

1032
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,820
Well, I really

1033
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,340
need this vacation.

1034
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,820
As expected of you.

1035
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,820
What do you think about loan surgery?

1036
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,900
It must be a misunderstanding.

1037
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,130
We've been at Gemu for so long.

1038
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,420
Has anything like this ever happened?

1039
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:56,780
Right?

1040
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:59,740
Well, I hope it's a misunderstanding.
