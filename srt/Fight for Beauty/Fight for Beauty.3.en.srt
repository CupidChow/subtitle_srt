1
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,620
Is this Wang Qi's wedding dress?

2
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,460
Yeah.

3
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,290
Give it to me.

4
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,210
I'm Wang Qi.

5
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,620
Ms. Zhou,

6
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,900
I've scheduled the consultation for Jiang Rong's surgery at 10 AM tomorrow.

7
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,890
I've also arranged for the media to be there on surgery day.

8
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,380
You're welcome.

9
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,780
Qiao Yang,

10
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,500
Jiang Rong's consultation is at 10:30.

11
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,850
We'll discuss the final surgical plan.

12
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,410
No matter what, I hope you'll join.

13
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,940
Can you hear me?

14
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,540
I need your help.

15
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,130
I'll help anyone except you.

16
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,340
Thank god you can hear me.

17
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,980
You really think you're something special?

18
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,500
You've always been like this.

19
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,010
Living in your own world.

20
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,060
Always thinking you're right.

21
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,170
And everyone else is a fool, a simpleton.

22
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,980
I'm telling you,

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,780
if I could find someone else,

24
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,820
I wouldn't have come to you.

25
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,500
I know I'm a terrible person.

26
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,820
I'm selfish.

27
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,250
I don't even know which of my words are true.

28
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,460
Which ones are lies.

29
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,540
I also have some pasts

30
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,980
that I'm too afraid to face.

31
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,900
You know all about those pasts.

32
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,100
That's why I'm afraid to meet you, you know?

33
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,490
Hey, bike!

34
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,290
Listen to me.

35
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,340
Stop right there!

36
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,980
I don't know what else to say to you.

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,490
Bike!

38
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,810
But for Jiang Rong's surgery, you're the only one who can join.

39
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,170
I'll be waiting for you at the café ahead.

40
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,660
Think about it.

41
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,490
That bike! Stop right there!

42
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,170
Is she your friend?

43
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,340
She's a psycho.

44
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,490
Psycho?

45
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,250
Hey, psycho! Stop!

46
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,100
You hear me?

47
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,290
Stop!

48
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,700
Mr. Qin.

49
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,730
Mr. Qin.

50
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,540
It's 11 o'clock.

51
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,810
The doctor from the Third Hospital isn't coming, right?

52
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,140
Just wait.

53
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,730
Auntie,

54
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,780
don't worry.

55
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,100
Let's wait a little longer.

56
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,900
Sorry to keep you waiting.

57
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,780
This is Dr. Qiao

58
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,580
from the Third Hospital.

59
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,020
Your pace is terrible.

60
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,100
Don't be so arrogant.

61
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,020
Tonight, I'm going to beat you down.

62
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,980
Qiao Yang.

63
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,370
Isn't she your idol?

64
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,580
Well, we already know each other to some extent.

65
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,660
Let's get straight to the point.

66
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,220
The difficulty of this surgery

67
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,700
lies in the treatment of the scars.

68
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,660
The patient has over seventy new and old scars.

69
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,170
They're really shocking.

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,020
Most of them are concentrated on the head, neck, back,

71
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,700
legs, and arms.

72
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,780
The largest one

73
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,660
is a surgical scar left from a C-section.

74
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,540
Let's take a look at Ms. Zhou's plan.

75
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,020
For the small scars on the head and arms,

76
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,340
we're using laser and microneedling.

77
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,410
This generally requires four to five sessions

78
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,140
for better fading effects.

79
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,460
It's a standard procedure.

80
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,250
But it works.

81
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,290
The real challenge is these two scars.

82
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,020
For the leg scars, we'll remove them

83
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,050
and then use tension-relieving sutures.

84
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,980
During the healing process,

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,580
we'll also apply growth factors to assist in the recovery.

86
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,730
This combination is practical and effective.

87
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,340
For the abdomen, we'll use abdominoplasty,

88
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,490
which is commonly known as a tummy tuck.

89
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,370
While removing the scars,

90
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,730
we'll also tighten the abdomen

91
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,340
and reshape the waistline.

92
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,050
Ms. Zhou's really thought this through.

93
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,700
So, with this surgery,

94
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,140
not only will we address these complex scars,

95
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,850
but we'll also achieve shaping results.

96
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,140
Plastic surgeons are everywhere,

97
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,410
and plastic surgery can be done anywhere.

98
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,170
But the real question is,

99
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,460
whether the results can soothe

100
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,810
the deepest pain in the patient's heart.

101
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,580
Can it meet

102
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,850
the patient's deepest needs?

103
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,930
From this perspective,

104
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,850
this plan gets a perfect score.

105
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,100
Now that we've discussed the plan,

106
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,930
let's take a look at the actual procedure.

107
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,290
This delicate and complex surgery

108
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,780
needs to be completed within three hours.

109
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,660
Three hours...

110
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,290
And it's a public surgery.

111
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,370
I'm even getting a bit excited.

112
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,940
Come on, let's watch together.

113
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,370
Abdominoplasty.

114
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,130
Her wrinkles aren't too severe.

115
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,010
Two hours.

116
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,340
For the legs, twenty-five minutes.

117
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,610
For these two areas,

118
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,730
this one's fifteen minutes.

119
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,250
This one's twenty minutes.

120
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,370
Three hours in total.

121
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,060
If we're faster,

122
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,850
we might even have some extra time.

123
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,490
Perfect.

124
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,460
Does anyone have any objections?

125
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,180
No objections.

126
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,890
Alright.

127
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,820
I have a question.

128
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,300
Is it really necessary to complete the surgery

129
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,980
in three hours?

130
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,180
From this case,

131
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,580
I don't see any reason to do it like this.

132
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,060
Scar repair and abdominoplasty

133
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,730
could easily be done in two separate surgeries.

134
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,370
Not only would it reduce the risk during the procedure,

135
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,980
but the recovery time would be faster too.

136
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,940
If I were you,

137
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,580
no matter how good this plan looks,

138
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,770
I wouldn't accept it.

139
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,530
You've already gone through so much,

140
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,220
and now you're risking your life

141
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,490
just to put on a show for others?

142
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,490
It's not worth it.

143
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,420
That's my opinion.

144
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,130
Sorry,

145
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,650
I need to use the restroom.

146
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,730
What's going on?

147
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,460
She's not doing it?

148
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,180
Thank you so much.

149
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,890
You're not doing the surgery, but you've come here to mess things up.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,850
You're putting in so much effort.

151
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,610
She's just walked through the gates of death,

152
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,890
and lost her child.

153
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,650
Now, you wanna drag her

154
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,300
into an internet marketing show?

155
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,340
Do you even know what the word "bottom line" means?

156
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,490
To me, the bottom line

157
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,530
is understanding the patient's deepest needs.

158
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,370
What about you?

159
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,980
How much do you know about Jiang Rong?

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,770
Is it just the three pages of the surgical plan?

161
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,850
I'm telling you,

162
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,770
I know Jiang Rong

163
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,850
more than just those three pages.

164
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,060
Oh, really?

165
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,850
If you know her so well,

166
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,770
then you should do it yourself.

167
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,820
Why are you asking me?

168
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,180
I'm not your bottom line.

169
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,100
King of speeches,

170
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,220
are you riding tonight?

171
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,580
Your physical strength is so weak for someone in surgery.

172
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,890
How are you going to outcompete others?

173
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,180
See you Monday.

174
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,060
She's just walked through the gates of death,

175
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,420
and lost her child.

176
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,220
Now, you wanna drag her

177
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,980
into an internet marketing show?

178
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,530
Do you even know what the word "bottom line" means?

179
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,700
What's that smell? It stinks!

180
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,100
Do you guys smell something?

181
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,850
Kept the diet light today.

182
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,130
Okay.

183
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,730
No food after 8 PM tonight.

184
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,530
No water for 8 hours before surgery.

185
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:11,980
No problem.

186
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,010
Thank you.

187
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,580
Jiang Rong, right?

188
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,580
Shameless!

189
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,010
Her son died, and she still wants cosmetic surgery?

190
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,940
How can you face your child?

191
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,180
Stop pretending to be innocent!

192
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,420
Someone!

193
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,220
You deserve to die!

194
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,220
Shameless!

195
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,300
Fei!

196
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,580
Don't be afraid.

197
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,010
Sorry!

198
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:57,850
I'm sorry!

199
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,490
It's fine.

200
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,580
Sorry.

201
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,610
Stop apologizing.

202
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,650
It's okay.

203
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,890
I'm sorry.

204
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,300
Stop crying.

205
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,580
What kind of people are those?

206
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,530
They're mad!

207
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,610
Stop crying.

208
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,580
It's okay.

209
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,420
I'm fine.

210
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,700
I'm okay.

211
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,060
Excuse me.

212
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,130
Sorry.

213
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,010
Ms. Li.

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,340
What's going on here?

215
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,490
Is everything okay?

216
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,340
What are they doing?

217
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,700
Qing,

218
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,100
get a few more security guards.

219
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,980
Get the one who checks the car passes at the entrance,

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,370
always shouting for Zhuang.

221
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,180
Tell him to come and guard 24/7.

222
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:43,980
Alright.

223
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,820
We've stopped several groups already.

224
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,420
There are still some who slipped through.

225
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,010
Several groups?

226
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,100
Jiang Rong was my college classmate.

227
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,180
She became a full-time housewife right after graduation.

228
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,770
She never earned a penny.

229
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,730
To put it bluntly, she's a parasite.

230
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,650
That's a bit harsh.

231
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,060
And the second most liked post...

232
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,610
Her husband is a teacher.

233
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,940
He's usually quite humble.

234
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,650
How could he commit domestic violence out of the blue?

235
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,650
I heard Jiang Rong was having an affair.

236
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,180
She's like a ticking time bomb.

237
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,010
Enough. Just sit down for a moment.

238
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,370
These people online...

239
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,820
They just speak out of nowhere,

240
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,460
as if they were actually there.

241
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,370
It's frustrating, but

242
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,460
we still need to handle this calmly.

243
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,300
We can't fan the flames.

244
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,700
Right now, the best solution

245
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,220
is if Jiang Rong herself steps forward

246
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,850
and says she won't go through

247
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,300
with the surgery.

248
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,420
Good idea.

249
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,010
Silence. We're talking business here.

250
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,010
Mr. Qin, what do you think?

251
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,340
Jingwen's surgery plan is definitely fine.

252
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,770
Qiao Yang has also reviewed it.

253
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,940
She couldn't find any issues with it.

254
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,730
It's just the timing of the surgery.

255
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,220
No one mentioned cosmetic surgery causing disfigurement anymore, right?

256
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,770
In the 16th century,

257
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,530
rhinoplasty was done to cover up syphilis scars.

258
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,460
In the 80s, people got double eyelid surgery

259
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,180
and claimed it was caused by a fever.

260
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,420
From hiding ugliness to seeking beauty,

261
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,940
it's all in line with the progress of society.

262
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,850
We are also looking for solutions based on the perspectives

263
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,060
of the people leading the development.

264
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:05,940
That's right.

265
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,610
Some people criticize Jiang Rong online,

266
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,010
but that's not important.

267
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,420
What matters is a perfect surgery.

268
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,580
That will shut up those who misunderstand.

269
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,300
You've raised the value, right?

270
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,490
She's raised the value, right?

271
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,060
Seriously?

272
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,010
Let's talk about something practical.

273
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,300
The media experts have already been arranged.

274
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,180
If the surgery's delayed,

275
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,610
Mr. Tang,

276
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,460
have you calculated the losses?

277
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,730
At least starting from a million.

278
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,530
What?

279
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,700
Actually, it's all fine.

280
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,770
If the surgery goes well,

281
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,370
of course that's the best outcome.

282
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,610
The problem is, the lead surgeon hasn't been confirmed yet.

283
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,130
Qiao Yang's clearly stated she wouldn't take it.

284
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,530
Who's gonna do the surgery then?

285
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,610
Me.

286
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,220
Wait a moment.

287
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,980
Do we need a shower?

288
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,250
No.

289
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,380
Don't you need pre-surgery cleaning?

290
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,050
Can we not use technical terms at this moment?

291
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,490
I'm be quick.

292
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,380
Your call.

293
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,700
Who is it?

294
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,620
Chunsheng.

295
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,730
Coming.

296
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,420
Checking up?

297
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,730
I stole his stuff.

298
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,860
My wallet is suddenly missing.

299
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,250
Oh?

300
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,420
That's definitely not me.

301
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,900
I usually steal more expensive stuff.

302
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,770
You'll need to stitch me up internally.

303
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,140
I have a scar tendency.

304
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,330
You don't trust my technique?

305
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:41,980
What now?

306
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,460
Your call.

307
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,700
From whom?

308
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,620
You're so popular.

309
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,050
Go away.

310
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,660
Sorry.

311
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,770
Where are you going?

312
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,770
I have an urgent matter.

313
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,860
I gotta go.

314
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:20,980
Wait.

315
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,180
Can the scheduled surgery

316
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,250
be canceled?

317
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,090
It's not canceled.

318
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,620
Just delayed.

319
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,290
Don't catch a cold, okay?

320
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,290
You're really leaving?

321
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,220
Where's the on-call doctor?

322
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,420
What's going on?

323
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,980
Hematoma or infection?

324
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,380
I'm not sure. You can take a look.

325
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,220
The stitches was removed tonight.

326
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,010
She said she wanted you to be the first to see her.

327
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,770
Shut up.

328
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,330
Oh no.

329
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,940
What's wrong?

330
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,220
You're not cute anymore.

331
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,290
You don't look like Golden Horn anymore.

332
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,700
Chunsheng?

333
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,220
Please make sure she rests more.

334
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,140
Don't let her mood fluctuate too much.

335
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,140
Got it.

336
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,010
Thank you, doctor.

337
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,660
You're welcome.

338
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,570
Take care.

339
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,940
Ms. Zhou,

340
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,810
I still feel like this surgery

341
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,490
isn't what Jiang Rong needs right now.

342
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,620
We can't just do it

343
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,420
because...

344
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,700
What?

345
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,860
Because we need it?

346
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,980
No,

347
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,330
that's not what I mean.

348
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,730
What I mean is,

349
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,330
she should start a new life first.

350
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,860
Then, she can consider these things.

351
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,980
Jiang Rong is an old patient of Gemu's.

352
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,420
She came to see me two years ago.

353
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,660
You don't remember?

354
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,570
She made a really funny request back then,

355
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,180
but it was also kind of cute.

356
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,900
She wanted to have breast surgery

357
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,010
but didn't want anyone to know.

358
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,140
She asked if I could just give her a shot.

359
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,090
No one could help her with that.

360
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,460
At the time, she didn't have as many scars.

361
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,860
So why didn't you...

362
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,140
Yeah.

363
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,250
I didn't do anything back then.

364
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,220
Are you gonna go to sleep?

365
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,490
What?

366
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,900
See what day it is today.

367
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,770
I know.

368
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,700
But I'm really tired today.

369
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,730
Let's do it tomorrow.

370
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,770
Tomorrow? It'll be too late.

371
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,140
What's wrong with you?

372
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,620
Me?

373
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,700
Then what's going on with you today?

374
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,810
What?

375
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,620
During the meeting today,

376
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,140
you didn't support me at the critical moment.

377
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,220
Yeah,

378
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,140
you're the master of balancing things, huh?

379
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,330
Honey,

380
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,180
Right now, in Gemu, we're just the surface.

381
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,940
Tang is the pillar.

382
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,460
No matter how shiny we look,

383
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,620
if the pillar falls,

384
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,700
we're all done for.

385
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,900
Tang is the pillar?

386
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,180
Then Li Qi is not?

387
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,660
Li Qi can hold up the pillar.

388
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,140
You're such a coward.

389
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,380
You were glaring at me when you were scolding me.

390
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:17,900
You seem

391
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,090
quite energetic now.

392
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,530
Let's make use of the time.

393
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,330
What are you doing?

394
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,380
I wanna sleep!

395
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,290
Come on.

396
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,570
We can't wait until tomorrow.

397
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,380
I'm exhausted.

398
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,940
Honestly,

399
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,730
about that surgery,

400
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,290
I really don't have much confidence in it.

401
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,700
But there's no better solution.

402
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,530
If there's another surgery,

403
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,530
her mental state can't handle it.

404
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,900
Seems like Qiao Yang has some skills.

405
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,050
Why don't you get in touch with her?

406
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,180
Okay.

407
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,700
Let me contact her now.

408
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,090
Let's go to sleep.

409
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,530
Really?

410
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,250
What else?

411
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,900
Fine.

412
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,660
Good night.

413
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,140
She's not divorced from that man.

414
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,860
Maybe after he comes out of prison, they'll continue their life together.

415
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,730
There's always a reason for someone's misfortune.

416
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,330
I don't think it's a problem. They're adults,

417
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,940
and they're responsible for their own choices.

418
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,090
Why do some people hate Jiang Rong so much?

419
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,290
She hasn't done anything heinous.

420
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,010
Three hours.

421
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,810
Ms. Zhou's doing it herself.

422
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,980
She really has a lot of courage.

423
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,290
Don't be sarcastic.

424
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,490
You should learn from her.

425
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,490
Improve your own professional abilities.

426
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,660
Do what you're supposed to do.

427
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,620
Then what's meant to come will come.

428
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,330
Yeah.

429
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,730
I'll definitely do my job well.

430
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,050
Actually,

431
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,380
one of my friend

432
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,700
did a reading for me,

433
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,770
a Tarot or something with coins.

434
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,010
She said my work is gonna have ups and downs,

435
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,380
and that'll be quite big.

436
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,660
What kind of friend?

437
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,290
A new girlfriend?

438
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,010
No,

439
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,940
it's still that one from last month.

440
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,250
You're like this everyday.

441
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,770
Can you not be so superstitious?

442
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,530
I know your little thoughts.

443
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,570
Du Jun left some time ago.

444
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,220
The position of the director has been vacant.

445
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,140
The media has been asking me,

446
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,980
and I don't even know how to answer them.

447
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,180
Ms. Zhou

448
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,900
has already clearly stated

449
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,900
that she's not interested in that position.

450
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,050
Right now, she's fully focused

451
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,010
on Jiang Rong's surgery.

452
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,730
She doesn't have the energy to care about this.

453
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,940
Right.

454
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,180
I'm taking this opportunity

455
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,900
to do some work with Tang.

456
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,490
What do you think? Who will be

457
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,420
the next owner of Du Jun's room?

458
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,730
Um...

459
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,530
Oh my God!

460
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,900
Oh my God!

461
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:29,860
Sit down.

462
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,770
This really is...

463
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,530
Look at your reaction.

464
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,570
I didn't want to tell you so soon.

465
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,730
I was afraid you'd go blabbering outside.

466
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,090
Yeah.

467
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,730
I've already made arrangements with the media friends.

468
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,770
Mr. Tang also agreed.

469
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,660
Within a month,

470
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,980
there will be an appointment ceremony for the new director.

471
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,530
We'll let people in the industry see

472
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,530
that even though Du Jun is gone,

473
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,730
Gemu will not collapse,

474
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,980
it will only get better.

475
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,980
Chen Xinhui,

476
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,290
how come it's you again?

477
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,460
You can actually recognize me?

478
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,700
Your eyes are sharp.

479
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,490
I specifically came to find you.

480
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,290
Why did you change to this hair department?

481
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,050
Yeah.

482
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,570
I came all the way here to avoid you.

483
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,730
But you can still find me.

484
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,090
Although you always reject me,

485
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,460
I've seen so many doctors,

486
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,940
but you're the most reliable.

487
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,180
But you never listen to me.

488
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,050
You went out and found other doctors, right?

489
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,420
But every time something goes wrong,

490
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,010
it's you who helps me fix it.

491
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,490
This time, I want to shave my jawbone

492
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,490
and also my chin.

493
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,810
Can you take a look for me?

494
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,330
Is this for your boyfriend again?

495
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,660
Don't mention it.

496
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,330
I know.

497
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,090
He told me that breaking up means he doesn't love me anymore.

498
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,700
Saying I'm fat and have a big face are just excuses.

499
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,180
So, I have to make myself look better and try again.

500
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,010
If it still can't be saved,

501
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,380
then it's fate.

502
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,090
I can move on.

503
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,380
A new life can start at any time, darling.

504
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,530
Why do you insist on fighting with your own face?

505
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,730
If he likes a sharp face, you shave your jawline.

506
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,330
But what if the next one likes a round face?

507
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,620
You'll come to me again

508
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,810
to get your jawbone back.

509
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,420
But I won't be able to find the original one.

510
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,860
I know.

511
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,810
But I've already gotten used to having him by my side.

512
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,460
I can't just let go.

513
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,220
Changing my face seems simpler.

514
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,220
I can't do it either.

515
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,380
Every time you wanna do something,

516
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,530
it's never for yourself.

517
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,140
It's always for your boyfriend.

518
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,420
Let me ask you,

519
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,940
what's your ideal man like?

520
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,090
Tony Leung.

521
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,900
He's so charming.

522
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:45,940
Alright.

523
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,940
When you have your next boyfriend,

524
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,860
bring him over.

525
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,290
I'll make him look like Tony Leung.

526
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,570
Then you can fulfill your own needs.

527
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,140
How nice.

528
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,620
But right now, I just want him.

529
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,250
I don't want Tony Leung.

530
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,900
Dr. Qiao, don't reject me.

531
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,980
You're the only one who can help me.

532
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,330
You're the best doctor.

533
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,380
Every time I meet someone I like, they leave me.

534
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,420
My fate is too bad.

535
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,250
I need to change it.

536
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,660
The problem is, I'm a plastic surgeon.

537
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,980
I'm not a God.

538
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,290
Plastic surgery can't change fate.

539
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,940
No matter how good the fate is, doesn't it still eventually end?

540
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,770
Sweetheart,

541
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,420
come.

542
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,290
Once you step out that door,

543
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,140
someone will definitely be willing to do it for you.

544
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,620
If you don't listen to me and still wanna do it,

545
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,980
don't come back to me afterward.

546
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,570
Alright?

547
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,490
Thanks. Bye!

548
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,010
Your burn

549
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,050
has reached the dermis.

550
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,660
Go to my office for a further examination.

551
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,980
Ms. Qiao,

552
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,220
braised pork.

553
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,460
The last serving is for you.

554
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,180
Put it on the table.

555
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,730
Don't steal any.

556
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,980
Rare to get a call from you.

557
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,220
I'll do the surgery myself.

558
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,250
The plan is still the same as before.

559
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,530
I thought you

560
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,090
were just a bit impatient,

561
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,050
but I didn't expect you to be so unaware of your own limits.

562
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,940
Three hours!

563
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,460
Are you joking?

564
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,050
You can't do it alone.

565
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,570
That's why I've been researching and reinforcing the plan.

566
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,460
I'll find a way to get it done well.

567
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,420
Thanks for your concern.

568
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,420
Stop being narcissistic.

569
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,250
I'm just reminding you out of good intentions.

570
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,220
Don't treat a patient's life like a joke

571
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,900
just because you want to show off.

572
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,490
Understood.

573
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,250
So, I need better advice.

574
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,620
If you have any,

575
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,250
I'd really appreciate it.

576
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,010
Zhou Jingwen, don't act recklessly.

577
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,660
You're gonna cause a big problem doing this.

578
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,570
Ms. Zhou,

579
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,980
I just went on rounds.

580
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,940
Jiang Rong is missing.

581
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,620
What do you mean by Jiang Rong is missing?

582
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,140
She sent me her home address.

583
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,330
I'm gonna check it out.

584
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,140
Hello?

585
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,460
Hello?

586
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:57,980
Auntie.

587
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,810
Leave.

588
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,530
We'll pay back the hospitalization fees.

589
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,180
She's already suffered enough.

590
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,770
Please, leave us alone.

591
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,380
Auntie,

592
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,140
Jiang Rong asked me to come.

593
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,420
Rong.

594
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,730
Rong!

595
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,380
She might have fallen asleep. I'll go check.

596
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,810
Rong!

597
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,290
Rong!

598
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,330
Where did she go?

599
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,420
She probably went to pick up the child.

600
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,180
Auntie,

601
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,530
can you call her?

602
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:37,980
Hello.

603
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,900
The number you dialed is powered off.

604
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,380
Why is it turned off?

605
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,570
It's turned off?

606
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,700
Where is the kindergarten?

607
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,010
Let's go home.

608
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,130
Mom said she'd come pick me up.

609
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,690
She must be busy.

610
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,650
Let's go home and wait.

611
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,380
Did mom go find brother?

612
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,980
Don't say that.

613
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,300
Mom!

614
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,820
Xin!

615
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:37,980
Xin!

616
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,570
Mom, I thought you weren't coming.

617
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,650
I'm sorry.

618
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,090
I won't do this again.

619
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,460
I'm sorry.

620
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,980
I won't do this again.

621
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,610
Dr. Qiao

622
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,420
probably never eats with patients before.

623
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,940
Today is an exception.

624
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,980
Sorry, Dr. Qiao.

625
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,860
Sorry for the trouble.

626
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,420
I'm sorry.

627
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,530
It's fine, sit.

628
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,210
Thank you.

629
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,460
You've really helped me a lot today.

630
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,010
Can she sit down?

631
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,300
I shouldn't have...

632
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,420
I was just kidding with you.

633
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,260
Sorry.

634
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,010
Sit down, please.

635
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,610
Alright.

636
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,090
What would you like to eat?

637
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,340
It's on her.

638
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,860
No, I'll treat you.

639
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,210
What would you like? It's on me.

640
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,090
Fine. My treat.

641
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,460
No, Dr. Qiao...

642
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,380
Please.

643
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,820
Let me.

644
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,780
Sit.

645
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,130
Mom!

646
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,490
Be careful!

647
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,980
It's okay, Xin.

648
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,780
Don't be scared.

649
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,170
I'm here.

650
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,690
Go to sleep.

651
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,210
Go to sleep.

652
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,780
Other people's kids...

653
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,490
are super happy when they hear their father coming home.

654
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,340
Our child...

655
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,210
Even if asleep, when they hear noise,

656
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,940
they still wake up.

657
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,900
Fei didn't like basketball.

658
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,130
He joined the basketball class

659
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,980
because the training time was long enough.

660
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,940
We could go home late.

661
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,380
Sometimes when it was hot,

662
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,900
the coach bought them ice pops.

663
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,940
Fei always let Xin have his.

664
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,460
But if Xin actually ate it,

665
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,210
he got upset and cried every time.

666
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,740
I think

667
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,090
these two kids must have chosen the wrong mom.

668
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,980
He not only hits me,

669
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,380
but when drunk, he even hits the kids.

670
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,610
I deserve it.

671
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,260
I accept the beating.

672
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,690
What did the kids do wrong?

673
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,740
A belt that thick hitting the child,

674
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,940
and I couldn't do anything...

675
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:54,980
I...

676
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,650
I...

677
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,650
I deserve to die.

678
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,980
I'm the one who should die!

679
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,130
No.

680
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,490
Living needs courage.

681
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,260
If you die,

682
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,170
won't that just help that bastard?

683
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:09,940
Yeah.

684
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,380
What's the use of crying?

685
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,780
Let me show you a comment.

686
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,260
Fei, who had an accident, was a student in my basketball class.

687
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,820
Every Tuesday, his mother accompanied him to class.

688
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,260
I believe his mother is a good person.

689
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,420
Because once, Fei told me

690
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,050
"I love Mom the most."

691
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,610
"She always protects us."

692
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,650
"I wanna protect her too."

693
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,650
Fei wants you to live well.

694
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,090
So stop crying.

695
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,210
Live well.

696
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,380
Xin,

697
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,300
take your feet down.

698
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,130
Don't get the car dirty.

699
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,490
It's fine, just let her lie down and sleep.

700
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,340
I'm sorry.

701
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,170
From today onwards,

702
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,460
stop saying sorry.

703
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,420
Understood.

704
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,420
No "understood" either.

705
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,130
Alright, I got it.

706
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,170
Then what should I say?

707
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,940
Straighten your back.

708
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,650
Be yourself.

709
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,490
You don't need to bow down to anyone.

710
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,490
Okay, sure.

711
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,340
Thank you.

712
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,860
Oh my god.

713
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,210
As women,

714
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,340
do we just love to criticize ourselves?

715
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,940
What's there to criticize?

716
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,300
If we're wrong, we can just start over.

717
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,980
If life could truly start over from the beginning,

718
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,300
how wonderful would that be?

719
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,860
Then let's start with the surgery.

720
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,490
So, you agreed?

721
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,530
Munich University.

722
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,090
That's a good school.

723
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:26,940
It's a good one, yeah.

724
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,650
But it was very cold there.

725
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,610
The food was awful.

726
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,130
Do you want an Americano or a latte?

727
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,860
Neither.

728
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,820
I'm used to going to bed early.

729
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,090
Are you on the Rongchuan Forum too?

730
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,170
Yeah.

731
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,900
Your presentation on the asymmetry correction plan for short stature deformity

732
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,050
was really good.

733
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,260
My patient is recovering really well.

734
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,940
You guys do that kind of surgery?

735
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,420
In the private hospital,

736
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,980
we can do more than you think.

737
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,210
So, how about we start?

738
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,090
I have one condition.

739
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,570
You can't reveal my name.

740
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,210
Why?

741
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,420
Can you agree to that?

742
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:09,740
Sure.

743
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,210
I don't lose anything.

744
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,490
Let's do it.

745
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,050
Come.

746
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,740
Please wait here.

747
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,490
Mom...

748
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,650
Xin.

749
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,210
It's okay.

750
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,130
Stay with grandma.

751
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,460
I'll come out in a bit.

752
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,420
Be good.

753
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,380
Mom.

754
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,490
You even set up a countdown.

755
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,900
Trying to bluff?

756
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,570
People who don't know might think we're disposing of a bomb.

757
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,900
Right, the bomb is under the operating table.

758
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,530
If we don't finish in three hours,

759
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,010
we'll go down together.

760
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,530
Are you ready?

761
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,650
Don't worry about me.

762
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,940
As long as you don't hold me back.
