1
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,210
What are you doing here?

2
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,380
The 5G project doesn't proceed well.

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,210
Why are you dressed like you're going to a red carpet event?

4
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,410
Have you won an award for acting?

5
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,620
It seems you have watched my live stream.

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,290
Back to how it was fifteen years ago.

7
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,260
How can you say such nonsense.

8
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,740
Whether it's five years younger or fifteen years younger,

9
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,410
Isn't it all a matter of perspective?

10
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,820
Relying on makeup or today's technology.

11
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,980
Getting twenty years younger is not

12
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,260
a problem either.

13
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,980
Her son is the only thing matters to her.

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,660
Oh, that's what parents do.

15
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,170
Plastic surgery cannot solve her life issues.

16
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,340
It can't fix a broken relationship.

17
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,690
Zhang Zhe left home as an adult.

18
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,660
Who can stop him if he wants to go home?

19
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,340
He must have a reason for still drifting outside.

20
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,100
There is nothing to do with

21
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,850
how many wrinkles Liu Xinfang has

22
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,170
on her face.

23
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,130
Why deceive yourself?

24
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,260
As a doctor,

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,660
we have no way to

26
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,100
change the fate of patients.

27
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,980
But choices can be made.

28
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,410
Studying medicine is one choice.

29
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,570
Getting married and having children is also a choice,

30
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,450
and plastic surgery is her choice.

31
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,980
How do you know weather this choice

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,410
will change her or not?

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,570
I actually think

34
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,940
the changes you made

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,380
have really made you look like a celebrity.

36
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,170
Thank you.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,660
Goodbye.

38
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,660
That's right.

39
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,730
Yes, yes, yes.

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,980
Drink more tonight.

41
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,690
Has she arrived?

42
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,820
Ms. Zhou is here.

43
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,610
Mr. Du,.

44
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,380
Congratulations.

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,850
You are so remarkable even working in Jiao Ai.

46
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,500
Ms. Zhou, let me tell you.

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,130
Starting a business

48
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,410
is so damn hard.

49
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:30,850
Right?

50
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,980
I only understand now.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,540
How difficult it was for you back then.

52
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,980
We must toast.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,660
Yes, yes, yes.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,890
Let's toast. For all these years staying at Gemu,

55
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,220
I've learned quite a lot.

56
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,100
I really feel grateful.

57
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,940
Alright, alright, alright

58
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,500
Come here.

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,890
Is that how you show gratitude with that little wine?

60
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,660
Come on.

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,850
Fill it up.

62
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,940
That's enough.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,100
Since I have learned so much from Gemu,

64
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,410
no more copyright fees.

65
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,010
Let's do it.

66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,500
Come on.

67
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,220
Sure.

68
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,570
That will be it.

69
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,660
Mr. Qin is here.

70
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,570
Ms. Zhou has to perform a surgery tomorrow.

71
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,890
So she can't drink too much.

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,410
That's right. She can't.

73
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,540
Let's drink.

74
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,380
Excuse me

75
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,850
Sure.

76
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,450
Take your time.

77
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,410
Let's drink another day.

78
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,100
It's almost time.

79
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,730
Can we go back now?

80
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,100
I didn't plan to go back.

81
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,500
If you want to go back, go by yourself.

82
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,690
I'm drinking happily.

83
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:17,900
On the way here,

84
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,780
I came across a public account article on my phone,

85
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,580
titled 'Family Emotional Abuse'.

86
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,020
Both spouses are victims.

87
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,140
So,

88
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,020
in order to prevent further harm to both parties,

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,220
shouldn't we have a chat?

90
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,020
Do you think it is suitable to talk about couple matters

91
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,580
on such occasions?

92
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,170
Drink more.

93
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,660
This is too much.

94
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,370
Excuse me, may I interrupt you two?

95
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,930
Ms. Li asked me to help you both take a photo together.

96
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,780
Will that do?

97
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,220
Come on, fill it up.

98
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,340
Fine.

99
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,140
Ok.

100
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,140
Then please come this way.

101
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,900
Sure.

102
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,100
Come, let me help you with that.

103
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,220
Your tie is misplaced.

104
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,980
Okay.

105
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,490
Handsome.

106
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,250
You wanna talk, right?

107
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,810
Let's talk right here.

108
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,140
Honey, I don't know why

109
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,540
our communication has become so difficult now.

110
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,810
I don't understand why you're angry.

111
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,780
I just suggested a

112
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,020
solution to the problem.

113
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,290
Yeah.

114
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,700
You're always solving problems.

115
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,540
Shouldn't I?

116
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,660
Is it okay not to solve problems?

117
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,170
What exactly is the problem?

118
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,050
You don't want me to be the dean.

119
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,700
And that's the biggest problem.

120
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,050
Jingwen,

121
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,140
I know the biggest problem we have now

122
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,460
is not that you want to be the director,

123
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,340
but your lack of sense of security.

124
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,610
If you don't trust them,

125
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,170
I hope you can trust me.

126
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,610
Trust your husband.

127
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,250
Now Mr. Chu and Qiao Yang have both joined us.

128
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,370
Plastic surgery department is all right now.

129
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,780
Even if Li Qi

130
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,290
has different views on business philosophy,

131
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,930
she can't stir up much of a storm.

132
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,660
You don't need to be so defensive.

133
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,370
Right?

134
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,660
Who is being so defensive anyway?

135
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,490
You're not happy when I work overtime.

136
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,020
You're also not happy when I go on a business trip.

137
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,170
I want to be the director now.

138
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,980
Will you support me?

139
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,170
If I were the kind of person

140
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,410
who doesn't support my wife in her career,

141
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,980
I wouldn't have built this hospital in the first place.

142
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,980
It's not you who built this hospital.

143
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,220
This hospital

144
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,780
was our shared ideal from the beginning.

145
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,730
Have you forgotten?

146
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,780
Your biggest ideal right now

147
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,580
is for me to go back with you and have children.

148
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,220
Jingwen, have you ever thought about that

149
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,340
actually,

150
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,460
I also need a sense of security.

151
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,850
Auntie, what about me now?

152
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,780
I have prepared three pillboxes for you..

153
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,930
Remember to take your medicine in the morning, at noon, and in the evening.

154
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,220
If it hurts too much, just add one of these.

155
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:51,930
Ms. Li.

156
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,170
I asked the nurse to help you with that.

157
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,290
Thank you!

158
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,250
Take a picture over there in a while.

159
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,780
It's ready over there.

160
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,980
You must take the medicine on time.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,780
If you do so,

162
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,100
you will recover soon.

163
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,100
Don't forget it.

164
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,220
I am Zhang Zhe.

165
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,660
Zhang Zhe.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,900
It's me, Mom

167
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,340
Son.

168
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,340
Mom.

169
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,780
My son.

170
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,660
Mom finally sees you.

171
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:27,930
Mom.

172
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,100
You finally came back.

173
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,580
Mom.

174
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,650
Where have you been all these years?

175
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,530
Mom misses you so much.

176
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,220
I miss you too.

177
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,420
Why did you come back now?

178
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,460
Mom misses you so much.

179
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,250
Mom.

180
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,940
My son.

181
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,980
You finally came back.

182
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,300
Mom.

183
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,420
Where have you been for so long?

184
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,220
Wow, a lost child is easy to find, right?

185
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,610
What a coincidence.

186
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,250
Even TV dramas wouldn't dare to write this.

187
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,300
Well, our operation of this surgery has gone viral.

188
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,610
The power of the internet is very strong.

189
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,420
Liu Xinfang has already acknowledged it.

190
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,890
How could she not recognize her own child?

191
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,180
Given the current situation,

192
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,370
the dean must be Ms. Zhou.

193
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,130
Dr. Chen.

194
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,530
Stay low-key.

195
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,100
It's not settled yet.

196
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,530
Ms. Qiao once rejected

197
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,060
a batch of lower blepharoplasty patients.

198
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,100
Later, those patients came.

199
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,730
On the contrary, they wanted Ms. Qiao to perform the surgery.

200
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,370
Really?

201
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,610
And Qi Dacheng's face transplant surgery

202
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,180
has boosted her reputation more.

203
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,300
What do patients care about?

204
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,980
What?

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,060
The doctors.

206
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,610
That's right.

207
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,250
So you mean that

208
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,770
Dr. Qiao stands a greater chance.

209
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,130
I don't know.

210
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,130
The 5G remote robot project

211
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,890
that you are working on

212
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,060
is still hanging in the air.

213
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,220
If in any chance,

214
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,850
it fails.

215
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,890
It will backfire.

216
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,980
See?

217
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,610
She got nothing to refute me.

218
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,420
Why is Dr. Wei angry again?

219
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,610
Dr. Chen has got used to it.

220
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,180
Honestly

221
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,060
whether it's Dr. Zhou or Dr. Qiao,

222
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,300
neither stands a chance.

223
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,980
Our department's performance can't win.

224
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,490
Performance talks.

225
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,340
What's with the pout?

226
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,890
If you won't join,

227
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,370
there is no need for sarcasm.

228
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,820
I'm just being realistic.

229
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,730
That project is too risky.

230
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,010
If you pull it off,

231
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,370
I will celebrate it for you first.

232
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,300
Sure, Mr. Rational.

233
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,650
You can even eject the 5G robot.

234
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,610
Now you call yourself a geek?

235
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,700
I guess that

236
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,980
you don't want the drone for your birthday.

237
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,300
You remembered?

238
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,060
Buy it yourself.

239
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,250
What are you staring at?

240
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,220
Chen Mingjie, get back here!

241
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,130
Wang Qian, that ingrate,

242
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,010
stopped reporting to me recently.

243
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,770
He must be charmed by Qiao Yang.

244
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,010
“Charmed”?

245
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,650
I asked Wang Qian to assist Dr. Qiao

246
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,300
since she is new here,

247
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,420
and her help as much as he can.

248
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,530
So you don't even

249
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,730
keep up with this 5G robot project, right?

250
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,650
I'm not a doctor.

251
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,010
How would I understand?

252
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,250
What nonsense!

253
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,580
Young people these days

254
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,220
have no curiosity

255
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,890
about the world.

256
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,420
I remember that You have a college degree.

257
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,220
I have never got one myself.

258
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,530
Yet here I am, lecturing you as my subordinate. Do you know why?

259
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,850
Because from the first day I was out there working,

260
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,060
whatever job I am doing,

261
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,250
I never let anything I encounter

262
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,340
stays a mystery.

263
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,130
Ever heard the saying that,

264
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,370
“Enter a treasure mountain and leave empty-handed”?

265
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,700
Ask! Learn!

266
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,730
Steal knowledge if needed!

267
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,940
Or use the internet!

268
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,650
Or you'll be the first to get axed.

269
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,980
You are just lazing around

270
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,180
and wasting your time.

271
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,850
Is Ms. Gao here?

272
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,180
She is in the next room.

273
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,300
We're ready to start.

274
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,530
Hurry.

275
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,130
Get more close-ups!

276
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,940
You look good.

277
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,530
Have you taken your meds today?

278
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,730
It'll help recovery.

279
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,370
Sitting like this also

280
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,820
reduces swelling.

281
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,220
Like I said,

282
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,730
everything will get better.

283
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,370
Relax.

284
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,130
Thank you, Dr. Zhou.

285
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,340
Another surprise.

286
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,010
You told me before that you love to sing, right?

287
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,460
Guess who's here?

288
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,300
This way.

289
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,460
Dr. Chen.

290
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,490
No, it's not me.

291
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,490
Hello.

292
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,180
Oh my god.

293
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,580
Ms. Gao.

294
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,370
No need to get up!

295
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,490
Is it really you?

296
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,340
Yeah.

297
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,100
After hearing your story,

298
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,250
I had to come.

299
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,460
You're so brave.

300
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,490
"A mother's love makes her strong".

301
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,340
You have embodied that.

302
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,980
This must be Zhang Zhe?

303
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,130
Hello, Ms Gao.

304
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,370
Young man.

305
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,490
You should take good care of your mom.

306
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,100
I will. Thank you.

307
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,940
I can't believe that

308
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,180
they got you here.

309
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,300
I'm Dr. Zhou's patient.

310
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,300
Years ago, a car accident

311
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,940
broke my nose.

312
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,820
The initial treatment didn't go well.

313
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,300
Thanks to Dr. Zhou, I can.

314
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,980
What is happening? Wang Yibo is here?

315
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,490
Gao Yalan—Ms. Gao is inside.

316
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,340
See how well I've recovered?

317
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,530
Can't tell, right?

318
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,850
Yes.

319
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,940
I have just watched your show on TV

320
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,700
last month.

321
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,370
Really?

322
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,730
Zhang Zhe.

323
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,180
You like singing, too. Right?

324
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,060
A pro is here.

325
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,300
Don't flatter me.

326
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,490
Ms. Gao.

327
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,340
I've studied vocal music before.

328
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,700
I can play guitar well.

329
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,730
And I have also published several songs.

330
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,130
Please get in.

331
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,700
You've got potential. Relax.

332
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,340
You can just leave medical issues to Dr. Zhou.

333
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,060
As for your music career,

334
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,700
you can come to me.

335
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,890
Don't be shy.

336
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,300
Thank you!

337
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,250
Thank you, Ms. Gao.

338
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,770
Never mind.

339
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,610
Thank you!

340
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,370
Thank you!

341
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,130
Changing the fish tank water

342
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,250
must be a hassle.

343
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,770
I got no time for that.

344
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,820
Qing is caring them all the time.

345
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,850
They are lucky fish.

346
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,890
I often get new ones

347
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,490
from the market.

348
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,700
There is always something new in the market.

349
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,130
Look at this.

350
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,940
that black one with red edges.

351
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,130
It's always alone

352
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,100
and doesn't vie for food.

353
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,060
I just thought that

354
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,700
it can't make it to this month.

355
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,530
But it proves that I am wrong.

356
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,820
Less eating guarantees longevity.

357
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,340
Maybe it will live longer than others.

358
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,340
Fish keeping is like parenting.

359
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,890
It doesn't matter how you cure them,

360
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,420
but how you prevent them from falling ill.

361
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,730
This tank is pricey.

362
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,980
It can't accommodate too many fish at a time.

363
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,340
It can't contain too many big ones.

364
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,940
The water temperature. flow and quality

365
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,610
should all be well managed.

366
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,300
You just said you are not interested in raising fish.

367
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,180
But you know everything.

368
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,530
I am indeed not interested,

369
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,420
but that doesn't mean I have to stop getting to know them.

370
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,220
Come.

371
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,820
Let's have some tea.

372
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,770
I'm planning to talk to you anyway.

373
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,010
That robot is too large.

374
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,770
You can't just

375
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,370
always push it around the hospital.

376
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,250
That's crazy.

377
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,370
It looks like a Transformer set.

378
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,250
Mr. Qin

379
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,370
shouldn't just let you handle it alone.

380
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,980
The 5G tele-operation is a big project.

381
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,890
Everyone should do their part for it.

382
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,730
Mr. Qin has already funded us.

383
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,940
He shall not be bothered by these trivial things.

384
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,580
Come on.

385
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,890
We can just talk about it in the meeting.

386
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,610
Black tea or Longjing tea?

387
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,460
Whatever you get me.

388
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,220
I' m both fine.

389
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,220
Is the date scheduled?

390
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,180
Please keep me informed.

391
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,130
So I can send those young people

392
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,370
to learn something.

393
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,650
They are fooling around.

394
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,100
They don't even know

395
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,100
the current situation of the project.

396
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,820
You are quite interested.

397
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,130
I have to.

398
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,850
The era we are living in

399
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,820
is so horrible.

400
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,370
New things keep coming.

401
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,220
I'm so happy that you can be here.

402
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,610
You have brought us a lot fresh ideas.

403
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,530
Not flattery.

404
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,890
I do think that

405
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,650
the medicine aesthetics industry really needs people

406
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,250
as visionary and ambitious as you.

407
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,060
I do have a vision of

408
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,370
how good your tea will be.

409
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,180
Right?

410
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,700
Ms. Li from Li Ge gave it to me.

411
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,290
She told me that

412
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,570
an entire tea hill can only

413
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,530
produce a small bag of it.

414
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,980
Take it if you like.

415
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,180
I will ask her to get me more later.

416
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,050
I appreciate it. But no.

417
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,220
That's too good for me.

418
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,730
Grape is enough for me.

419
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,250
My biggest flaw I think

420
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,220
is my crazy pursuit of talents.

421
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,620
Since you have joined us,

422
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,730
we have never talked.

423
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,810
Today,

424
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,900
I have to win you over.

425
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,290
Training a doctor’s tough.

426
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,460
You have to go through medical school, PhD,

427
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,980
training, residency and a lot

428
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,460
which will take at least 15 years.

429
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,250
Not to mention talents like you,

430
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,810
who have got this far

431
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,090
by performing operations to gain reputation.

432
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,660
That's really amazing.

433
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,050
My duty

434
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,770
is to make sure that

435
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,730
every doctor here can fully exert their talent.

436
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,770
Good to hear that.

437
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,050
Then I shall tell you directly.

438
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,980
I have met many obstacles

439
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,900
in promoting the 5G tele-operation

440
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,530
in our hospital.

441
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,810
I don't have any other interests

442
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,290
but a perfect operation.

443
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,380
But recently I notice that

444
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,810
there is something troublesome

445
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,250
unrelated to surgery

446
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,330
bothering me a lot.

447
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,810
That's quite annoying.

448
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,330
So I come to you today,

449
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,420
hoping that you can support me.

450
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,900
I understand.

451
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,940
Then you shall get my support.

452
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,090
That's great!

453
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,980
But there is a string attached.

454
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,660
You have to answer me a question.

455
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,530
What's that?

456
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,530
You had a stable job at the Third Hospital,

457
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,660
and you are so excellent.

458
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,380
Why did you choose us?

459
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,570
Maybe it's because the salary,

460
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,490
cute guys here,

461
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,660
and the 5G tele-operation.

462
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,620
So I am here.

463
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,460
All right, it's the time.

464
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,980
Time for surgery.

465
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,290
Keep pushing for the project!

466
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,050
Professor Chu.

467
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,180
Dr. Zhou says you're her mentor,

468
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,530
a legend in this field.

469
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,140
I'm honored

470
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,810
that you're treating me.

471
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,980
Thank you.

472
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,140
Don't believe them.

473
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,700
This is just my job.

474
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,290
I'm also a fan of yours.

475
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,860
When HongKong was recovered in 1997,

476
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,660
you performed at our military compound.

477
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,460
We have taken a photo together.

478
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,620
Really?

479
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,250
You wouldn't remember.

480
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,860
It was a long time ago.

481
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,420
Times change.

482
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,420
Relax.

483
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,050
When I was young,

484
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,900
I have won every award.

485
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,810
But now,

486
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,900
I was eliminated in two rounds on The Voice.

487
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,220
I know it myself that

488
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,490
I am just a stepping stone for kids.

489
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,530
But I still can't accept it.

490
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,620
All right, relax now.

491
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,860
People nowadays have taste for art.

492
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,090
They only care about appearance.

493
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,860
"Countenance matters" as it's used

494
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,180
in the catchy words today.

495
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,250
People always say that,

496
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,050
singer may get older,

497
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,250
but the fans will always remain young.

498
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,330
That's right.

499
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,220
The same is true of my job.

500
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,860
People aesthetics are evolving every year.

501
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,050
If I were young ladies,

502
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,570
I will also choose Zhou to perform operation on me.

503
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,420
You really have a light heart.

504
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,940
You have taught me a lesson.

505
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,730
We should never

506
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,860
take ourselves too seriously.

507
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,770
When I just retired,

508
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,940
I felt low as well.

509
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,420
No matter how great you are,

510
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,810
you are an ordinary person after all.

511
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,490
The higher people place you,

512
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,140
the more arrogant you will be.

513
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,380
And when that happens, all you hear will be lies.

514
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,010
You won't have any real friends.

515
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,250
You will just live your life alone,

516
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,050
like a statue.

517
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,090
That kind of life is meaningless.

518
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,940
Look at me now.

519
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,940
Doing something

520
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,660
within my capacity

521
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,660
not only pleases you

522
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,420
but also makes me happy.

523
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,660
I really need to think about

524
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,940
what you just said.

525
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,730
Yeah, you can think about it now,

526
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,810
but don't frown.

527
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,490
Can I check it now?

528
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,330
Here, the mirror.

529
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,770
Well, let me see.

530
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,250
Isn't that better now?

531
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,010
Well. it really is.

532
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,090
The hyaluronic acid

533
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,180
is injected into the bone layer.

534
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,660
You might feel odd

535
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,180
at first,

536
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,290
but that feeling will disappear

537
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,140
in weeks.

538
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,180
Well.

539
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,050
A face lift would hurt more, right?

540
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,620
Liu Xinfang is so amazing.

541
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,180
She can even stand that pain.

542
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,660
That's understandable.

543
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,860
That's all for her son.

544
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,620
Her son of my ass.

545
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,420
That's not her son.

546
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,770
It's just a show.

547
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,420
They may fool you.

548
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,330
But not me.

549
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,180
I've been in this field too long. That's easy to identify.

550
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,010
(Zhang Zhe.)

551
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,900
(If you are watching this,)

552
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,900
(please come home.)

553
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,420
(I miss you a lot.)

554
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,860
(Auntie, don't be sad.)

555
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,530
(You will find your son someday.)

556
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,330
(We will try our best to help you.)

557
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,940
(Can you express your desire again?)

558
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,730
(Regret now?)

559
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,290
(That's too late.)

560
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,700
(I'm wondering)

561
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,050
(were they amicable like this)

562
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,730
(when Zhang Zhe was still at home?)

563
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,570
(That's right.)

564
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,380
(The miserable deserve their misery.)

565
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,050
(No parents are perfect.)

566
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,860
(They are not saints. They will make mistakes.)

567
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,250
(Even if they had disputes before,)

568
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,860
(but they still love their kids.)

569
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,530
(Don't be too hard on parents.)

570
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,620
(You are family.)

571
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,660
(Let's see.)

572
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,050
(Will any normal person)

573
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,940
(abandon their parents?)

574
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,940
(From this day on,)

575
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,180
(no more guitar.)

576
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,050
(What did I do to deserve you,)

577
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,140
(a good-for-nothing kid.)

578
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,250
(You are meant to get nowhere.)

579
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,420
(Do you have any idea that)

580
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,140
(if you are to be admitted to a college.)

581
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,660
(I will support you to play anything you want)

582
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,330
(not to mention the guitar.)

583
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,140
(You wanna leave this family, right?)

584
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,810
(Then go.)

585
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,770
(If you dare to go, you shall never come back.)

586
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,420
(What if they still)

587
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,530
(refuse to acknowledge their fault,)

588
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,940
(and try to find the son in such a way,)

589
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,660
(it only proves that they only love themselves.)

590
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,530
(Zhang Zhe has already forgiven his parents.)

591
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,180
(What are you doing here?)

592
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,220
(You should)

593
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,660
(tell your own parents this crap.)

594
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,900
Is that really her son?

595
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,380
Are you talking to me?

596
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,490
Come on.

597
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,380
Everyone in the hospital knows

598
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,010
that kid is a fake one.

599
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,420
You know that, don't you?

600
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,140
He needs a home.

601
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,620
Liu Xinfang needs a son.

602
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,180
And I need a touching story.

603
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,420
A story associated with the surgery.

604
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,940
That's it.

605
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,290
Own up to your lies.

606
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,090
Why wouldn't I?

607
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,810
Happy mother and son.

608
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,380
That's a perfect ending.

609
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,290
Perfect?

610
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,810
Her husband didn't look thrilled

611
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,900
when he saw his "son".

612
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,900
Again.

613
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,290
You're a doctor, not God.

614
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,660
You can't fix ger life.

615
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,220
Dr. Qiao, a word?

616
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,090
Wait a minute.

617
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,140
What now?

618
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,250
Well.

619
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,860
The company called

620
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,620
they want to accelerate the surgery date.

621
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,900
So can you just

622
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,250
perform this operation earlier?

623
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,090
What do you think the operation is?

624
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,420
A game?

625
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,250
Ms. Qiao.

626
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,660
I'm under great pressure now.

627
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,220
If we can't make any progress,

628
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,090
they will call it off.

629
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,620
Here, eat a chicken leg.

630
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,900
So you can keep working.

631
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,900
I want that, too.

632
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,810
Go get it yourself.

633
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,050
I wanna get it from you.

634
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,660
Well then you have to be as good as Xi.

635
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,980
I know you are pursuing perfection.

636
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,050
You've finished

637
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,380
more than 300 operations on double eyelids.

638
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,090
I believe you can do it with your eyes closed.

639
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,090
Well, that's too much.

640
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,810
Can you show us how to do it?

641
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,730
Surgery starting.

642
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,140
What are you doing?

643
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,770
Having a stroke?

644
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,860
Careful. I'll practice on you.

645
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,980
Why the long face?

646
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,730
You just did well.

647
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,980
Just enjoy your meal.

648
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,460
No more comforting words.

649
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,700
I have seen you guys chatting there.

650
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,290
They wanna replace me, right?

651
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,220
No.

652
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,530
I have practiced it many times.

653
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,700
I can do it.

654
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,220
But I'm kind of nervous

655
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,700
when there are too many people watching.

656
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,980
You must be very nervous.

657
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,090
I swear

658
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,570
that will never happen again.

659
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,700
No, you have to do.

660
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,770
If not, how can you conduct a perfect surgery?

661
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,900
Nervousness is not your enemy.

662
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,660
We tend to classify

663
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,220
nervousness, fear and frustration

664
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,380
as negative emotions.

665
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,330
But they can be transformed into

666
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,860
our weapon.

667
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,180
You see.

668
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,570
Our ancestors survived predators

669
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,940
when they were in jungles,

670
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,530
thanks to nervousness.

671
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,090
When disaster comes,

672
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,810
human will instinctively

673
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,660
perform the action of avoidance.

674
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,900
When the critical moments draw closer,

675
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,900
nervousness will make our brain thrilled,

676
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,380
so that we are highly focused

677
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,460
and become more innovative.

678
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,980
So.

679
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,330
Nervousness is the key factor that

680
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,380
stimulates people's potential.

681
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,770
What if I'm too nervous,

682
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,900
and I have that nervousness affecting my operation.

683
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,900
That's because

684
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,330
you consider nervousness as your enemy in your heart.

685
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,180
So you become absent-minded.

686
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,980
How can you focus on the operation then.

687
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,250
That's right.

688
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,980
I do notice that sometimes the more nervous you are,

689
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,090
the worse you may perform even if you are good at it.

690
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,220
As your tutor. Here is a trick.

691
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,050
Next time you're stressed,

692
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,810
take a breath

693
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,050
and say:

694
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,290
Great, I'm nervous!

695
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,330
With that baby,

696
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,700
I can surely finish the surgery.

697
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,140
What did you say?

698
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,380
God you didn't hear it.

699
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,330
All right. I have wasted my breath.

700
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,770
You just said you are my tutor.

701
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,860
Did I?

702
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,730
You did.

703
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,900
You said as your tutor.

704
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,940
Well, like you said.

705
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,180
I'm gonna do more practice now since I'm still nervous.

706
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,460
Here, the chicken leg.

707
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,860
Oh you foodie.

708
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,700
Go practice with her.

709
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,420
I'm not nervous.

710
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,730
Well you should be.

711
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,810
Is that trick really useful?

712
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,810
If so, I wanna give a try next time.

713
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,730
How the hell I know. I just made it up.

714
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,530
I'm nervous anyway.

715
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,810
What?

716
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,900
But all that talking.

717
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,460
The theory things, so you just made it up?

718
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,530
Well,

719
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,180
that's what I have learned from the book.

720
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,860
You are a terrible tutor.

721
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,900
An unreliable one.

722
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,860
Then let me give a real trick.

723
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,900
You will get nervous when you're afraid of loss.

724
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,810
And you will be relaxed if you wanna win.

725
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,490
What?

726
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,900
Ms. Qiao.

727
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,660
The chicken leg

728
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,290
has really done it part.

729
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,570
Oh, you freak me out.

730
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,250
Mr. Chen.

731
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,980
Tomorrow is the last animal trial.

732
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,420
Please make arrangements.

733
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,330
All right, I'm on it.

734
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,050
God.

735
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,380
It totally freaks me out.

736
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,330
Are you still nervous now?

737
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,460
No.

738
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,180
But I was nervous at first.

739
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,660
But Ms. Qiao.

740
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,900
I have used your trick.

741
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,620
I was thinking that

742
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,180
with this trick

743
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,330
I can definitely perform well.

744
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,380
I'm not nervous at all.

745
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,980
Well. Keep going.

746
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,290
Don't be too proud.

747
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:09,940
Sure.

748
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,250
Auntie.

749
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,570
Where is your son?

750
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,730
You know, weekends.

751
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,700
They are always busy.

752
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,570
Yeah.

753
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,620
Did you have a good sleep?

754
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,330
You should have because your stitches will be removed later.

755
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,180
How is Zhang Zhe still not here?

756
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,220
He should be here now.

757
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,980
Come, let's talk inside.

758
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:36,980
Auntie.

759
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,860
After being with him for several days,

760
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,730
have you noticed any differences?

761
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,180
Is he in the middle of something now?

762
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,380
Can you call him?

763
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,010
Calm down.

764
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,290
He asked me to tell you something.

765
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,980
He told me that he had a great time with you these days.

766
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,660
He was so happy.

767
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,660
But he also felt guilty

768
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,980
because he is not Zhang Zhe.

769
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,460
He is just a kid with similar experience of Zhang Zhe.

770
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,810
What do you mean?

771
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,090
I don't understand.

772
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,250
He

773
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,860
left his mom after a quarrel when he was young.

774
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,660
Then his mom passed away.

775
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,140
He never got to see her again.

776
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,700
He was so regretful.

777
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,730
When he watched our live streaming,

778
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,660
he said he shared same feeling with you,

779
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,140
so he came here to see you.

780
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,250
Auntie.

781
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,700
He says sorry.

782
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,570
He shouldn't lie to you.

783
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,980
Don't worry.

784
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,660
We still got time.

785
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,940
We will find your son eventually.

786
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,980
No need for that now.

787
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,660
I have found my son.

788
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,940
Stop that nonsense.

789
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,810
Zhang Zhe will be sad when he arrives.

790
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,940
Auntie.

791
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,250
Remember to take your medicine.

792
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,180
What medicine?

793
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,660
You ask me to take medicine everyday.

794
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,810
But I am not sick.

795
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,420
You're a liar!

796
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,810
You promised me to find my son.

797
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,980
Now he is here.

798
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,980
I think he is my real son.

799
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,330
Who dare you doubt me?

800
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,220
Auntie.

801
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,490
What right do you have to send him away?

802
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,330
Auntie.

803
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,420
Calm down.

804
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,530
Your wound is not healed yet.

805
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,770
He is my son.

806
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,530
He is Zhang Zhe.

807
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,250
Go get my son back.

808
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,700
I…

809
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,220
Go.

810
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,420
Zhang Zhe.

811
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,380
You won't be so unfeeling.

812
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,730
I have never let you suffer

813
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,460
since you were born.

814
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,770
What did I do wrong?

815
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,140
I just wanna see you,

816
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,940
hear your voice again.

817
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,660
After all these waiting,

818
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,380
we reunited.

819
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,330
But you left me again.

820
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,140
Are you punishing me?

821
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,530
Then what's the meaning of

822
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,050
doing all of these?

823
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,860
Don't tear it off, auntie.

824
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,490
Don't bite me.

825
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,620
Loose.

826
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,900
Loose.

827
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,290
Let go of me.

828
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,900
Give my son back.

829
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,180
What to do now?

830
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,090
Many people are waiting for the updates now.

831
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,180
We have already started it.

832
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,650
We have to finish it.

833
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,130
Fine.

834
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,780
Anything you want.

835
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,260
Just let me know.

836
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,420
I have noticed

837
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,050
a weird comment before.

838
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,210
This one

839
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,420
named drifting guitar.

840
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,740
Can parents abuse and beat children willfully

841
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,460
in the name of love?

842
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,210
That's ironic though.

843
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,490
The plastic surgeon

844
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,570
can help people change their faces.

845
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,300
But faces

846
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,170
that are etched in people's heart

847
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,530
are hard to be changed.

848
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,010
Well. I will handle the life streaming.

849
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,740
You should take care of the patient.

850
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,530
Drifting guitar.

851
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,740
Drifting guitar.

852
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,380
Let's see.

853
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,610
Don't speak now.

854
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,170
Your face is still swollen.

855
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,650
Once muscle tension eases,

856
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,420
you can move you tongue freely.

857
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,570
You can not only say thanks but also sing.

858
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,530
All right. Calm down.

859
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,900
Calm down.

860
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,490
Dacheng.

861
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,820
Can you close your mouth now?

862
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,820
Have a try.

863
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,090
Come. Let me help you.

864
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,650
Try harder.

865
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,380
Ok. Open the mouth.

866
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,740
One.

867
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,740
One.

868
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,420
That's not enough.

869
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,490
His face is still stiff now.

870
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,050
You see. He is drooling.

871
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,980
Right.

872
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,900
Where is his family?

873
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,740
Where is his family?

874
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,460
I can't leave now.

875
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,570
He has to stay in the hospital.

876
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,740
Family member of Qi Dacheng.

877
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,820
Come on.

878
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,740
The doctor is calling you.

879
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,980
Come on.

880
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,460
I will call you back later.

881
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,130
Come on.

882
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,340
Come here.

883
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,490
His face is still stiff now.

884
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,900
You have to help him

885
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,460
do some exercise to activate his facial muscle.

886
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,380
In about 2 months,

887
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,380
when the facial nerves heal,

888
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,090
he will be able to make expressions.

889
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,210
I know.

890
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,050
Doc.

891
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,610
When can he be discharged?

892
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,530
His condition is not stable.

893
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,900
He has to stay here a little longer.

894
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,530
Even if he is discharged later,

895
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,130
you have to make him

896
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,130
take anti-rejection meds daily.

897
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,170
I know.

898
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,940
Don't worry.

899
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,740
It will be fine.

900
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,420
Don't worry.

901
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,900
Why are you sitting here?

902
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,820
I'm fine.

903
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,420
Just wanna sit here and have a rest.

904
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,300
Hurt anywhere?

905
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,420
Does it hurt?

906
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,570
Shall we go to the hospital?

907
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,860
No.

908
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,650
I'm a doctor myself.

909
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,570
I have already handled it well.

910
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,130
I'm fine.

911
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,940
You can't drive now.

912
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,900
I will send you home.

913
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,090
Oh you.

914
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,050
When such things happen next time,

915
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,940
you have to protect yourself first.

916
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,380
I heard that

917
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,490
you didn't even dodge.

918
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,980
If she really hurt your hands badly,

919
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,860
how can you perform operations again?

920
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,380
Liu Xinfang is also a poor woman.

921
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,530
With all these efforts, she only got a fake son.

922
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,780
No wonder she is devastated.

923
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,740
But

924
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,610
she shouldn't never attack you.

925
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,740
And Zhang Zhe.

926
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,490
Where the hell is he?

927
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,260
Just some disputes among families.

928
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,170
How could elusion solve the problem?

929
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,130
When one is determined to leave the home,

930
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,010
leave the parents,

931
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,860
he must had hardened his heart.

932
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,130
I think

933
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,650
Zhang Zhe was not doing things impulsively.

934
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,210
I agree with that.

935
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,490
I just thought that

936
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,260
it's a pity to see a family scattered.

937
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,780
I mean they are families.

938
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,780
Even if they have different views,

939
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,820
they do can seek common ground while shelving differences.

940
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,130
Forget it.

941
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,380
I'm hungry. Let's find some food.

942
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,050
Sure.

943
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:22,900
Waiter.

944
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,260
Please refill my cup.

945
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,860
Ok.

946
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,490
The fake Zhang Zhe was my idea.

947
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,210
During her consult,

948
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,610
I noticed that Liu Xinfang

949
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,900
has some mental issues.

950
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,050
There is something wrong with her.

951
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,490
She is mentally healthy, right?

952
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,650
She is too stubborn.

953
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,170
She has to make herself look like

954
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,300
a 30-year-old lady.

955
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,610
That's crazy.

956
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,690
The water overflowed.

957
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,050
I'm sorry.

958
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,570
It's fine.

959
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,170
I will clean it for you.

960
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,050
Don't worry. I will do it.

961
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,780
It's okay.

962
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,690
Sorry.

963
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,460
Why didn't you refuse?

964
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,900
I did.

965
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,260
But her husband came to me later,

966
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,090
and showed me her diagnosis report.

967
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,260
Her mental illness is confirmed.

968
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,610
But she doesn't believe it, and refuses to take medicine.

969
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,610
She insists that she is not ill.

970
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,740
During these years,

971
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,490
her mental state is getting worse.

972
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,490
She was hot-tempered when she was young.

973
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,010
But that was all for the goodness of the child.

974
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,650
We wanted him to attend a good university

975
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,130
so that he can get a good job in the future.

976
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,090
I do understand.

977
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,260
But that is different.

978
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,900
Plastic surgery has nothing to do with finding your son.

979
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,010
Even if I have performed the surgery

980
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,090
to make her look younger again,

981
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,690
we can't ensure that

982
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,900
you can find Zhang Zhe.

983
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,820
I know.

984
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,010
I have to try

985
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,260
even if he won't show up.

986
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,900
Or we can get her a fake one,

987
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,900
so that she can receive treatment.

988
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,610
Or at least she is willing to take medicine.

989
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,340
If it continues to go like this,

990
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,900
the whole family will be screwed,

991
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,610
let alone finding our son.

992
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,490
Move your wrist.

993
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,380
All right. Be careful.

994
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,900
Slow down.

995
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,610
Hold it.

996
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,340
Sure.

997
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,490
Hello?

998
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,050
Qi Dacheng is gone.

999
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,530
What do you mean he is gone?

1000
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,820
I just found out when I was on ward rounds.

1001
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,900
He left in advance.

1002
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,170
He won't answer the phone.

1003
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,210
His stats are bad these days.

1004
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,300
His condition is very unstable.

1005
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,380
I have already asked Mr. Chu.

1006
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,130
He knows nothing as well.

1007
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,210
Has he ever called you?

1008
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,380
No.

1009
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,740
Zhang Zhe will never come back home.

1010
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,900
I'm such a failure.

1011
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,490
After all these years of suffering,

1012
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,130
I end up raising an ingrate.

1013
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,650
He had meningitis as a kid.

1014
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,650
We tried our best to save him.

1015
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,380
If I know he is such an ingrate,

1016
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,740
I would never save him.
