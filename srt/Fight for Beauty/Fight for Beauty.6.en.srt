1
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,930
Ms. Qiao.

2
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,850
Morning.

3
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,570
Any plans for today?

4
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,620
Not at the moment.

5
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,900
Doesn't Gemu have a routine meeting on Mondays?

6
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,620
No.

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,100
There's only one meeting on the first day of each month,

8
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,210
and it's brief,

9
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,100
just about twenty minutes.

10
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,930
Ms. Zhou said

11
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,490
we should spend more time

12
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,570
focusing on our practice.

13
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,100
Ms. Zhou.

14
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,100
Ms. Li.

15
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,460
What's with the grand entrance? Are you checking up on us?

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,260
Not at all.

17
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,570
I just thought it's our first handover,

18
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,850
so the three of us should touch base.

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,060
Well, Ms. Qiao, I can only say your charm is truly remarkable.

20
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,220
So many patients are specifically requesting your services.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,660
Even after screening out many

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,380
based on your criteria,

23
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,730
there are still quite a lot.

24
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,970
Scheduling so many surgeries at once?

25
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,180
Even an iron man couldn't handle it.

26
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,500
Why don't you sort them out?

27
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,140
For the less urgent ones,

28
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,340
we can advise them

29
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,250
to reschedule.

30
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,060
No need.

31
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,490
I can handle them all.

32
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,970
See, I told you not to let her see the list.

33
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,860
Once she spots it, her hands start itching to get to work.

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,940
Wang Qian,

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,170
prioritize these three cases.

36
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:36,850
Got it.

37
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,890
Wait,

38
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,890
add two more.

39
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,380
Ms. Qiao, take a break.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,500
I'll do the stitching.

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,980
No need, just a few stitches and it'll be done.

42
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,500
You rest.

43
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,380
What time is the next surgery?

44
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,730
In forty minutes.

45
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,100
That long?

46
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,290
Tell the head nurse

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,690
that I don't need such a long break between surgeries.

48
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:44,850
Sure.

49
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,060
You can go rest.

50
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,850
I'll take a walk on my own.

51
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,730
Sure.

52
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,290
Whether a nose looks delicate or not

53
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,850
mainly depends on the tip.

54
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,380
You can immediately tell the doctor's skill

55
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,730
and aesthetic sense just by looking at it.

56
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,940
If you want it to look beautiful,

57
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,690
you have to practice repeatedly.

58
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,380
For this kind of oblique cut,

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,580
make one decisive incision

60
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,700
without constantly adjusting it,

61
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,490
that's how it looks the most natural.

62
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,290
How did you even figure this out?

63
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,580
It's similar to wood carving.

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,340
Crafting a nose

65
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,490
is essentially no different

66
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,610
from a craftsman's technique.

67
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,220
Beautiful.

68
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,980
You've got some impressive skills there.

69
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,290
Teach me sometime, will you?

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,050
Sure,

71
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,220
just call me "Master" and I'll teach you.

72
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,340
Once I learn it,

73
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,930
I'll even improve it for you.

74
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,610
We'll see who's the "Master."

75
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,900
I'll see you after surgery.

76
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,780
Come.

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,140
Why am I so unlucky?

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,170
Looks like

79
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,730
I'm the protégé of the chief surgeon.

80
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,290
But in reality,

81
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,100
Ms. Qiao is a total workaholic.

82
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,100
Once she's on the operating table,

83
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,140
her eyes light up like searchlights.

84
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,050
She insists on handling every surgery herself.

85
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,340
When I was with Mr. Du,

86
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,700
he didn't bother with minor surgeries,

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,050
so I got to be the lead surgeon sometimes.

88
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,410
Now Im just stuck sterilizing stuff.

89
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,580
I don't even get to stitch.

90
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,780
So,

91
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,340
the famous "Mole King" at Gemu

92
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,930
doesn't get to remove any moles anymore?

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,540
Don't worry,

94
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,850
you've still got me.

95
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,410
I'll take you along on all my surgeries.

96
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,730
Really? You'd give me your clients?

97
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,930
Come on, what surgeries do you have anyway?

98
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,460
Just double eyelids,

99
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,410
and more double eyelids.

100
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,810
What's wrong with double eyelids? Are they not good enough for you now?

101
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,250
You should be grateful.

102
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,700
Ms. Qiao's skills are top-notch.

103
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,250
Just learn from her, step by step.

104
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,140
I'm learning properly,

105
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,900
but I also need hands-on practice.

106
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,850
Even the best doctors need patients to prove their skills.

107
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,490
How long do I have to wait

108
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,170
to get a proper surgery?

109
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,410
Even a double eyelid surgery would do.

110
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,730
When's the next one?

111
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,780
How many times have I told you?

112
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,220
The statistics for PicoSure, IPL, and Thermage

113
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,540
must be in separate tables!

114
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,460
When I actually need them, you can't find anything!

115
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,610
As soon as you start work,

116
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,900
it's like

117
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,220
you've left your brain at home.

118
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,810
What's going on, Jinsong?

119
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,780
Mumu, step out for a bit.

120
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,610
I need to discuss some work matters with Mr. Dong.

121
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,490
Okay.

122
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,290
Go on.

123
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,900
Why are the invoices here too?

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,900
You're usually the one who's most considerate of the ladies.

125
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,100
What happened?

126
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,810
I've come to realize something.

127
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,290
My biggest mistake

128
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,020
is being too trusting of others.

129
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,700
No matter what I want,

130
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,050
in the end, I'm the one putting in all the effort

131
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,410
like a fool.

132
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,460
Sounds like there's more to that.

133
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,020
Let me think about it.

134
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,020
Are you talking about Mumu or about me?

135
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,020
Even if you gave me a hundred guts, I wouldn't dare talk about you.

136
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,610
I'm not capable enough,

137
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,170
I can't blame anyone else.

138
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,460
Serves me right.

139
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,290
Serves me right for being the laughingstock of the whole hospital.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,170
You're really too impatient.

141
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,780
When I promised you earlier

142
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,730
that I'd make arrangements

143
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,930
with Tang and Mr. Qin,

144
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,050
there wasn't a big personnel change

145
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,580
like Qiao Yang joining us.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,340
Everything can change,

147
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,490
but the one thing that can't is what I promised you.

148
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,930
Is that reasonable?

149
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,660
Even if you're

150
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,540
a thousand times dissatisfied,

151
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,810
can't you see

152
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,660
the new director hasn't been given to you

153
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,220
or anyone else yet? It's still vacant.

154
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,100
Stop blaming others

155
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,780
and use that idle brain of yours to think,

156
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,250
analyze why it's like this.

157
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:33,980
Why?

158
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,020
Ms. Qiao's skills are undeniable,

159
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,850
so it's bound to stir things up.

160
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,250
During this period,

161
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,220
all work needs to be adjusted,

162
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,810
and everyone is still being observed.

163
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,810
Before the dust settles,

164
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,810
do you think Tang and the others

165
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,340
would easily decide on the new director?

166
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,460
There was Zhou before,

167
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,290
and now there's Qiao.

168
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,980
Do I still have a chance?

169
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,980
How should I put it?

170
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,700
From what I've observed,

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,020
you still have a pretty good shot.

172
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,810
Ms. Li, is that how you see it?

173
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,340
Then tell me,

174
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,810
what exactly have you observed?

175
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,610
You're not even the director yet,

176
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,180
and you're already giving me attitude.

177
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,940
If you actually become the director,

178
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,490
who knows how you'll bully me.

179
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,300
No.

180
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,490
Ms. Li,

181
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,820
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,130
I made a mistake.

183
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,490
Dear Li,

184
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,700
I deeply realize my mistake.

185
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,100
I'm just...

186
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,180
just immature.

187
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,980
You should criticize me

188
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,100
so I can grow through your criticism,

189
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,220
right?

190
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,420
No just that.

191
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,300
Scold me harshly.

192
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,940
You're a man, okay?

193
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,650
I know how to bend and stretch.

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,700
Sit down,

195
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,060
I'll make you some tea.

196
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,130
You can keep scolding me.

197
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,820
Dr. Wei!

198
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,220
Qing, I was just looking for you downstairs.

199
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,420
What's up?

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,850
Let's talk over there.

201
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,770
Is Ms. Qiao still in surgery?

202
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,980
Oh gosh, she's going all out again.

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,980
Come here.

204
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,820
What's wrong?

205
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,100
Qing, you've got to help me.

206
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,300
See if there's any surgery

207
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,340
that you can arrange for me.

208
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,370
Whatever you arrange, I'll do it.

209
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,370
Help me out.

210
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,250
I'll cover all the milk tea for the second half of the year!

211
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,650
There is one.

212
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,820
Sure. Give it to me.

213
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,490
But that woman's a real handful.

214
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,220
Always asking questions. She's a master negotiator.

215
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,820
It's fine.

216
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,490
Just give it to me.

217
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,460
If you agree,

218
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,940
it's actually pretty suitable.

219
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,220
Perfect! Just give it to me.

220
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,420
But if I push it to you like this, is it appropriate?

221
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,850
Ms. Qiao might not agree.

222
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,060
It's fine, I'll talk to her.

223
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,220
She won't say no.

224
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,300
Okay, open your eyes.

225
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,530
Alright, take a look in the mirror.

226
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,180
This one is a small fan shape.

227
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,980
I recommend these two.

228
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,340
They suit you better.

229
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,650
The thread embedding method isn't suitable for you.

230
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,610
The results wouldn't be great.

231
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,940
I suggest doing a full incision.

232
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,700
Don't worry about slow recovery.

233
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,850
It's just a very small minimally invasive procedure.

234
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,180
Sorry, can I ask,

235
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,820
how old are you?

236
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,300
Dr. Wei looks young,

237
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,890
but she has plenty of experience.

238
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,820
She's the top apprentice of Ms. Qiao.

239
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,340
You've heard of Qiao Yang, right?

240
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,980
She's a big expert in the field of craniofacial surgery.

241
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,940
You must have heard

242
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,700
of the surgery on Fang Ting recently, right?

243
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,580
Ms. Qiao was the lead surgeon on that.

244
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,220
Don't worry.

245
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,100
I'd never recommend

246
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,610
an unreliable doctor to you.

247
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,220
I've done more than 300 double eyelid surgeries myself.

248
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,980
You're in good hands.

249
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,220
Have you decided?

250
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,850
For the price you're offering,

251
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,220
Dr. Wei offers the best value for your money.

252
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,420
Do you feel anything?

253
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,300
A little.

254
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,730
How about here?

255
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,890
Yeah, I feel it here.

256
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,180
Alright, let's wait a bit longer.

257
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,770
Sure.

258
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,490
Don't worry, this'll be over soon.

259
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,340
Do you feel anything now?

260
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,850
No, not anymore.

261
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,460
How about this side?

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,650
Anything?

263
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,770
Nope.

264
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,940
Great, let's start the surgery.

265
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,610
Alright, we're starting now.

266
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,340
Look, it's removed.

267
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,250
Well, this is still my flesh, after all.

268
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,010
We'll stitch it up in a moment.

269
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,370
I'll use a kite flap technique.

270
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,460
Once it heals, you won't even notice.

271
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,770
You guys sure know how to come up with impressive names for these procedures.

272
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,100
Your wife came in last week.

273
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,420
Why didn't you come with her?

274
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,980
I was busy.

275
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,420
I've been working overtime for almost a month straight.

276
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,730
You'd better

277
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,370
get ready at the hospital.

278
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,460
The mid-year review is coming up soon.

279
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,770
Wasn't the review always at the end of the year?

280
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,010
Things are different now.

281
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,700
The industry's been developing well,

282
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,220
and in order to improve management,

283
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,530
they're doing reviews for the Level 4 surgical licenses earlier this year.

284
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,250
It's the same for all hospitals.

285
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,130
I've sent you the details.

286
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,460
Go check it out when you have time.

287
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,300
No problem, thanks!

288
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,340
Talking about retiring to Japan,

289
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,650
but he's still taking orders.

290
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,130
That foreigner from Shanghai finally replied to the email.

291
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,940
He wrote a lot,

292
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,100
but the bottom line is:

293
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,820
no.

294
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,370
Can you believe it?

295
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,890
We've contacted so many professors,

296
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,250
and still couldn't find anyone.

297
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,180
It just goes to show

298
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,370
how much our industry has grown.

299
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,650
With our hospital's strength,

300
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,340
even if we need to redo the review for the Level 4 surgical license,

301
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,700
it shouldn't be an issue.

302
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,300
We don't necessarily need to find an expert for it.

303
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,250
The Level 4 license is just one aspect.

304
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,980
The most important thing is

305
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,490
lately, all these incidents

306
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,130
have made me reflect.

307
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,940
There are some operational issues we need to address.

308
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,420
You see, when patients come to the hospital,

309
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,610
who's the first person they meet?

310
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,940
It's the consultation department.

311
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,730
The issue with the lower eyelid surgery

312
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,980
exposed the lack of professionalism

313
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,130
in our consultation team.

314
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,530
Consultation and doctors

315
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,010
have different starting points.

316
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,730
The consultants have performance targets,

317
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,700
so their recommendations

318
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,180
are often more profit-driven.

319
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,220
But don't we have doctors to oversee the consultation?

320
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,490
As for the related plans,

321
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,940
didn't you adjust them already?

322
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,460
It's not just about tweaking a few items

323
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,460
or adjusting a few consultants.

324
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,180
To make Gemu better,

325
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,180
we need to focus

326
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,530
on cultivating our medical system.

327
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,940
The key is the leader.

328
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,940
We need to find someone with academic stature and industry authority,

329
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,180
someone who also knows how to teach.

330
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,300
Chu Feng!

331
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,060
How could I forget him?

332
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,610
He's a giant in the field!

333
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,340
But isn't he getting older now?

334
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,650
His health can't keep up anymore.

335
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,730
He looks pretty young still.

336
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,010
Look at him.

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,250
He seems more energetic than Mr. Chen.

338
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,700
He's probably retired by now, right?

339
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,370
He's not working at the frontlines anymore.

340
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,420
But in the past two years, he's published a lot of papers.

341
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,940
And they're all big ones.

342
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,770
He's academic,

343
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,460
he may not fully understand current trends

344
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,490
or aesthetics.

345
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,130
He even has a Weibo account.

346
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,850
He has quite a few followers.

347
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,700
He posts a lot.

348
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,300
Just recently, he shared a Weibo from Qiao Yang.

349
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,130
Take a look.

350
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,250
Is he Qiao Yang's mentor?

351
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,980
Well, that makes things easier.

352
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,890
I'll ask Qiao Yang about it.

353
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,770
Okay, I got it.

354
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,650
Mr. Qin, I understand what you're saying,

355
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,370
but whether he's willing to come or not,

356
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,300
I really can't say.

357
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,220
His personality...

358
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,180
I can only try.

359
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,100
Ms. Qiao.

360
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,850
Ms. Qiao, something's happened to Xiaoxi.

361
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,770
When the surgery was performed,

362
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,850
I had a feeling something was wrong.

363
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,980
I went back and checked.

364
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,460
Wei Xiaoxi was just an resident physician, right?

365
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,730
How could she have performed 300 surgeries?

366
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,060
She said she was removing the stitches today,

367
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,980
but how could she do that with this swelling?

368
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,490
Don't worry, dear.

369
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,010
Let me check, okay?

370
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,650
Look up for me.

371
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,580
Can you only lift it this high?

372
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,490
Can you go higher?

373
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,730
Okay, look down for me.

374
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,700
Close your eyes, let me see.

375
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,300
No problem, dear.

376
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,940
This is just a normal post-surgery reaction.

377
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,420
It's not a problem with the surgery quality.

378
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,460
See? Just as I said.

379
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,580
Still trying to argue?

380
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,650
I have friends who've had this surgery.

381
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,100
They were fine in a few days.

382
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,730
But me...

383
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,100
How many days has it been?

384
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,490
Everyone's body is different,

385
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,370
so the time for swelling to subside varies.

386
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,490
It's like normal eating,

387
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,370
some people are allergic to rice.

388
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:18,980
Yeah.

389
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,770
I've done more than 300

390
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,460
double eyelid surgeries myself.

391
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,700
Let me ask you，

392
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,180
has she really done 300 surgeries?

393
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,100
Dear Wei Xiaoxi,

394
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,700
Congratulations.

395
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,530
You're now a doctor with a lawyer's letter.

396
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,420
You know yourself,

397
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,530
The surgery had no problems at all,

398
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,890
just the swelling took longer to go down.

399
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,340
But you lied.

400
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,770
What's worse is that

401
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,420
the lawyer's letter wasn't even sent by a lawyer.

402
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,620
She sent it herself.

403
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,620
This patient's profession is a lawyer.

404
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,940
Surprised?

405
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,810
The evidence is well-prepared.

406
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,420
She came ready for this.

407
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,050
If she wins this lawsuit,

408
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,980
you'll never be able to practice medicine again.

409
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:20,900
Yeah.

410
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,250
This was my first major double eyelid surgery.

411
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,490
But I've assisted in no less than 1,000 surgeries.

412
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,940
Simulations are countless.

413
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,010
There's always a first time.

414
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,860
If others won't give me the opportunity,

415
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,220
I'll take it myself.

416
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,940
At the Third Hospital,

417
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,620
didn't you also fight for your surgical opportunities?

418
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,330
Come.

419
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,090
What are you hiding from?

420
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,050
I don't know.

421
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,700
You don't know what I'm going to do.

422
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,700
So you don't trust me.

423
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,770
Xia Qing doesn't trust you either.

424
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,940
Just answer me one thing,

425
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,860
did you inject Qiao Hui off-campus?

426
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,290
I haven't done anything wrong.

427
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,620
Being a doctor

428
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,620
is different from any other profession.

429
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,770
Professional ethics come first.

430
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,010
Maybe you should apply to withdraw from school.

431
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,730
Who reported me?

432
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,860
Qiao Yang?

433
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,090
You didn't even say you were coming.

434
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,290
My wife went to Yuanyuan's house.

435
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,770
You have to have instant noodles.

436
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,860
Here you are.

437
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,860
It's fine that she's not here.

438
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,770
That way, you can go on a rampage.

439
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,460
Bringing alcohol to bribe me?

440
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,380
Regretting it now, huh?

441
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,530
You want me to speak on your behalf to get you back to the Third Hospital?

442
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,140
How could that be?

443
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,140
Would I let you do something so disgraceful?

444
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,700
At least I'm your disciple.

445
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,090
Wherever I go,

446
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,530
others will chase after me.

447
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,940
Bringing alcohol means nothing good.

448
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,620
Speak.

449
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,940
It's definitely a good thing.

450
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,330
I just want you to loosen the ground for me.

451
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,330
Help me grow faster.

452
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,090
What do you mean?

453
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,700
I've now gone to a private hospital.

454
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,980
It's called Gemu.

455
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,810
It's a hospital with Level 4 license.

456
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,570
The bosses are all around my age.

457
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,180
But they're also serious about the business.

458
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,250
I understand.

459
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,810
But I just retired and have had a few relaxing days at home.

460
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,770
I just wanna look at my phone, browse the internet,

461
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,460
drink some wine, and tend to my flowers.

462
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,460
I'm not really involved with you young people.

463
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,330
Come on.

464
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,980
What you do is just having instant noodles and alcohol.

465
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,810
I like it.

466
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,530
The more you drink,

467
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,860
the better it gets.

468
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,530
You always drink just a little.

469
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,980
It's just to protect your heart and blood vessels.

470
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,700
So you have a chance to get back to the operating table.

471
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,290
I know.

472
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,330
If you go back to the Third Hospital,

473
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,180
that's for the patients and for medicine.

474
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,490
But if you go to Gemu,

475
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,460
you'll lose face.

476
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,090
Don't provoke me.

477
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,770
I'm getting old now.

478
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,620
I only have these feathers left.

479
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,980
Feathers need to spread their wings and fly high

480
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,770
to fully utilize their value.

481
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,050
You have the skills, the awareness,

482
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,530
and the patience to mentor new people.

483
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,460
If you don't use these feathers,

484
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,770
they’ll just become a preserved specimen.

485
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,620
Get out of here.

486
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,380
Can't you say something nice?

487
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,420
You know what I mean.

488
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,220
You've recently started reading The Old Man and the Sea again?

489
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,730
Santiago is a good fisherman.

490
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,810
But even he reaches his life's limits.

491
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,010
Yet, he didn't get discouraged.

492
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,530
If you ask me,

493
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,490
some people are born for lakes,

494
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,050
and some are born for the sea.

495
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,010
You were born for the sea.

496
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,010
Nice alcohol.

497
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,010
It must be over fifteen years old.

498
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,010
Qiao Yang,

499
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,860
the surgery you did a while back, the full excision,

500
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,330
didn't it cause quite a stir?

501
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,140
Even us old-timers,

502
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,730
who've been in the business our whole lives,

503
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,050
were sharing it in the group, discussing it.

504
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,620
Really?

505
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,250
I just replied with four words to them in the group:

506
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,570
She is my disciple.

507
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,290
You're showing off again, huh?

508
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,770
It's been a long time since I've heard you compliment me face to face.

509
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,090
That's enough to make me proud for a whole week.

510
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,570
Actually, in the past few decades,

511
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,180
medicine has been developing rapidly.

512
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,860
Even if you had the highest medical skills,

513
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,810
staying stagnant means falling behind.

514
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,660
I'm getting old.

515
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,530
This world belongs to you young people now.

516
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,860
Could you stop talking about being old?

517
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,290
Honestly.

518
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,860
I've just started this journey,

519
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,250
I'm still in the trial phase.

520
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,010
When they said they wanted to invite you,

521
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,180
I got so excited.

522
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,620
I immediately volunteered to come find you.

523
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,220
Just thinking about

524
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,860
working with you again,

525
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,530
I can't express how happy I am.

526
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,010
Gemu is a promising hospital.

527
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,940
The key thing is,

528
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,860
do you know who the owner is at Gemu?

529
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,090
Zhou Jingwen, right?

530
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,380
You know?

531
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,570
I knew it, you've been keeping an eye on it.

532
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,140
Yeah.

533
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,770
Right.

534
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,810
I've been following.

535
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,220
Wasn't Jingwen doing a surgery

536
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,660
on a domestic violence survivor recently?

537
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,660
It seems like it was right after your surgery.

538
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,380
In our group,

539
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,090
we were also discussing and sharing it.

540
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,420
Honestly, I'll tell you the truth,

541
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,940
that surgery was something we did together.

542
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,010
I just didn't take credit for it.

543
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,860
Really?

544
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,250
I knew it.

545
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,770
Actually, that surgery seemed simple,

546
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,860
but in reality, it was quite the opposite.

547
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,940
A series of intricate stitching work,

548
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,860
and on top of that, three hours

549
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,620
to complete so many scar repairs.

550
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,250
It really wasn't easy.

551
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,660
I raise my glass to you

552
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,570
and give you a thumbs up.

553
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,660
Thank you.

554
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,530
You should come.

555
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,050
Only with you can we soar steadily,

556
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,620
and fly even further.

557
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,810
Thank you for trusting me.

558
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,940
Actually, back then, for both of you,

559
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,420
I owe the academy a huge favor.

560
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,290
It took me quite a bit to bring both of you

561
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,530
under my wing.

562
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,290
I never expected it to turn out like this.

563
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,010
You thought Xia Qing was too picky,

564
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,940
difficult to deal with,

565
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,010
so you didn't let me handle it.

566
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,730
Then that day, Wei Xiaoxi came to find me.

567
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,900
And I thought,

568
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,490
aren't they really annoying?

569
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,140
Let's take the opportunity to teach them a lesson.

570
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,090
Those two

571
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,330
probably have a head full of lawsuits now.

572
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,660
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

573
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,250
Do you think they're happy?

574
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,090
When you throw food, they all scramble for it.

575
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,180
When we feed the fish, the most important thing

576
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,330
is to make sure

577
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,940
not every single one gets full.

578
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,460
How to maintain balance

579
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,700
is the most important lesson

580
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,980
for an ecosystem.

581
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,900
No matter the situation,

582
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,700
I won't be foolish enough to take a hammer and smash the tank.

583
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,420
What's the benefit to me if the tank breaks?

584
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,140
How many years have you been with me?

585
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,250
Five years.

586
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,330
I came to Gemu with you.

587
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,620
Five years and this is all the progress you've made?

588
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,700
I was wrong, Ms. Li.

589
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,380
Will you do it again?

590
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,010
Never.

591
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,220
Get out.

592
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,700
I've talked to Xia Qing.

593
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,460
She's refused an out-of-court settlement.

594
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,980
She insists on going to court.

595
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,620
Anyway, I've found the people I needed to find.

596
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,220
Even their law firm partners.

597
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,700
I added them on WeChat through indirect means.

598
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,620
But it didn't help.

599
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,940
She said

600
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,180
it's a personal matter,

601
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,940
and finding anyone won't make a difference.

602
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,620
Really, she won't listen to anything.

603
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,900
Qiao Yang said Wei Xiaoxi is her disciple,

604
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,980
and suggested letting her handle it.

605
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,860
Right now, it's the critical time for the level four license,

606
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,090
we can't afford any distractions.

607
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,490
Hello, who is this?

608
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,330
Is this Jingwen? I'm Chu Feng.

609
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,660
Mr. Chu.

610
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,620
Ms. Xia.

611
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,460
Are you stalking me?

612
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,220
The lawyer's letter has your firm's name on it.

613
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,570
Can we talk for a moment?

614
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,290
What's there to talk about?

615
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,660
I've already said, I refuse an out-of-court settlement.

616
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,330
Ms. Xia,

617
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,250
if you delay the stitch removal, the recovery period will be longer.

618
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,860
You seem busy too.

619
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,980
If you go to the hospital on the weekend,

620
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,980
I think your wound will have almost healed.

621
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,290
If it's not fully removed then,

622
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,460
you'll need a second surgery.

623
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,660
Are you threatening me?

624
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,570
No.

625
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,860
If you keep pestering me,

626
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,250
I can also sue you.

627
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,660
That's right.

628
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,250
The person you should be suing is me.

629
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,490
I'll prescribe you some erythromycin eye ointment in a moment.

630
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,380
Apply it once a day

631
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,810
before bed.

632
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,700
Three days of application should be enough.

633
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,730
Why?

634
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,250
To prevent infection.

635
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,180
I meant,

636
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,730
why are you speaking up for her?

637
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,220
I've looked into it.

638
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,900
You're also new at this hospital.

639
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,220
She's just a normal doctor.

640
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,460
Why?

641
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,090
I've assessed her.

642
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,420
Her professional skills are fine.

643
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,180
I trust her to handle the operation independently.

644
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,530
I removed your stitches today.

645
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,180
After a week, once the swelling goes down naturally,

646
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,570
you might even want to thank her.

647
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,980
Everyone has their first time.

648
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,700
Every doctor

649
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,460
has their first patient,

650
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,860
just like you lawyers

651
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,290
have your first court hearing.

652
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,570
Right?

653
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,140
Dr. Wei, you don't need to see me off.

654
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,250
I'm free.

655
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,180
I'll walk you out.

656
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,900
Sorry, Ms. Xia.

657
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,140
I did deceive you.

658
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,380
I havent done

659
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,010
300 eyelid surgeries before.

660
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,380
But you've assisted in 1,000 surgeries.

661
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,050
You know what?

662
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,250
I'm best at writing lawyer letters.

663
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,140
The number of lawyer letters I've written

664
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,620
is no less than the number of surgeries you've performed.

665
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,810
Among my male colleagues of the same age,

666
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,730
most of them can already handle cases independently.

667
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,900
But I'm still doing odd jobs.

668
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,730
Last time I asked my boss,

669
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,380
why haven't I been allowed to go to court yet,

670
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,530
and he actually said,

671
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,330
I'm too ordinary-looking.

672
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,860
The scariest part is,

673
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,810
I actually believed it.

674
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,050
If only I had a boss

675
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,220
like your mentor.

676
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,860
Can I add you on WeChat?

677
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,900
Sure.

678
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,250
You're my first patient, you know.

679
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,860
Maybe I'll even become

680
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,220
your first client.

681
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,660
Are you sure?

682
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,730
I specialize in criminal law.

683
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:11,810
Goodbye.

684
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,090
Let's keep in touch.

685
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,860
Ms. Qiao, I know I was wrong.

686
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,570
Whether it's having my pay deducted or being suspended from surgeries,

687
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,530
I accept it.

688
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,290
I hate when they punish doctors by suspending surgeries.

689
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,730
Who exactly benefits from this?

690
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,770
But your good days are over.

691
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,010
From today onwards,

692
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,090
you'll be assisting in all my surgeries.

693
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,380
Really?

694
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,380
Does that mean I might get a chance to be the lead surgeon?

695
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,290
You've got ambition.

696
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,660
But you'll have to

697
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,460
finish those 300 eyelid surgeries first.

698
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,620
It's fun, right?

699
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,940
Actually, these things are quite magical.

700
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,090
They need to be raised separately.

701
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,940
They have a strong territorial instinct.

702
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,770
You can't put them together.

703
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,980
If you do, they'll fight.

704
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,420
Look at this one,

705
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,770
you can tell it's been in a fight.

706
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,810
Its nose is all damaged.

707
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,460
Sure.

708
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:09,980
Sure.

709
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,660
It's cute.

710
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,810
So cute.

711
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,570
Try holding it out?

712
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,090
No, no.

713
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,460
I'm fine just looking at it.

714
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,770
Scared?

715
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,140
If you're scared, we shouldn't have come.

716
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,330
I should've known you weren't too fond of this place.

717
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,220
We should do something else.

718
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,330
Have brunch or something.

719
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,220
Sir, your hobbies are quite niche.

720
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,570
I'm just satisfying my curiosity.

721
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,530
If I really took one home,

722
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,050
I'd be the one getting hurt.

723
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,770
I invited you out today.

724
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,530
Do you feel it's too abrupt?

725
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,380
Sir, I know why

726
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,460
you called me here today.

727
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,330
To be honest, it wasn't my idea

728
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,770
to invite you to Gemu.

729
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,250
But if you do come,

730
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,290
it'd be the best choice for Gemu.

731
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,290
What about for you?

732
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,140
For me, I'm very grateful.

733
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,220
But if you refuse,

734
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,180
I wouldn't be surprised.

735
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,770
The fact that you called me today

736
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,380
means you still have some concerns,

737
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,050
whether it's about me or about Gemu.

738
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,140
Sir, just say it. It's fine.

739
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,180
You left school in 2008, right?

740
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,460
Yeah.

741
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,330
Actually, before you left,

742
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,570
something similar happened at the school.

743
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,900
I won't go into specifics,

744
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,180
but her choice was different from yours.

745
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,900
She gave up being a doctor and changed careers.

746
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,490
But actually, she's doing very well now.

747
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,090
I remember very clearly,

748
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,140
when she left, she asked me one question.

749
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,700
She said, "Sir,

750
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,180
isn't it the most important thing

751
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,420
to cultivate a good doctor?"

752
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,140
After your incident,

753
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,530
I immediately thought of what she said.

754
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,220
Actually, as a teacher,

755
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,250
the thing we hope for the most

756
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,700
is to see our students succeed.

757
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,900
Look at you,

758
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,730
after that incident,

759
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,940
not only did you not get discouraged,

760
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,530
but you also started your own hospital.

761
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,290
Honestly,

762
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,330
I'm very pleased.

763
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,900
Everyone makes mistakes in life.

764
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,620
If making a mistake

765
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,290
means becoming a good doctor,

766
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,220
then the regret wouldn't just be a regret.

767
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,700
If there were better options,

768
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,180
there wouldn't be the regret we have now.

769
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,050
"Wäre, hätte, könnte

770
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,460
– alles nur leeres Gerede."

771
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,490
That German proverb,

772
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,620
isn't it something like this?

773
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,050
Yes, it's exactly like that.

774
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,770
If, would, could

775
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,050
– all just empty talk.

776
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,380
Sir, your level of understanding is so deep.

777
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,980
We still have a lot to learn.

778
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:51,810
By the way,

779
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,050
Jingwen,

780
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,730
I have a question that's off-topic.

781
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,420
Does your hospital

782
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,220
allow lizard breeding in the office?

783
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,050
Of course not.

784
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,900
Thank you, Sir.

785
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,330
I heard that the taste is really good.

786
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,980
A lot of influencers come to check in.

787
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,940
The delivery guy is so handsome.

788
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,980
Hey, handsome! I'm doing a livestream right now.

789
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,290
Could you say hi

790
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,220
to my audience?

791
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,140
Are you deliberately keeping such an ugly hairstyle

792
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,700
and beard to avoid being harassed?

793
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,330
Hello.

794
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,490
I didn't mean anything by it,

795
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,050
just want you to say hi.

796
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,220
Are you getting plastic surgery?

797
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,330
Yes.

798
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,250
But you already look great!

799
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,490
Look, you're even an online celebrity.

800
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,900
Your video has over 500,000 likes.

801
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,050
I don't wanna be an online celebrity.

802
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,210
I just wanna look uglier.

803
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,530
Handsome,

804
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,650
aren't you being a bit too humble?

805
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,650
Sorry,

806
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,010
I've been a doctor for so many years,

807
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,940
but it's the first time

808
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,170
a patient has made such a request.

809
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,380
I'm really curious,

810
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,490
why do you want that?

811
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,380
Are you familiar with BDD?

812
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,420
What?

813
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,780
Body Dysmorphic Disorder.

814
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,010
I don't have any disorder.

815
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,260
Maybe I didn't express myself clearly just now.

816
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,170
I just wanna look different.

817
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,780
Got it.

818
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,130
I have the skills to make someone ugly become beautiful,

819
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,420
but to make someone beautiful become ugly... I can't do that.

820
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,530
It goes against medical ethics.

821
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,690
No plastic surgeon can do that for you.

822
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,050
And if any doctor says they can,

823
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,570
I advise you not to go through with it.

824
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,490
Why not?

825
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,980
I'll pay.

826
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,010
I have no specific requirements.

827
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,300
Any different look is fine.

828
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,490
Aren't you professionals?

829
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,420
Why can't you do it?

830
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,340
Precisely because we are professionals,

831
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,740
we can't do it for you.

832
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,650
Zhou Jingwen!

833
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,010
I'm Qiao Yang's cousin, Qiao Hui.

834
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,490
I've heard Yang mention you a lot.

835
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,490
I heard your clinic is much cheaper

836
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,780
than the Third Hospital.

837
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,340
No.

838
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,980
I promised Qiao Yang I wouldn't go there again.

839
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,010
Jingwen,

840
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,260
this matter is really important to me.

841
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,740
Please, just help me out.

842
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,980
I promise I won't tell anyone.

843
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,740
Dr. Zhou.

844
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,780
The first time I entered the operating room

845
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,420
to cut a person's mandibular bone,

846
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,380
do you know how long it took me?

847
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,170
How long?

848
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,010
Eight hours.

849
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,340
Eight hours?

850
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,260
My legs were shaking.

851
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,130
But look at me now,

852
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,420
I can finish it in half an hour,

853
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,420
without any unnecessary movements.

854
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,260
The detached mandibular bone

855
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,490
has extremely smooth lines.

856
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,780
You can't see the cut.

857
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,690
It's very small, right?

858
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,340
Yeah.

859
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,820
Dr. Qiao.

860
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,420
It all comes down to the skill of the hands.

861
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:01,980
It's all about feeling.

862
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,650
Dr. Qiao.

863
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,980
You again?

864
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,460
We've already discussed your situation with you, haven't we?

865
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,610
What?

866
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:22,900
This is me.

867
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,610
You used to look pretty handsome back then.

868
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,210
Now, with this scar,

869
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,900
I look like a monster.

870
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,490
Every time I go out, I get checked for ID.

871
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,780
I lost my job,

872
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,010
my partner left, and I ran out of money.

873
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,780
Finally I found a job

874
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,900
as a taxi driver,

875
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,980
but I get complaints every day.

876
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,210
Many passengers get in and immediately want to get out.

877
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,820
I can't even remember the last time

878
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,780
I had a conversation like this with someone.

879
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,820
Talking to people has always been hard.

880
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,490
To be honest, I haven't saved much money over the years.

881
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,300
I also saw that report on Jiang Rong,

882
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,820
and I felt like your hospital is different from others.

883
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,740
Can we work something out? Can I have the surgery first

884
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,130
and pay later?

885
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,260
Once I earn enough, I'll definitely pay it back.

886
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,300
I'm sorry.

887
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,380
Your situation is different from Jiang Rong's.

888
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,610
We are a hospital,

889
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,010
not a charity organization.

890
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,210
We can't treat patients without payment.

891
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:20,740
Here.

892
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,530
Dr. Zhou, you don't need to pay.

893
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,740
It's the right thing to do.

894
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,820
It's already been paid.

895
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,530
I was going to tell you,

896
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,260
you're really lucky.

897
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,780
Recently, our clinic got a new equipment,

898
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,380
and we need clinical subjects for it.

899
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,780
There's no charge for that.

900
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,570
But this new technology and equipment,

901
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,940
do come with some risks.

902
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,090
Do you want to think about it?

903
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,460
What risks could this face of mine possibly have?

904
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,090
Be careful.

905
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,460
Put it at the entrance, yes.

906
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,050
Align it properly.

907
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,610
Make it neat.

908
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,980
There's only an hour left before they arrive.

909
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,300
Why are the candies gone?

910
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,380
And the water hasn't been replenished either.

911
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,420
Don't forget to take care of that.

912
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,210
Okay, I'll do it now.

913
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,130
Make sure everything's in order, okay?

914
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,940
Got it.

915
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,010
Restock whatever needs to be restocked.

916
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,090
Alright.

917
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,900
When they arrive,

918
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,490
I'll first take them on a tour of the hospital.

919
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,420
You'll be in charge of Zhao Zheng's scar repair.

920
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,940
When we get to the operating room,

921
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,900
you and Ms. Qiao should both

922
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,980
be halfway through your surgeries.

923
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,610
Okay.

924
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,570
The new expert coming is Mr. Chu.

925
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,690
I've seen his photo in textbooks before,

926
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,460
super handsome.

927
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,260
That was a photo from thirty years ago.

928
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,260
Now, well...

929
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,530
But that old man loves to look good.

930
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,900
Make sure to compliment him on his looks when he's here.

931
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,740
So should I call him "Master"?

932
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,170
Master? Call him "Handsome Guy"!

933
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,130
Your EQ is really something...

934
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,490
Alright, then what should I call him?

935
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,210
Don't call him anything, just kneel down.

936
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,740
I really don't get it.

937
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,460
Zhao Zheng doesn't look like a good person at all.

938
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,170
Ms. Zhou even talked about some new equipment trial

939
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,380
and gave him a free treatment.

940
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,980
We don't have new equipment at all.

941
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,460
Stop talking so much.

942
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,690
I'm not done yet.

943
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,050
And then there's Lin Qiang,

944
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,380
both surgeries are tough cases.

945
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,490
Neither makes any money.

946
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,420
They're earning so much, but insist on being do-gooders.

947
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,980
Who's gonna cover our bonuses?

948
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,490
Shut up.

949
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,260
Don't talk behind people's backs.

950
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,980
If you really have a problem,

951
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,130
why don't you write it up and give it to Ms. Li?

952
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,210
Would you dare?

953
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,210
No wonder you're broke.

954
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,380
Pack all this up.

955
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,260
Put away the signs.

956
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,780
Jingwen,

957
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,650
has Mr. Chu contacted you?

958
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,610
No, he hasn't.

959
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,380
I can't reach him right now.

960
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,900
Qiao Yang said she went to pick him up.

961
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,260
But even Qiao Yang can't get in touch with him.

962
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,610
Can't find him? How could that be?

963
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,090
As doctors,

964
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,690
we not only need to stay fit,

965
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,010
but more importantly, we need to build strength.

966
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,940
Practicing Baduanjin

967
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,740
helps us adjust

968
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,570
and control our breathing rhythm.

969
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,740
During surgery,

970
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,900
it allows us to achieve a harmonious state of body and mind.

971
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,260
No shaky hands, no panicked heart.

972
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,380
Dr. Wei,

973
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,780
are you still here?

974
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,420
I've already fallen asleep.

975
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,780
When it's done, remember to wake me up.

976
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,420
Why don't you set an alarm for yourself?

977
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,980
I'm about to crash too.

978
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,650
Mr. Chu, welcome!

979
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,650
Hello.

980
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,490
Mr. Chu.

981
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,170
Hello everyone!

982
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,780
What's with all this?

983
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,170
She paid for it.

984
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,130
This way, please.

985
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,050
Okay.

986
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,780
Qiao Yang, Zhou Jingwen.

987
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,090
Who's prettier between the two of us?

988
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,940
At Gemu,

989
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,420
you both still have room for improvement.

990
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,610
Mr. Chu,

991
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,650
now that you've agreed

992
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,780
to be our consulting director,

993
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,460
I can finally put my mind at ease.

994
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:24,780
Please.

995
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,210
I know you don't like trouble,

996
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,900
but we still need to follow

997
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,090
the proper procedures.

998
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,490
Tonight, we're hosting a welcome banquet for you.

999
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,650
No need.

1000
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,610
Let's skip those formalities.

1001
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,940
I heard that both of you

1002
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,690
have an important surgery today.

1003
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,260
Mr. Qin gave me the materials beforehand.

1004
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,610
I found them quite interesting.

1005
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,530
As a teacher, I still need to keep learning.

1006
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,090
Oh no...

1007
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,010
Normally, I'm never nervous during surgery,

1008
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,530
but as soon as you mention an on-site evaluation,

1009
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,610
look at my hands trembling.

1010
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,010
I can't control it, see?

1011
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,980
It feels like we're back in school again.

1012
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,130
Mr. Chu,

1013
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,260
after we finish our surgeries,

1014
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,380
please come and give us some guidance.

1015
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,570
Alright, go and get ready for your surgeries.
