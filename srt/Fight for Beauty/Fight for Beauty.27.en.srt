1
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,330
I think Qi Dacheng's condition

2
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,930
is much better than we expected.

3
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,020
Yeah,

4
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,740
I thought he had run away,

5
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,930
and that was the end of it.

6
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,410
I thought the surgery would be in vain.

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,900
Turns out I underestimated him.

8
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,930
He set an alarm on his phone,

9
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,260
reminding himself to take his medicine at the same time every day.

10
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,770
To be honest with you,

11
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,330
ever since he ran away and we lost contact,

12
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,620
it's felt like

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,330
there's a time bomb inside me.

14
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,410
Every day I worry about receiving bad news.

15
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,820
This bomb could go off at any moment.

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,820
Do you think I have anxiety?

17
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,890
Maybe I should see a psychologist.

18
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,940
Actually, hearing you say that makes me feel quite happy.

19
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,980
Now that you mention it,

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,260
I think you should come with me

21
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,340
to see a psychologist.

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,730
I'm this anxious and you're happy about it?

23
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,170
Seriously,

24
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,890
Qiao Yang,

25
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,010
have you noticed you've changed a lot lately?

26
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,980
I've gotten prettier?

27
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,730
In the past, no matter what situation you faced,

28
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,450
you always adjusted yourself,

29
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,980
trying to suppress your negative emotions.

30
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,610
Do you think my evaluation of you is fair?

31
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,690
It's so-so.

32
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,100
You said I'm like a robot.

33
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,780
Humans aren't machines.

34
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,290
There's no need to wind yourself up so tight.

35
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,690
I think, as doctors,

36
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,730
we're like containers,

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,660
holding the joys, sorrows, and emotions of others.

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,260
We need to learn to carry it all.

39
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,290
If we don't adjust ourselves well,

40
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,690
the negative emotions and mental "garbage"

41
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,380
in this container will accumulate.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,610
It'll eventually explode.

43
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,660
That's why you go online

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,100
and play live streams and games,

45
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,690
to find a way to release your emotions

46
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,060
so you don't go insane.

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,540
Exactly.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,570
Humans aren't steel warriors.

49
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,010
There's no need to pretend to be so strong.

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,500
Only by admitting our weaknesses

51
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,610
can we accept ourselves.

52
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,130
When we're tired, we rest.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,690
When we're frustrated, we shout it out.

54
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,980
I've been really worried about you

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,850
since Zhong Shunhua's incident.

56
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,220
I didn't bring it up to you,

57
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,980
but I hoped you'd be able to get through it on your own.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,820
We all have to

59
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,890
get through this hurdle.

60
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,610
After you came back from Qianqiao,

61
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,380
I felt like you were in a much better state.

62
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,540
Really?

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,730
Are you in a relationship now?

64
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,690
With Lu, right?

65
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,780
Don't act like you don't know.

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,290
You've already figured it out.

67
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,340
Gossip is one of life's great pleasures.

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,450
Who says a life coach can't gossip?

69
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,660
So, what's the situation now?

70
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,100
Who's chasing whom?

71
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,690
Alright, I can't take you anymore.

72
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,540
You go chat online with your old lady.

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,610
No,

74
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,340
this plan won't work.

75
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,540
The amount is too much,

76
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,170
and the time required is too long.

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,730
Look, what do you think

78
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,820
about combining these two?

79
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,730
Take a look.

80
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,060
These two.

81
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,380
They don't really go together.

82
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,500
Why not?

83
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,060
I think they work well together.

84
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,850
Now you're just mixing things up randomly.

85
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,130
Look at mine.

86
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,780
Braised beef with potatoes is a dish, right?

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,250
Mashed potatoes are a side.

88
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,020
Put them together, and it's both nutritious and healthy.

89
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,660
You have quite an appetite.

90
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,290
Isn't this just my normal portion?

91
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,020
Seeing you eat well puts my mind at ease.

92
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,020
Wait a second.

93
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,220
Why did you only order one bowl of rice?

94
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,220
That's not enough.

95
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,020
You're finally eating normal food?

96
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,170
What happened to your "grass"?

97
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,900
I quit.

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,660
I need to eat more

99
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,980
and build some muscle so I can beat you.

100
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,050
Look at you, acting all tough.

101
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,700
See you at the boxing gym after work.

102
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,460
Sure.

103
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,930
So, you're officially back now,

104
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,660
Ms. Qiao?

105
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,850
Why?

106
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,980
Got any problems you need my help with?

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,780
Zhou,

108
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,410
I heard you took on Duan Mengmeng's reconstruction.

109
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,250
That face is a real challenge.

110
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,700
So many hospitals couldn't handle it.

111
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,290
Are you sure you can?

112
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,660
I have been really busy lately.

113
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,140
But if you're asking for my help,

114
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,660
I might consider it.

115
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,980
Alright then.

116
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,140
Since you love meddling in things,

117
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,980
I'll show you my plan while we order takeout.

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,930
Look at you, can't even be polite when asking for help.

119
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,580
Forget it.

120
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,660
I'll help you anyway.

121
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,140
Don't get all smug now.

122
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,250
You...

123
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,050
Don't forget, I'm your boss!

124
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,490
Not much of a boss, though.

125
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,580
Other bosses are eating abalone,

126
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,170
and you're having takeout on my tab.

127
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,140
Turn a little this way.

128
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,290
Here.

129
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,020
My face is all red, swollen, and itchy.

130
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,810
It hurts when I press on it.

131
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,290
See? Just a light press and it hurts.

132
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,930
Let's take it one step at a time, okay?

133
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,340
Alright.

134
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,050
- You first. - Doctor.

135
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,140
That's my daughter.

136
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,730
I'm her niece.

137
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,930
She's my sister.

138
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,370
What I meant was

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,540
how did your face end up like this?

140
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,540
From injections.

141
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,290
What kind of injections?

142
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,460
Hyaluronic acid.

143
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,850
Hyaluronic... what?

144
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,930
Rejuvenation injections.

145
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,250
Rejuvenation injections.

146
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,100
When did you get them?

147
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,020
Six months ago, you gave me one.

148
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,580
We both got ours from her.

149
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,050
She did hers by herself.

150
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,730
Each shot costs over 4,000 yuan.

151
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,730
That's way too expensive.

152
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,170
Could you say less, please?

153
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,490
Did you understand all that?

154
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,700
So, six months ago,

155
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,610
I gave you a rejuvenation injection.

156
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,460
Afterward, your mom thought it was too expensive,

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,140
so you started injecting yourself.

158
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,220
And you gave injections to both of them too, right?

159
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,780
Right.

160
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,930
Mainly because your injection worked so well.

161
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,980
They were tempted but thought it was too expensive.

162
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,220
4,000 yuan

163
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,610
for just one month's effect.

164
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,700
You don't even earn that much in a month.

165
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,170
Please stop talking.

166
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,930
How are you feeling now?

167
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,810
Just pressing here hurts.

168
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,170
Mine's all red, swollen, and breaking out.

169
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,410
I can't even sleep at night.

170
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,340
It feels like a hard shell.

171
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,930
Let me take a look.

172
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,050
Like this? Does it hurt?

173
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,850
Yes!

174
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,020
Where did you learn to give injections?

175
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,700
Just from a tutorial video.

176
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,410
I watched it once and picked it up.

177
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,730
I've done it multiple times.

178
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,850
It was fine before,

179
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,290
just messed up this time.

180
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,980
You're not using a licensed institution,

181
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,370
not a licensed professional,

182
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,980
and not a sterile environment.

183
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,410
This isn't an accident,

184
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,660
it was bound to go wrong sooner or later.

185
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,850
Yeah...

186
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,460
What you have now

187
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,900
is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction.

188
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,100
Rejuvenation injections can cause swelling,

189
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,100
and the effects accumulate.

190
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,780
Once or twice might be okay,

191
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,290
but by the third or fourth time, problems start to show.

192
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,580
I'll prescribe you some medication.

193
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,980
Take it consistently.

194
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,700
Come back for a follow-up next week.

195
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,050
I understand you wanna save money,

196
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,700
but you must go to a licensed hospital

197
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,220
and see a qualified doctor, okay?

198
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,250
I just wanted to ask...

199
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,930
At my age,

200
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,900
is there any kind of discount here?

201
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,660
Ma'am, I'm really sorry.

202
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,850
Unfortunately, we...

203
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,610
I've seen a psychiatrist.

204
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,700
There's no such policy.

205
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,250
And I've already started treatment.

206
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,780
Look, I can help you...

207
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,700
Never thought being ugly

208
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,850
could lead to BDD.

209
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,370
Actually, I didn't use to be ugly.

210
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,220
This was me on my wedding day.

211
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,700
I hadn't had any cosmetic work done then.

212
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,410
Your husband was quite handsome.

213
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,810
Exactly. That's the problem.He was too handsome.

214
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,220
After we got together,

215
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,810
everyone thought I wasn't good enough for him.

216
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,370
And sure enough,

217
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,100
two years in,

218
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,660
he was dead set on divorcing me.

219
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,900
I begged him for over half a year,

220
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,980
cried, made scenes, even threatened suicide. Nothing worked.

221
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,020
In the end, I had no choice but to agree.

222
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,140
Did he remarry later?

223
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,100
Nine months.

224
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,540
Just nine months.

225
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,730
He remarried only nine months after our divorce.

226
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,810
Can you believe that?

227
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,780
He must've been cheating on me

228
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,050
before he asked for the divorce.

229
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,170
Honestly, I really wanted to see

230
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,580
what that homewrecker looked like.

231
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,850
Could she really be better-looking than me?

232
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,420
When they got married,

233
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,940
I almost succeeded in crashing the wedding.

234
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,220
But he had already taken precautions.

235
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,890
In the end, I was thrown out.

236
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,980
Have you seen them since then?

237
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,180
After the wedding,

238
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,490
they moved to Shanghai together.

239
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,180
Got it.

240
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,370
So...

241
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,370
that's when you started all the cosmetic procedures?

242
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,180
What year was that?

243
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,650
2008.

244
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,300
The year you went abroad.

245
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,770
That's when I met Li Qi.

246
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,220
Sorry.

247
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,820
What are you doing? Can't you watch where you're going?

248
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,010
I'm so sorry.

249
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,820
Are you here to cancel your membership too?

250
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,700
Hurry up then.

251
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,370
I'm honestly speechless with that person.

252
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,490
You got the injection, you used it,

253
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,100
and now you're telling me there's a problem?

254
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,850
Get lost!

255
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,730
What are you doing?

256
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,420
Are you okay?

257
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,340
I gave you so much money to buy those injections,

258
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,850
and you have the nerve to scam me?

259
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,340
The product was faulty?

260
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,060
He's the one who sold it to you?

261
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,250
Come with me to the police station.

262
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,060
You're a victim too.

263
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,340
You paid a fortune for that low-quality junk,

264
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,180
because that bastard tricked you.

265
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,100
Don't worry.

266
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,130
I'll testify for you.

267
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,700
Trust me, come with me to the police station.

268
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,770
Some roads, once you take them, there's no turning back.

269
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,060
Chong have to head south.

270
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,890
That's why I...

271
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,340
They've probably already cleaned up after themselves.

272
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,130
You won't find a trace of them.

273
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,300
You...

274
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,580
You're gonna testify for me?

275
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,650
Who testify for you?

276
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,490
Hui jumped off a building.

277
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,180
She's dead. Do you even know that?

278
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,530
If it hadn't been for you back then...

279
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,730
She begged me, okay?

280
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,370
She kept begging and begging.

281
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,940
I only told her where she could get it done.

282
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,890
Whether she went or not was her own decision.

283
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,820
Didn't I come to you and ask you

284
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,650
to do the procedure for her?

285
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,580
And you flat out refused, didn't you?

286
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,420
Zhou Jingwen.

287
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,610
Zhou Jingwen, didn't I warn you too?

288
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,770
If you didn't do it for her,

289
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,250
she would go find someone else.

290
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,850
Now that it's all said and done,

291
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,300
you're the one who killed her.

292
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,100
There's a free trial class Friday afternoon.

293
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,250
Register on site.

294
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,730
Location: Renji Tower.

295
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,370
Mom,

296
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,650
these shoes are so dirty. Why are they on the table?

297
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,370
Jingwen bought these for me. Don't touch them.

298
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,250
Alright.

299
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,530
I'll hide them over there for you, okay?

300
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,010
Mom,

301
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,370
it's raining! Come inside quickly!

302
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,890
You're gonna slip!

303
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,250
Let her play.

304
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,700
If she falls, don't come crying to me.

305
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,300
She's always been like this.

306
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,460
Come down and play.

307
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,100
Come down and join us.

308
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,250
Why is she screaming again?

309
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,980
Maybe go upstairs and check on her?

310
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,610
What's happening?

311
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,580
Nothing will happen.

312
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,490
She's not right

313
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,940
in the head.

314
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,340
Medicine...

315
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,420
I heard in the last class,

316
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,730
two girls had problems.

317
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,530
Their whole bodies got messed up.

318
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,130
You think that won't happen in our group?

319
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,300
They probably just weren't careful.

320
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,530
Everything has risks.

321
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,010
Anyway, I think the sooner you learn, the sooner you make money.

322
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,100
Can't overthink it.

323
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,770
One of my coworkers only did two training sessions,

324
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,980
then went to work at a beauty clinic.

325
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,180
Just doing injections nets her 20 to 30K a month.

326
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,420
Unlike me...

327
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,730
Standing behind a counter every day,

328
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,820
serving picky customers,

329
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,980
barely making 6K.

330
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,370
Well, you're still doing better than me.

331
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,060
Our school wanted to send us to factories.

332
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,130
I didn't want to go,

333
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,650
so I just ran with the tuition.

334
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,850
You didn't tell your family?

335
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,460
Of course not.

336
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,060
They'd break my legs if they found out.

337
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,820
My plan is, once I've finished training,

338
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,340
and I'm making 20–30K a month

339
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,940
like your coworker,

340
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,980
then I'll tell them.

341
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,850
Investing in yourself is always the safest bet.

342
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,180
I heard the instructor teaching us thread lifts today

343
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,010
is pretty young too,

344
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,130
also a woman,

345
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,700
makes millions a year.

346
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,530
Seriously?

347
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,890
Yeah.

348
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,700
She can make that much?

349
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,580
Just send me the money, please.

350
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,820
It's only 5,000 yuan, super worth it.

351
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,610
Please!

352
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,300
But spots are limited for this program!

353
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,460
See? So many people came.

354
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,490
They're making that much?

355
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:16,980
Yeah.

356
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,650
Oh my god.

357
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,300
- When can I... - Let's go in.

358
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,340
Who wouldn't be interested?

359
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,490
It's about making money!

360
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:23,940
Exactly.

361
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,650
In life, making choices is the most important thing.

362
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,220
The same opportunity,

363
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,100
some people only see risk,

364
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,100
others see potential.

365
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,530
Come.

366
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,100
Is this surgery really that difficult?

367
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,100
Enough to get the two goddesses of Gemu to join forces again?

368
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,700
Even burying the hatchet with a smile?

369
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,180
Look at you, getting bolder,

370
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,940
daring to joke about the two of us.

371
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,530
You think he's joking?

372
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,980
You may not be a goddess,

373
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,060
but I definitely am.

374
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,650
Alright.

375
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,370
Manman,

376
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,420
nervous?

377
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,340
A little.

378
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,420
Me too.

379
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,820
Think we'll still have jobs after today?

380
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,300
That depends on Ms. Zhou's skills.

381
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,940
Hey,

382
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,980
stop scaring her.

383
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,220
How could I mess up?

384
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,730
As long as she doesn't drag me down.

385
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,490
Alright.

386
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,300
I'll do the nose, you harvest the rib.

387
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,100
Let's begin.

388
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,530
Hook.

389
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,490
Oh my god.

390
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,300
It's like glue in there.

391
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,850
You'd never know without opening it up.

392
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,340
The whole structure is wrecked.

393
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,940
The implant's shifted.

394
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,490
The septum is deviated.

395
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,420
The alar cartilage is asymmetrical.

396
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,060
Big job coming your way, Zhou.

397
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,940
You guys are removing the capsule?

398
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,770
At my last clinic,

399
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,250
the doctors didn't even bother.

400
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,700
Because it's hard to deal with.

401
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,130
And very few can remove it

402
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,300
as cleanly as Ms. Zhou.

403
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,220
But if you don't remove it,

404
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,420
there's a risk of capsular contracture.

405
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,010
That could affect the shape of the nose.

406
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,460
Cleared, Ms. Zhou.

407
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,420
You even brought a fan club to the surgery.

408
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,820
Ms. Qiao, you're not bad either.

409
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,220
But I can't afford your services.

410
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,850
Mr. Chu,

411
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,580
you came in person?

412
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,460
The way you look after your disciples,

413
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,340
I'm actually jealous.

414
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,650
No.

415
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,700
I just came to take a peek.

416
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,490
Honestly, this surgery

417
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,300
is like post-disaster reconstruction.

418
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,530
A series of meticulous steps.

419
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,610
It really tests your skill.

420
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,850
Here.

421
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,940
Your turn to sculpt.

422
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,490
Later, let my mentor

423
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,940
check your work.

424
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,180
Got it.

425
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,620
Jingwen and Qiao Yang together

426
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,250
is like Black Widow and Wonder Woman

427
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,180
teaming up.

428
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,010
I'm just here munching popcorn,

429
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,770
waiting for them to save the world.

430
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,770
You really watch a lot of movies.

431
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,220
Alright, I'm good.

432
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,330
Back to binge-watching my shows.

433
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:21,860
What,

434
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,980
not staying for the ending here?

435
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,250
No suspense left.

436
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,730
Why is it that when I follow your method,

437
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,490
my sculpt still feels off?

438
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,570
Let me see.

439
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,770
Not bad at all.

440
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,940
You know the saying,

441
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,570
"Teach your apprentice too well, and the master will lose their job."

442
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,330
So you did hold back.

443
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:58,940
Ms. Zhou,

444
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,330
you're making me anxious now.

445
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,050
Go away.

446
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,860
Hook.

447
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,380
Perfect.

448
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,940
Why do you have that weird disco ball lamp in your house?

449
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,980
Qin Gui bought it.

450
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,380
They sent the wrong item.

451
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,090
Right.

452
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,220
I love that guy!

453
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,700
Doesn't it remind you

454
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,380
of our college dance parties?

455
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,420
Yes, totally.

456
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,980
I miss those dances so much.

457
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,380
Do you remember this photo of us?

458
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,900
With who?

459
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,860
You and me, of course.

460
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,420
Me?

461
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,940
You?

462
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,570
How come I don't have that picture?

463
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,180
At the start of the semester, that guy...

464
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,490
I forgot his name.

465
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,700
He bought a new camera,

466
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,620
and took a photo of us two.

467
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,460
Right at the campus gate.

468
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,050
Even if we combined both our skills now,

469
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,940
we couldn't bring ourselves back to that

470
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,570
collagen-packed version of us.

471
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,420
So true.

472
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,980
Time shows no mercy.

473
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,530
You got old.

474
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,900
I got old?

475
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,700
I didn't change.

476
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,220
Look, totally the same.

477
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,620
You... you've gotten prettier.

478
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,090
Let me see,

479
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,660
what cosmetic treatments have you done?

480
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,490
None!

481
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,380
Cheek fillers?

482
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,490
Get outta here.

483
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,140
I'm taking this.

484
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,460
Where are you taking it?

485
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,180
Home.

486
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,250
No way!

487
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:42,980
Come on, give it back.

488
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,810
Finders keepers.

489
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,900
Don't snatch it.

490
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,700
I'll print another one for you, okay?

491
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,330
So stingy, Zhou Jingwen!

492
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,810
You haven't changed one bit.

493
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,290
Just like your drinking tolerance.

494
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,490
Still as bad as ever.

495
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,570
My drinking is bad?

496
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,940
I'm a great drinker!

497
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,180
I've never been drunk!

498
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,810
You clearly don't remember yourself.

499
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,810
First year of grad school,

500
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,900
eight people couldn't hold you back.

501
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,730
You insisted on sewing a whole plate of pork intestines

502
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,330
into a train.

503
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,460
With chives as the thread.

504
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,250
Was that you?

505
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,530
It stank!

506
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,380
And you even wanted to stuff it into your bag.

507
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,660
You remember that?

508
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,220
I remember all your embarrassing moments for you.

509
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,420
Xing, it was him.

510
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,770
He kept forcing drinks on me.

511
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,220
That old creep,

512
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,090
he had a crush on you.

513
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,290
And you didn't even reject him.

514
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,900
Would he have dared try that on me?

515
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,180
One slap and he'd be gone.

516
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,770
Well, I just wanted to get

517
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,460
two steps closer to the operating table.

518
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,530
I'm not like you.

519
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,570
You open your mouth and food's right there.

520
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,220
I've had to rely on my own effort.

521
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,180
Then you're just seeing the thief eat meat

522
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,490
but not seeing the thief get beaten.

523
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,090
When I was grinding hard,

524
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,010
you were probably still sleeping in the dorm.

525
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,490
I saw it all.

526
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,940
Otherwise why would you have always

527
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,490
been my imaginary rival?

528
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,700
Then you should really thank me.

529
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,220
If it weren't for me,

530
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,050
you wouldn't have been pushed,

531
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,180
step by step, to the professional level you're at today.

532
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,490
Come on, a toast to my imaginary enemy.

533
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,900
Are you sure you didn't buy fake booze tonight?

534
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,940
I feel like I'm sobering up more and more.

535
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,900
You've already been to the bathroom a dozen times.

536
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,490
You've metabolized everything by now.

537
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,420
Do you have kidney problems or something?

538
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,730
Do you have any basic medical knowledge?

539
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,660
That just proves my kidneys are working great.

540
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,980
Don't argue with me.

541
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,460
I'm about to transform!

542
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,330
Let me transform, come on,

543
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,380
hand me a piece of intestine so I can stitch it up.

544
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,290
How about slicing open your own belly

545
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,860
and stitching your own intestines?

546
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,140
Then I'll have to stitch your intestines.

547
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,180
Get lost.

548
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,940
You know what?

549
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,460
I only recently found out

550
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,940
that my mom and my brother

551
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,810
have been living in Rongchuan for quite a while.

552
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,460
That day you straight-up lied to my face,

553
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,810
insisting that woman wasn't your mom.

554
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,900
I didn't even want to call you out.

555
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,570
You two have the exact same features,

556
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,290
like you were made from the same mold.

557
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,220
Lying like that

558
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,860
is a disgrace to my profession.

559
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,620
I wasn't trying to fool you.

560
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,180
I left home after college

561
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,660
and never kept in touch.

562
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,620
And I just found out

563
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,010
my mom has Alzheimer's.

564
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,330
What stage is she at?

565
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,010
Early stage.

566
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,620
But this disease is so unpredictable.

567
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,980
In a few months,

568
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,810
she might not even recognize me.

569
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,860
But maybe that's for the best.

570
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,090
You know,

571
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,980
when I was a kid, my biggest goal

572
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,290
was to get away from home,

573
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,900
get away from her.

574
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,180
All I felt was hate.

575
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,620
But if she doesn't remember anything now,

576
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,050
what's the point of all that hate?

577
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,180
There is no point.

578
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,220
Of course not.

579
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,380
When I was little, my greatest joy

580
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,140
was going against my dad.

581
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,180
He was too authoritarian,

582
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,900
like a tyrant.

583
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,700
Everyone around him had to live by his rules,

584
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,330
or they were wrong.

585
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,050
And he has no sense of aesthetics whatsoever.

586
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,900
Not a single ounce of interest in life.

587
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,290
My mom, someone who loves beauty, who understands beauty

588
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,660
actually spent most of her life with him.

589
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,250
It's just... so sad.

590
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,940
I used to think

591
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,620
that standing up to my dad

592
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,420
meant I was taking control of my own life.

593
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,380
But recently I've realized...

594
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,090
I'm actually a lot like him.

595
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,530
In fact,

596
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,220
I haven't really cared about my mom either.

597
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,460
I've never done anything for her.

598
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,090
I'm just like my dad.

599
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,250
Selfish.

600
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,380
We're the same.

601
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,730
All selfish.

602
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,220
Then maybe I'm a bit better than you.

603
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,900
Seriously? You're competing on this too?

604
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,380
We really

605
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,330
put effort

606
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,290
into this renovation and design.

607
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,380
We even hired a top interior designer from China

608
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,250
to help us with the layout.

609
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,700
If you're not satisfied with your facial features,

610
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,140
then you need professionals like us

611
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,660
to make the proper adjustments.

612
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,940
That black mole you've got，

613
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,180
it's actually a type of cellular tumor.

614
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,420
There's a risk it could become cancerous.

615
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,660
It has to be removed.

616
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,860
Just pick a good date and we'll take care of it.

617
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,460
Hello, everyone.

618
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,900
Once you're in, make sure to click that follow button.

619
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,940
Drop your questions in the chat.

620
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,490
I'll answer them one by one for you.

621
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,290
Here.

622
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,660
Ouch.

623
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,460
Hurts, doesn't it?

624
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,140
It's fine.

625
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,770
We'll have someone come change your dressing later.

626
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,180
It looks great.

627
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,570
Who sculpted this nose?

628
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,570
It's perfect.

629
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,460
Dr. Lu.

630
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,380
You have surgery today? What a coincidence.

631
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,900
Coincidence? Please.

632
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,090
I came here on purpose to catch you.

633
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,860
Why have you been avoiding me since we got back from Qianqiao?

634
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,420
Avoiding you? Why would I do that?

635
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,330
You're overthinking.

636
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,250
We're adults. What's with the act?

637
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,530
Be my girlfriend. Okay?

638
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,290
What is this, a drama?

639
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,660
How do you two not cringe at such cheesy lines?

640
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,730
Wait! Sit.

641
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,180
Be my witness.

642
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,940
Okay.

643
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,700
In broad daylight,

644
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,050
nothing to hide.

645
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,380
It's official, you hear me?

646
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,380
Let the world know we're together.

647
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,330
Give me a title.

648
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,980
You think the world even knows who we are?

649
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,250
"Title"? Seriously?

650
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,490
You care so much about appearances?

651
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,010
Lu Ziyou, honestly...

652
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,940
you're more childish than I thought.

653
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,770
You're more fake than I thought.

654
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,620
Not just fake, cowardly too.

655
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,460
And spineless.

656
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,700
Lu Ziyou!

657
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,010
At the very least, I'm your superior.

658
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,330
Watch your tone and the occasion when you speak.

659
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,330
Know your place.

660
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,290
What are you doing?

661
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:50,730
What are you doing?

662
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,010
Are you crazy or something?

663
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,220
You should mention more often that you're my boss.

664
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,010
It's kind of a turn-on.

665
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,700
See that?

666
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,980
That's what happens

667
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,050
when you date someone from work.

668
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,700
Seriously, you two better not date childish guys

669
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,490
in the future.

670
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,010
What a nutcase.

671
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,250
What now?

672
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,570
So you admit you're my girlfriend.

673
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,700
You heard that, right?

674
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,770
It's official!

675
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,180
Ms. Qiao,

676
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,770
just give him the title already.

677
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,530
Get lost!

678
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,570
There she is.

679
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,490
Duan Mengmeng,

680
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,380
you're recovering pretty well.

681
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,420
The swelling's all gone.

682
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,900
Who are you looking at?

683
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,900
The guy in the blue suit is my ex-husband.

684
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,530
The woman next to him is his current wife.

685
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,770
So ugly.

686
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,180
You two are the experts.

687
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,250
You tell me, am I better looking,

688
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,730
or that homewrecker?

689
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,980
You told us

690
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,570
something life-threatening was happening,

691
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,620
and rushed us over

692
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,810
for this?

693
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,770
Isn't this a big deal?

694
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,940
Okay, it's not nothing.

695
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,050
But honestly, if you want revenge,

696
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,050
you should go straight to the person who wronged you.

697
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,620
Aren't you already divorced?

698
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,330
Exactly.

699
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,570
Weren't you in therapy?

700
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,330
You used to criticize yourself,

701
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,420
now you're projecting it onto others.

702
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,140
Chen Ming!

703
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,940
Who's that?

704
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,810
Why haven't we left yet?

705
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,860
She's emotionally unstable. Just keep an eye on her.

706
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,380
What if something really happens?

707
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,530
If something really were going to happen, it would've happened long ago.

708
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,010
We've been divorced for years.

709
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,900
Can't you get on with your own life?

710
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,330
My life was ruined by you!

711
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,980
What "own life" do I even have left?

712
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,380
All the surgeries on my face,

713
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,700
all the suffering, that's all because of you!

714
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,330
You insisted on divorcing me.

715
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,810
Fine.

716
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,090
I figured it must be because I wasn't pretty enough.

717
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,420
I couldn't attract you anymore.

718
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,490
So, all these years,

719
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,010
I just kept getting plastic surgery.

720
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,180
I kept altering myself.

721
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,090
I even saw a therapist.

722
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,180
And for what?

723
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,420
For a fox like her?

724
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,490
Put your hands down.

725
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,050
If you want to talk, then talk.

726
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,770
If Gemu really gets acquired by Jiao Ai,

727
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,770
where would you go?

728
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,010
That's impossible.

729
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,420
I won't let that happen.

730
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,180
Then I'll just stick with Gemu

731
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,770
and share its fate.

732
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,860
Hearing that actually moves me a bit.

733
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,290
I think you've just become dependent on me.

734
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,490
Exactly.

735
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,900
For the second half of my life, I'm relying on you.

736
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,420
Do your best, Zhou.

737
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,620
Jingwen, hurry over to my place!

738
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,810
Two girls are in serious trouble.

739
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,860
Mom, don't go there!

740
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,380
This is really bad.

741
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,010
Hurry!

742
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,220
Since we've been divorced for so long,

743
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:19,980
then tell me,

744
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,660
why did you want to divorce me back then?

745
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,330
At least she doesn't ask me a hundred times a day

746
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,050
if she's pretty, if she looks good.

747
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,220
It's that simple.

748
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,770
You just hated how I didn't look good enough.

749
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,180
Do you remember

750
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,940
when we first met at the wholesale market,

751
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,050
selling furs?

752
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,050
Back then, everyone in the market

753
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,730
knew you.

754
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,730
You were confident, generous, and capable.

755
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,330
No matter how difficult the order,

756
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,730
it always came easily to you.

757
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,380
Some people

758
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,330
even came all the way from Russia to buy from you.

759
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,730
Do you know what I was thinking back then?

760
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,860
I thought, this woman is incredible.

761
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,220
I'm definitely going to win her over.

762
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,010
But after we got married,

763
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,620
everything changed.

764
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,980
You ask me why?

765
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,380
At least I know one thing for sure.

766
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,420
Our divorce

767
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,250
had nothing to do with you being pretty or not.

768
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,940
It had no connection to that.

769
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,700
I'm happy to see that you're recovering well.

770
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,860
The surgery was a success.

771
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,660
Now you can start a new life.

772
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,460
I'm really happy now.

773
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,330
I truly hope you find happiness too.

774
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,090
Quick! Someone help!

775
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,090
This has been happening for days!

776
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,660
They scream so loudly at night.

777
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,140
Yeah, it's really scary to listen to.

778
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,490
Hurry! Someone's about to die!

779
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,330
Mom!

780
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:48,860
Go!

781
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,620
Don't move!

782
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,050
Auntie, what are you doing here?

783
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,620
This is the doctor! Hurry!

784
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,620
She started yelling early this morning.

785
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,140
All the customers in the shop ran off.

786
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,330
Mom kept saying Jingwen was calling her,

787
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,490
so she ran up here.

788
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,330
Let me see.

789
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,530
Mom, don't touch her!

790
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,620
I've already called an ambulance.

791
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,770
You guys get ready.

792
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,140
- You need to go to the hospital. - No.

793
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,380
We won't go to the hospital.

794
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,290
I'm not going.

795
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,460
Listen to me.

796
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,250
If you don't go to the hospital with this situation,

797
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,700
you won't make it. Do you understand?

798
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,770
Jingwen?

799
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,700
Where's Wenwen?

800
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,250
Mom.

801
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:34,900
Wait a second!

802
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,570
Wait!

803
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,180
They haven't gone yet.

804
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,980
Jingwen!

805
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,460
Where's Jingwen?

806
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,420
Jingwen!

807
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,490
Mom!

808
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,700
Mom!

809
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,620
Jingwen!

810
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,290
Mom!

811
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,700
No.

812
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,620
Mom, what are you doing?

813
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,380
The van has already left.

814
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,010
Why did you

815
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,940
even call her over?

816
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,980
Well, she's a doctor, right?

817
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,940
Your sister hasn't even eaten yet.

818
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,900
Let's go home and eat.

819
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,010
Are you hungry?

820
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,250
Come on, let's go home.

821
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,570
How did this get so serious?

822
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,090
I was about to ask you the same thing.

823
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,210
So many abscesses,

824
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,610
I've never seen anything like it.

825
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,650
Looking at the symptoms,

826
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,650
it looks like an infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria.

827
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,490
The current treatment is

828
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,690
to remove their abscesses and infected tissue.

829
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,530
She had 137 stitches.

830
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,980
This one had 112 stitches.

831
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,380
All their abscesses and infected tissue were removed.

832
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,490
We couldn't perform any tests.

833
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,420
We'll have to wait until they wake up

834
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,820
to understand what happened.

835
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,530
You can tell too, right?

836
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,570
It looks very much like an infection

837
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,530
caused by an unregulated medical procedure.

838
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,210
A while ago, Lu Ziyou told me

839
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,570
about a family doing injections at home,

840
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,740
and their faces turned rotten.

841
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,170
I think these two girls are in a similar situation.

842
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,420
These two girls

843
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,010
probably don't have medical knowledge.

844
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,460
Their entire bodies are already infected,

845
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,460
and they still won't come to the hospital.

846
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,130
This is really something.

847
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,740
What's wrong with you?

848
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,570
You've been sighing non-stop these past few days.

849
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,170
It's still about the shares of Tang.

850
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,980
The past few days, Qin Gui has gone to Shanghai

851
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,530
and met with General Manager from Weijian Group.

852
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,420
There's still no result.

853
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,860
Tang really got himself into big trouble.

854
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,380
If he sells to Li Qi,

855
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,940
Gemu is finished.

856
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,650
But Tang probably doesn't want to

857
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,780
sell his shares to Li Qi.

858
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,210
But Li Qi has the leverage on him,

859
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,010
right?

860
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,490
It's fine.

861
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,860
If the piano's ruined,

862
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,420
I'll take you to play the cello.

863
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,010
Let's go.

864
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,780
No way.

865
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,010
How's your mood today?

866
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,650
It's okay.

867
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,260
Yeah?

868
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,260
Your temperature?

869
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,780
37.2°C.

870
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,780
Good.

871
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,460
Number 23, wake up.

872
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,340
What's your temperature? Did you use the bathroom?

873
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,690
Do you know Shi Jin from Bojin Group?

874
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,010
Shi Jin?

875
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,010
Our senior disciple.

876
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,260
She was a big name in academia back in school.

877
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,210
Then she switched to working with medical equipment

878
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,260
and has been doing really well.

879
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,170
Have you met her?

880
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,820
She's interested in investing in the downstream?

881
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,900
She's interested.

882
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,460
It was arranged by Mr. Chu.

883
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,090
I met her briefly,

884
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,460
and she's very interested

885
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,420
in taking over Tang's shares.

886
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,260
I invited her to come over in a couple of days

887
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,690
to visit Gemu for an inspection.

888
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,380
By coincidence,

889
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,050
she's flying to Rongchuan today.

890
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,380
That's why

891
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,420
I rushed back this morning

892
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,420
to make some preparations

893
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,380
and give her a warm welcome.

894
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,940
That's great.

895
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,340
This must be done.

896
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,010
This is Gemu's last chance.

897
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,380
Send me the flight number.

898
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,210
I'll book a private room.

899
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,210
I'm busy right now, I'll call you back later.

900
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,420
What?

901
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,460
The two girls upstairs are back.

902
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,340
The older sister has already left.

903
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,980
I didn't tell Zhou Kai you came.

904
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:22,820
Okay.

905
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,530
Then I won't go up.

906
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,170
There are kids at home.

907
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,490
I'm afraid they might have an infectious disease.

908
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,940
It's okay.

909
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,940
Wait for me here.

910
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,570
Okay.

911
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,820
Coming.

912
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,980
Coming.

913
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,650
How did you get back so fast?

914
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,530
Wait.

915
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,050
Don't close the door yet.

916
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,570
Let me take a look.

917
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:03,980
You're burning.

918
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,380
Come, sit down.

919
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,420
Don't rush, don't struggle.

920
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,780
Sit down.

921
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,130
Don't move anymore.

922
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,420
Your wound will open up.

923
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,460
Come.

924
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,340
I...

925
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,650
I'm not going to the hospital with you.

926
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,940
Is there someone who told you not to go to the hospital?

927
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,610
No.

928
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,300
Did someone tell you

929
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,460
that a doctor would come

930
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,530
and asked you not to make a fuss?

931
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,090
Did you guys do cosmetic procedures?

932
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,380
How do you know?

933
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,050
In this environment,

934
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,130
you won't heal.

935
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,340
It will only get worse.

936
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,570
You're having a high fever now,

937
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,130
which is a sign of worsening infection.

938
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,650
There are so many sores on your body.

939
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,420
If you keep delaying,

940
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,900
even going to the hospital won't help.

941
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,420
Am I gonna die?

942
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,690
That depends on what you do.

943
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,130
No.

944
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,820
My sister won't abandon me.

945
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,690
She went to find the person in charge.

946
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,130
She said she would definitely cure me.

947
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,300
The person in charge?

948
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,940
Have you met her?

949
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,530
No.

950
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,130
But when she called my sister,

951
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,050
she recorded it.

952
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,530
Can I listen to it?

953
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,570
It's on her phone.

954
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,740
But I think there's a backup on the laptop.

955
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,380
It's on the desk.

956
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,340
Yan Tong, Yan Dan ran back home.

957
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,380
Wang Qian said you're in surgery.

958
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,050
I'll go over and check the situation first.

959
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,650
You can come over when you're done.

960
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,820
Okay, got it.

961
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,010
Ms. Qiao.

962
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,610
What's up?

963
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,740
Let's talk inside.

964
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,860
Okay, come in.

965
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,010
What's going on?

966
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,260
Look at this.

967
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:11,820
Here's the thing.

968
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,530
A while ago,

969
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,010
I noticed something was wrong with Xiaoxi.

970
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,090
Yesterday, I found out

971
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,610
that she was dismissed by Jiao Ai.

972
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,530
Why?

973
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:19,940
Look at this.

974
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,460
Li Qi

975
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,210
asked Xiaoxi to teach this class.

976
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,090
She refused,

977
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,530
then turned around and reported it.

978
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,130
As a result, the class was shut down.

979
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,380
Li Qi found an excuse to fire her.

980
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,300
Good job.

981
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,780
Well done,

982
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,340
my apprentice.

983
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,460
What's so good about staying with Jiao Ai?

984
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,380
Tell her

985
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,820
to come back and find me.

986
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,010
Okay.

987
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:41,900
But Ms. Qiao,

988
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,860
if I tell her,

989
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,860
I'm afraid she won't have the courage to come to you,

990
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,650
so it's better if you contact her directly.

991
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,340
Okay.

992
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,650
I'll give her a call later.

993
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,340
Thanks, Ms. Qiao.

994
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,300
No need to thank me, Im happy about it.

995
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,980
Li Qi is becoming more and more unscrupulous in her actions.

996
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,820
When she was at Gemu,

997
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,380
at least your mentor was keeping an eye on her,

998
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,610
so she was a bit more restrained.

999
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,820
But ever since she joined Jiao Ai,

1000
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,090
she's been acting recklessly.

1001
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:04,940
Isn't that right?

1002
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,170
I heard from Xiaoxi

1003
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,690
that the investors behind Jiao Ai are very ambitious,

1004
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,460
putting a lot of pressure on Li Qi and Du Jun.

1005
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,340
So the doctors there are only focused on performance.

1006
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,130
Du Jun alone

1007
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,260
does up to 18 double eyelid surgeries a day.

1008
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,940
Goodness!

1009
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,130
He must be exhausted

1010
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,380
from making so much money.

1011
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,340
And then there's this training program.

1012
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,380
First, they open a class and rake in money,

1013
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,740
then once the training is complete, they're put straight to work.

1014
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,210
It saves a huge chunk of labor costs.

1015
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,170
What a closed-loop system.

1016
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,300
Li Qi's planning is really something.

1017
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:32,780
But that doesn't make sense.

1018
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,210
Her institution has been shut down,

1019
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,300
so how come she's fine?

1020
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,260
XiaoXi tried,

1021
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,130
but couldn't find any evidence

1022
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,380
connecting Li Qi to the training program.

1023
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,530
I heard that two girls in the training program

1024
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,610
were taught to use a nebulizer to inject weight loss protein,

1025
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,940
but ended up having their whole bodies ruined.

1026
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,050
Two girls?

1027
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,490
What's troubling you?

1028
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,780
What's there to hesitate about?

1029
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,690
Tong is just like my sister.

1030
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,570
Seeing her in so much pain makes my heart ache too,

1031
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,010
but you can't rush this.

1032
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,820
If this blows up, it'll ruin your future.

1033
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,010
You won't be able to get into this field again.

1034
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,300
What can you do then?

1035
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,610
Serve food, sell clothes?

1036
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,300
Look at your cousin now,

1037
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,820
how much is she earning every month?

1038
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,610
If you endure this and make it through, you'll succeed.

1039
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,340
When you recover, I'll arrange a job for you.

1040
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,900
Tong,

1041
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,690
hurry up, the car will be here soon.

1042
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,210
Are you ready, Tong?

1043
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,690
Tong!

1044
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,460
What's wrong, Tong?

1045
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,860
Sis, I'm cold.
