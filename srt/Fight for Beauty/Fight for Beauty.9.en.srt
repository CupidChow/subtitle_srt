1
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,260
Didn't you say you wouldn't be the director?

2
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,020
I did.

3
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,050
But things have changed.

4
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,050
I changed my mind.

5
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,980
Can't you at least discuss it with me?

6
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,460
Would you agree if I did?

7
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,690
You agreed when I mentioned Dong.

8
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,380
I never said he wasn't good.

9
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,460
But isn't this an open election?

10
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,100
Of course, I hope you'll support me too.

11
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,900
Think about it.

12
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,900
You're being impulsive.

13
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,570
You can't just act out in front of Tang and the others

14
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,380
just because you're mad at me.

15
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,410
Mr. Qin.

16
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,540
I just made

17
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,060
a perfectly reasonable suggestion.

18
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,690
I'm not being impulsive at all.

19
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,980
Tang Jun, what's going on?

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,380
Didn't you review the cost data?

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,610
We agreed yesterday.

22
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,010
You approved the merger in the meeting.

23
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,410
Why change everything now?

24
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,610
Don't be mad.

25
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,340
Come on, sit down.

26
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,780
Look at that frown.

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,780
You'll get wrinkles.

28
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,130
Where's your shoulder pain again?

29
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,060
Here? Left side?

30
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,450
Right side?

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,500
Which one? I'll massage it.

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,260
That's enough.

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,260
Take the offer.

34
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,730
If you don't, it'll be off the table.

35
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,260
You really think

36
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,780
I don't know what you're up to?

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,780
My father called me

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,940
this afternoon.

39
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,500
Ever since he gave me money to start a business,

40
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,660
I've done so many things.

41
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,260
Not once did he praise me,

42
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,130
he'd scold me every time we met.

43
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,730
But today, he actually complimented me.

44
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,820
He said his friends

45
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,780
kept mentioning Gemu

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,450
when they were playing golf.

47
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,660
And that made him feel proud.

48
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,060
And then he said three words,

49
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,380
"You've made it."

50
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,850
My father

51
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,690
started doing business 40 years ago.

52
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,220
He's seen it all,

53
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,540
the rise and fall of a lot companies.

54
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,130
He wouldn't praise me for no reason.

55
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,660
But I didn't dare ask why.

56
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,570
I've been thinking about it ever since.

57
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,260
What exactly did we do right lately?

58
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,890
Aren't you tired

59
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,690
of all the scheming?

60
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,660
Use that energy to think about

61
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,730
who the real backbone of Gemu is.

62
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,850
And who you should

63
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,260
build stronger ties with.

64
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,490
Look, this robotic arm has a wrist joint.

65
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,340
It has seven degrees of freedom.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,700
Much clearer than previous tools.

67
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,220
Look,

68
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,610
it's as flexible as a human hand.

69
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,540
And it automatically compensates

70
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,170
for hand instability.

71
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,460
It's a surgical robot.

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,050
The Third Hospital has used these for a while.

73
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,140
No way.

74
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,980
You're way too smug today.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,250
Something's up.

76
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,140
I've heard of this.

77
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,140
What's it called?

78
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,850
It's right on the tip of my tongue.

79
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,460
It's...

80
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,370
It's Hainan?

81
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,730
See that?

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,610
5G eliminates distance barriers.

83
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,540
It allows multiple connections.

84
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,610
That's great.

85
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,340
Okay, you've had your turn.

86
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,370
Let me try.

87
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,370
Come on.

88
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,700
Alright.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,580
This is insane, we're in Hainan instantly.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,540
This one?

91
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,050
Yeah.

92
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,100
Ok.

93
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,490
Thumb and middle finger.

94
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,050
So clear.

95
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,050
You're sitting right here,

96
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,100
but you can operate on patients

97
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,220
from the south to the north

98
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,290
of the country.

99
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,340
So cool.

100
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,340
Unbelievable.

101
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,220
This is amazing, let's get one for Gemu.

102
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,020
Sure.

103
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,340
Need a budget?

104
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,900
One remote surgery alone

105
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,900
costs more than traveling for treatment.

106
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,170
The key is, patients don't understand this.

107
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,290
They may not trust it.

108
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,220
And our cost and risk

109
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,290
with the robot

110
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,660
are quite high.

111
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,460
Yeah, there's risk.

112
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,540
But we're already in

113
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,610
the AI era.

114
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,220
It's the first time

115
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,580
the 5G robot surgery

116
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,410
is being used in plastic surgery.

117
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,850
If this clinical trial succeeds,

118
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,220
it'll be a breakthrough for the entire industry.

119
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,780
Yeah.

120
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,250
And not every hospital

121
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,490
has the ability to make this happen.

122
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,730
If we didn't have Mr. Chu supporting us,

123
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,540
we wouldn't be so confident.

124
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,290
Yeah.

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,610
Mr. Chu, please share your professional opinion.

126
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,100
You can give us a more detailed perspective.

127
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,980
Well, this is how I see it.

128
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,370
Any science,

129
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,610
no matter how long its history,

130
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,170
its major breakthroughs

131
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,850
are defined by a few decisive moments.

132
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,460
I think the 5G surgery is one of those moments.

133
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,780
But the money, that's for him to decide.

134
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,490
I can't handle that.

135
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,340
The responsibility still falls on me.

136
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,220
I've always admired

137
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,660
Ms. Qiao's endless pursuit

138
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,050
of new technologies.

139
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,410
I also believe

140
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,660
in your and Mr. Chu's professional judgment.

141
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,100
But,

142
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,460
I can't agree to this blindly.

143
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,050
See?

144
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,250
As expected from the boss.

145
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,220
No money wasted.

146
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,660
About the candidate for the director position,

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,100
I want to talk to you about it.

148
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,780
Mr. Chu,

149
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,700
and it's perfect that you're here too.

150
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,980
Did you hear?

151
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,490
The director's position is up for election.

152
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,460
Why are we having elections?

153
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,980
It's because the bosses don't agree.

154
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,100
They're debating based on doctors' performance,

155
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,810
the industry's influence,

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,170
and the doctors' surgical skills.

157
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,850
Why set so many standards?

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,930
Normally, this kind of thing is just a formality, right?

159
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,700
What were they thinking?

160
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,660
What else could they be thinking?

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,100
They don't want the boss's wife to get the position.

162
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,610
Are you asleep?

163
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,930
No.

164
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,540
Hungry?

165
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,170
Don't put food on my desk,

166
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:27,980
it's all greasy.

167
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,730
It's been a busy morning,

168
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,700
didn't even have time to eat.

169
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,460
Want a bite?

170
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,540
I'm not hungry.

171
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,460
Are you still mad at me?

172
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:45,930
Here.

173
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,780
I was impulsive this morning.

174
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,930
I said some things I shouldn't have.

175
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,370
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,660
Actually, I've been struggling these past couple of days.

177
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,020
We've known each other for nine years, married for five.

178
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,810
I just found out

179
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,580
how little I know about you.

180
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,050
Looking back now,

181
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,220
every time I brought up

182
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,730
your life before going to Germany,

183
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,850
you avoided the topic.

184
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,370
I should've noticed earlier.

185
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,490
Sorry,

186
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,250
I haven't cared for you enough.

187
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,340
Jingwen.

188
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,370
I've talked to Mr. Chu.

189
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,980
It's all in the past.

190
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,370
From now on, whatever happens,

191
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,980
you don't have to bear it alone.

192
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,130
I'm here for you.

193
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,130
I will support you unconditionally.

194
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,060
In the past two months, we've argued

195
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,850
more than we did in the last five years.

196
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,610
When you suddenly said you wanted to run for director,

197
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,010
I thought it over.

198
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,340
I wonder if all these recent things

199
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,820
made you feel insecure.

200
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,460
Jingwen,

201
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,770
I hope you know, no matter what happens,

202
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,460
I won't change how I feel about you.

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,820
We'll always be a family.

204
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,850
Do you remember

205
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,060
the first time we met?

206
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,530
What was the first thing I said to you?

207
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,700
Hello.

208
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,580
No.

209
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,100
You shook my hand.

210
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,730
I said, “Your hand is so warm.”

211
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,250
I still remember that day.

212
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,460
I was in the OR for six or seven hours.

213
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,060
Freezing cold.

214
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,340
But when I held your hand,

215
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,650
I felt alive again.

216
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,890
Those years in Munich

217
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,890
were the darkest for me.

218
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,460
I wasn't fluent in German.

219
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,580
Everything felt foreign.

220
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,370
I broke out in rashes.

221
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,060
The stress was overwhelming.

222
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,060
I spent all my time studying

223
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,610
and interning at the hospital.

224
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,980
I barely spoke to anyone,

225
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,580
until I met you.

226
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,940
You made me feel warm.

227
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,250
You said I feel insecure.

228
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,890
You're half right.

229
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,250
Gemu has too many problems.

230
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,490
both in terms of management

231
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,700
and medical care,

232
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,700
making it impossible for me to let go.

233
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,060
All these uncertainties

234
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,490
are making me feel insecure.

235
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,980
Do you know why I want to be director?

236
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,610
Because I don't want to be passive.

237
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,460
Do you get that?

238
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,770
I totally do.

239
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,700
We built Gemu

240
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,940
from the ground up,

241
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,610
turning it from an empty shell

242
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,250
into what it is today,

243
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,850
piece by piece, together.

244
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,370
Back then,

245
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,890
we haggled with the landlord for months

246
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,770
just to save a few thousand on rent.

247
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,220
No matter where you went,

248
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,490
you always took the red-eye

249
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,490
to save on airfare.

250
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,940
To cut costs,

251
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,730
we painted these walls ourselves.

252
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,220
Jingwen,

253
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,370
I know better than anyone

254
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,250
what you've put into Gemu.

255
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,980
Lately,

256
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,060
it's been too much for you.

257
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,610
People say I crave power,

258
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,700
have a short temper,

259
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,820
and love to control.

260
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,940
I don't care.

261
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,130
But if you think that too,

262
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,770
I don't get it.

263
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,890
Sorry, I was wrong.

264
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,100
I shouldn't have said that.

265
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,610
But I do know you.

266
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,770
Right?

267
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,060
Plastic surgery is Gemu's foundation.

268
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,180
It can't change.

269
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,130
I think all these conflicts stem from

270
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,850
how management views it differently.

271
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,820
Their vision is different.

272
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,890
Maybe it's the different views on Gemu's direction.

273
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,180
There's some disagreement.

274
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,610
Here's my thought.

275
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,610
Since you've already brought up

276
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,770
running for director,

277
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,940
and everyone's on board,

278
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,770
why not go with the flow?

279
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,820
We could find a doctor

280
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,130
from plastic surgery department

281
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,890
for this role.

282
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,340
This way, we maintain control.

283
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,180
I already talked to Qiao Yang.

284
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,610
I suggested she run,

285
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,580
and she didn't refuse.

286
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,340
She's a surgeon.

287
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,130
She's single, a workaholic,

288
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,010
so more work doesn't bother her.

289
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,340
Then you can relax a bit, right?

290
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,460
Think it over.

291
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,650
I'm doing this

292
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,890
not just for Gemu,

293
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,370
but for us.

294
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,060
For our family.

295
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,940
What do you think?

296
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,770
I think

297
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,890
I need some air.

298
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,220
I overheard.

299
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,700
Ms. Qiao's in the race now.

300
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,770
Public competition, it's normal.

301
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,890
No one can stay totally above it

302
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,420
when such an important role is up for grabs.

303
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,490
The easiest mistake

304
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,420
people make

305
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,770
is labeling others.

306
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,530
When interests shift,

307
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,060
it's easy for things to backfire.

308
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,890
I really want to interview you.

309
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,300
You gave up everything to bring her here,

310
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,980
and gave her whatever she wanted.

311
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,250
But she's still not satisfied.

312
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,490
Aren't you surprised at all?

313
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,370
Here I go.

314
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,180
Ms. Li.

315
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,100
Ms. Zhou.

316
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,940
Qin Gui said you're running for director.

317
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,220
Aren't you only focused on surgery?

318
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,770
Don't you and your husband talk about this?

319
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,060
It was your husband who insisted I sign up.

320
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,250
It's my condition for getting the 5G robot.

321
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,730
So that's why, huh?

322
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,460
I thought I was getting slapped in the face.

323
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,180
Your face hasn't been slapped enough yet?

324
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,060
Any new tech or equipment you want

325
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,010
it's just a matter of asking.

326
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,730
Didn't you say that?

327
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,490
Who cares about being director?

328
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,490
I'm not interested at all.

329
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,130
If you keep your promises,

330
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,340
I wouldn't have to bother

331
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,770
with all this mess.

332
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,060
I think Qin Gui's idea is good.

333
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,180
Take a break.

334
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,060
Seriously.

335
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,610
Think about running for it.

336
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,060
I can support you.

337
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,220
It's you who wants to be director, not me.

338
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,530
Don't say those fake words to me.

339
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,650
Now Li Qi wants to merge

340
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,940
the dermatology and plastic surgery departments,

341
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,250
make Gemu focuse more on non-surgical treatments.

342
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,300
That's completely opposite to what I had in mind

343
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,700
when I built Gemu.

344
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,300
If I can stop this,

345
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,770
I don't care who becomes

346
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,370
director.

347
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,610
You need to understand something.

348
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,530
These issues you're talking about

349
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,650
are your problem, not mine.

350
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,300
I know they're my problems.

351
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,460
But you'll have fewer surgeries,

352
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,610
and you don't care?

353
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,770
Did I ever say

354
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,700
I want to stay in your hospital forever?

355
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,610
If I want to do surgery,

356
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,220
I can go anywhere.

357
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,370
If one day Gemu

358
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,060
really becomes what you're saying,

359
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,370
why would I stay?

360
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,700
The next few days

361
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,370
won't be as full of surgeries.

362
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,180
It's because Jiao Ai just opened,

363
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,340
so we're a little affected.

364
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,060
Should I talk to the consultants

365
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,180
and have them figure something out?

366
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,530
No need.

367
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,220
Less is better.

368
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,530
We have more important things to do.

369
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,850
You two, come with me.

370
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,700
Let's go.

371
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,610
This is urgent.

372
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,420
Next, Gemu is going to do a

373
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,940
long-distance surgery plan.

374
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,370
Using the 5G communication Planck robot

375
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,650
for remote surgery.

376
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,980
If we make this happen,

377
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,250
we'll be

378
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,730
the leader in 5G robot.

379
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,650
Of course.

380
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,250
There are only three spots.

381
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,700
I thought of you first.

382
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,610
You're the only one for the job.

383
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,460
These spammers,

384
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,820
they're driving me crazy every day.

385
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,730
Don't look at your phone,

386
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,370
Come back here.

387
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,220
What were you saying?

388
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,980
Robot, right?

389
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,980
5G robot.

390
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,730
No problem, I'm fine with it.

391
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,090
But remember,

392
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,050
you have to handle the training.

393
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,460
I can start training you now.

394
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,010
Let's do it.

395
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,660
I can't right now.

396
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,250
I'm about to take my kid to a tutoring class.

397
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,940
So, tomorrow?

398
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,530
No,

399
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,490
there will be a piano class.

400
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,420
How about the day after?

401
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,860
Drama rehearsal.

402
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,180
And then TOEFL.

403
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,860
The day after that, reading comprehension.

404
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,290
Where's your husband?

405
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,250
He's not doing anything.

406
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,980
He's in charge of sports and math.

407
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,180
We divide the work.

408
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,420
Just check

409
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,250
when you're free.

410
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,730
Don't rush, I'm checking.

411
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,770
Hurry up!

412
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,050
The day after tomorrow.

413
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,490
Well,

414
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,010
Sunday afternoon...

415
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,980
It's ok for me.

416
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,980
Not for me.

417
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,570
Hey, you...

418
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,570
Sunday afternoon we're having family dinner.

419
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,090
Family gathering, I forgot to write it down.

420
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,330
Look, twenty years ago,

421
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,490
who would've thought we'd have video calls on phones?

422
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,460
Ten years ago we still carried cash.

423
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,460
Times change.

424
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,490
We have no choice

425
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,700
but to catch up.

426
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,620
We're getting a head start

427
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,420
with the new tech.

428
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,810
When everyone else catches up

429
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,660
and we're still behind,

430
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,620
we'll be outdated.

431
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,940
Who else but me?

432
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,940
I only have three spots.

433
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,290
You're the first person I thought of.

434
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,460
Ms. Qiao, you're in, right?

435
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:13,900
Of course.

436
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,090
So, who's the lead author when the article's published?

437
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,420
Of course, it'll be Ms. Qiao.

438
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,620
Then what's in it for me?

439
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,770
In ten years,

440
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,660
the concept of hospitals might not even exist.

441
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,250
Doctors won't need to make rounds.

442
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,490
No matter where the patient is,

443
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,380
they'll get the best treatment.

444
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,490
That's the future.

445
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,700
Right, Ms. Qiao.

446
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,290
But you don't need to explain it to me.

447
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,490
Xiaoxi knows that

448
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,900
I'm a huge tech fan.

449
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,940
I never miss the annual

450
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,250
medical equipment expo.

451
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,140
I saw the robot

452
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,980
at the expo two years ago.

453
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,530
But back then, it was just a concept.

454
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,660
I didn't expect it to be in production now.

455
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,140
What I'm saying is,

456
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,180
we can skip the explanations.

457
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,140
Mingjie, you get it.

458
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,770
If I were you,

459
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,290
I wouldn't miss this opportunity.

460
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,530
There are only three spots.

461
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:58,940
You're the first...

462
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,140
I'm the first person you thought of.

463
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,140
Well-trained.

464
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,810
Thanks a lot, Ms. Qiao.

465
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,290
I'm really looking forward to

466
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,290
the success of your first 5G surgery.

467
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,220
I'll definitely be there to observe.

468
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,180
Mingjie, you didn't get what I mean.

469
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,050
I'm formally inviting you

470
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,460
to join this surgery.

471
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,700
Okay.

472
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,050
You didn't get me either.

473
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,460
With my experience,

474
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,700
I'm fine just observing.

475
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,290
I won't be part of the surgery.

476
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,700
Don't be so humble.

477
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,810
I'll be there.

478
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,490
Xiaoxi will be there too.

479
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,380
No need to worry.

480
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,700
You'll catch on quickly.

481
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,900
Wei Xiaoxi, your discipline is still too loose.

482
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,420
Do you usually scold him?

483
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,050
Ms. Qiao,

484
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,810
it's not about discipline.

485
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,220
Think about it.

486
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,530
He's been with Ms. Zhou for years,

487
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,010
they have a deep teacher-student bond.

488
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,460
I know that.

489
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,730
That's why he was the last one I approached.

490
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,050
Now, everyone's talking.

491
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,250
You are

492
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,900
going to run for hospital director.

493
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,980
If he joins your 5G surgery team

494
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,730
at this critical point,

495
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,180
what will Ms. Zhou think?

496
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,290
I'm only doing this for 5G robot.

497
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,660
This is just a formality.

498
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,530
Everyone's taking it too seriously.

499
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,530
You need to take it seriously.

500
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,290
You have the best skills in the hospital.

501
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,620
You should be the director.

502
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,050
I only know surgery.

503
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,420
I don't know about politics.

504
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,620
Being the director is a complicated job.

505
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,620
I'm not suited for it.

506
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,420
My brain is too simple.

507
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,140
Yeah, you're too simple to do this.

508
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,730
You can just keep quiet.

509
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,380
I'm just stating facts.

510
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,490
Look at them,

511
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,290
they're avoiding us.

512
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,290
We haven't gotten anyone on our side, right?

513
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,220
Ms. Qiao, am I good enough?

514
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,490
If Chen Mingjie can do it, so can I.

515
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,220
My experience is a bit less than his,

516
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,050
but I'll definitely work harder than him.

517
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,900
I won't disappoint you.

518
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,980
The robot technology is not hard to master,

519
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,380
but it needs a lot of practice.

520
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,980
Can you do it?

521
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,530
Yes.

522
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,180
I'll start by not sleeping today.

523
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,180
You're determined.

524
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,420
You're in.

525
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,420
Ms. Qiao, still one more.

526
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,530
You're not needed yet.

527
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,490
Zeng,

528
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,530
you young people learn quickly.

529
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,700
Any new trends

530
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,940
in the industry recently?

531
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,490
Of course. Mr. Dong.

532
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,380
I read your new paper,

533
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,730
“Preliminary Study of Collagen Dressing Clinical Effects.”

534
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,660
I really learned a lot.

535
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,180
You really work hard.

536
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,180
I tried to book an appointment with you three months ago,

537
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,290
but couldn't get it.

538
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,140
You still have time for research?

539
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,050
You don't rest at all, Mr. Dong.

540
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,490
Next month, he will be the director of Gemu.

541
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,420
Don't talk about things that aren't officially announced.

542
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,010
Mr. Dong,

543
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,220
you're getting promoted?

544
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,290
My boss Mr. Tang insists on pushing me.

545
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,570
I told him,

546
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,570
I'm focused on my profession.

547
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,010
I'm not interested in management.

548
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,570
But you know,

549
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,980
people like Mr. Tang

550
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,810
once he makes a decision,

551
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,290
it's hard to argue with.

552
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,140
Mainly, he said,

553
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,140
he trusts me to run the hospital.

554
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,460
What can I say?

555
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,700
He's made it clear,

556
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,290
Right?

557
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,420
Well, I'll congratulate you in advance.

558
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,380
Just don't raise our prices!

559
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,220
I won't.

560
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,860
This area might hurt a bit.

561
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,980
Hang in there.

562
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,530
What's so great about being the director?

563
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,660
It's stressful.

564
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,620
You need real skills.

565
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,810
If sales don't improve,

566
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,420
and you don't have enough patients,

567
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,570
how can you even compete?

568
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,940
That's what I mean.

569
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,460
When it comes to industry influence and performance,

570
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,290
if you say you're second,

571
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,940
who in this hospital dares to claim they're first?

572
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,770
I'm not after empty titles.

573
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,090
We just do the hard work.

574
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,140
It's all about real skills.

575
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,330
We earn it with every needle we put in.

576
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,010
Unlike some people,

577
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,900
doing livestreams,

578
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,460
acting cute for their husbands,

579
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,050
and getting ahead.

580
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,220
Done. You look better now.

581
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:39,900
Alright.

582
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,940
Ms. Zhou,

583
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,940
what are you doing here?

584
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,770
Aren't there only two machines?

585
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,050
If I'm not here, where else would I be?

586
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,490
Mr. Dong,

587
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,010
You look stressed.

588
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,530
Your eye bags are showing.

589
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,290
Make an appointment with me, I'll help you out.

590
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,770
Sure, sure.

591
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,290
I need to go livestream first.

592
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,660
Make an appointment with Chen Mingjie.

593
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,660
Sorry, sorry.

594
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,220
Let me adjust it.

595
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,980
What are you looking at? Pull the curtain.

596
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,660
Ready?

597
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,810
Ms. Liu，

598
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,050
don't be nervous, just take your time.

599
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,050
Relax.

600
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,460
Start.

601
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,490
My name is Liu Xinfang.

602
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,900
I'm from Xi'an.

603
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,140
I'm 60 years old.

604
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,980
I want to find my son who has been missing for 15 years.

605
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,180
My son's name is Zhang Zhe.

606
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,570
He loved singing since he was little.

607
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,090
After high school, he went to Beijing.

608
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,290
He said he was going there to chase his music dream.

609
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,900
But unexpectedly,

610
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,460
I haven't seen him since.

611
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,330
No news at all.

612
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,980
If I count, he's 33 now.

613
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,290
Zhang Zhe,

614
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,090
if you're watching,

615
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,090
come home.

616
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,530
Mom misses you.

617
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,010
Can you tell us more about your request?

618
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,330
Look at me now.

619
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,090
Even if I bump into him on the street,

620
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,090
my son probably wouldn't recognize me.

621
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,460
I just hope,

622
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,250
I can look like I did back then.

623
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,530
Back then.

624
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,330
You mean look 15 years younger, right?

625
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,620
It's actually not that easy.

626
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,010
I hope all viewers

627
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,530
to actively leave comments

628
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,250
and help us come up with ideas.

629
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,220
Ms. Liu,

630
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,660
can you share some stories about Zhang Zhe?

631
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,250
This guitar of his

632
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,530
was a gift I bought for him

633
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,180
when I was on a business trip

634
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,220
to Shanghai.

635
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,330
I remember it was a Yamaha.

636
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,330
His music teacher said,

637
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,660
that guitar had a really good sound.

638
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,380
Slacking off again?

639
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,490
Can't you see there are no customers?

640
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,460
Hurry up,

641
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,980
go attract more customers.

642
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,770
Hurry!

643
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,660
You really think you're a singer?

644
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,140
Thermage facelift.

645
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,460
Our viewers know a lot.

646
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,460
Some even know about endogenous growth factors.

647
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,490
Must have seen

648
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,660
my video on facial rejuvenation.

649
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,660
Actually, we have a special

650
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,730
plan for you.

651
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,900
Specially for me?

652
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:37,620
Yes.

653
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,010
The treatment will be in two stages.

654
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,220
In the first stage,

655
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,620
we'll remove wrinkles

656
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,330
and add facial fat.

657
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,770
That's to tighten the skin and remove wrinkles.

658
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,940
Then your apple cheek

659
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,140
will naturally look fuller.

660
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,380
It'll make you look younger.

661
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,980
Ms. Qiao.

662
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,290
Hi.

663
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,220
Let's talk for a bit.

664
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,220
Sure.

665
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,050
About my son…

666
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,460
Let's only talk about work.

667
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,090
Your personal issues are none of my business.

668
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,090
I'm not interested

669
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,330
Sure.

670
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,490
I came to find you

671
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,290
to talk about

672
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,980
the 5G robot surgery.

673
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,530
You've been to the company too.

674
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,050
You saw the operation.

675
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,490
Now my team is short-handed

676
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,220
Come help me.

677
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,220
No.

678
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,180
You have to.

679
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,940
Listen,

680
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,660
if you don't know how to operate

681
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,770
I can teach you.

682
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,730
It's okay if you're a little slow

683
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,180
As long as you practice hard,

684
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,530
you'll get it soon.

685
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,220
What, who's slow?

686
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,620
Are you asking me for help or insulting me?

687
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,460
I already said I won't help.

688
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,380
Your boss is talking to you.

689
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,090
Can you show some basic respect?

690
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,810
Then tell me,

691
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,980
why won't you help?

692
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,490
It's because of my personal issues.

693
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,980
The thing you don't want to talk about.

694
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,180
Well, I'm fully booked.

695
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,290
I'm very busy.

696
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,770
I have to be with my son after work.

697
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,980
This practice you're talking about

698
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,420
will take away my time with him.

699
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,290
Do you understand?

700
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,420
Fine.

701
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,460
I'll help with your surgeries.

702
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,980
How are you going to do it? How many?

703
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,010
Should I send you my schedule?

704
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,490
Sure, send it to me

705
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,010
I'll send you the practice schedule.

706
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:22,860
Wait.

707
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,770
No, no.

708
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,330
Are you playing the boss here?

709
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,810
Sit down.

710
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,660
Have you gone through everyone else before me?

711
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,220
No one helped, so now you came to me?

712
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,090
Can you change your attitude?

713
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,700
Don't be so harsh.

714
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,050
Don't threaten me like this.

715
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,380
If you're begging me,

716
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,620
I might consider it.

717
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,220
Fine, I'm begging you.

718
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,090
Begging me?

719
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,140
Okay, let's talk

720
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,530
about my personal issues, alright?

721
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,860
Your personal issues?

722
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,220
What's there to talk about?

723
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,860
Isn't it obvious?

724
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,090
Married with a son.

725
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,620
When your wife called you home at midnight,

726
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,050
you were celebrating another woman's birthday.

727
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,770
I've been wanting to yell at you for a long time, Lu Ziyou.

728
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,620
How can you be this shameless?

729
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,050
No, I've already said

730
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,900
it's not what you think.

731
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,530
I have a son.

732
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,620
I don't care that you have a son.

733
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,180
What I care about is your son's mother.

734
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,180
No mother.

735
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,420
She's gone?

736
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,460
I met his mom

737
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,700
at the Coachella Festival back then.

738
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,330
We found out

739
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,490
we were both McGill alumni.

740
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,420
I was in med school.

741
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,460
She was in business.

742
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,770
After we went back to Canada

743
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,770
we were together.

744
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,940
The next year, when we broke up,

745
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,220
she was pregnant.

746
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,900
She asked me what to do about the baby.

747
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,380
Then Dan was born.

748
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,770
And our relationship ended.

749
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:35,860
That's all.

750
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,490
One side of the story.

751
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,010
But the logic holds up.

752
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,220
Well, if you have any more questions,

753
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,090
just ask.

754
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,530
So,

755
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,660
can you come for the 5G robot surgery?

756
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,730
I'm confident

757
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,810
I can make you look like you did 15 years ago.

758
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,380
Leave it to us at Gemu.

759
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,810
Thank you!

760
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,860
As for Mrs. Liu's upcoming treatment,

761
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,460
we'll share updates

762
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,770
on Gemu's account.

763
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,660
Please stay tuned. Thank you.

764
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,570
Thank you for your hard work.

765
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,140
Thank you.

766
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,730
See you.

767
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,420
Bye.

768
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,010
Bye.

769
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,730
Mingjie,

770
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,460
given Ms. Liu's age,

771
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,380
we should check carefully

772
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,770
her heart, blood clotting,

773
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,770
liver, kidneys and lungs,

774
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,810
along with a chest CT.

775
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:16,570
Sure.

776
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:19,770
But Ms. Zhou,

777
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,220
do you think this livestream is useful?

778
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,730
Can we really find Zhang Zhe like this?

779
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,330
It's been fifteen years.

780
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,940
If I were Zhang Zhe,

781
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,860
I'd probably forget what my mom looked like.

782
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,050
Jingwen,

783
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,900
the water's boiling.

784
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,490
Jingwen,

785
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,940
didn't you hear me?

786
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,730
The water's boiling like crazy.

787
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,460
What are you looking at?

788
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,660
Give it back to me.

789
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,460
Mom, what are you doing?

790
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,290
What's the use of studying for a girl?

791
00:29:59,310 --> 00:29:59,940
Give it back to me.

792
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,090
I already told Ms. Wang

793
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,090
to take you to work in a couple of days.

794
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,050
Make some good money.

795
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,090
In a couple of years your brother will be in college.

796
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,570
After he graduates,

797
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,490
he'll get married and have kids.

798
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,010
All of that will need money, right?

799
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,330
What are you looking at?

800
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,530
Why are you crying?

801
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,380
I've raised you for nothing.

802
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,220
Ms. Zhou.

803
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,700
Ms. Zhou.

804
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,700
The child won't forget.

805
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,940
They just won't.

806
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,050
Your veins are pretty rich.

807
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,010
It's a bit tricky.

808
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,660
Who's this?

809
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,980
You actually came to help.

810
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,900
You're late.

811
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,460
Hey,

812
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,860
don't you know where the assistant sits?

813
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,620
Go sit over there.

814
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,810
Butterfly!

815
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,620
Butterfly!

816
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,810
Doctor, you should give her the shot.

817
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,250
Let's go with general anesthesia.

818
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,010
Handsome.

819
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,220
Add me on WeChat.

820
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,620
Well,

821
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,860
this is my assistant.

822
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,330
You can leave her your WeChat later.

823
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,810
Don't worry.

824
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,290
After you're done,

825
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,380
I'll send you Dr. Lu's phone number

826
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,180
and home address.

827
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,050
Thanks.

828
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,010
What did you say?

829
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,330
I didn't say anything.

830
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,700
His snoring is making my head buzz.

831
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,860
What did you say?

832
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,290
His snoring is making my head buzz.

833
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,090
All done.

834
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,090
That was fast, you're amazing.

835
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,700
I saved you two hours a day.

836
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,980
That's ten hours a week.

837
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,940
That should be enough for robot videos.

838
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,570
I've already watched them.

839
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,460
It won't take that long.

840
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,290
Watched already?

841
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,090
You should've said that earlier.

842
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,420
My back is killing me.

843
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,380
Stop eating.

844
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,330
Dr. Lu,

845
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,050
You have such skillful hands.

846
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,220
No comparison, no harm.

847
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,770
It seems like I'm just too clumsy.

848
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,940
It's not that impressive.

849
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,050
Besides natural talent,

850
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,490
it's just practice.

851
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,700
Don't listen to him.

852
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,980
Top students always claim they didn't study.

853
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,980
You've been practicing for months, right?

854
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,090
I got a good teacher.

855
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,660
You really watched my video

856
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,290
after Dan fell asleep last night?

857
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,380
Are you sure you didn't see it beforehand?

858
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,620
I mean, with such advanced machine,

859
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,810
where could I have encountered that?

860
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:00,980
Well,

861
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,570
you sent me that video last night,

862
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,660
around 3 AM.

863
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,460
Why was the sound so loud?

864
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,090
I screamed,

865
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,140
and scared my son.

866
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,330
Then he slapped me.

867
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,380
You still have the nerve to say that?

868
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,900
At 2:30 AM, you asked me for the video.

869
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,980
I searched the official site for it.

870
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,300
Now I'm totally exhausted.

871
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,130
Thanks for the effort.

872
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,860
What are you looking at?

873
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,740
Your operation is really smooth.

874
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,380
But remote connection still has a lot of challenges.

875
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,490
What about next week?

876
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,420
I'll continue helping you with surgeries.

877
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,860
But you have to promise me

878
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,900
three hours of practice every day. Got it?

879
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,210
Alright, stop pretending.

880
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,340
They can tell.

881
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,300
What are you pretending for?

882
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,780
So I can still contact you in the middle of the night?

883
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,090
You should just sleep.

884
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,130
Don't cause trouble.

885
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,940
I can't sleep. I have insomnia.

886
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,380
Let Dan slap you a few more times,

887
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,130
and you'll fall asleep.

888
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,780
The livestream went so well today.

889
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,780
At its peak, there were 150,000 people online.

890
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,860
You've learned how to surprise me now.

891
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,690
Next time, I'll inform you in advance.

892
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,130
No surprises. Let you oversee everything.

893
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,090
The topic of searching for children is perfect.

894
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,050
It's both humanistic and valuable to the industry.

895
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,900
Dong and the others have no real actions

896
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,420
in the director election,

897
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,820
they're just living off past success.

898
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,690
Only you

899
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,940
are doing the real work.

900
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,050
Out of the 100 people in the hospital,

901
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,740
we're the ones who care most about it.

902
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,130
It's just the two of us.

903
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,210
Tang gave me a harsh critique.

904
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,740
You know, we've been through so much together,

905
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,650
and I still argued with you.

906
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,010
I really shouldn't have.

907
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,170
Have we ever not been united?

908
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,650
If you don't admit it, then you haven't opened up to me.

909
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,690
Well, I admit I have my selfish side.

910
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,780
But personally, I think you're the most qualified

911
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,860
to be the director of Gemu.

912
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,610
I fully support you.

913
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,570
Looking at you now,

914
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,610
so mature, so wise,

915
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,860
I truly admire you.

916
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,860
I can't help but think,

917
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,010
is this still the little girl

918
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,490
I met back then?

919
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,090
Ms. Li.

920
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,860
Alright,

921
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,340
I have to go.

922
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,610
Chong,

923
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,210
think of me next time something good happens.

924
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,530
My classmate can't get her nose done again.

925
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,780
She's addicted to plastic surgery now.

926
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,980
Did you not know?

927
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,340
Really? That's serious.

928
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,860
Psychologically, this is called the Diderot Effect.

929
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,820
The more she gets, the less satisfied she is.

930
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,690
After this, there will definitely be a next time.

931
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,340
Did you try to persuade her?

932
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,570
Did she listen?

933
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,650
I've tried to persuade her many times.

934
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,090
She just doesn't listen.

935
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,380
If she listened,

936
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,300
we would've stopped her.

937
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,610
If she doesn't listen,

938
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,210
we can only refuse to do it.

939
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,860
Do you think she'll stop?

940
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,570
Or will she go find someone else?

941
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,650
Jingwen, you're her friend.

942
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,860
I believe if you do it for her,

943
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,170
you'll do your best.

944
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,780
You have no idea

945
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,980
what kind of people

946
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,170
are doing surgery at those clinics.

947
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,300
Do you really want to push your friend

948
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,860
into that situation?

949
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,820
If you're supporting me like this,

950
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,300
I won't hold back.

951
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,010
Don't hold back.

952
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,690
Hello, doctor.

953
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,050
I'm Deng Yulan from Qingdao.

954
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,860
Hello.

955
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,260
I want to make the tip and sides of my nose

956
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,090
a bit smaller,

957
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,130
and lift the tip slightly

958
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,170
to make the front look more defined.

959
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,570
It's about raising the bottom of my nose.

960
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,050
Something like that.

961
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,380
Lift your head up a bit.

962
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,740
Sure.

963
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,380
Lower your head.

964
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,650
and turn to the side.

965
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,300
I feel like

966
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,010
her eyes stick out a bit.

967
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,740
Let me see the other side.

968
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,860
Look at her neck.

969
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,690
Pinch your nose.

970
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,980
It's fine, pinch harder.

971
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,300
Actually, your nose is quite good.

972
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,530
You don't need an implant.

973
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,050
We can use ear cartilage.

974
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,260
Then push your nose bone

975
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,380
in a little.

976
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,090
That will give you the look you want.

977
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,300
Don't you think something's off with her?

978
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,490
Zhang Zhe,

979
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,650
after the surgery,

980
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,300
Mom's face won't have wrinkles anymore.

981
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,860
It'll be like it was

982
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,300
fifteen years ago,

983
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,340
when you left home.

984
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,490
So when we meet,

985
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,860
you'll recognize mom right away.

986
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,980
How's that?

987
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,490
Ready to look younger?

988
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,780
Get some good sleep.

989
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,380
Disinfect the area.

990
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,650
Close your eyes.

991
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,860
I'm disinfecting you now.

992
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,610
Good, move a bit to the left.

993
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,130
More left.

994
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,780
Yes, keep going.

995
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:21,860
Yes, a bit more.

996
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,170
Be careful.

997
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,010
Ms. Qiao.

998
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,690
Come on, keep practicing.

999
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,650
What's wrong?

1000
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,650
Ms. Qiao.

1001
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,570
There are three surgeries left.

1002
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,010
And we have only one week now.

1003
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,820
How about we bring in someone more experienced?

1004
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,980
You machine sellers

1005
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,380
know more about the operation than we doctors?

1006
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,130
Should we have you take over?

1007
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,170
The one with the nose surgery, Deng Yulan.

1008
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,210
Schedule another consultation.

1009
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,980
Just ate and you're still eating?

1010
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,300
You can eat so much!

1011
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,820
Turn the AC down a bit.

1012
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,980
It's too hot today.

1013
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,380
Feels like my heart is pounding.

1014
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,530
Still hot?

1015
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,610
Isn't it already 17°C?

1016
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,380
17°C?

1017
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,780
Hello, doctor

1018
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,130
Hello, Ms. Deng.

1019
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,380
This is Ms. Qiao.

1020
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,650
Hello, Ms. Deng

1021
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,740
Please move forward a bit.

1022
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,860
Follow my lead.

1023
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,690
Let's raise our hands flat.

1024
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,740
Like this?

1025
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,650
Good. Don't move, let me check.

1026
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,610
It's still moving

1027
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,380
Shaking a lot, huh?

1028
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,010
Yeah.

1029
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,690
Ms. Deng

1030
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,690
Do you usually have a racing heart?

1031
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,690
Feel irritable or angry easily?

1032
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,860
How'd you know?

1033
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,050
Dr. Wang,

1034
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,530
please do a thyroid function test for Ms. Deng

1035
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,610
How could she have familial hyperthyroidism?

1036
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,940
She said her grandmother had it too.

1037
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,650
I really have terrible luck.

1038
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,530
I just started getting the hang of it.

1039
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,820
And she runs into this.

1040
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,340
Yeah, about her case,

1041
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,210
we didn't expect it either.

1042
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:57,940
This project...

1043
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,010
Right?

1044
00:40:59,150 --> 00:40:59,740
This project can't...

1045
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,380
Ms. Qiao.

1046
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,260
Well,

1047
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,050
it's...

1048
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,010
Are you done here?

1049
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,690
What's wrong?

1050
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,860
We've reserved this meeting room.

1051
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,650
This project will be going on for over two weeks.

1052
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,380
The meeting room is booked until next weekend.

1053
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,050
But we booked it a long time ago.

1054
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,860
Really?

1055
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,980
We booked it last week.

1056
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,530
Wang Qian.

1057
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,610
Wang Qian.

1058
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,980
Push!

1059
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,130
Come on!

1060
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,650
One, two, three, push!

1061
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,260
You can forget something like

1062
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,260
reserving a meeting room?

1063
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,860
What were you thinking?

1064
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,740
It's Mercury retrograde.

1065
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,300
It's all over the internet

1066
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,820
Taurus is in Mercury retrograde this week.

1067
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,010
Okay, don't move.

1068
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,860
This carpet is hard to manage.

1069
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,260
What's going on here?

1070
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,570
This is the meeting room you booked, right?

1071
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,380
Yes.

1072
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,570
Ms. Qiao.

1073
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,420
Sorry.

1074
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,420
We already reserved this room.

1075
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:00,860
Fine.

1076
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,610
Move aside.

1077
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,340
Hurry.

1078
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,460
This is sensitive equipment.

1079
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,490
Don't touch it.

1080
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,130
Got it.

1081
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,860
Move aside.

1082
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,050
Ms. Qiao,

1083
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:10,490
be careful.

1084
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,530
You're looking a bit pale lately.

1085
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,210
You should rest more.

1086
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,380
Take care of your health, okay?

1087
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,170
I'll come to you for whitening shots.

1088
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,940
No problem.

1089
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,340
Take care of your back.

1090
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,210
One, two, three!

1091
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,130
One, two, three!

1092
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,260
Ms. Qiao, we're turning!

1093
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,130
No, it won't fit. One, two, three.

1094
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,050
It's so much wider!

1095
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,650
Why does it not fit?

1096
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,090
How did you measure it?

1097
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,050
Let me measure it properly.

1098
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,170
Look, from here.

1099
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,490
It's as wide as a forearm.

1100
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,780
Let's go to the reception.

1101
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,300
Let's go.

1102
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,170
Let's go.

1103
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,380
Why are you sitting here?

1104
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,490
5G robot is not going well?
