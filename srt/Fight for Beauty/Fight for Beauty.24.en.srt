1
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,330
How did she find you?

2
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,260
She went to our hospital

3
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,330
with two old ladies, saying they were her neighbors.

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,050
She said they run a hospital.

5
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,330
They wanted to treat the rheumatologist.

6
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,490
But when they got there, they realized it's a cosmetic surgery clinic.

7
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,290
So why'd you bring her home?

8
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,540
Let me explain something.

9
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,930
How has your mom been feeling?

10
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,490
Why do you ask that?

11
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,610
She can eat and drink.

12
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,060
She looks fine, but

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,260
I think

14
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,980
there might be something off.

15
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,540
Can't you tell she's faking it?

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,850
Jingwen, I know you don't have a good relationship with your mom,

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,540
but she's so old.

18
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,660
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,660
Let me cook for you.

20
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,060
Zhou Kai,

21
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,610
come to this address and pick up your mom.

22
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,820
No need.

23
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,850
I'll drive myself.

24
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,450
When did you get married?

25
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,410
Why didn't you tell me?

26
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,100
Is this your husband?

27
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,980
Look at me, I should've dressed well.

28
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,500
This is

29
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,940
a wedding gift.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,260
Can you stop messing around?

31
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,690
When are you having a baby?

32
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,890
I'll help you take care of it,

33
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,820
I have experience.

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,660
Look, little baby.

35
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,890
Baby...

36
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,220
When are you having a baby?

37
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,850
I'll help take care of it.

38
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,940
Have you said enough?

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,290
Did you ever take care of me when I was little?

40
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,690
Now you want me

41
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,010
to be the dutiful daughter?

42
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,450
Let me tell you, that's never gonna happen.

43
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,450
You stay here.

44
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,940
Have Zhou Kai come pick you up.

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,100
Alright, Jingwen.

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,610
Stop running around.

47
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,130
I'm so busy, and I had to come to pick you up.

48
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,410
Hello, I'm Qin.

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,890
I'm Jingwen's friend.

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,890
Is it okay if I talk to you for a moment?

51
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,570
Come.

52
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,730
Doesn't Auntie mental state seem a bit off?

53
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,980
Did you have her checked?

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,170
She's always like this.

55
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,890
From now on...

56
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,010
Charge!

57
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,100
Why is it always me they call

58
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,130
when something happens at school?

59
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,540
You're not her guardian, are you?

60
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,660
I can't go,

61
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,170
I have surgery this afternoon.

62
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,050
Can you figure something out?

63
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,610
Where's the chili oil?

64
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,780
I'm so flustered.

65
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,050
As expected, it's mala tang.

66
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,780
I could smell it all the way down the hall.

67
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,340
What?

68
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,700
You don't have surgery this afternoon?

69
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,540
Just one more left this afternoon.

70
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,610
Let me try it.

71
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,100
Dr. Qiao.

72
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,930
Come on, if you're gonna eat, sit properly.

73
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,580
Come, sit.

74
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,780
It's all yours.

75
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,370
So good.

76
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,410
Aren't you eating?

77
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,020
I will.

78
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,100
Not bad, huh?

79
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,580
Can you do me a favor?

80
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,410
Of course, it's totally worth it.

81
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,220
Definitely worth it.

82
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,780
Here's the thing.

83
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,540
My daughter

84
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,810
has this really important performance at school.

85
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,250
They're asking parents to attend.

86
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,100
I've missed it a few times already.

87
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,660
I can't miss it this time.

88
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,850
But I've got a liposuction this afternoon.

89
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,980
It's a very small case.

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,730
Can you help me out?

91
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,460
Please.

92
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,930
I've got a breast augmentation at 2 p.m. this afternoon.

93
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,170
Then schedule hers for 4 p.m.

94
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,490
4 p.m. this afternoon.

95
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,980
Nice.

96
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,370
This place is pretty good.

97
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,900
Add some chili oil.

98
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,170
It's broken.

99
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,780
What happened?

100
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,250
Hurry, get a new one.

101
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,900
Okay.

102
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,780
Manman,

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,220
go notify Zhong Shunhua.

104
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,730
She's Dr. Meng's patient.

105
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,610
Her surgery might be delayed by an hour.

106
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,460
Got it.

107
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,540
Half an hour should be fine.

108
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,410
Isn't half an hour a bit tight?

109
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,290
We'll just finish our surgery in half an hour here.

110
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,020
Stop nagging, hurry up.

111
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,610
Right, remember to give Zhong Shunhua some IV fluids.

112
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,660
Got it.

113
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,100
Is that so?

114
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,460
Sorry about this.

115
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,250
Ms. Qiao's been

116
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,660
working non-stop all day.

117
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,580
To keep your surgery on schedule,

118
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,020
she's had to give up her rest time.

119
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,020
So, we hope you understand.

120
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,850
Yes, I understand.

121
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,220
You haven't eaten yet, right?

122
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,980
Let me have the nurse give you some fluids.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,460
Thanks.

124
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,900
It's okay, no worries.

125
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,810
You can rest now.

126
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,610
Wait,

127
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,220
can you just listen to me first?

128
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,050
Just give me a straight answer, Dad.

129
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,290
Are you coming to my wedding or not?

130
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,410
My Mom's definitely coming.

131
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,610
She's never missed an important moment in my life.

132
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,540
Are you wondering if Ze will be there?

133
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,700
He'll be there.

134
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,930
Let me put it this way,

135
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,220
Mom and Ze are practically joined at the hip now.

136
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,140
If Mom's there,

137
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,410
Ze will definitely be there too.

138
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,220
Alright.

139
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,340
Fine, do whatever you want.

140
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,490
Gotta go.

141
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,050
Dad's coming to the wedding.

142
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,220
And he's bringing Auntie Wang with him.

143
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,850
Seriously?

144
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,810
You could've just let him come alone.

145
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,410
Why did you have to ask him to bring her?

146
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,610
How long has it been since we got divorced?

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,780
If the management from the mine see this,

148
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,250
it's gonna be so awkward.

149
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,540
Well, you're bringing Ze.

150
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,370
Why can't Dad bring Wang?

151
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,540
I'm bringing Ze...

152
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,580
Isn't that what you were thinking deep down?

153
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,490
He got divorced and found someone younger,

154
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,490
big deal.

155
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,730
It's not like you can't do the same.

156
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,850
Besides,

157
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,980
if it really came down to a face-off between them,

158
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,100
I'd bet on Ze winning.

159
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,610
Really?

160
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,610
Of course.

161
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,540
Let's not talk about how he treats you,

162
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,170
or whether he's capable or not.

163
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,930
But just in terms of looks,

164
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,460
he's definitely decent.

165
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,980
If Dad's meeting him for the first time,

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,660
It's totally normal for him

167
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,930
to feel a little intimidated.

168
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,610
Stop talking nonsense.

169
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,140
I didn't choose Ze for those reasons.

170
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,850
He really cares about me.

171
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,290
Give him a call.

172
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,290
Ask him where he is.

173
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,370
What's going on?

174
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,050
His phone keeps losing signal.

175
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,220
Where the heck did he go?

176
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,250
Xue,

177
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,290
get me some chocolate.

178
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,980
Mr. Qin,

179
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,140
the implant broke during surgery today.

180
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,490
Shouldn't we check this new batch of products?

181
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,900
Ms. Qiao, here you go.

182
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,980
Alright.

183
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,130
Ms. Qiao, I ordered takeout.

184
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,850
-Just have some. - I don't have time.

185
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,530
You guys eat.

186
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,650
Ms. Qiao, the waist binder!

187
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,250
Manman,

188
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,370
Is implant rupture

189
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,420
a common issue in our hospital?

190
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,060
It happens in about one out of ten cases.

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,650
Seems like we recently changed suppliers.

192
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,420
Stop with the nonsense.

193
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,340
Where are you?

194
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,700
Don't you know my mom had surgery today?

195
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,610
She kept asking about you before the anesthesia.

196
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,340
We called you a hundred times, and you didn't pick up.

197
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,730
Hold on.

198
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,530
Doctor, was my mom's surgery successful?

199
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,700
You are...?

200
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,100
I'm Zhong Shunhua's daughter.

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,580
Yes, everything went well.

202
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,980
A total of 2000 milliliters were removed.

203
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,180
She needs to wear a compression garment for three months.

204
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,060
She can take a shower two days after the stitches are removed.

205
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,850
Soreness and swelling are normal.

206
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,250
Especially when she sleeps,

207
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,460
just let her find a comfortable position.

208
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,850
- Okay. - She shouldn't stay in one posture for too long,

209
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,850
Or she might develop bedsores.

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,300
Okay, thank you, doctor.

211
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,250
Oh, this...

212
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,610
Sorry, I'll clean it up right away.

213
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,010
Hello?

214
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,130
You still have the time for a road trip in the suburbs?

215
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,370
What's the point of coming now?

216
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,980
The surgery's already over.

217
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,130
Damn it.

218
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,940
Hello?

219
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,130
Is this Manman?

220
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,890
Yes, Ms. Qiao.

221
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,530
How is Zhong Shunhua in Bed 13 doing?

222
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,370
I just checked on her five minutes ago.

223
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,370
Everything is normal.

224
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,010
Alright.

225
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,010
Good.

226
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,610
Can I trouble you to check on her

227
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,300
every two hours tonight?

228
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,340
No problem.

229
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,610
Ms. Qiao, is there something you're worried about?

230
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,650
Nothing in particular.

231
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,770
Just want to be cautious.

232
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,940
Alright.

233
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,180
Look at this picture.

234
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,250
It looks good.

235
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,940
No way, I look too fat in this one.

236
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,060
You look great.

237
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,300
My daughter is beautiful no matter what.

238
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,730
Hairuo,

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,530
did Ze tell you

240
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,060
he's not coming tonight?

241
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,820
He clearly promised

242
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,730
he'd be here for my surgery.

243
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,130
He told me

244
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,610
there was a landslide.

245
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,940
The roads were blocked, and he couldn't get out.

246
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,610
They just got cleared today.

247
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,300
By the time he gets to the city, it'll be too late,

248
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,580
so he's not coming.

249
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,460
A landslide?

250
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,300
Not sure if that's true or not.

251
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,250
Is he okay?

252
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,100
He's totally fine, jumping around like nothing happened.

253
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:44,980
Mom,

254
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,730
I can't help but feel like

255
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,610
he never really wanted to come see you.

256
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,730
Don't talk nonsense.

257
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,980
The doctor said

258
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,060
my surgery isn't a big deal.

259
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,220
If he doesn't wanna come, then forget it.

260
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,460
As long as he shows up on the wedding day, that's enough.

261
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,130
Then you tell him.

262
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,820
I think he's up to something.

263
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,770
Alright,

264
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,610
enough.

265
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,370
I know what I'm doing.

266
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,130
Are you hungry?

267
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,370
You haven't eaten all day.

268
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,580
Have some food, come on.

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,730
I don't have an appetite.

270
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,700
What's wrong?

271
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,890
It hurts again.

272
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,980
Should I call the nurse?

273
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,460
No need.

274
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,010
The doctor said

275
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,130
this kind of pain is normal.

276
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,610
Don't bother them.

277
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,370
Still, why go through

278
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,610
all this suffering?

279
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,010
You're just worried that during the wedding,

280
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,010
Dad and Wang might steal the spotlight, right?

281
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,300
You want to stand next to Ze,

282
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,340
so you look more compatible and younger.

283
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,980
Like me.

284
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,300
Oh, you think

285
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,530
you know everything, huh?

286
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,250
I fully support you getting your youth back.

287
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,420
Especially when I picture the wedding day,

288
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,010
and Dad's face turning dark with jealousy,

289
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,530
I feel so happy for you.

290
00:12:59,390 --> 00:12:59,940
Hairuo,

291
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,490
listen to me.

292
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,100
You've never had to endure hardship since you were little.

293
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,220
If, one day, you're not happy in your marriage,

294
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,180
don't hold it in.

295
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,460
Just divorce him.

296
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,490
Mom,

297
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,610
You're saying this to someone who's about to get married.

298
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,530
Is that appropriate?

299
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,850
No, it's not.

300
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,460
Alright, I won't say it anymore.

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,850
Are you sure you don't wanna eat something?

302
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,820
No.

303
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,530
Hello?

304
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,180
Zhong Shunhua is in trouble!

305
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,250
Mom! Are you okay?

306
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,730
Doctor, what's happening?

307
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,490
What's wrong with my mom?

308
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,530
It hurts! Be gentle!

309
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,300
How about here?

310
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,890
Hurts!

311
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,770
Mom!

312
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,100
Understood, I'll take her to the ER immediately.

313
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,250
Pack up quickly, we're transferring her to another hospital.

314
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,370
Why do we have to transfer?

315
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,530
Our equipment isn't sufficient.

316
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,700
We need to transfer her as soon as possible!

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,490
Hurry up! Come and help!

318
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,700
Mom!

319
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,100
How is she?

320
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,130
Ms. Qiao,

321
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,700
Zhong Shunhua has been transferred to Jingbei Hospital.

322
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,530
She's in emergency treatment now.

323
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,730
I've been monitoring the situation.

324
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,850
Why was she sent to Jingbei?

325
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,490
Her condition is too critical.

326
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,770
You should come over first, we'll explain more then.

327
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,420
Alright, I'm on my way.

328
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,850
Hello,

329
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,700
was there a patient brought in just now?

330
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,770
Her name is Zhong Shunhua.

331
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,490
Could you check for me?

332
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,940
Are you her family member?

333
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,980
No, I'm her doctor.

334
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,770
You performed the liposuction?

335
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,770
Yes.

336
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,490
She now has intestinal perforation.

337
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,250
Contact a larger hospital immediately.

338
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,220
We're running low on blood.

339
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,250
If this continues, she won't make it.

340
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:36,890
Ms. Qiao,

341
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,770
how did this happen?

342
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,820
Hold on.

343
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,850
This is Qiao Yang.

344
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,100
can I speak to Mr. Huang?

345
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,610
I'll have Third Hospital set up a fast-track admission.

346
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,650
Coordinate with them right away.

347
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,340
Got it.

348
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:48,980
Huang,

349
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,770
I have a patient here

350
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,700
in critical condition.

351
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,220
Can you open a fast-track emergency channel?

352
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,980
We're currently on North Section One of Ring Road.

353
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,820
Just a turn away from arriving.

354
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,530
Alright, got it.

355
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,060
Thank you, Mr. Huang.

356
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,940
Mr. Huang is the top digestive surgeon at Third Hospital.

357
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,980
He's already on his way.

358
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,700
Don't worry.

359
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,460
She's in ventricular fibrillation, get the defibrillator ready!

360
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,250
What happened?

361
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:16,850
She's in shock.

362
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,730
Administer 1 mg of epinephrine IV push!

363
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,460
Mom!

364
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,850
Is she gonna be okay?

365
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,890
Mom!

366
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,100
Alright, her heartbeat has stabilized.

367
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,490
Qiao, listen,

368
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,130
if anything happens to my mom,

369
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,820
I'll take you down with me.

370
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,130
Do you hear me?

371
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,580
Mom...

372
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,770
The surgical procedure was fine.

373
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,100
A total of 2000ml was removed.

374
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,250
Was there bleeding during the surgery?

375
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,100
No.

376
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,340
What about post-op?

377
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,770
She kept saying her stomach hurt after the surgery.

378
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,250
Why wasn't this reported to the on-duty doctor?

379
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,850
I just found out too.

380
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,820
Does she have any chronic illnesses?

381
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,300
Yes.

382
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,220
She has hypertension.

383
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,770
She's been taking Shihuida regularly.

384
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,100
Alright, take an X-ray first.

385
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,530
Check if it's an intestinal perforation.

386
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,010
Got it, thanks, Huang.

387
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,980
Come on.

388
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,850
Almost there!

389
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,010
Get the backboard ready.

390
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,850
Backboard!

391
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,060
Turn her over!

392
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,370
- No! - Turn her over!

393
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,340
Why are you yelling?

394
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,180
Come on, turn her over.

395
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,610
Mom!

396
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,650
It hurts...

397
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,250
Hang in there, dear.

398
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:01,890
Just hold on a little longer, okay?

399
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,060
Stay strong, Mom!

400
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,530
Hang in there.

401
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,810
I've got you, love.

402
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,290
Hold her steady.

403
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,730
Just a little longer.

404
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,330
Huang, hurry up!

405
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,570
Hang in there.

406
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,620
Hold on, Mom!

407
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,180
Come.

408
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,810
Hello?

409
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,570
Hello?

410
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,980
Hairuo, what do you want this late?

411
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,050
There was a complication during my mom's surgery!

412
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:23,980
Come here now!

413
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,620
Is it serious?

414
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,090
Yes, very serious!

415
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,940
She's about to go into surgery!

416
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,380
Come to Third Hospital now!

417
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,810
That's so far...

418
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,900
Even if I come now, I'd just be waiting around.

419
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,730
Far?

420
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,810
She's your wife!

421
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,660
My mom's life is on the line,

422
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,730
and you're complaining about distance?

423
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,330
Do you not care whether she lives or dies?

424
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,700
Hairuo,

425
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,250
can you calm down?

426
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,330
Calm down?

427
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,660
I'm asking you, are you coming or not?

428
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,660
Can you come?

429
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,770
I'll talk to him.

430
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,770
None of your business.

431
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,180
It's about your mother.

432
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,940
Hello?

433
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,700
This is Zhong Shunhua's doctor.

434
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,010
She's in critical condition.

435
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,220
We urgently need the spouse's signature.

436
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,730
If you don't come, I'll call the police.

437
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,620
Ms. Qiao.

438
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:14,860
Thank you.

439
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,900
I'm sorry.

440
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,460
It's my fault. I didn't ask enough questions

441
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,860
before transferring her to Jingbei.

442
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,380
I've caused you trouble.

443
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,010
It's okay. You're new.

444
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,250
Everyone makes mistakes.

445
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,180
You can go home.

446
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,900
Are you afraid she'll hit me?

447
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,380
I can take a beating.

448
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,810
Go on, go home.

449
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,570
Get some rest.

450
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,220
Go.

451
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,570
Go ahead.

452
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,010
Hairuo!

453
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,180
What's going on?

454
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,660
Wasn't it far?

455
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,570
You got here in less than twenty minutes.

456
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,380
I rushed like crazy!

457
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,220
Ran through red lights all the way here.

458
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,570
Isn't this all for your mom?

459
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,810
How is she now?

460
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,380
She should be fine, right?

461
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,770
How would I know?

462
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,730
Wasn't this supposed to be a routine surgery?

463
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,460
And with such a renowned doctor, too.

464
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,620
How did it turn out like this?

465
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,460
Who's that?

466
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,620
The one who just mentioned calling the police?

467
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,220
Is Zhong Shunhua's family here?

468
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,770
Yes.

469
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,940
The X-ray results are out.

470
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,380
It's not a bowel perforation from liposuction.

471
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,530
A gastric hemorrhage?

472
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,860
She needs immediate surgery.

473
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,730
But the patient's condition is critical.

474
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,330
We'll do everything we can to save her.

475
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,380
But you should also be prepared for the worst.

476
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:41,980
Doctor,

477
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,380
money doesn't matter.

478
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,290
Her life is the most important thing.

479
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,700
Huang, please help.

480
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,460
I'll do my best.

481
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,460
Doctor, please, save my mom!

482
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,380
She hasn't even seen me get married yet!

483
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,220
We'll do our best.

484
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,140
Calm down.

485
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,050
We'll do our best.

486
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,980
Calm down.

487
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,980
Pease.

488
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,010
Don't touch me!

489
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,530
Stop pretending to be the good guy.

490
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,090
This isn't over!

491
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,620
- Doctor, please! - Okay.

492
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,620
Just come with me and sign the form.

493
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,330
Alright.

494
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:02,900
Just you wait.

495
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,530
Qiao Yang,

496
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,090
still trying on wedding dresses?

497
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,620
Come to the hospital now.

498
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,460
Where's my mom?

499
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,090
Mom!

500
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,570
Mom!

501
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,290
She needs immediate surgery.

502
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,620
Please step aside.

503
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,700
Don't worry.

504
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,660
She'll be fine.

505
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,620
Please move aside, thank you.

506
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,380
Mom, it's okay.

507
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,010
Mom.

508
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,660
Mom.

509
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,570
We need to begin surgery.

510
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,940
Please move aside!

511
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,090
Family members, please wait outside.

512
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,050
It's okay.

513
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,330
- Mom. - It's okay.

514
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,330
- Mom. - It's okay.

515
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,140
It's okay.

516
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,220
It's gonna be okay.

517
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,860
Fancy some tofu pudding?

518
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,700
What are you doing here?

519
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,220
Came to check on you.

520
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,730
Not eating? No appetite?

521
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,220
Look over there.

522
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,530
Wait, isn't it usually the longer your surgeries last,

523
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,660
the hungrier you get?

524
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,220
Remember back when we had that back-to-back shift

525
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,980
with Qi Dacheng?

526
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,090
We worked nonstop and then had a late-night barbecue.

527
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,810
What, are you fasting today?

528
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,490
What?

529
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,490
What's wrong?

530
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,730
Brought you some daily essentials.

531
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,700
Figured you might need them.

532
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,530
I reviewed your upcoming surgery plans.

533
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,380
If there's anything you need to hand over, just tell me.

534
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,380
I'll help coordinate things.

535
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,530
Operating Room 1: Surgery for Zhong Shunhua is complete.

536
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,420
Doctor! How's my mom?

537
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,700
The gastric bleeding was caused by a stress ulcer.

538
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,730
Her condition has stabilized.

539
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,050
Can I see her?

540
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,180
She's still unconscious.

541
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,090
After surgery, she'll be transferred to the ICU

542
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,050
for monitoring.

543
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,250
Whether she wakes up or not

544
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,860
depends on her recovery.

545
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,770
How did she suddenly have gastric bleeding?

546
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,620
It's all her fault!

547
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,460
She wouldn't let my mom eat!

548
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,010
Calm down!

549
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,460
The surgery was delayed by thirty minutes.

550
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,810
The surgery was delayed?

551
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,180
Was she given IV fluids in the meantime?

552
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:09,860
Yes.

553
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,980
Then it shouldn't have had much impact.

554
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,980
Stress ulcers can have multiple triggers.

555
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,140
Given your mom's condition,

556
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,460
the primary factors would likely be

557
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,700
anesthesia stress, surgical stress,

558
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,010
severe emotional strain,

559
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:21,940
or depression.

560
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,420
All of these are possibilities.

561
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,250
Think of it

562
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,250
as the body's natural physiological response

563
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,810
to external stimuli.

564
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,810
It's just that this time,

565
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,050
your mom's reaction was too severe.

566
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,420
So basically, you're saying she was just unlucky?

567
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,860
Dr. Zhou,

568
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,660
does everything have to be removed?

569
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,730
The area on my forehead, after removal, it's sunken in.

570
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,860
It looks terrible.

571
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,620
I told you during the consultation.

572
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,620
If it can be removed, it should be removed completely.

573
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,010
But don't worry.

574
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,330
After the extraction,

575
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,660
I'll use a biological patch

576
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,770
to repair it.

577
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,180
In six months to a year,

578
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,050
once it's fully healed,

579
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,180
you can come back to see me.

580
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,090
By then, you can decide whether you want fat grafting

581
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,490
or hyaluronic acid.

582
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,330
Alright, I trust you.

583
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,730
Thanks to your "Starlight Project,"

584
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,090
if I hadn't read the educational materials,

585
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,250
I wouldn't have even realized I had Polyacrylamide Hydrogel injections.

586
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,140
Well, thank you for trusting us.

587
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,900
I'm administering the anesthesia now. Relax.

588
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,140
There'll be a bit of pain.

589
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,380
You're really

590
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,250
letting yourself go.

591
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,570
The first polyacrylamide gel removal surgery was a success.

592
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,290
That's worth celebrating.

593
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,420
I have to reward myself

594
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,660
with high-calorie food.

595
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,420
I seriously don't understand

596
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,050
why I used to love eating salads.

597
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,900
So, the Starlight Project is definitely not letting Gemu participate?

598
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,570
Forget it.

599
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,530
Given the current situation,

600
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,530
we should avoid suspicion.

601
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,700
How's Qiao Yang?

602
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,090
He'll be here soon.

603
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,940
Come on, eat something.

604
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,290
You look pale.

605
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,090
Are you okay?

606
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,660
Dr. Qiao,

607
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,700
you're not eating?

608
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:07,900
By the way,

609
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,490
would you say Shunhua's condition is stable now?

610
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,730
She's still very weak.

611
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,180
Mr. Huang is keeping a close watch.

612
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,810
Got it.

613
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,730
Hairuo,

614
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,770
eat.

615
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,290
It's fine.

616
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,940
Doctors always give you

617
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,730
the worst-case scenario first.

618
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,940
That way, if anything goes wrong, they can't be blamed.

619
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,810
Listen,

620
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,050
last year during New Year's,

621
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,770
I went to Baoguang Temple with your mom to draw a fortune stick.

622
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,010
It said she'd face a major difficulty this year.

623
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,770
But in the end, she'd turn misfortune into fortune.

624
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,290
So, don't worry.

625
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,900
What exactly are you trying to say?

626
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,180
Look,

627
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,010
things here are stable for now, right?

628
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,460
A friend of mine is opening a new sports venue.

629
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,010
It's Zha, someone both your mom

630
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,220
and I know well.

631
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,980
He's helped me a lot in the past.

632
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,420
I promised him days ago that I'd be there.

633
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,900
Your mom can't go now.

634
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,860
So, doesn't it make sense for me to represent her?

635
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,250
My mom is in the ICU.

636
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,050
I know.

637
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,860
That's why I'll go and come back quickly.

638
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,180
Then you can focus on your wedding.

639
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,570
I'll handle everything else.

640
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,940
Don't worry about it.

641
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,010
Whatever.

642
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,290
Look at that expression,

643
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,010
like I shouldn't be leaving.

644
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,380
Who do you think I'm doing this for?

645
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,810
I'm off.

646
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,810
Call me if anything comes up.

647
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,700
Remember to eat.

648
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,860
Stay in touch.

649
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,660
Hello?

650
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,050
I don't care if it's canceled or not.

651
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,180
I don't care if the wedding happens or not.

652
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,250
Just leave me alone.

653
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,810
Getting married is a big deal.

654
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,090
You should think carefully.

655
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,050
If you have things to take care of,

656
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,490
go ahead.

657
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,810
I'll keep watch here.

658
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,940
If anything happens, I'll call you.

659
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,330
Go home and get some proper sleep.

660
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,010
You need rest to stay on top of things.

661
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,700
I'll come back tomorrow morning.

662
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,900
You look terrible.

663
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,980
Are you running a fever?

664
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,530
Let me check.

665
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,330
You're burning up!

666
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,010
I'll take you home to rest.

667
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,330
No.

668
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,180
I need to stay here and keep watch.

669
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,140
Then I'll stay with you.

670
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,090
You suddenly care about me so much.

671
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,460
What's your motive this time?

672
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,330
Don't flatter yourself.

673
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,860
I just don't want you ending up in the ICU.

674
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,770
I'm tough.

675
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,380
Yeah, I guess you are.

676
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,530
I've never seen you like this before.

677
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,380
I thought you never got sick.

678
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,220
I remember back in school,

679
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,420
during that flu outbreak,

680
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,090
everyone in class got sick except for you.

681
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,700
You were full of energy,

682
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,050
like you'd been injected with adrenaline.

683
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,620
Half the class took exams while sick.

684
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,460
And you had zero sympathy.

685
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,420
You even stood there gloating,

686
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,290
calling us weaklings.

687
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,570
I still remember the final scores from that time.

688
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,050
You only beat me by two points.

689
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,770
If I hadn't been sick,

690
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,810
I hated you so much for that.

691
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,770
You still remember...

692
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,290
I beat you by two points...

693
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,860
Mom!

694
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,490
Open your eyes and look at me!

695
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,140
Don't leave me alone...

696
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,700
You haven't seen me get married yet!

697
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,570
Mom!

698
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,220
Mom...

699
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,940
Murderer...

700
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,660
You're awake.

701
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,620
What's wrong? Bad dream?

702
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:32,940
Have some water.

703
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,980
Your fever is gone.

704
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,660
Want something to eat? I'll get it for you.

705
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,700
I dreamt of Qiao Hui.

706
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,460
Don't think about it.

707
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,730
Go home and have dinner with your dad.

708
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,620
I'll stay here and watch over things.

709
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,250
Don't worry.

710
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,250
Uncle, your stir-fried bamboo shoots smell amazing!

711
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,220
Back where I'm from, we just blanch them and eat them.

712
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,140
Really?

713
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,300
This is such a feast!

714
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,690
Uncle, you should teach me how to cook sometime.

715
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,530
It's really simple.

716
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,940
Why are you at my house again?

717
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,820
I came to check on you.

718
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,300
Has your fever gone down?

719
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,650
I'm here on behalf of Gemu.

720
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,900
Didn't you ask Qin Gui to have me come back?

721
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,090
It's just a few of us.

722
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,050
We came to see how you're doing.

723
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,490
These bamboo shoots are so fresh.

724
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,460
You really know how to pick them.

725
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,090
Thanks.

726
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,570
Come on, try some! Here.

727
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,610
I don't have an appetite. You guys eat.

728
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,380
Then at least sit down and join us.

729
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,050
It's okay, Uncle.

730
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,980
I'll go check on her.

731
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,820
I'm coming in.

732
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,170
If you go to sleep without drying your hair, you'll get sick.

733
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,170
Get up.

734
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,860
Come on, sit up.

735
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,530
Sit properly.

736
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,050
What are you doing?

737
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,650
Why are you drying my hair?

738
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,740
Don't move.

739
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,740
Can I ask you for one thing?

740
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,130
Stop looking at me with pity.

741
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,170
I'm not a child.

742
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,210
I'm a doctor.

743
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,420
I know exactly what I'm facing.

744
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,650
I'm going back to work at Gemu tomorrow.

745
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,900
I know you're not a child.

746
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,420
But I still have to remind you.

747
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,130
If you're going back to Gemu,

748
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,900
cough loudly

749
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,340
when you pass the break room.

750
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,610
Let them know you're there,

751
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,980
so they'll stop gossiping.

752
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,650
Drink less water. Use the restroom less.

753
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,170
Otherwise, in the cubicles,

754
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,130
you'll hear them talking behind your back.

755
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,570
Don't go to the cafeteria either.

756
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,090
Don't take away their only source of entertainment.

757
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,460
But those aren't even the worst things.

758
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,460
When it's time for your appointments,

759
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,210
your assistant will tell you

760
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,260
the patient canceled.

761
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,740
No need to ask.

762
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,380
They booked with another doctor instead.

763
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,130
Wow, you've really been through it.

764
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,170
The fact that you can still be sarcastic

765
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,690
means your mindset is holding up well.

766
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,690
Have you ever smelled death?

767
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,610
It has this unsettling,

768
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,740
greasy odor.

769
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,210
Mixed with the scent of

770
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,740
a wilting rose.

771
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,420
Both metallic and strangely sweet.

772
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,610
I smelled it when Qiao Hui passed.

773
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,170
I smelled it when my mother passed.

774
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,860
And two days ago, outside the ICU...

775
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,980
I smelled it again.

776
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,980
I don't care if you laugh at me.

777
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,170
I couldn't stop shaking.

778
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,570
I was trembling all over.

779
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,690
Actually,

780
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,490
death education is part of every doctor's basic training.

781
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,380
On the operating table,

782
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,050
I've faced

783
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,690
life-and-death crises many times.

784
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,170
But I always knew clearly,

785
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,900
in those moments, I was saving lives.

786
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,420
This time is different.

787
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,460
If Zhong Shunhua

788
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,690
dies on my operating table,

789
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,650
then a perfectly healthy person

790
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,650
would have died because of me.

791
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,090
All these years as a doctor,

792
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,130
I've never had an accident.

793
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,530
I always thought it was because I was skilled.

794
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,690
Now I realize

795
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,980
I was just lucky.

796
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,860
Qiao Yang,

797
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,860
you know

798
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,820
that every medical procedure carries risks.

799
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,170
Medicine's understanding of the human body is still so limited.

800
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,490
No matter how skilled you are,

801
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,860
you'll encounter patients

802
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,420
whose nerve distribution is different from the norm,

803
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,650
whose blood vessels are more fragile,

804
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,690
or who have

805
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,530
unknown stress reactions.

806
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,490
Otherwise, why would there be

807
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,090
a pre-surgery consent form?

808
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,570
Every clause is written in the blood and tears of those before us.

809
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,940
Stop doubting yourself.

810
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,380
You performed the procedure correctly.

811
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,860
I performed the procedure correctly.

812
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,300
Legally, I'm not at fault.

813
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,570
But does that bring peace of mind?

814
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,690
I performed the procedure correctly.

815
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,380
Legally, I'm not at fault.

816
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,460
But does that bring peace of mind?

817
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,490
Has anyone been following this?

818
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,490
Something major happened at Gemu.

819
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,690
A simple liposuction procedure,

820
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,460
the patient walked in smiling but was carried out lying down.

821
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,380
But

822
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,860
I have to speak up for Qiao Yang.

823
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,940
She's an incredibly professional doctor.

824
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,690
She's performed many successful surgeries,

825
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,650
which you can find online.

826
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,690
But that's how medicine is.

827
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,050
No matter how famous or skilled you are,

828
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,980
even the smallest oversight

829
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,420
can lead to severe consequences.

830
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,490
The patient

831
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,090
is still in the ICU.

832
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,980
I heard her daughter is about to get married soon.

833
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,090
My mom is getting older too.

834
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,940
Just thinking that she might not even...

835
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,570
I'm sorry.

836
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,940
Just thinking

837
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,820
that she might not live to see her daughter's wedding,

838
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,860
I really...

839
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,690
So I believe,

840
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,940
since we're in the medical field,

841
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,570
we must take precautions against even the smallest risks.

842
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,570
We need to eliminate all potential dangers

843
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:39,050
before the surgery even begins.

844
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,610
That means we must be careful,

845
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,130
extremely careful,

846
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,460
and exercise the utmost caution.

847
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:01,650
Slow down.

848
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,980
Thank you.

849
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,570
You're welcome.

850
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,420
Zhong Hairuo

851
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,740
is actually more understanding than I expected.

852
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,170
Qiao Yang

853
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,900
has been there watching over things for three days straight.

854
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,420
She stayed with the resuscitation team,

855
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,380
brought in the best gastroenterologists in the country,

856
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,530
they've all seen what she's done.

857
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,170
And her mother is still in critical condition.

858
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,130
She doesn't have the time or energy to settle scores with her.

859
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,490
So now,

860
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,740
you're finally going back to Gemu, right?

861
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,820
Gemu needs you.

862
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,820
I feel like I need to split myself in half.

863
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,530
The Starlight Project has just started,

864
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,010
I can't just leave it behind.

865
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,210
I thought I was getting a long vacation.

866
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,820
Turns out it was just a short break.

867
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,050
Back to the hospital?

868
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,740
Yeah.

869
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,820
New doctors have joined recently.

870
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,570
I have to go check on them.
