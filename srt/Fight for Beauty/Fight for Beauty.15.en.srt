1
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,540
Mr. Tang.

2
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,180
What's so urgent?

3
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,130
I still got something...

4
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,380
This part is a bit short.

5
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,100
Ms. Qiao,

6
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,740
Ms. Li and the consulting team are back.

7
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,660
Look at you so excited,

8
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,100
I thought humans had cured cancer or something.

9
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,660
The issue with the apple cheek,

10
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,180
we can solve that easily.

11
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,330
Stop standing there. Get to work!

12
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,820
We should focus on

13
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,130
why patients feel they must have surgery

14
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,890
and try to understand them.

15
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,340
I'll still do Dabao's surgery.

16
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,690
No.

17
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,780
Didn't you watch the show's

18
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,610
next episode preview?

19
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,380
That's adding fuel to the fire.

20
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,850
We just announced that loan cosmetic surgery

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,060
would be strictly investigated,

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,730
and now Qiao Yang's saying

23
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,610
she'll do this surgery.

24
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,290
Why is that?

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,660
No, Mr. Tang,

26
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,780
I've discussed it with Qiao Yang.

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,570
Dabao's situation

28
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,780
isn't how it's portrayed.

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,010
It's malicious editing.

30
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,100
I need to verify with the show.

31
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,890
What good will verifying do?

32
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,570
Even if it's malicious editing,

33
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,890
it's already out there.

34
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,100
If the label

35
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,500
of loan cosmetic surgery sticks,

36
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,660
it'll really harm Gemu.

37
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,450
I shouldn't have gone to see a doctor.

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,130
Such a mess happened

39
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,730
when I was away.

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,570
It's my fault.

41
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,410
My throat problem

42
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,610
acted up these days.

43
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,500
Before you guys came,

44
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,010
I called Guo Xuan

45
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,450
and had a big argument.

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,980
I told her before,

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,220
let me see the video before it's released!

48
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,060
How can she do that?

49
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,060
What's the use of arguing?

50
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,660
And with your voice like that,

51
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,260
can you even out-argue her?

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,290
Ms. Li, you said you called Guo Xuan.

53
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,060
Why didn't she tell me?

54
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,540
What good would it do if she told you?

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,730
By the time you handle it,

56
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,410
there'll be several more trending topics.

57
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,940
Don't blame Ms. Zhou.

58
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,570
Guo Xuan is stubborn.

59
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,290
She said

60
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,940
the video won't be withdrawn,

61
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,060
at most Gemu can issue a statement,

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,450
and she'll help us to release it.

63
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,380
Isn't that infuriating?

64
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:47,940
Well.

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,410
She released the video

66
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,260
for the show's effect,

67
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,220
and now wants us to explain? Why?

68
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,170
Because they've got something on us.

69
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,500
So here's the situation.

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,690
Loan cosmetic surgery

71
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,170
is a fact now.

72
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,100
Let's discuss how we

73
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,610
explain it to the public.

74
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,540
To be honest with you,

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,450
I've been upset these few days.

76
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,850
I haven't slept well for several nights.

77
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,730
I think

78
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,810
Zhang Qing must be fired.

79
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,020
Of course.

80
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,610
She was confused for a moment,

81
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,250
making such a big mistake.

82
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,660
I should take the blame.

83
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,540
I failed to teach her right.

84
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,580
I should be punished, too.

85
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,730
I should leave Gemu with her.

86
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,020
No, no need.

87
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,930
Ms. Li,

88
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,660
don't be so hard on yourself.

89
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,730
How can Gemu do without you?

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,850
If you leave,

91
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,780
what will happen to the consulting team?

92
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,610
Yeah.

93
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,370
No one means that.

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,900
Why so dramatic?

95
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,220
Can you be real?

96
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,220
You're making me feel uneasy.

97
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,170
I absolutely disagree.

98
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,370
If that's the case, I was wrong too.

99
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,050
Should I leave as well?

100
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,730
It's all my fault.

101
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,170
For such a mistake, I must accept the punishment.

102
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,020
I'm willing to forfeit my salary this quarter

103
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,850
and my annual bonus.

104
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,250
No need for that.

105
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,140
If you disagree,

106
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,490
I'll resign.

107
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,140
Okay. Let's do as you said.

108
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,660
Qin,

109
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,050
if money can solve it, it's a small matter.

110
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,730
Let her stop for as long as she wants.

111
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,100
Let's move on quickly.

112
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,250
The problem is, we can't move on

113
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,250
just because we want to.

114
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,410
What about Ms. Qiao's video?

115
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,170
She accepted the interview

116
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,340
without consulting anyone.

117
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,220
At such a critical time,

118
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,980
she insisted on going her own way.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,900
What kind of loss

120
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,340
has this brought to Gemu?

121
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,460
How should we handle it?

122
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,220
Shouldn't we discuss this?

123
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,250
What's wrong?

124
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,290
Are you resigning?

125
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,850
Say something.

126
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,700
The loan cosmetic surgery issue,

127
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,220
just do as Ms. Li said.

128
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,050
Issue a statement and be done with it.

129
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,100
No.

130
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,170
I'll write

131
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,700
the statement.

132
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,490
Don't worry.

133
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,730
And about

134
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,810
the ridiculous party Jiao Ai held.

135
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,850
If not for Ms. Li keeping an eye on it,

136
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,410
our people would have all

137
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,780
been poached by them.

138
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,250
Is it that serious?

139
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,780
Let Ms. Li explain later.

140
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,730
And you.

141
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,250
How could you go alone?

142
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,290
How could you

143
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,020
tolerate Du Jun's

144
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,290
nonsense?

145
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,290
Du Jun invited me

146
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,140
personally that day.

147
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:47,850
Given that

148
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,540
how he left last time,

149
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,290
I feared he'd pull something again.

150
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,660
Good thing I went.

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,290
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

152
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,780
I wouldn't believe it.

153
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,370
Guess who else was there?

154
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,930
Lu Ziyou, Wei Xiaoxi,

155
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,930
and your apprentice Chen Mingjie.

156
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,980
I know.

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,100
I told him to go.

158
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,410
I knew they went.

159
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,610
Just didn't expect you to be so concerned

160
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,050
despite not feeling well.

161
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,460
I'm just a worrier.

162
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,660
Seeing that scene yesterday,

163
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,050
I felt really disappointed.

164
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,810
They've been working at the hospital for years.

165
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,100
Where's their loyalty?

166
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,700
Is it a management issue

167
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,780
or a people issue?

168
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,140
It's management personnel's fault.

169
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,140
Qin, Jingwen.

170
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,020
You should discuss hospital matters

171
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,580
with Ms. Li more often.

172
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,410
Don't make decisions on your own.

173
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,170
Those rumors about coaxing patients

174
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,700
into loan cosmetic surgery

175
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,220
are true after investigation.

176
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,900
Consultant Zhang Qing, for personal gain,

177
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,930
encouraged patients to take loans for surgery,

178
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,980
violating professional ethics and has been dismissed.

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,980
Qing is really unlucky.

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,610
Related management personnel will face appropriate actions.

181
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,700
Gemu will not tolerate

182
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,810
any violations of industry ethics

183
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,980
and standards.

184
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,700
To prevent such incidents,

185
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,900
our hospital will make personnel adjustments.

186
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,660
Medical work will be

187
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,580
fully managed by Director Dong Jinsong.

188
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,700
The hospital appointing you to take over medical affairs

189
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,890
means you're the director, right?

190
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,340
Should we celebrate?

191
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,460
Look at you, can't keep your cool.

192
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,100
Did you forget my reading?

193
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,650
It's not time for action.

194
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,180
Stay cautious.

195
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,580
Look at those two

196
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,650
who opposed Ms. Li.

197
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,490
See what happened?

198
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,650
Once the statement is out,

199
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,890
it's set in stone.

200
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,130
It's just a statement.

201
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,420
We still need to address

202
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,130
the loan cosmetic surgery issue.

203
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,060
What's there to address?

204
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,980
This whole series of matters

205
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,530
and the video by Guo Xuan

206
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,940
are all her plans.

207
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:07,980
This matter ends

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,850
as per her plan.

209
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,580
I know.

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,770
You don't know. You know nothing.

211
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,370
Can't we not have this chaos at home

212
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,980
whenever something happens at work?

213
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,060
I always have to balance work

214
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,100
and your emotions whenever

215
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,100
something happens to Gemu.

216
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,820
My emotions?

217
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,610
Aren't we fighting together?

218
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,610
So I'm being unreasonable now?

219
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,730
Fine, I'm being unreasonable.

220
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,890
What?

221
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,940
Nuts.

222
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,730
Chen Mingjie,

223
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,010
can you be a bit more straightforward,

224
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,650
live up to your name?

225
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,700
I can't be straightforward.

226
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,010
Everyone at the hospital knows

227
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,370
we went to that party yesterday.

228
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,820
The director hasn't asked me about it.

229
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,820
What do you think she's thinking?

230
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,610
What can she think?

231
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,650
What are you afraid of?

232
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,700
It wasn't just us.

233
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,100
There were seven or eight people.

234
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,490
Are they going to fire us all?

235
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,700
Why don't you say it louder

236
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,180
so the whole world can hear?

237
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,770
Look at you.

238
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,060
My mentor said it well.

239
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,530
For us doctors,

240
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,490
in the end,

241
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,180
it's about our skills and expertise.

242
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,010
If you're capable, you'll find work anywhere.

243
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,490
Now Gemu is asking us to stay,

244
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,460
not us begging to stay at Gemu.

245
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,060
What do you mean?

246
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,980
Are you leaving?

247
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,060
What's wrong with looking around?

248
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,890
Why so serious?

249
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,580
What can I do?

250
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,250
I was hoping for my mentor,

251
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,010
but now

252
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,770
she can't even take care of herself.

253
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,130
We have to think for ourselves.

254
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,460
Same goes for you.

255
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,820
With the loan issue resolved,

256
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,180
Dr. Meng may come back to work tomorrow.

257
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,490
Will you still have a part in Sun Xiao's surgery?

258
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,300
I was just looking for you, Ms. Qiao.

259
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,250
Don't take the statement to heart.

260
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,530
It's just a formality for the public.

261
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,250
Mr. Tang and Mr. Qin

262
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,980
know the real situation.

263
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,650
You know the situation

264
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,010
best, right?

265
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,530
I have to say,

266
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,940
you're really something.

267
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,180
Ms. Qiao,

268
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,100
I know you're upset.

269
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,700
My punishment is much worse than yours.

270
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,610
You might not know,

271
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,850
I requested it myself.

272
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,460
You really have a big heart.

273
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,420
People

274
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,100
make mistakes.

275
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,100
I've already talked to Guo Xuan.

276
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,100
You'll just need to apologize

277
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,730
to the public on camera,

278
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,890
and this will be over.

279
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,130
Apologize?

280
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,580
Apologize for what?

281
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,100
Ms. Zhou, just in time.

282
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,250
Help me convince Ms. Qiao.

283
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,770
She's being impulsive again.

284
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,060
If we've done wrong,

285
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,650
we should take the criticism

286
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,220
and accept the feedback, right?

287
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,490
Cheng Dabao's surgery can't be done.

288
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,700
What did I do wrong?

289
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,770
The point isn't whether Cheng Dabao

290
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,610
should have surgery,

291
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,370
it's whether loan cosmetic surgery should be done.

292
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,060
So

293
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,580
firing Qing is the end of it?

294
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,010
Nothing else to pursue?

295
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,770
Ms. Qiao,

296
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,650
who else do you want to fire?

297
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,650
I'll still do that surgery.

298
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,460
I'm quitting this stupid competition.

299
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,610
You saw it.

300
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,980
Everyone should

301
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,770
stay true to their character,

302
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,460
but you can't just give up

303
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,490
when facing difficulties.

304
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,940
You have to consider the bigger picture.

305
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,130
Your throat is better.

306
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,340
On and off.

307
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,180
I'm really...

308
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,770
Why are you here?

309
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,530
What's up?

310
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,700
Sunbathing my legs.

311
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,490
What legs?

312
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,010
I think you're sunbathing your mouth.

313
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,490
Easy, easy, easy.

314
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,530
Does it hurt?

315
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,700
Yes!

316
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,770
You're a doctor,

317
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,300
standing all day for surgery.

318
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,890
I thought you were made of steel.

319
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,940
Hurts?

320
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,700
Just massage.

321
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,300
Why so much talking?

322
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,220
You'll only get hurt

323
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,490
if you keep riding like that.

324
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,180
You grit your teeth whenever you're riding

325
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,530
like someone owes you money.

326
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,730
Don't get so angry.

327
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,890
Anger harms the body.

328
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,610
How can I not be angry?

329
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,010
You haven't seen Li Qi's face.

330
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,100
Qingqing got fired

331
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,490
to take the fall for me.

332
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,460
After working with them for years,

333
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,700
how come I never saw them for who they are?

334
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,370
How did you endure it all these years?

335
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,890
Are you on their side?

336
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,650
I shouldn't have come to Gemu.

337
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,820
I shouldn't have trusted Zhou Jingwen.

338
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,700
Ms. Guo.

339
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,250
Is Qiao Yang with you?

340
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,180
She texted me saying she's quitting the competition,

341
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,460
and now she won't answer the phone.

342
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,460
It's just a video.

343
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,300
Once the announcement comes out, it'll be reversed.

344
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,180
Is it necessary?

345
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,370
Mr. Guo,

346
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,220
you know Qiao Yang's personality,

347
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,940
right?

348
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,300
Jingwen,

349
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,250
talk to Qiao Yang.

350
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,700
The show's already half-recorded.

351
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,610
If she quits now, I can't handle it.

352
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,940
Can you help me out?

353
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,850
How can I help you?

354
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,180
You know my relationship with Qiao Yang.

355
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,700
Maybe ask Ms. Li?

356
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,130
Didn't you all agree privately?

357
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,700
Alright, you don't need to worry about it.

358
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,850
How's your case preparation going?

359
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,650
Going smoothly?

360
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,460
Don't worry, it's all good.

361
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,850
You went to Jiao Ai, right?

362
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,250
Yeah.

363
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,180
The Italian pasta at the hotel was delicious.

364
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,980
I've been wanting to go.

365
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,730
Come on.

366
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,530
I'm telling you,

367
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,250
the salary at Jiao Ai is really high.

368
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,420
Look, a traitor.

369
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,060
I'm just trying to raise Dadan.

370
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,060
It's not easy.

371
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,850
Summer camp, tutoring classes.

372
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,370
A lot of pressure, you know?

373
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,580
If I found someone to share the load,

374
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,420
wouldn't that be nice?

375
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,250
In your case,

376
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,580
you might need a rich woman to help you out.

377
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,700
Found one.

378
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,580
I don't have money.

379
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,890
I'm not interested in being a stepmom.

380
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,250
Forget it.

381
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,820
What are you interested in?

382
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,100
Interested in getting revenge?

383
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,300
Got too much free time?

384
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,700
I'd rather think

385
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,530
about Dabao's surgery.

386
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,460
There are still two points I'm unsure about.

387
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,420
This,

388
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,770
and this.

389
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,530
You're seeking revenge, right?

390
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,060
Smoke less.

391
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,220
Too much tar is bad for your skin.

392
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,420
Look, look.

393
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,490
All wilted.

394
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,010
This is tricky.

395
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,380
Can it be saved?

396
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,620
You need patience to grow plants.

397
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,530
Take it one step at a time.

398
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,810
Alright.

399
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,420
I'll loosen the soil first.

400
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,050
If it really can't be moved,

401
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,010
I'll ask you for help.

402
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,900
No.

403
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,980
Don't come to me this time.

404
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,810
It's up to you

405
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,250
to save it.

406
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,010
The tumor is under the skin.

407
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,140
Let me put it another way.

408
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,250
It's like a dumpling.

409
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,810
The skin is the dumpling wrapper.

410
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,220
The tumor is the filling.

411
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,770
Surgery is cutting open the wrapper,

412
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,730
taking out the filling,

413
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,570
and then using the wrapper to repair

414
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,660
and restore the leftover wound.

415
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,490
Is that clear enough?

416
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,220
That's a great analogy.

417
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,570
It's a shame you're not a teacher.

418
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,330
Actually, our work is quite similar

419
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,050
to yours, Ms. Sun.

420
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,330
We're both shaping people.

421
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,860
But you use a teaching stick,

422
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,220
and I use a scalpel.

423
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,730
What's wrong?

424
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,380
Nothing, just ate too much tonight.

425
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,330
Keep chatting, don't mind me.

426
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,140
About the last test you did.

427
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,180
Is it accurate?

428
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,180
Why not get checked at another hospital?

429
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,090
How can a blood test report be wrong?

430
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,770
You saw the report.

431
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,700
Not pregnant.

432
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,700
Stop being paranoid.

433
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,380
Ms. Zhou.

434
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,180
-You called me? -Mingjie.

435
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,980
You've met, Dr. Chen Mingjie.

436
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,290
I've discussed with Ms. Sun,

437
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,730
you'll handle breast reconstruction.

438
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,140
Tomorrow at 10 am,

439
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,900
tumor removal and breast reconstruction,

440
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,570
about four hours.

441
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,220
There will still be a team filming.

442
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,140
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

443
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,290
You're welcome. Get some rest.

444
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,420
Dr. Chen, I'll be counting on you.

445
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,460
Don't worry.

446
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,530
Rest well.

447
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,660
Eighteen pairs of stitches.

448
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,250
An auspicious number.

449
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,220
The tumor is removed,

450
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,220
now it's time for the breast reconstruction.

451
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,660
Dr. Chen,

452
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,290
it's over to you.

453
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,940
Let me introduce,

454
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,010
the prince of plastic surgery at Gemu,

455
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,940
the expert at stealing the show, Mr. Chen Mingjie.

456
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,490
If it's about stealing the show, you're my mentor.

457
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,660
I'm just

458
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,860
the future king of liposuction.

459
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,620
I've scheduled Dabao's surgery for next week.

460
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,900
You'll lead, I'll guide.

461
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,900
I've sent the surgical plan to your email.

462
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,570
The difficulties are included.

463
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,180
If you have any questions,

464
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,380
feel free to ask me.

465
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,770
Why stand there? Get ready.

466
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,860
Okay.

467
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,490
Thank you.

468
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,860
Growing well, little one.

469
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,660
Don't worry.

470
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,530
The surgery went smoothly.

471
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,660
My colleague is there.

472
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,050
This liposuction king's skills,

473
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,090
how will you

474
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,330
rate it?

475
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,570
I wouldn't dare rate it.

476
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,770
But I do feel my job

477
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,460
might be at risk.

478
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,700
That's true.

479
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,010
It's said teaching apprentices will starve the master.

480
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,940
Looks like we need a backup plan.

481
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,940
Wipe my sweat.

482
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,290
Is the air conditioning broken?

483
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,380
So hot.

484
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,180
Why so tense?

485
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,050
You two, calm down.

486
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,180
You've used two wipes

487
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,290
in less than an hour.

488
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,980
I think you two broke

489
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,620
the air conditioning.

490
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,660
Have a look.

491
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,730
This is the centrifuge machine.

492
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,490
It's specifically for purifying fat,

493
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,570
separating moisture.

494
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,250
The higher the purity of the fat,

495
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,980
the better the shape,

496
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,420
and the higher the survival rate.

497
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,330
Wang Xuchen!

498
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,770
Next.

499
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,700
Me?

500
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,330
Hi.

501
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,330
Aren't you filming this week?

502
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,290
I need to tell you something.

503
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,460
Sorry.

504
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,620
Go ahead.

505
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,380
Seriously?

506
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,420
That's great.

507
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,140
Right?

508
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,290
Xiaoqin, could you leave for a moment?

509
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,460
Female lead. Signed the contract.

510
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,380
I might really make it big this time.

511
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,010
If you're be in his film,

512
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,900
you'll not only make it big,

513
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,770
you'll be a Cannes Best Actress

514
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,050
next year.

515
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:09,980
Come on,

516
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,180
give me an autograph.

517
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,860
Stop it.

518
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,530
I'll sign a whole wall for you, okay?

519
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,770
Just do as we plan.

520
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,180
But you have to make it quick.

521
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,090
Because we'll start shooting

522
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,140
in three months.

523
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,980
Three months?

524
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,660
Even if the swelling goes down,

525
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,530
the subcutaneous tissue

526
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,810
needs time to heal.

527
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,940
Use the machines

528
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,620
and that kind of stuff.

529
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,810
Can't they speed up recovery?

530
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,220
No.

531
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,860
It'll make your face look stiff.

532
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,660
If you want it to look natural,

533
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,460
it takes six months at least.

534
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,730
But...

535
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,620
Calm down.

536
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,180
Have you thought

537
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,810
that Director Wang chose you

538
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,250
because of your

539
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,660
natural face?

540
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,730
I don't dare to guess

541
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,220
what he's thinking.

542
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,730
But I think

543
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,180
I have to do something.

544
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,620
I need the audience to remember me,

545
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,730
remember my face.

546
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,140
Why don't you fill her forehead,

547
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,460
cheekbones, and chin,

548
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,980
widen her eyes,

549
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,980
inject Botox into the cheeks?

550
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,620
And she'll look perfect.

551
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,380
Who are you channeling today?

552
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,050
You know I'm talking nonsense.

553
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,860
What do you mean?

554
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,220
Respecting her for who she is.

555
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,330
Every individual is unique.

556
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,620
Why conform to a single standard

557
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,900
of beauty?

558
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,530
What if some big director

559
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,530
just likes her look?

560
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,900
If her face is changed,

561
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,460
she may lose the opportunity.

562
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,460
Do I smell beef stew?

563
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,620
It's provided in the cafeteria today.

564
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,380
Didn't you say there's nothing good today

565
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,660
so we'd eat instant noodles?

566
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,050
Instant noodles are the best.

567
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,290
I love beef.

568
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,730
Thanks a lot.

569
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,460
Can you respect me,

570
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,380
respect individual differences?

571
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,700
Alright.

572
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,180
How long have those red spots been on your chest?

573
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,420
Ms. Zhou,

574
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,050
how's my mom's surgery?

575
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,290
It went well.

576
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,180
The bleeding was well controlled,

577
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,700
and the tumor's cleanly removed.

578
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,380
She's resting now.

579
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,770
Neurofibromatosis is hereditary.

580
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,900
Those red spots on you are tumors.

581
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,770
Are you pregnant?

582
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,980
Don't want your mom to know?

583
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,860
It used to be spots.

584
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,940
But it's flared up recently.

585
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,900
Progesterone stimulation.

586
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,330
The tumors will grow more later on.

587
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,250
I know all this.

588
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,980
As long as you know.

589
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,730
How about this?

590
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,140
I'll schedule a brain MRI for you.

591
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,460
Your faintness

592
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,860
might be caused by a lesion

593
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,860
in your brain.

594
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,730
If the lesion's in a bad spot,

595
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,010
pressing on your optic nerve, it'd be troublesome.

596
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,220
Don't tell my mom.

597
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,490
Don't worry about that now.

598
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,010
Further tests are needed.

599
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,180
Rest well.

600
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,090
Ms. Zhou,

601
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,460
after the tests,

602
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,220
are you going to advise me to terminate the pregnancy?

603
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,530
My mom got sick when she was pregnant

604
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,460
with me.

605
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,730
She suffered a lot.

606
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,860
She advised me not to have kids.

607
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,090
But it still happened.

608
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,250
Ms. Zhou,

609
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,490
you've seen a lot.

610
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,220
Do you think

611
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,220
I shouldn't have this child?

612
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,220
They all think Plan A is good,

613
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,090
but I believe Plan B

614
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,090
truly solves the problem.

615
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,900
Do you think so?

616
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,290
Yes.

617
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,530
I rushed over to ask you.

618
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,980
Since you also think Plan B is better,

619
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,380
I feel more confident.

620
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,420
Plan A is safe,

621
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,050
but safe doesn't mean it solves the problem.

622
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,090
Alright, I'm off.

623
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,250
Off work? Go.

624
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,420
Ms. Qiao.

625
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,980
Qi.

626
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,980
This one.

627
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:14,900
This one.

628
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,380
And this.

629
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,860
And some spicy boiled pork slices.

630
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,330
Ms. Qiao.

631
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,660
Order more.

632
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,730
I'm treating today.

633
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,940
Found a wallet?

634
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,180
We can't eat that much.

635
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,140
That's enough.

636
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,490
Thanks.

637
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,570
Ms. Qiao,

638
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,290
do you get any internal discounts?

639
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,660
Xia asked me to get a membership card.

640
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,290
She said it's

641
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,860
Gemu's fifth anniversary,

642
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,180
with great deals.

643
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,140
Recharge 10,000 and get 12,000.

644
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,900
I thought if I asked you,

645
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,860
would it be cheaper?

646
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,660
Did you change jobs?

647
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,050
No, still at the service center.

648
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,810
Where did you get so much money?

649
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,050
Just had double eyelid surgery and now a card?

650
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,700
I got married, remember?

651
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,220
Got lots of red envelopes.

652
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,050
Ms. Qiao.

653
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,900
I'm at the richest point in my life.

654
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,730
Got it.

655
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,010
Wealth makes you happy.

656
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,140
No.

657
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,420
It's you.

658
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,980
After you did my double eyelids,

659
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,290
I see things more clearly.

660
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,810
Let me see.

661
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,250
I feel more confident.

662
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,770
Girls should dress up.

663
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,180
Take ourselves seriously.

664
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,050
There's a difference between pretty and not pretty.

665
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,490
Colleagues who never

666
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,940
talked to me

667
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,810
are greeting me now.

668
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,290
I get it.

669
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,700
But don't get addicted.

670
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,660
Double eyelids are enough.

671
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,050
Don't waste money on a card.

672
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,980
Don't.

673
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,570
You just got a taste of it,

674
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,090
and want to transform yourself now?

675
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,770
That's not real confidence.

676
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,530
You should know when enough is enough.

677
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,620
There are many ways to gain recognition,

678
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,250
not just by getting pretty.

679
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,730
Please, Ms. Qiao.

680
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,660
You're the doctor who knows me best.

681
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,660
Only you

682
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,290
can make me more beautiful.

683
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,180
I want to be an outstanding person.

684
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,860
Ms. Qiao.

685
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,980
It's your choice to take the surgery you want.

686
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,380
As your doctor,

687
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,460
I have the right to refuse.

688
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,050
As your friend,

689
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,050
I have to remind you

690
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,980
that surgery can't change fate.

691
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,700
Do you remember Qiao Hui?

692
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,180
I was young then.

693
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,810
Dad mentioned it once or twice.

694
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,940
I only

695
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,090
know the gist.

696
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,460
Qiao Hui was the epitome of perfection.

697
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,980
I never thought someone so beautiful

698
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,010
couldn't escape fate.

699
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,090
The provincial drama troupe's second round results are out.

700
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,290
Guess who ranked first?

701
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,770
Impressive.

702
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,050
There were hundreds of candidates.

703
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,490
Not many, just 800.

704
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,900
Final interview next month.

705
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,980
When you gave up

706
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,860
that five-year teaching spot

707
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,700
to take this exam,

708
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,250
I thought you were taking a big risk.

709
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,290
Didn't expect it.

710
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,490
High skills, bold heart.

711
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,700
Respect.

712
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,140
Who am I?

713
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,460
If I do it, I do it to the fullest.

714
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,810
There's no "settle" in my dictionary.

715
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,090
Shouldn't you celebrate me?

716
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,220
Celebrate? Absolutely.

717
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,770
What you want to eat? My treat.

718
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,420
Food can wait.

719
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,620
I'm at your hospital

720
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,900
to get a face-slimming injection.

721
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,490
Your hospital's too pricey,

722
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,860
over 3,000 for one shot.

723
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,250
Can you help me talk to Ji

724
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,490
for an internal price?

725
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,090
Face-slimming?

726
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,900
You're beautiful.

727
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,730
I'm not refusing to help.

728
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,050
It's unnecessary.

729
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,090
Is skinny beauty really attractive?

730
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:45,900
Also,

731
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,220
from my professional view,

732
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,220
a healthy face should have some flesh.

733
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,570
You don't understand.

734
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,250
My face muscles are huge,

735
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,140
very noticeable on camera.

736
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,660
There are only three spots.

737
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,380
I'm ranked third overall.

738
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,460
You have to help me.

739
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,700
I have to fight for it.

740
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,250
I hated many people

741
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,290
because of that incident.

742
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,010
But I hated myself most.

743
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,460
If I knew

744
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,860
that surgery can't change fate,

745
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,860
I'd have stopped her

746
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,810
from going to that rooftop.

747
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,900
Got it.

748
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,380
Sorry

749
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,050
for reminding you of sad things.

750
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,660
I'll listen to you.

751
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,380
No card,

752
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,140
no more face work.

753
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,810
You said

754
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,620
you have no strengths.

755
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,940
I disagree.

756
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,700
To me,

757
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,730
you're kind, gentle, and filial.

758
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,330
Got good grades and empathetic.

759
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,810
Everyone likes you.

760
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,490
But you've never accepted

761
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,900
or trusted yourself.

762
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,180
Actually,

763
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,220
I've always

764
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,570
been afraid of you for no reason.

765
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,010
But when you bought me the wedding dress,

766
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,220
I felt

767
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,010
you understood me.

768
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,220
I know.

769
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,090
That was your life's need.

770
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,420
You want to be seen.

771
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,220
I just happened to open that door for you.

772
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,570
It's up to you

773
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,860
to be the person you want to be

774
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,530
and to get the life you want.

775
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,050
Eat up.

776
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,490
Print 20 copies of this.

777
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,290
Got it.

778
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,570
Ms. Li.

779
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,180
-Ms. Li. -Go.

780
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,140
Get back to your work.

781
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,530
Ms. Li.

782
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,570
My chin was

783
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,730
a bit recessed.

784
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,620
Four injections here.

785
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,530
But hyaluronic acid was too soft,

786
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,900
causing sagging.

787
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,180
Now it gets droopy.

788
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,490
-Then I... -Wait a sec.

789
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,330
Let me check.

790
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,980
Which is the post-op one?

791
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,010
The left one.

792
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,330
Isn't it obvious?

793
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,700
Let me take a closer look.

794
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,620
Then I added an implant.

795
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,980
Before that,

796
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,220
I found out I was allergic to hyaluronidase.

797
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,010
So it wasn't dissolved completely.

798
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,620
Now I've got an implant

799
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,330
and hyaluronic acid in my chin.

800
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,730
It looks a bit exaggerated.

801
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,660
I went to many hospitals

802
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,810
to get the hyaluronic acid dissolved.

803
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,220
But the implant's too small and thin.

804
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,250
After that, my face is almost

805
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,700
the same as before.

806
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,380
Got it.

807
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,010
I think

808
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,860
we should remove the implant first.

809
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,940
Shouldn't we enhance it

810
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,900
with more hyaluronic acid?

811
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,810
I don't think so.

812
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,010
Your facial proportions

813
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,050
are perfect now.

814
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,900
Adding more

815
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,010
would be a bit exaggerated.

816
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,460
It's okay.

817
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,330
Xia said

818
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,090
your skills are great.

819
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,700
She's arranged everything.

820
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,770
I've paid.

821
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,570
She said I could have the injection after the consultation.

822
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,980
Dosage and site are all set?

823
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,660
Exactly.

824
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,770
Xia arranged it?

825
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,010
Yeah, she's super professional.

826
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,570
Well.

827
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,460
Xia is just

828
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,700
a professional consultant.

829
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,140
As a doctor,

830
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,330
I advise

831
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,220
no more hyaluronic acid.

832
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,290
Refund the order.

833
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,050
But she said...

834
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,700
If you want the implant removed,

835
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,050
I can help with that.

836
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,810
Those consultants

837
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,490
are overstepping.

838
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,380
They brought arranged orders to me.

839
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,180
Who's the doctor here?

840
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,810
I wasn't polite today.

841
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,660
I turned the client down

842
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,220
in front of her.

843
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,050
It's different now.

844
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,660
When Ms. Zhou was around,

845
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,460
the consultants respected us.

846
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,330
Now Ms. Li's in charge,

847
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,250
we're just tools.

848
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,330
Milk?

849
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,090
No.

850
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,010
Where's Mr. Dong?

851
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,130
Isn't he in charge of medical affairs now?

852
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,420
Why isn't he speaking up for us?

853
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,300
Mr. Dong.

854
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,170
Mr. Dong.

855
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,380
Mr. Dong.

856
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,980
This is Mr. Dong.

857
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,420
Hello, Mr. Dong.

858
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,090
So many people.

859
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,860
One at a time.

860
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,980
Arrange them.

861
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,940
He

862
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,980
only focuses on profits.

863
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,460
Can't be happier now.

864
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,380
Gosh.

865
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,170
What's wrong with this coffee machine?

866
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,490
The coffee tastes awful.

867
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,420
It's…

868
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,210
Ms. Li.

869
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,170
Ms. Li.

870
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,050
Ms. Li.

871
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,090
If you have issues with consulting, talk to me.

872
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,300
I'll criticize them for any shortcomings.

873
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,010
Everything's negotiable.

874
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,170
Why take it out on the client?

875
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,210
Who's taking it out?

876
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,740
I'm a doctor.

877
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,340
I have to give

878
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,490
a professional judgment.

879
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,170
If it can't be done, it can't.

880
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,530
I must be frank.

881
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,820
I know you're straightforward.

882
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,010
I understand you speak up for doctors.

883
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,860
I just want to discuss

884
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,490
your consultation approach.

885
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,340
Good thing they were regular clients.

886
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,130
Free services calm them down.

887
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,900
Ms. Li,

888
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,210
if you have time,

889
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,820
please fix the coffee machine.

890
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,010
If not,

891
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,780
it thinks it's a helicopter,

892
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,210
ready to take off anytime.

893
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,460
Gao Wen, stop drinking.

894
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,460
You have surgery later.

895
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,740
Aren't you afraid of not holding it in?

896
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,740
Ms. Li.

897
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,780
it's really that Dabao.

898
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,010
I thought it was just a name match.

899
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,650
After all that fuss, still doing it?

900
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,130
Not afraid of stirring up more trouble?

901
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,340
They paid.

902
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,610
Why not?

903
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,300
You're really something.

904
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,650
Are you cold?

905
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,780
Why are you shivering?

906
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,690
I'm not cold.

907
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,460
I'm just nervous.

908
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,980
My heart's racing.

909
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,380
Look at you shaking.

910
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,340
The line's about to veer into your armpit.

911
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,130
I'm scared, Dr. Qiao.

912
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,460
Don't be scared.

913
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,460
We'll sort it out soon.

914
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,420
Relax.

915
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,300
I'll draw a dragon on your left,

916
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,460
and a rainbow on your right.

917
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,900
Then make it

918
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,530
look cool for me, okay?

919
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,300
No problem.

920
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,210
We're not doing surgery today.

921
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,130
Why not?

922
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,980
We agreed, didn't we?

923
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,210
Don't get upset.

924
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,300
I discussed with my colleague.

925
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,050
You've been an actress for years.

926
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,170
Many around you have had surgery,

927
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,780
but you never did,

928
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,170
even after so much pressure.

929
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:52,980
Why?

930
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,740
Because you love your face,

931
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,740
right?

932
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,460
What good is it if I like it?

933
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,900
Others don't.

934
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,610
The audience doesn't.

935
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,900
The directors don't.

936
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,690
I'm tired of fighting them.

937
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,610
How about this?

938
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,420
I'll inject a bit

939
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,900
of hyaluronic acid

940
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,980
in your temples,

941
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,420
and the base of your nose.

942
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,050
It'll make your face

943
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,090
look fuller

944
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,420
without being exaggerated.

945
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,050
Trust me.

946
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,010
Let me see.

947
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,210
The breast reconstruction looks great.

948
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,740
The tumor has been cleared well.

949
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,610
Congratulations, Ms. Sun.

950
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,460
The surgery was successful.

951
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,610
Thanks to you, Doctor.

952
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,530
Not at all.

953
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,460
Look,

954
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,690
this was her tumor before.

955
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,420
It's all smoothed out now.

956
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,490
The scars will fade.

957
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,050
So amazing.

958
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,490
If not for this show,

959
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,780
I wouldn't know plastic surgery

960
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,650
was this advanced.

961
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,300
Alright, you can dress now.

962
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,050
Let me help.

963
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:03,940
Thanks.

964
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,210
Not much change, huh?

965
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,900
Injections are subtle.

966
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,860
They're not as drastic as surgery.

967
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,130
So it's still my face?

968
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,460
I don't know much.

969
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,050
But I think

970
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,740
actors should at least

971
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,940
have their own personality,

972
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,900
be recognizable.

973
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,740
If you look like others,

974
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,820
a common face,

975
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,610
what's the point

976
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,900
of being Song Yuanyuan?

977
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,940
Good news.

978
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,340
The plastic surgery competition results are out.

979
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,340
Already?

980
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,780
I was just checking Sun Xiao's post-op.

981
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,490
Official results aren't out yet,

982
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,940
but Mr. Li has connections.

983
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,260
Guess your rank?

984
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,820
Guo Xuan kept filming me.

985
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,420
I didn't get to follow it up.

986
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,210
So?

987
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,260
Sixth.

988
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,130
National sixth.

989
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:19,980
Look at her,

990
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,610
not even excited.

991
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,130
Competitions like this

992
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,380
used to be dominated by public hospitals.

993
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,090
Jingwen's first time,

994
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,610
and she's sixth nationally.

995
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,940
When the results are out,

996
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,780
we should really promote it.

997
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,490
No need.

998
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,420
This competition is for industry insiders.

999
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,860
When Qiao Yang got first,

1000
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,380
we didn't mention it.

1001
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,780
That was before.

1002
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,420
You have no idea

1003
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,300
how popular our show is now.

1004
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,940
Alright, leave it to me.

1005
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,260
I've arranged everything.

1006
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,420
This needs

1007
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,610
Ms. Li's help.

1008
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,490
Sure thing.

1009
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,690
After two rounds,

1010
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,780
despite Ms. Qiao's unexpected withdrawal,

1011
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,570
generally speaking,

1012
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,210
Gemu's reputation soared.

1013
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,460
Especially you,

1014
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,860
your performance was outstanding.

1015
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,420
Of course,

1016
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,610
our promotion helped a bit.

1017
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,860
You're too modest.

1018
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,460
The next round starts on the 14th.

1019
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,530
Let's keep it up.

1020
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,300
Ms. Zhou,

1021
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,380
any plans?

1022
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,780
Sorry,

1023
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,610
I won't participate in the competition or the show.

1024
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,610
You...

1025
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,050
Don't.

1026
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,090
You're being moody, right?

1027
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,420
You don't need to.

1028
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,460
Jingwen.

1029
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,900
This is the time to push forward.

1030
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,300
Show them your hard work

1031
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,010
over the years.

1032
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,740
Once I've decided, I won't change.

1033
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,210
I have surgery on bed 16.

1034
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,650
We were having a nice chat.

1035
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,170
What's with Ms. Zhou?

1036
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,780
You ate so much as a kid.

1037
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,090
When was this?

1038
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,090
What was I eating?

1039
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,210
You have the nerve to mention it.

1040
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,610
Couldn't stop you. Look,

1041
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,460
smelling your own feet.

1042
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,490
Look at it.

1043
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,010
No, I'm just sniffing my nose.

1044
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,650
Do you know when this was?

1045
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,380
You wanted that ice cream.

1046
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,380
Ms. Zhou,

1047
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,130
do you really think I shouldn't have this child?

1048
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,610
In your case,

1049
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,170
the tumors are growing too fast.

1050
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,050
It might be worse than your mom's.

1051
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,130
If the brain MRI shows tumors

1052
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,170
in your brain,

1053
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,780
as a doctor,

1054
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,530
I wouldn't recommend having it.

1055
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,460
Do you have kids?

1056
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,460
No.

1057
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,260
I'm a preschool teacher.

1058
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,530
The kids in my class

1059
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,940
tell me

1060
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,860
they chose their moms from the sky

1061
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,460
before they were born.

1062
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:04,130
They'd fight over the ones they liked.

1063
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,490
One kid named Tian,

1064
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,860
told me

1065
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,090
she beat Jia

1066
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,260
and was born a few days earlier

1067
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,610
to get her favorite mom.

1068
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,650
Kids say the cutest things.

1069
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,860
They're angels.

1070
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,090
Yes.

1071
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,900
I think this child

1072
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,460
chose me,

1073
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,090
just like I chose my mom.

1074
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,690
As my mom's daughter, I'm happy.

1075
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,460
I want a chance

1076
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,780
to give this happiness to her.
