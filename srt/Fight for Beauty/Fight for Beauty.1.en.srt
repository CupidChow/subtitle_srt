1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,010
Once the surgery is successful, you'll get a new lease on life.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,060
Of course, throughout the process,

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,940
you'll have to pay quite a price.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,250
As your doctor, my job is to make that price

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,690
as small as possible.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,050
This is going to be a huge challenge

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,260
for both you and me.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,810
During the surgery,

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,940
a lot of unpredictable situations might come up.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,460
So,

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,980
we need to tackle this battle together.

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,090
Take this risk together.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,980
I'll give it my all.

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,900
But what's crucial

15
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,650
is your determination.

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,300
Of course,

17
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,050
I tell every patient

18
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,010
no matter what anyone else says,

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,980
your own willpower is what matters most.

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,650
I just want to live like a normal person.

21
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,660
What did I tell you after the surgery?

22
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,450
No strenuous exercise for a week.

23
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,850
You just had liposuction three days ago, and you're out running?

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,660
If the ambulance had been five minutes late,

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,780
you'd be dead!

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,820
Keep an eye on her.

27
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,890
She still needs to be monitored for two more days.

28
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,220
Got it.

29
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,890
Hey, girl,

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,890
you're already so thin.

31
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,570
What's left to suck out?

32
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,010
Take it from me,

33
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,730
don't ruin your body over this.

34
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,540
I'm so sick of hearing that kind of "sensible nonsense."

35
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,130
Hair falling out everywhere, all the time,

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,500
and I haven't had my period in six months.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,780
If it weren't for keeping my job,

38
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,220
who'd want to live like this?

39
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,820
People only care if you're skinny enough on camera,

40
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,170
if you can squeeze into the smallest size.

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,380
I need to be discharged.

42
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,170
I should be on a plane right now.

43
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,380
This show's coming to the country for the first time!

44
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,220
Fine.

45
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,500
Careful.

46
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,410
You can leave the hospital

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,660
when you can walk out on your own.

48
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,980
This is the best hospital,

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,340
with the best doctors.

50
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,010
We're lucky to even have a treatment plan.

51
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,850
Keep an eye on her.

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,170
What more do you want?

53
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,540
Stop fussing about getting discharged, will you?

54
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,260
Hello.

55
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,380
What's going on here?

56
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,450
Sorry about that,

57
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,540
just throwing a tantrum.

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,570
I'll sort it out right away.

59
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,380
Smash it, smash me to death!

60
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,290
You're not the only one annoyed.

61
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,290
I'm tired too.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,410
You only need to worry about your condition.

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,540
I'm the one bearing all the things alone.

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,570
I borrowed the money for your treatment.

65
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,730
Now I don't have any friends left.

66
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,610
Everyone's avoiding me.

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,500
You can yell at me,

68
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,660
but what about me? Who can I yell at?

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,490
Keep your voice down, this is a hospital.

70
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,730
I'll figure out the money situation.

71
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,410
Don't worry.

72
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,220
Go lie on the bed.

73
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,900
Slow down.

74
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,220
Where is Qiao Yang?

75
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,730
I saw her sign in this morning.

76
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,660
What's the point of signing in?

77
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,730
It's to show that I've come to work.

78
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,730
Not that I've been here.

79
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,730
If everyone's like this,

80
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,610
what's the point of these rules?

81
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,850
It's not the first time.

82
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,340
Mr. Ji,

83
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,460
you can't control Dr. Qiao at home.

84
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,540
But this is the workplace.

85
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,490
If there's an issue, address it.

86
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,780
What are you even talking about?

87
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,050
Rounds.

88
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,020
If we're talking about responsibility,

89
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,340
we should look at Qiao Yang.

90
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,460
She couldn't make it for rounds.

91
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,810
She's always focusing on those critical patients.

92
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,980
How could she not?

93
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,730
The surgery on "Dinosaur Woman" is so popular.

94
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,810
It's even in the news.

95
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,980
She must keep a tight grip on it.

96
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,540
You're right.

97
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,580
No history of hepatitis, tuberculosis, or infectious diseases.

98
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,900
No drug allergies.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,100
Planning to do scar revision surgery tomorrow morning.

100
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,900
Here's her medical record and surgical plan.

101
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,340
Ms. Li,

102
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,250
Qiao Yang is in Fang Ting's ward.

103
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,370
You go ahead, I'll go check on her.

104
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,250
Where are you looking?

105
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,490
Is there a patient over there?

106
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,410
The internal structure of the blood vessels is similar.

107
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,410
But the tumor is not visible to us.

108
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:48,900
So...

109
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,490
Qiao Yang,

110
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,220
come out for a moment.

111
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,050
You need to prepare more spring coils.

112
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,810
I need you for something.

113
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,540
In a short time,

114
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,980
we'll be performing reconstructive surgery.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,460
Okay.

116
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,810
The condition is good.

117
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,850
Thank you, doctor.

118
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,020
Spit it out!

119
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,290
I've got surgery to do later.

120
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,250
Can't you give me a little respect?

121
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,050
After all, I'm your superior.

122
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,410
Mr. Ji,

123
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,810
spit it out.

124
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,850
You're so concerned.

125
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,140
Is it because the surgery for Fang Ting

126
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,100
is so difficult?

127
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,170
I'm telling you, Ms. Li won't back down.

128
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,460
She'll make you stop outpatient services just to quiet down.

129
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,340
Stop thinking about being the main surgeon, it's not going to happen.

130
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,410
Sorry.

131
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,250
The surgical plan has already been completed.

132
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,580
Total excision.

133
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,340
Total excision?

134
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,580
I'm confident about it.

135
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,020
Where did that confidence come from?

136
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,930
Are you crazy?

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,100
This is impossible.

138
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,250
If it goes wrong,

139
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,610
it'll ruin her, and it'll ruin you.

140
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,810
Then I'll try my best to make it right.

141
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,810
Why are you always so stubborn?

142
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,020
Can you listen to me just once?

143
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,290
I don't understand.

144
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,580
Why can't you just

145
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,660
persuade that girl?

146
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,050
Persuade what?

147
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,290
If she's just been born,

148
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,660
her family can't accept it.

149
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,490
I understand you want to do it better.

150
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,850
But she's over twenty.

151
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,810
No matter how outsiders see it,

152
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,810
she's used to it, right?

153
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,490
It doesn't affect her daily life.

154
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,170
Is beauty more important than living?

155
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,340
What?

156
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,810
I didn't say anything wrong.

157
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,980
I chose total excision,

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,170
not just for beauty.

159
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,980
I want her to live like a normal person.

160
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,540
You'll never understand.

161
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,930
For many people,

162
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,850
beauty is as important as life.

163
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,980
As a plastic surgeon,

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,180
you don't understand the importance of beauty.

165
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,940
No wonder you've made no progress in your skills these years.

166
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,340
Why are you scolding me?

167
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm just talking about surgery here.

168
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,850
Read carefully.

169
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,940
If you don't understand, ask me.

170
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,980
Skip the formalities on the first two pages.

171
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,420
Start from the third page.

172
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,730
Dad called me yesterday.

173
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,250
Ji Xuefeng, we've been divorced for so many years.

174
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,730
Why are you still calling my dad "Dad"?

175
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,060
Does your wife know?

176
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,010
You don't wanna know why he called me?

177
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,730
Qiao Yang!

178
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,730
What's going on?

179
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,610
Emergency brought in.

180
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,580
Male, 19 years old.

181
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,100
Accident during ice hockey.

182
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,940
The puck hit his right side of the face directly.

183
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,010
Who's from emergency?

184
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,250
What treatment did you do?

185
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,130
We did basic debridement.

186
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,820
Facial comminuted fractures.

187
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,490
The entire cheekbone was crushed.

188
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,610
From now on, any surgeries like this from emergency,

189
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,610
send them directly to me.

190
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,420
Where are those interns?

191
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,340
Get them in here.

192
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,580
Widen the view a bit more.

193
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,610
Look at my face.

194
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,980
Call Zhou Jingwen out.

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,300
Calm down, everyone!

196
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,100
Call her out.

197
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,980
Look, this heartless hospital...

198
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,100
Call your supervisor out.

199
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,580
Call the supervisor out.

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,130
Look, this heartless hospital is irresponsible.

201
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,890
Call your supervisor out.

202
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,770
Zhou Jingwen!

203
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,730
Good morning, Ms. Zhou.

204
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,730
Morning.

205
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,580
Ms. Zhou.

206
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,370
Ms. Zhou.

207
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,010
Look, this heartless hospital is irresponsible.

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,530
Tissue.

209
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,890
Are you okay?

210
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,580
It's fine.

211
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,700
Where's Mr. Du?

212
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,130
He's fine.

213
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,250
He came in through the back door.

214
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,940
That old fox.

215
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,060
Look, heartless hospital.

216
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,850
Ms. Zhou.

217
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,650
Good morning, Ms. Zhou.

218
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,610
Ms. Zhou.

219
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,530
Ms. Zhou.

220
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,130
Good morning, Ms. Zhou.

221
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,820
Morning.

222
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,650
- Ms. Li. - Good morning, Ms. Li.

223
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,220
Morning.

224
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:24,980
Morning.

225
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,820
You're so busy every day.

226
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,730
I've been chasing you down this whole time.

227
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,890
I wanted to report something to you,

228
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,940
but you didn't hear me.

229
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,130
Sorry.

230
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,530
You've got something in your hair.

231
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,420
What's going on with you guys?

232
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,010
You didn't even let Ms. Zhou know?

233
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,890
We all came in through the back door.

234
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,650
I'll listen to you

235
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,060
how to perform surgery.

236
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,460
It's better to listen to me

237
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,010
how you deal with people.

238
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,700
Also, don't overwork yourself.

239
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,130
The whole Gemu depends on you alone.

240
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,060
My only concern now

241
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,300
is your health.

242
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,340
I'm fine.

243
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,940
Ms. Zhou, excuse me.

244
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,100
Excuse me, Ms. Li.

245
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,340
All of you?

246
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,980
Did you see the dermatology department's performance this month?

247
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,460
They broke records again.

248
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,820
A lot of people are making snide remarks.

249
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,980
Saying the dermatology department's performance

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,100
is three times that of your department, whatever.

251
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,460
I absolutely disagree.

252
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,530
Different departments aren't comparable.

253
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,820
My heart is with your department.

254
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,250
Ms. Li,

255
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,650
you know the customer acquisition cost is so high now.

256
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,250
If you want me to boost performance,

257
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,460
give me a little more budget.

258
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,890
What are you talking about?

259
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,300
You're the boss of Gemu

260
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,340
and also the director of plastic surgery.

261
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,700
We're just discussing, aren't we?

262
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,460
Tang always says

263
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,180
light cosmetic procedures are the trend.

264
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,060
He says the plastic surgery department's profits are low.

265
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,700
The current budget will be further reduced

266
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,220
by at least 40%.

267
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,850
What?

268
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,850
40%?

269
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,890
This is not fair!

270
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,580
Every time he says it, I get angry.

271
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,460
Ms. Zhou.

272
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,060
Wait.

273
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,460
Let me make it brief.

274
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,940
We'll soon have a meeting.

275
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,130
At that meeting, Tang will announce

276
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,980
major personnel adjustments.

277
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,130
Regarding department mergers...

278
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,580
Department mergers?

279
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,100
We discussed this before, didn't we?

280
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,650
Tang insists.

281
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,980
Wait for my notification.

282
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,850
Ms. Zhou,

283
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,220
Mr. Du has been waiting for you.

284
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,370
What's wrong?

285
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,340
Why the long face?

286
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,580
Is it about the medical disputes?

287
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,700
We've seen this kind of thing many times.

288
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,940
That guy with the little mustache is a pro at medical disputes.

289
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,770
You see him outside every hospital.

290
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,010
No matter what,

291
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,940
it's still a hassle for the hospital.

292
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,700
I'll take responsibility for this.

293
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,700
This way, you'll have an explanation.

294
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,650
Mr. Qin isn't here,

295
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,130
but it's the same if I tell you.

296
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,460
No.

297
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,060
Mr. Du,

298
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,820
you're the head of Gemu.

299
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,010
Gemu is a big ship.

300
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,700
How could it sail without you as the captain?

301
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,580
Besides, if you leave,

302
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,650
wouldn't that mean Gemu is responsible for ruining someone's face?

303
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,770
I can't agree with that.

304
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,700
It's not just my problem.

305
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,770
I've advised them,

306
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,700
but they wouldn't listen.

307
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,820
They said they've been with me for so many years.

308
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,340
Gemu still has you at the helm.

309
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,530
Handling light cosmetic procedures will be a breeze.

310
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,460
It's about money, right?

311
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,060
Not long ago, plastic surgery indeed had some difficulties.

312
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,460
But I've already discussed it with Mr. Qin,

313
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,730
and I've requested a subsidy.

314
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,770
It's going through finance.

315
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,180
It'll be distributed this afternoon.

316
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,340
These five years,

317
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,100
you and Mr. Qin have really been amazing to me.

318
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,010
Now we have the level 4 license.

319
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,580
The hospital is on track.

320
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,940
I guess I can finally retire.

321
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,010
After all, I'm a doctor.

322
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,610
I'm into the profession.

323
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,340
You know the dinosaur girl, right?

324
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,060
She came to me first.

325
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,300
I was thinking of doing it,

326
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,980
but does our hospital have the capability?

327
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,650
Now, she's gone to the Third Hospital.

328
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,650
I came from the Third Hospital.

329
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,650
When you all came to find me,

330
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,530
we agreed to build up Gemu

331
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,300
together.

332
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,770
But now,

333
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,220
we can't even do

334
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,370
any challenging surgeries.

335
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,340
All we do is double eyelids.

336
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,890
And we're being criticized for turning plastic surgery into disfigurement.

337
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,460
What am I even doing here?

338
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,220
Mr. Du resigned.

339
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,100
Dr. Liang and the others

340
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,420
left too.

341
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,820
Our plastic surgery department

342
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,010
had two stars, Mr. Du and Ms. Zhou.

343
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,060
But now,

344
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,250
only Ms. Zhou remains.

345
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,850
Even if her skills are great, she can't carry it all alone.

346
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,340
It's been rumored that plastic surgery will merge with dermatology

347
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,610
and transform into light cosmetic procedures.

348
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,610
With all this fuss,

349
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,300
it might really happen.

350
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,850
Isn't Ms. Zhou the founder of the hospital?

351
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,250
Even if plastic surgery merges with dermatology,

352
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,730
it won't affect her.

353
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,940
You're new here,

354
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,770
so you might not understand.

355
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,850
Let me explain.

356
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,340
Our plastic surgery department is like a latte.

357
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,820
Dermatology is like an Americano.

358
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,300
The latte is the hospital's signature.

359
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,530
We built our reputation on it.

360
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,940
But now,

361
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,700
the sales of Americano are several times that of the latte.

362
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,850
So Li's idea is

363
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,060
that we stop selling lattes.

364
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,130
If customers want it,

365
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,340
they can order Americano with milk.

366
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,580
It tastes the same, but costs less.

367
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,180
But they're different.

368
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,370
You've hit the point.

369
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,890
So once the merge happens,

370
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,980
the latte will be completely phased out.

371
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,980
I don't want latte.

372
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,180
Let's switch.

373
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,700
I had that already!

374
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,890
It's so shattered.

375
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,490
After cleaning up the shattered bones,

376
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,700
what comes next?

377
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,980
We need to reposition the broken bones.

378
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,820
Reassemble the shattered bones.

379
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,820
Fix them with titanium mesh.

380
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,490
Just imagine this like a jigsaw puzzle.

381
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,900
We need to put the smashed cheekbones

382
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,810
back together.

383
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,460
It needs to be assembled properly.

384
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,860
This young man has such a good appearance.

385
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,490
Right?

386
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,770
Titanium mesh.

387
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,490
Now is the time to test your artistic skills.

388
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,420
Plastic surgery isn't just a technical job.

389
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,330
It also requires artistic sense.

390
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,810
My hands are so sore.

391
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,620
Five whole hours.

392
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,860
How is Dr. Qiao not tired?

393
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,290
Let me tell you,

394
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,330
five surgeries in a day,

395
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,980
she might be a bit tired.

396
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,530
Ten surgeries,

397
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,050
she gets more and more energetic.

398
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,980
If it's twenty surgeries,

399
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,330
she wouldn't even need to sleep.

400
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,180
When someone's face is shattered,

401
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,660
she's like she's on a high from adrenaline.

402
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,090
To quote her famous saying,

403
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,380
"If you're tired from surgeries,

404
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,570
why even do it?"

405
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,900
From now on, any surgeries like this from emergency,

406
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,330
send them directly to me.

407
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,290
You're pretty good at imitating.

408
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,330
Why don't you become an actor?

409
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,140
Thanks.

410
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,050
Dr. Qiao, lunch is ready.

411
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,980
What's for lunch?

412
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,530
Still the same old stuff?

413
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,980
Who ordered takeout?

414
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,770
I did.

415
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,770
Could you be a bit more creative?

416
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,090
Your brain is for thinking.

417
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,050
Your eyes are for discovering beauty.

418
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,530
You didn't even put any thought into the takeout.

419
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,460
How can you innovate in your skills?

420
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,380
Just finished surgery, looking for something to eat.

421
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,380
What's new?

422
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,050
My cookies!

423
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,380
Fang Ting,

424
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,330
female, 23 years old.

425
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,290
Fibrous dysplasia of bone.

426
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,770
She started showing symptoms at 12.

427
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,900
By now, she has developed a tumor

428
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,620
as large as her skull and brain.

429
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,220
The Department of Plastic Surgery at our hospital has been around for decades,

430
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,940
and this is the first time we've encountered one this big.

431
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,490
Actually, this case

432
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,700
has already spread throughout the industry.

433
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,290
More than thirty specialized hospitals nationwide

434
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,330
dared not take it in.

435
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,050
Until last week,

436
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,380
they finally found us.

437
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,660
The blood supply to the tumor is extremely rich,

438
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,490
involving the entire face.

439
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,250
If bleeding occurs during the surgery,

440
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,700
it may be impossible to finish the operation.

441
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,460
No one can guarantee a hundred percent success.

442
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,380
This surgery is indeed difficult,

443
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,420
but based on our hospital's capabilities,

444
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,770
there shouldn't be any problems.

445
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,330
Since the patient is already here,

446
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,810
we shouldn't turn her away.

447
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,660
I've already met with the patient's family.

448
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,490
I told them they should've come to the Third Hospital earlier.

449
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,700
Ji,

450
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,380
please present the surgical plan

451
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,570
to everyone.

452
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,570
Our approach is as follows:

453
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,290
On the premise of minimizing risks,

454
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,900
we will first solve the issues of visibility

455
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,810
and ventilation.

456
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,730
We want the patient's life

457
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,860
to be completely self-sufficient.

458
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,900
The tumor occupies two-thirds of the face

459
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,140
and one-third of the skull.

460
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,290
Our surgery

461
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,940
will only remove the portion above the nostrils,

462
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,250
keeping everything below the nostrils intact.

463
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,490
The excised part

464
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,380
makes up about 20% of the overall distortion.

465
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,490
It's not a large proportion.

466
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,250
Just 20%.

467
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,730
I'm already looking forward to this surgery.

468
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,010
This will be

469
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,860
another classic battle for our hospital.

470
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,570
Excuse me.

471
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,490
There are still some shortcomings in the surgical plan.

472
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,010
Is there any other input from the team?

473
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,860
The neurosurgery team has no objections.

474
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,770
We have no objections either.

475
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,700
No objections.

476
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,420
We have no objections.

477
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,290
We'll fully cooperate.

478
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,180
Alright.

479
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,090
I believe this surgery

480
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,940
will showcase our Third Hospital's level

481
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,730
to both the nation and internationally.

482
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,090
I hope all departments will work closely together.

483
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,530
Let's all give it our best effort.

484
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,460
Since no one has any objections,

485
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,570
let's call it a day.

486
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,290
Alright.

487
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,290
Meeting adjourned.

488
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,490
I have an objection.

489
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,570
The meeting discussion has already concluded.

490
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,090
You weren't here.

491
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,010
What objection do you have?

492
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,220
I just want to ask,

493
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,050
isn't it still our duty as doctors

494
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,090
to treat and save lives?

495
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,770
Thanks.

496
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,460
Don't put labels on us.

497
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,860
Say what you want to say.

498
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,090
We all have things to do.

499
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,330
What I mean is,

500
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,220
for other hospitals,

501
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,180
20% resection is indeed difficult.

502
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,860
But for our hospital,

503
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,860
it's a sure thing.

504
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,290
There's absolutely no problem.

505
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,700
So why are you still saying this?

506
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,570
A 20% partial resection

507
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,570
is not the patient's real need.

508
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,180
If we're going to cut, it should be total resection.

509
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,570
I've already looked at a lot of materials.

510
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,010
The plan is ready.

511
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,330
I just need a little more time to refine it,

512
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,700
and I guarantee I can come up with

513
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,530
a plan that will satisfy both the hospital leadership and the patient.

514
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,380
Have some dinner.

515
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,700
You haven't eaten yet?

516
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,860
Ms. Li.

517
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,620
I've got good news for you.

518
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,980
The surgical plan is set.

519
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,730
Really?

520
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,460
Dr. Qiao has especially asked to give you special attention.

521
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,860
I told her to come in person

522
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,220
and explain the surgical plan to you.

523
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,700
The difficulty of the surgery is indeed quite high.

524
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,700
But we will remove the tumor as much as possible,

525
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,730
while ensuring safety.

526
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,490
As much as possible, how much?

527
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,220
We will fully resect the 20% above the nostrils.

528
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,220
The chief surgeon is

529
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,660
our most skilled Dr. Ji.

530
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,660
We will first

531
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,050
solve the issues of visibility and ventilation,

532
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,980
and then address other concerns.

533
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,530
For the specifics,

534
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,420
ask Dr. Qiao.

535
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,900
I have another meeting in a bit.

536
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,660
By the way, this hairpin is nice.

537
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,290
It's really beautiful.

538
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,460
Ms. Li, let me walk you out.

539
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,490
No need.

540
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,250
Thank you.

541
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,460
No nail polish before the surgery.

542
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:07,980
It's been confiscated.

543
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,140
Don't touch my stuff.

544
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,050
I'm not doing your damn surgery!

545
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,180
Even if I did, it'd be useless.

546
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,420
What are you doing?

547
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,860
Didn't Ms. Li say

548
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,530
this is just the first step.

549
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,250
We'll have more opportunities later, right?

550
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,420
What opportunities?

551
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,490
More chances to make a monster?

552
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,900
This huge lump is still there.

553
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,490
If I don't do it, I'm a monster.

554
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,250
If I do it, I'm still a monster.

555
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,090
So, you don't accept

556
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,250
the 20% partial resection plan, right?

557
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,730
Absolutely not!

558
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,460
You promised I could get a full resection!

559
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,290
You're a liar!

560
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,860
Monsters deserve to be deceived?

561
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,050
Monsters deserve to die?

562
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,090
Your pace is terrible.

563
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,140
Tonight, I'm going to beat you down.

564
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,420
It hurts!

565
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,050
Fell down?

566
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,420
Let me see.

567
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,010
- Can you move your wrist? - It hurt!

568
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,250
Where does it hurt? Here?

569
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,330
Ah!

570
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,220
This looks like a fibula fracture.

571
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,900
I've already confirmed it.

572
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,460
Where can I find a splint this late?

573
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,570
Xu,

574
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,220
get the first aid kit from my car.

575
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,620
Can you move your hand?

576
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,570
Yes.

577
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,010
Dong, call 120.

578
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,460
Okay.

579
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,770
You didn't hit the back of your head, right?

580
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,380
Hello, is this 120?

581
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,490
No.

582
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,490
Yes, one of my teammates is injured.

583
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,660
We're near Dacheng North Road.

584
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:05,770
Hang in there.

585
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,050
Let me just stabilize it for now.

586
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,490
You're also a doctor?

587
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,730
A surgeon?

588
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:13,980
What about you?

589
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,420
Can't you tell?

590
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,490
So, with this situation,

591
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,860
do we have a choice between full resection and 20% resection?

592
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,330
Yes, full resection is riskier,

593
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,620
but 20% resection is less risky.

594
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,810
Doesn't mean there's no risk.

595
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,250
And for the hospital,

596
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,860
doing such a high-difficulty surgery

597
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,250
is a good way to promote itself.

598
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,140
The doctors can write papers to earn promotions.

599
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,050
And for the patient,

600
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,220
she used to have a giant tumor,

601
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,980
and after surgery, she just ended up with a big lump.

602
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,050
She still can't go out.

603
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,900
She still can't live normally.

604
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,860
So, what's the point of this surgery?

605
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,420
Why should a patient risk their life

606
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,530
to undergo such a surgery?

607
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,980
What's the point?

608
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,860
Hold on a second.

609
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,620
Let me ask you something.

610
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,730
What's the point of you joining this cycling team?

611
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,250
What's up?

612
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,250
Look around.

613
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,660
Everyone here has had a long, tiring day.

614
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,940
Is anyone talking about work?

615
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,010
I'm not tired.

616
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,940
Just relax, okay?

617
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,380
Can we leave work in the operating room?

618
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,700
I'm talking to you about this

619
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,050
because you're also a doctor.

620
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,810
This world is competitive enough as it is.

621
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,330
Good thing you're not my colleague.

622
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,490
If I ever get the chance to work with you,

623
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,660
I'd make sure to outdo you first.

624
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,700
The surgery failed.

625
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,980
Why don't you have some water?

626
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,180
Have some water, okay?

627
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,140
Calm down.

628
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,090
Calm down.

629
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,810
Can you let me say a few words?

630
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,250
I'm Zhou Jingwen, a partner at Geme Medical.

631
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,700
I'm also the head of plastic surgery.

632
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,620
Regarding the rumors about Du Jun's resignation...

633
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,460
I don't know why it got spread like this.

634
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,330
But the truth is, yesterday morning,

635
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,250
he was dismissed by our board of directors.

636
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,250
Dismissed? He's such a well-regarded director.

637
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,220
Why was he dismissed?

638
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,330
There must be a problem.

639
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,180
Whether in medical skills or ethics,

640
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,620
Du Jun has proven to be a very disappointing doctor.

641
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,490
If any of Du Jun's patients are here,

642
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,620
I will take over all of them.

643
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,090
Who are you?

644
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,860
Everyone, please calm down.

645
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,380
Let's hear what our director has to say, okay?

646
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,900
It's fine.

647
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,090
If you're not familiar with me,

648
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,530
you can check the doctor profile wall in the lobby

649
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,620
to see my credentials.

650
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,090
Or search my name online

651
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,220
and you'll find my previous surgical cases.

652
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:58,980
Yeah, you can look it up.

653
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,940
Stop bluffing.

654
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,010
Your surgeries are fully booked.

655
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,900
Where would you find the time?

656
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,660
Can I still have my surgery next Monday?

657
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,700
Understood. I'll do my best.

658
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,220
Next, my assistant will handle

659
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,460
the scheduling for you.

660
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,980
There's another good piece of news.

661
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,090
The doctor replacing Du Jun will be here soon.

662
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,140
He's the best doctor in our field.

663
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,980
You can rest assured.

664
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,940
You have to trust our hospital, really.

665
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,290
We'll arrange the best doctors for everyone.

666
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,140
Where are you?

667
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,700
There's a bit of a situation here.

668
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,700
It's best if you come over right away.

669
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,620
Check it online.

670
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,090
Zhou Jingwen,

671
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,140
you don't deserve to be a doctor.

672
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,290
Qiao Yang,

673
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,220
we'll see about that.

674
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,620
I heard the surgery is very risky.

675
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,010
Are you scared?

676
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,730
No matter how you look at it, I'm winning.

677
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,490
If it fails,

678
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,090
it's just a chance to reincarnate.

679
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,180
Maybe I'll be a pretty girl in my next life.

680
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,660
Dear,

681
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,530
who did the surgery on that "dinosaur girl"?

682
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,530
Mr. Li, what's wrong?

683
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,090
Mr. Qin just left a few days ago.

684
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,250
And now something this big happens?

685
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,140
Why isn't Du even answering my calls?

686
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,490
What's going on?

687
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,620
Enough. What's your situation?

688
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,140
Low pressure 120, high pressure 160.

689
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,420
And you're still getting worked up?

690
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,010
If Du isn't answering his phone,

691
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,490
it means he's captaining another ship.

692
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,010
No point wasting words with you.

693
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,490
Did you take your medication today?

694
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,220
I'm taking it now.

695
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,730
Mr. Tang,

696
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,290
I'm really sorry.

697
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,530
There were so many guests this morning.

698
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,140
I was so busy I didn't even drink water or eat.

699
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,490
Have you eaten?

700
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,380
Wanna order something together?

701
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,860
No need.

702
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,940
I have high blood pressure, I'm taking medication.

703
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,420
I don't need anything either, my stomach hurts.

704
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,090
When I left yesterday,

705
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,570
you should have left with me.

706
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,530
Yeah.

707
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,900
Ms. Li, you're pushing yourself too hard.

708
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,090
From now on, leave these social engagements to Qin Gui.

709
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,700
Can I really avoid drinking?

710
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,140
Our industry is so fiercely competitive.

711
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,900
The equipment you want

712
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,620
updates every year.

713
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,090
Why does Geme Medical always get the first batch?

714
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,250
Isn't it all thanks to me drinking bottle after bottle for it?

715
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,490
If Geme Medical wants to do well,

716
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,900
Tang provides the money.

717
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,180
Jingwen has medical skills and knows management.

718
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,420
I don't have any other skills.

719
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,490
I can only sacrifice my liver

720
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,660
and give up my stomach.

721
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,940
Huai Shan Beef Tripe Soup.

722
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,140
Good for the liver and stomach, order this one.

723
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,940
You still have the mindset to eat something so delicate?

724
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,810
Tell me, what's going on with the plastic surgery department?

725
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,980
The profits aren't going up,

726
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,730
but the problems never stop.

727
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,900
At the beginning of the year, I invested millions

728
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,220
to buy you new equipment.

729
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,700
And yet, that cosmetic surgery failure

730
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,220
hasn't blown over, has it?

731
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,490
The director ran off,

732
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,050
taking three attending surgeons with him.

733
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,570
And those three were our most profitable ones!

734
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,900
Isn't that just adding fuel to the fire?

735
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,220
Now the reputation of our Gemu Hospital

736
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,290
is about to be ruined by your plastic surgery department.

737
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,250
Tell me, how do you plan to solve this?

738
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,700
Merge the plastic surgery and dermatology departments,

739
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,530
transition to minimally invasive cosmetic procedures,

740
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,380
that would solve everything, wouldn't it?

741
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,380
Mr. Tang,

742
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,620
isn't that your idea?

743
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,250
Of course it is.

744
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,460
And didn't Ms. Li always say

745
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,180
it's the trend of the industry?

746
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,620
Ms. Zhou,

747
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,940
you can't just

748
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,620
keep burying your heads in the operating room.

749
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,420
Take some time to go out

750
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,660
and see how the industry is developing.

751
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,700
Mr. Tang,

752
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,980
you just came from Hanzhong Street, right?

753
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,090
Have you counted

754
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,860
how many minimally invasive cosmetic clinics are on that street?

755
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,140
Four.

756
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,250
One street has four clinics.

757
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,460
Now think about how many streets we have in Rongchuan.

758
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,460
Minimally invasive cosmetic clinics

759
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,980
are more common than nail salons.

760
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,140
I spent money to buy equipment

761
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,860
and fought hard to get the Level 4 surgery license,

762
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,660
all to set us apart from them.

763
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,810
What they can't do,

764
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,050
Gemu can.

765
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,620
That's the core competitive advantage of Gemu.

766
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,490
Ms. Li, isn't that right?

767
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,660
Of course.

768
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,700
Tang, you're just too anxious.

769
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,810
Who else would have high blood pressure if not you?

770
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,860
We've already said that merging the departments is a strategic direction,

771
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,010
it needs long-term planning.

772
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,700
Right now, there are more urgent issues to address.

773
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,660
Ms. Zhou,

774
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,570
Mr. Tang, look.

775
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,010
This is the latest case from the Third Hospital.

776
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,010
It's the nationally followed Dinosaur Girl case.

777
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,620
The chief surgeon was their youngest department director,

778
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,490
Ji Xuefeng.

779
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,660
Do you know this person?

780
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,050
You're thinking of having him replace Du Jun?

781
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,250
Is that reliable?

782
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,180
His skills are excellent.

783
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,250
And he just took on Fang Ting's surgery.

784
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,860
Right now, he's a key talent being cultivated at the Third Hospital.

785
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,570
He's expected to become the director in the future.

786
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,180
Imagine the future director of the Third Hospital

787
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,770
coming to Gemu to be our director...

788
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,380
Wouldn't that instantly resolve our trust crisis?

789
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,290
Wait.

790
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,180
I didn't get most of that,

791
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,860
but one thing I did understand.

792
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,490
He's the prospective director of the Third Hospital,

793
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,140
right?

794
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,220
Then why would he leave to come to Gemu?

795
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,460
Be a bit more realistic.

796
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,620
Can you just talk properly?

797
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,730
You're being too much.

798
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,940
Ms. Zhou has worked so hard for Gemu.

799
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,810
Let's set a deadline.

800
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,090
Within one month,

801
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,010
if you can really

802
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,420
recruit Ji Xuefeng to Gemu,

803
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,810
then it'll be an acceptable answer to Mr. Tang.

804
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,620
Fine, you have the final say.

805
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,570
But what if you can't recruit him?

806
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,250
Then the dermatology and plastic surgery departments will be merged.

807
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,220
As for my position,

808
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,090
you can decide as you please.

809
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,730
I'm back.

810
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,700
Weren't you supposed to come back tomorrow?

811
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,660
When my wife summons me,

812
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,980
how could I not book the earliest flight?

813
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,700
I rushed back without stopping.

814
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,140
Alright.

815
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,700
Still working so late?

816
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,980
Haven't washed your hands, go wash them.

817
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,570
Didn't we already handle

818
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,620
most of Du Jun's surgery issue?

819
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,730
Why did it blow up again?

820
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,460
I guess he has long planned to resign.

821
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,730
He just found a convenient excuse to do so.

822
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,980
As for why the public outcry got so big...

823
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,090
Someone's clearly targeting us from behind the scenes.

824
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,810
I'm not sure who it is yet.

825
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,290
Is there any food at home?

826
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,090
I'm hungry.

827
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,770
Didn't you eat on the plane?

828
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,570
I fell asleep.

829
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,900
I'll make you some instant noodles.

830
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,700
From what Mr. Tang was saying,

831
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,620
if the plastic surgery and dermatology departments don't merge,

832
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,770
we can't resolve the cosmetic surgery failure issue.

833
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,740
It sounds like if we don't do it,

834
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,090
Gemu will be done for.

835
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,380
But I've been thinking about it,

836
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,130
it doesn't make sense.

837
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,210
Anyway, Tang Jun

838
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,570
just listens to Li Qi.

839
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,380
He keeps talking about minimally invasive cosmetic procedures

840
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,780
have low cost and quick returns.

841
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,130
Now, whatever projects we plan,

842
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,340
they all have to get past Li Qi first.

843
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,260
You know, those two

844
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,340
are so cringy.

845
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,380
I swear,

846
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,610
Li Qi practically wanted to shove that medicine right into Tang's mouth.

847
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,460
It gave me goosebumps all over.

848
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,460
To be fair,

849
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,340
Mr. Tang does have a bit of a temper,

850
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,210
but he's not a bad guy.

851
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,490
Back when no one believed in us,

852
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,650
he was the only one who firmly invested in Gemu.

853
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,490
Come on, give me a break.

854
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,490
He only cares about immediate gains,

855
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,570
never thinks beyond three steps ahead.

856
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,300
He's just lucky,

857
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,530
coming from money.

858
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,260
With his brains,

859
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,210
he should have gone bankrupt eight hundred times by now.

860
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,090
Have you thought about

861
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,300
how to approach Ji Xuefeng?

862
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,980
No idea. I'll figure it out when I get there.

863
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,260
When Mr. Du left the Third Hospital,

864
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,210
it was all over the place.

865
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,170
Now you're going to look for him,

866
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,460
but without any connections,

867
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,820
I'm worried

868
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,050
you won't even get in the door.

869
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,090
What else can I do?

870
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,090
We're stuck at this point already.

871
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,650
I don't know.

872
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,820
Just thinking about it gives me a headache.

873
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,980
Alright.

874
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,260
Don't stress.

875
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,340
As my dad always says,

876
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,260
as long as your mindset doesn't slip,

877
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,460
there are always more solutions than problems.

878
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,570
You know what?

879
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,570
It was crazy this time when I went back.

880
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,610
At that dinner table, besides me,

881
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,050
everyone else has at least two kids.

882
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,130
Remember my cousin?

883
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,050
Their family just had a third kid.

884
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,090
How do they have so many?

885
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,820
But those little ones were pretty sweet.

886
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,300
They kept calling me "Uncle" non-stop,

887
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,090
even recited "Memorial to Zhuge Liang" to me.

888
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,940
Hey, don't find me annoying, but

889
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,820
the medical checkup results are out.

890
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,010
Your thyroid hormone levels are still a bit high,

891
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,210
so you really need to keep adjusting.

892
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,820
Otherwise, all the effort from the past few months

893
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,090
will go to waste again.

894
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,490
Am I not trying hard enough already?

895
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,010
I even quit smoking.

896
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,690
I've done everything you asked.

897
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,050
Don't put more pressure on me, okay?

898
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,980
Alright, no pressure.

899
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,650
Leave all these worries,

900
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,090
especially work-related ones,

901
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,940
to me, okay?

902
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,010
If anyone's gonna be stressed, let it be me.

903
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,380
- Alright. - Let it all come at me.

904
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,980
The water's boiling, go make your instant noodles.

905
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,820
I'll go make the noodles.

906
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,460
Answer the phone.

907
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,420
Who is it?

908
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,170
Nutcase.

909
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,780
Looking even more handsome, Mr. Ji.

910
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,980
Did you read the materials I sent you?

911
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,460
I'm talking to you!

912
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,980
You definitely agree with my plan, right?

913
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,490
Otherwise, you wouldn't have called me

914
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,610
to the consultation.

915
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,420
Your plan is only theoretically feasible.

916
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,420
What about bleeding issues and postoperative complications?

917
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,460
Have you considered those?

918
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,010
Using an ultrasonic bone scalpel for simultaneous cutting and coagulation

919
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,860
can keep blood loss under 2,000 milliliters.

920
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,130
A total resection is doable.

921
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,010
Did you even read it?

922
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,420
I'm asking you a question!

923
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,260
You called me at three in the morning,

924
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,170
and what time is it now?

925
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,940
Seven o'clock.

926
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,260
There's still half an hour before the morning meeting.

927
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,860
Come on, let's go see Ms. Li.

928
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,090
You'll be the primary surgeon for this operation.

929
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,130
Go ahead and explain.

930
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,130
This paper shared by Qiao Yang

931
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,820
is a recent article from Liuyedao.

932
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,650
They also published

933
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,010
detailed video materials.

934
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,780
I've watched them,

935
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,010
and they are indeed quite insightful.

936
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,420
However, performing simultaneous cutting and coagulation

937
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,340
requires extensive clinical experience.

938
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,690
We've only done a few cases so far.

939
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,130
You just mentioned controlling blood loss to 2,000 milliliters,

940
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,490
we all know that's impossible.

941
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,010
Fang Ting's surgery itself

942
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,460
is extremely risky,

943
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,130
so I do not recommend

944
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,490
using such a risky surgical technique.

945
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,980
That's not what you said when you called me in

946
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,300
for the consultation.

947
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,010
I just asked you to listen in.

948
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,460
I never said I agreed with your plan.

949
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,740
Ms. Li,

950
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,210
Fang Ting has talked to me many times

951
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,010
about wanting a total resection.

952
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,090
At both major and minor meetings,

953
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,740
haven't you always emphasized

954
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,650
that we should

955
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,420
respect the patient's wishes as much as possible?

956
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,490
Of course, we should respect their wishes,

957
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,130
but it has to be their genuine wishes.

958
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,010
Qiao,

959
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,420
surgery is meant to relieve the patient's suffering,

960
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,740
not to satisfy a doctor's desire for practice.

961
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,860
No, wait, you're confusing me.

962
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,010
Total resection is exactly what the patient truly wants.

963
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,900
Fang Ting told me herself.

964
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,740
She absolutely won't accept the plan

965
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,690
for a 20% partial resection...

966
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,490
Take a look at this.

967
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,010
The surgery plan has been finalized.

968
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,780
The primary surgeon will be the director.

969
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,860
Their skills are definitely not an issue.

970
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,780
By the way,

971
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,940
about that red envelope...

972
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,900
Could you lend me a little more?

973
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,260
Don't worry.

974
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,340
I have something to deal with right now,

975
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,210
so I'll talk to you later.

976
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,300
Why did you sign the surgery consent form?

977
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,490
I've already thought of a new plan.

978
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,170
I'm still fighting for a total resection.

979
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,300
I don't wanna hear any more about it.

980
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,210
Why did you give up so quickly?

981
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,610
You know that if you don't do it this time,

982
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,170
there will be even fewer chances in the future.

983
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,490
You were the one who told me

984
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,010
you didn't want to live like this anymore.

985
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,940
I said fine,

986
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,900
we'll fight for it together.

987
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,530
I'm still gritting my teeth and holding on.

988
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,490
You can't just pull the ladder out from under me and run away!

989
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,090
I know what you want.

990
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,740
Trust me,

991
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,210
okay?

992
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,650
I've been to hospitals all over the country.

993
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,780
Other than you,

994
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,210
no one else has promised me a total resection.

995
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,420
Everyone gets scared just looking at such a huge tumor.

996
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,650
Only you,

997
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,610
you were so thrilled.

998
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,490
Telling me to take a gamble,

999
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,740
like I'm your little lab rat.

1000
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,860
If the surgery succeeds,

1001
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,380
you'll be famous.

1002
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,170
If it fails,

1003
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,010
I'm the one who dies.
