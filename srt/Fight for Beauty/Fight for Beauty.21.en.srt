1
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,770
I think I said something wrong today.

2
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,100
When I received bonus,

3
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,690
Ms. Zhou happened to be there.

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,130
I thanked her.

5
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,180
Then her face turned as dark as a storm cloud.

6
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,330
Guess she didn't know about it.

7
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,180
Bingo.

8
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,820
But anyway,

9
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,180
the bonuses should've been given.

10
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,570
Looks like Mr. Qin did it.

11
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,570
Mr. Drop and Ms. Zhou were no help.

12
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,020
Mr. Qin's the generous one.

13
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,490
I'm telling you...

14
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,850
Let's go.

15
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,690
Why Mr. Drop?

16
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,410
Because the first thing

17
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,060
our new director did was cut our salaries.

18
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,820
Who came up with that name?

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,340
Genius.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,940
Well,

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,660
complaining about bosses

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,450
is the only thing that can keep us happy now.

23
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,540
Getting a bonus now

24
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,780
feels too little, too late.

25
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,450
Dr. Meng's already set on leaving.

26
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,940
They should've just paid from the start.

27
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,450
A few days wouldn't have mattered.

28
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,170
Really.

29
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,260
Dr. Meng's been here since Gemu started.

30
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,820
She's the longest-serving doctor here.

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,010
Even she's leaving now.

32
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,220
If you suck at games, don't play.

33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,260
Look at you, bored enough

34
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,500
to play game at work.

35
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,450
Good thing you're not the director.

36
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,290
You'd be Ms. Drop.

37
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,290
What?

38
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,660
The director who cut salaries.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,850
It's Dong Jinsong's nickname.

40
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,690
Funny, right?

41
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,380
Not really.

42
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,290
No matter what,

43
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,690
they'd still badmouth me.

44
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,730
Exactly.

45
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,260
Director or not,

46
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,820
you'd still be stuck with this crap.

47
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,890
Why bother?

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,260
Just chill.

49
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,540
Yeah.

50
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,410
I just feel insecure.

51
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,410
But soon things will change.

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,130
Qin Gui is giving me all his shares.

53
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,060
You asked for the divorce,

54
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,170
and he still gave you everything?

55
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,130
Qin Gui's got class.

56
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,450
Honestly, I almost feel bad for you.

57
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,730
He really is a good guy.

58
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,980
I remember when we first got married,

59
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,820
he had everything planned out.

60
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,610
How the hospital would grow in a few years,

61
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,380
how many kids we'd have.

62
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,890
I didn't reject it back then.

63
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,810
I still don't know if I want to be childfree or have kids.

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,370
I'm not really sure.

65
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,540
But now it's different.

66
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,460
I've figured it out.

67
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,140
I'm not having kids.

68
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,930
Marriage is like this.

69
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,290
Who doesn't just figure things out as they go?

70
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,140
People change too.

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,020
Our thoughts change as well.

72
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,290
Maybe in a few years,

73
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,980
you'll want kids after all.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,370
Having a full house would be nice, right?

75
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,250
Who knows.

76
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,050
I only know that

77
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,140
I need to manage Gemu well.

78
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,490
Have you talked to Ms. Meng?

79
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,490
We're not super close,

80
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,580
but I don't dislike her.

81
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,370
Who doesn't like her?

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,490
She's great at what she does, fun to be around,

83
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,900
and doesn't argue with others.

84
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,460
She has no enemies wherever she goes.

85
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,490
True.

86
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,700
So if she leaves,

87
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,610
other doctors might have something to say.

88
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,050
The problem is

89
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,020
even someone as interesting as her is leaving,

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,660
and then it'll just be you.

91
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,020
How boring will Gemu be then?

92
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,370
You…

93
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,250
I was just touched by what you said.

94
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,490
Get lost.

95
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,850
Yes, boss.

96
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,250
Big shareholder.

97
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,660
Little black fish,

98
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,370
you've inherited

99
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,100
the legacy of your fish siblings.

100
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,700
Maybe later I'll get your stepmother

101
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,490
to find you a partner.

102
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,980
You'll have a nice life.

103
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,540
Is your daughter still keeping fish?

104
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,460
Yeah.

105
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,810
She's gotten into ping-pong recently.

106
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,810
I bet next year she'll be into fishing.

107
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,850
She's picking up old-people hobbies.

108
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,250
I still have half a basket of printer paper.

109
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,850
But I can't take it with me.

110
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,410
How about I move it all here?

111
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,810
Don't go to Jiao Ai.

112
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:10,850
I mean it.

113
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,700
I need to support my family.

114
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,610
Yeah, right.

115
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,250
You work for your ideals.

116
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,850
I have ideals too.

117
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,980
My biggest goal right now

118
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,580
is to raise my daughter to be an adult.

119
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,580
And a successful one.

120
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,660
This morning,

121
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,100
I was supposed to do a breast reconstruction surgery.

122
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,660
But guess what happened?

123
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,100
My patient ran away.

124
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,490
That young girl?

125
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,140
She must be nervous.

126
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,810
Her mom thought she was nervous too.

127
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,660
But actually,

128
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,290
she didn't want the surgery at all.

129
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,930
Her mom is too overprotective.

130
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,050
She practically plans her whole life.

131
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,170
She has no life of her own,

132
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,140
and focuses all her energy on her child.

133
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,100
The child is grateful,

134
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,930
but the problem is, she doesn't like it.

135
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,410
She doesn't like everything her mom arranges for her.

136
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,610
Isn't it a shame for the mom?

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,850
The kid is still young.

138
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,050
Of course, she doesn't understand her mom.

139
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,170
In a couple of years, she'll understand.

140
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,540
We moms always do

141
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,220
our best for them.

142
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,930
Maybe.

143
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,780
But you know what?

144
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,410
The kid asked me for something.

145
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,020
She asked me to do surgery on her mom.

146
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,460
She said her mom

147
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,290
is the one who really needs it.

148
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,250
See? The kid's got her own opinion.

149
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,610
Anyway, I don't really understand parenting.

150
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,610
I'm not in a position to talk.

151
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,290
I just really don't want you to leave.

152
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,250
Don't go.

153
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,140
It'd be nice to just talk to you every day.

154
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,980
You're so fake.

155
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,900
I'm being so sincere. Look at my eyes.

156
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,730
Look.

157
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,100
I get what you're saying.

158
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,930
Well, I've got surgery to do.

159
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,340
I've got a job.

160
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,140
Isn't your job being a tiger mom?

161
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,730
Sir, I have to go.

162
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,810
See you tomorrow.

163
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,460
See you.

164
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,020
Why didn't you call out to me?

165
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,140
We're gonna be late again.

166
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,010
It's fine, piano class got canceled.

167
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,700
Really, is the teacher busy?

168
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,220
Are you not interested

169
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,490
in these classes at all?

170
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,010
Some of them are okay.

171
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,420
Piano's just boring.

172
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,010
I'm not into piano.

173
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,130
What are you into then?

174
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,130
Biology, chemistry.

175
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,100
I like ping pong too.

176
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,250
The only field that combines all of these is sports medicine.

177
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,610
I plan to study that in the future.

178
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,490
Sports medicine?

179
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,530
You want to study medicine?

180
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,890
Doctors are amazing.

181
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,490
I watched a documentary before.

182
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,730
If athletes

183
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,980
meet a good doctor,

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,370
their career can be doubled.

185
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,850
And now so many people love to work out,

186
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,420
there's definitely a need for professional treatment.

187
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,460
I think this field

188
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,980
has a great future.

189
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,340
You're thinking ahead.

190
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,610
You never mentioned this before.

191
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,180
Well, you never asked.

192
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,340
I didn't know you wanted to study medicine.

193
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,770
Because you're such a role model of mine!

194
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,100
Then I'll go back to playing.

195
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,010
Sir,

196
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,060
let's play a bit more.

197
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,370
Come on.

198
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,130
Now, anyone can be a model.

199
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,650
Look at this girl.

200
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,370
She still dares to take photos looking like that.

201
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,180
She really thinks she looks good?

202
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,700
You're just not used to it.

203
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,890
Shut up, just take a look.

204
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,650
I think it's perfectly fine.

205
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,850
Where's she from?

206
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,580
She says she's from Gemu.

207
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,700
Wasn't she supposed to come at the end of the month?

208
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,890
Why is she here today?

209
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,060
She's over there.

210
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:16,820
Ms. Li.

211
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,650
Ms. Meng,

212
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,060
Please reschedule all my patients.

213
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,370
Ms. Meng, you're being too carefree!

214
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,100
You're not doing any of these surgeries?

215
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,700
Who said I'm not doing them?

216
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,060
I'll be back after the Chinese New Year.

217
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,180
You made it sound like I'm quitting my job.

218
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,060
Ms. Qiao.

219
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,420
Ms. Meng.

220
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,820
Leaving this early?

221
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,890
Did you clock out?

222
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,580
Who's leaving early?

223
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,300
I'm taking

224
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,180
two weeks off.

225
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,460
Going to watch the game with my daughter.

226
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,250
You are not leaving?

227
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,890
Where am I going?

228
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,940
You said you didn't want me to go.

229
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,130
Great,

230
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,340
my friend!

231
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,220
I had a chat with my daughter.

232
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,460
Even though I'm always with her,

233
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,700
I still don't really know her.

234
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,130
She's grown up so fast.

235
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,460
Gotta spend more time with her.

236
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,650
Yeah, that's a good plan.

237
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,130
Kids are like that.

238
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,460
My niece used to stick to me all the time last year

239
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,420
Now, she's

240
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,460
all independent.

241
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,580
That's right.

242
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,980
She used to say,

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,010
“Mom is my best friend.”

244
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,180
“Mom understands me.”

245
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,460
"If anything happens,"

246
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,420
"I'd tell mom first."

247
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,060
That was just a few years ago.

248
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,890
Now, she's always challenging me.

249
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,180
We fight every day.

250
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,650
I realized something after chatting with her yesterday.

251
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,460
I'm just not cut out to be a tiger mom.

252
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,100
What am I even doing every day?

253
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,300
Pickups, drop-offs,

254
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,010
weekends, holidays, nonstop.

255
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,460
She's exhausted, and so am I.

256
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,010
You finally see yourself clearly.

257
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,220
I'm taking a long break now.

258
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,180
If she's happy, I'm happy.

259
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,890
Sleep in together.

260
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,820
Applause for you!

261
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,700
Cheers to you!

262
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,580
How about you?

263
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,130
I heard you're working through the holiday.

264
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,340
Why so dedicated?

265
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,610
I'm all alone.

266
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,180
Where else would I go?

267
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,300
All I got is watching the Chinese New Year show.

268
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,180
Might as well stay here.

269
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,300
I got some urgent patient here.

270
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,460
Someone came from out of town.

271
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,530
Want to take it?

272
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,420
Sure.

273
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,770
This is the kind of thing I want a ton of.

274
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,010
Got it?

275
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,300
Send every patient to Dr. Qiao.

276
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,820
Well, you'll be busy.

277
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,770
No need to thank me.

278
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,370
You're not holding back, huh?

279
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,250
I thought you had an appointment with Mr. Du.

280
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,100
I'm here for you.

281
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,940
For me?

282
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,100
Jiao Ai's HR has been contacting me.

283
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,340
Yeah, we've been hiring.

284
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,850
How's it going?

285
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,370
I feel like your HR

286
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,940
doesn't really understand the industry.

287
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,530
Why?

288
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,850
Take a look.

289
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,820
Experience, salary, commission rates.

290
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,220
It matches pretty well with Jiao Ai's system.

291
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,300
You've been in the industry for a long time,

292
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,300
and have definitely seen more doctors than I have.

293
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,650
In our field,

294
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,060
even though we're all called attending doctors

295
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,420
and have similar years of experience,

296
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,650
there's a huge difference between someone

297
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,610
who's done 100 surgeries

298
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,010
and someone who's done 300.

299
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,490
True.

300
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,650
I remember you did great double eyelids.

301
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,940
We have a few eye specialists here too.

302
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,650
I'll introduce you guys sometime.

303
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,890
You're about the same age.

304
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,220
You can exchange ideas in the future.

305
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,980
Double eyelids, huh?

306
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,850
Of course, that's basic stuff.

307
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,060
Right now, I mainly do facial rejuvenation.

308
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,980
Like facelifts.

309
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,340
I also do some flaps.

310
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,460
Just recently, I got deeply involved

311
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,460
in a breast reconstruction.

312
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,940
Here are some of my cases.

313
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,940
You can take a look.

314
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,220
Did you do all these yourself?

315
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,700
I was the primary surgeon.

316
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,730
Nice.

317
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,340
Qiao Yang's really been mentoring you.

318
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,100
If you've got the skills, you'll get the chances.

319
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,100
Being a doctor is practical.

320
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,060
No matter how much you brag,

321
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,610
if your skills aren't there,

322
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,180
no mentor can help you.

323
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,370
Qiao Yang gave you so many chances,

324
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,220
and you're leaving?

325
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,530
You used to have all the power at Gemu.

326
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,730
And you also left.

327
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,340
This industry is too competitive.

328
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,250
It's always a battle out here.

329
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,180
Gemu is too conservative.

330
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,820
I'm someone who wants to push forward.

331
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,580
Young people should be confident,

332
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,250
and dare to take risks.

333
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,820
I really admire that.

334
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,530
Tell me, what are your terms?

335
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,010
Let's hold off on that.

336
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,130
My current contract

337
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,580
is still valid for another year.

338
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,940
We can talk about it then.

339
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,730
Besides, I checked,

340
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,100
it's a ten-year deal.

341
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,220
And there's a penalty for breaking it.

342
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,890
I feel like

343
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,580
I'm selling myself to the hospital.

344
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,180
You've got a unique way of looking at things.

345
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,730
As a doctor,

346
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,980
of course,

347
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,100
I want a long-term partnership

348
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,180
with a hospital.

349
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,460
So this contract gives doctors at Gemu

350
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,770
some real security.

351
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,580
It's not just about the length.

352
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,060
Look at the commission too.

353
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,820
We've raised the base rates.

354
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,940
The longer you work here,

355
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,580
the higher the cap.

356
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,940
Think about it,

357
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,460
which hospital out there

358
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,580
offers a deal like this?

359
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,890
The terms are great, no doubt.

360
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,490
And I do believe in Gemu.

361
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,250
I still remember when I signed my first contract,

362
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,370
I didn't even read it.

363
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,060
Just flipped to the last page and signed.

364
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,370
I remember your interview.

365
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,650
I thought you were just a doctor

366
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,940
who relied on your looks.

367
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,700
When you told me you wanted to do

368
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,420
ear reconstruction, I was surprised.

369
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,980
Thought that was just your persona.

370
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,460
Didn't expect you to actually love it.

371
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,770
Now, ear reconstruction

372
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,460
is one of Gemu's specialties.

373
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,650
I think we bring out the best in each other.

374
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,580
I've always felt

375
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,100
Gemu is different from other hospitals.

376
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,250
It is different.

377
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,300
Change isn't always a bad thing.

378
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,340
Think it over.

379
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,180
I respect your skills.

380
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,370
I really do.

381
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,460
But I know exactly

382
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,490
what Gemu offers.

383
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,850
And Jiao Ai is already being very generous.

384
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,340
To me, what you're asking for

385
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,460
is a bit too much.

386
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,890
Sure.

387
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,250
With what you're asking,

388
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,060
I could hire a deputy chief surgeon.

389
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,460
How about this?

390
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,420
We'll do the salary your way,

391
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,940
but everything else stays the same.

392
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,010
Otherwise, other departments will have issues.

393
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,580
Ms. Li,

394
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,580
I know

395
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,730
you call the shots

396
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,700
at Jiao Ai.

397
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,850
That's why I came to you directly.

398
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,580
Flattery won't work on me.

399
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,940
You're contacting these doctors

400
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,570
from Gemu as well, right?

401
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,980
I know that these doctors

402
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,050
don't mean much

403
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,330
to Jiao Ai.

404
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,980
But you really want Gemu

405
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,050
to lose them, don't you?

406
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,570
I can bring them all over.

407
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,660
Guess I underestimated you.

408
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,220
You've grown fast.

409
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,530
Alright, we'll go with what you said.

410
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,050
You've got two weeks.

411
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,250
Bring them all in.

412
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,460
No need.

413
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,730
See you next week.

414
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,380
The new contract

415
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,140
is the hospital's way of helping young doctors

416
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,330
develop more quickly.

417
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,380
It's a win-win for both of us.

418
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,900
You can check the terms later.

419
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,420
Come in, Juan.

420
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,810
Have a seat.

421
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,180
We'll be done soon.

422
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,420
Alright, no worries.

423
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,700
You go ahead.

424
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,090
I'll go over it carefully later.

425
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,620
Okay.

426
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,460
Dr. Zhao.

427
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,810
Here,

428
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,900
sit down.

429
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,330
Why do you want to have this surgery?

430
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,570
I've always thought my face is too big.

431
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,700
I just can't stand looking at myself in the mirror.

432
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,660
Alright, bite down.

433
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,900
Let me see. Now relax.

434
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,620
When I was young,

435
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,090
there was a woman in our factory.

436
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,220
She had a small face.

437
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,530
So pretty.

438
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,140
Too bad I didn't have this option back then.

439
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,180
Otherwise, I would've done it long ago.

440
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,250
Now my son has a stable job,

441
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,420
and he already bought a house.

442
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,330
Life's better now, right?

443
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,420
So I thought, why not go ahead with the surgery?

444
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,010
Juan,

445
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,010
this jaw surgery

446
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,620
should be done within the proper range.

447
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,860
Put your hand like this.

448
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,660
Hold it there.

449
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,530
Like this, right?

450
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,090
Right?

451
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,380
Generally,

452
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,860
a 120-degree angle is ideal.

453
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,250
If it's under 90 degrees,

454
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,940
surgery could help.

455
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,140
You said your face is a bit square,

456
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,140
but it's not really necessary to do surgery.

457
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,090
But Ms. Zhou,

458
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,660
why does my face look so big?

459
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,530
Our face is like a house.

460
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,250
The bones are the beams.

461
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,010
The muscles are the bricks.

462
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,180
Bite down again.

463
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,220
Take a look.

464
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,380
Your masseter muscles are bigger than your bones.

465
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,380
Now relax.

466
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,660
When you relax, it drops.

467
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,700
The problem is,

468
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,180
the walls of your house are too thick,

469
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,330
which makes it look wide.

470
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,900
But it's sturdy,

471
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,660
so your face won't sag.

472
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,330
Ms. Zhou,

473
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,530
now that you mention it,

474
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,900
I guess my big face is good for anti-aging?

475
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:58,860
Juan,

476
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,220
at your age,

477
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,420
I wouldn't recommend jaw surgery

478
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,860
or face-slimming injections.

479
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,900
Without the support of bones and muscles,

480
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,770
your face will look older.

481
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,250
Do you want a smaller face

482
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,660
or to look younger?

483
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,250
That's a good question.

484
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,530
I've spent my whole life living for others.

485
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,180
When I was young, I was in a rush to get married.

486
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,770
Then after getting married and having kids,

487
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,490
I was always worrying about my son.

488
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,860
And when he finally grows up,

489
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,700
I'll be busy taking care of his kids.

490
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,660
Think about it.

491
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,380
Life really feels so dull sometimes.

492
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,980
But still,

493
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,180
I often think back to my thirties.

494
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,250
Our factory organized a trip to Qingdao.

495
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,180
One day we had some free time.

496
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,330
Didn't do much,

497
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,620
just walked along the beach,

498
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,010
had some barbecue.

499
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,010
I was so happy.

500
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,380
I thought, I should go there once every year.

501
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,770
Then less than two months later,

502
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,770
I was laid off.

503
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,660
Just last month,

504
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,860
the colleague who went with me to Qingdao

505
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,900
suddenly passed away.

506
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,250
Heart attack.

507
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,530
When she passed,

508
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,180
I kept thinking,

509
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,250
if I got sick, I wouldn't get treatment.

510
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,900
I'd just dress up,

511
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,010
look pretty,

512
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,940
and go wherever I want.

513
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,250
Walk around, take it all in.

514
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,660
Okay.

515
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,900
Juan,

516
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,900
so we won't do the jaw surgery.

517
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,010
But leave the “pretty” part to me.

518
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,250
Why'd you buy so many snacks?

519
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,770
If you don't eat them, I will.

520
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,770
So you bought them for yourself.

521
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,980
Listen.

522
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,250
When you go to school,

523
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,250
turn off the power at home.

524
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,220
You're just having a surgery.

525
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,860
You'll still be able to speak.

526
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,530
You're all grown up now, huh?

527
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,490
Talking back already?

528
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,530
Dr. Qiao.

529
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,220
I saw an ad on the street today.

530
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,770
And I took a picture.

531
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,010
Cool, isn't it?

532
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,180
Super cool.

533
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,980
Mom.

534
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,460
Look, isn't your daughter cool?

535
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,860
Doesn't really look like you.

536
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,180
What do you mean?

537
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,620
Is your face really that small?

538
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,420
Are your eyes

539
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,730
that big?

540
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,860
Aren't they that big?

541
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,140
Come on, who doesn't edit photos these days?

542
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,140
This poster is going to be put up outside.

543
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,460
Those celebrities edit their photos way more than your daughter.

544
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,860
Looks great.

545
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,860
Yeah, I like it too.

546
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,330
Surgery's at 8:30 AM.

547
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,980
No food or water after 9 PM.

548
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,010
Let the nurse know if you need anything.

549
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,490
Thanks, Dr. Qiao.

550
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,250
Dr. Qiao.

551
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,660
No drinking tonight!

552
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,660
I handle my liquor just fine.

553
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,250
My hands won't shake, don't worry.

554
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,620
How much can you drink?

555
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,090
Mom,

556
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,530
Dr. Qiao does surgeries every day.

557
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,140
She doesn't drink.

558
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,010
Dr. Qiao,

559
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,380
no staying up late on your phone!

560
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,420
Mom, she's your doctor, not your daughter.

561
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,700
One, two.

562
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,730
One.

563
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,700
One.

564
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,530
One.

565
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,530
One.

566
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,140
One, two.

567
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,490
Very good.

568
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,420
Take a break, drink some water.

569
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,700
Thanks, coach.

570
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,660
What are you doing?

571
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,050
We came to box.

572
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,860
Why are you just sitting here?

573
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,770
Did they ask you to sign the contract?

574
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,810
Are you renewing?

575
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,250
Renew what? My contract isn't up.

576
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,420
They want a new one.

577
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,530
They'll come to you soon.

578
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,770
Commission increases with seniority.

579
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,900
Ms. Zhou is being generous.

580
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,530
Keep reading.

581
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,900
I should open a hospital and sign you.

582
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,770
I'd live off your termination fees.

583
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,660
You need the ability for that, Lu.

584
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,460
I'll show you my ability.

585
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,330
Watch closely.

586
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,980
Good thing I'm leaving.

587
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,330
That contract's a trap.

588
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,490
Whoever signs it is doomed.

589
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,730
Mr. Dong talked to me too.

590
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,140
Commission's higher,

591
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,770
but they made some complex formula.

592
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,250
Seniority, performance,

593
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,940
and even some revenue factor.

594
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,140
Who knows how much

595
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,010
we'll actually get?

596
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,620
I think our Mr. Dong

597
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,700
doesn't even know himself.

598
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,010
Mr. Dong?

599
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,330
Mr. Drop!

600
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,290
That's savage.

601
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,570
Why are you laughing?

602
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,140
We have a reason to leave.

603
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,730
You just did a couple of big surgeries, right?

604
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,860
You're not like us, stuck in the middle.

605
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,810
To be honest,

606
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,180
everyone has their own struggles.

607
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,620
So, have you decided where you want to go?

608
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,700
Not yet.

609
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,730
It depends on who gives the best offer.

610
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,730
I went to Jiao Ai today.

611
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,050
You went to Jiao Ai?

612
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,090
They've been contacting me too.

613
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,180
But I feel like they're too slick.

614
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,460
Switching jobs is like dating.

615
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,050
It's not easy to find the right one in a short time.

616
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,900
It's not that simple.

617
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,250
I was pretty surprised by Jiao Ai.

618
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,530
Take their equipment for example.

619
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,940
If we've got one here,

620
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,460
they'll have three.

621
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,770
And their ads are huge.

622
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,700
Have you seen those subway ads?

623
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,810
All theirs.

624
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,220
Let alone the amount of patients.

625
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,050
We used to think

626
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,420
they were stealing our clients.

627
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,010
But after I visited their hospital,

628
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,380
I realized it's not like that at all.

629
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,770
We're just not in the same league.

630
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,220
Honestly,

631
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,730
I think in less than six months,

632
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,220
most of these hospitals around here

633
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,810
could end up closing down.

634
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,530
Really?

635
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,530
Believe it or not.

636
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:37,620
Xiaoxi,

637
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,290
did you go to dermatology?

638
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,010
Yeah.

639
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,010
So, what's it like over there?

640
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,660
Tian Li.

641
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,810
Female, 55 years old.

642
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,220
Initial expander implant

643
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,460
for breast reconstruction.

644
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,420
The info is correct, right?

645
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,420
Correct, thanks.

646
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,290
How'd you sleep?

647
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,050
Didn't sleep at all.

648
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,900
Why?

649
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,010
I'm getting older,

650
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,140
and I'm doing the surgery now.

651
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,220
It's like watching a movie in my head.

652
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,330
I've been thinking a lot.

653
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,810
Is this going to affect the surgery?

654
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,770
It just means

655
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,050
you'll sleep well later.

656
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,250
Thanks.

657
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,940
Let's do the anesthesia.

658
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,810
You'll wake up as a beautiful, sexy woman.

659
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,620
Alright, deep breath.

660
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,180
These stitches are really neat.

661
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,090
Every time I stitch, I just think

662
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,860
the human body is so fragile.

663
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,940
You don't really need to stitch it.

664
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,490
It'll heal on its own.

665
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,250
Just not as perfectly.

666
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,700
Once a person gets hurt,

667
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,140
the body will heal itself, inside and out.

668
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,860
Humans are pretty strong creatures.

669
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,770
What doctors can do

670
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,490
is just help the wound heal faster

671
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,290
and better.

672
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,490
Looks like I'm free on the afternoon of the 9th.

673
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,860
I have two injections, see if you can move them up.

674
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,810
Can you check for me?

675
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,980
Sure, I can do it.

676
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,180
It's a must-do.

677
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,770
Whenever you want, I can schedule for you.

678
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,490
What's up with you today?

679
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,090
I saw you laughing all the time.

680
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,250
What's so funny?

681
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,220
Good news.

682
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,090
You'll know tomorrow.

683
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,420
Ms. Qiao,

684
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,460
I need to talk to you about something.

685
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,810
What could be more important than eating?

686
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,460
I'm quitting.

687
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,940
Ms. Zhou, are you free now?

688
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,860
Yeah,

689
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,290
come on in.

690
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,290
About the contract,

691
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,220
we've made our decision.

692
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,940
That's great!

693
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,180
Any other questions?

694
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,940
No, not anymore.

695
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,570
Alright, we can sign now.

696
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,010
We're quitting.

697
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,530
Ms. Qiao,

698
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,250
I'm quitting.

699
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,330
This has been on my mind

700
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,250
for a long time.

701
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,980
Since you came to the hospital

702
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,490
and became my mentor,

703
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,770
to be honest,

704
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,980
I've gotten more and more confused.

705
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,730
At first, my goal

706
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,570
was to get your approval.

707
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,090
I worked hard.

708
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,570
I worked really hard.

709
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,050
Then, it seemed I achieved that goal.

710
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,330
You gave me so many chances.

711
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,570
So I thought,

712
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,420
I'll just keep working hard,

713
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,940
and become a doctor like you,

714
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,730
completely devoted to patients and medicine,

715
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,770
giving them everything I have.

716
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,940
But I realized I can't fool myself.

717
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,770
I always feel unsatisfied inside.

718
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,900
Even if I become this kind of doctor,

719
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,900
I don't think that's me.

720
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,730
Ms. Qiao,

721
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,220
you're a good doctor.

722
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,810
I respect you,

723
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,570
but I don't want to be you.

724
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,420
This is a big deal.

725
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,810
Why didn't you talk to me first?

726
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,050
I'm telling you now.

727
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,420
There are so many hospitals.

728
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,730
Why does it have to be Jiao Ai?

729
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:29,050
I remember the first time we met.

730
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,620
It was in this restaurant, right?

731
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,420
And it was raining that day too.

732
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,490
We had just joined Gemu.

733
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,900
Zhang and the others hyped it up,

734
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,420
so you treated everyone to a meal.

735
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,010
Right?

736
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,330
Yeah.

737
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,250
I remember you said

738
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,660
the food here was pretty good.

739
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,380
Doesn't taste as good as before.

740
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,290
I prefer Japanese food now.

741
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,090
Yeah.

742
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,810
I know

743
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,180
Jiao Ai pays well.

744
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,730
But we talked about this before.

745
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,010
Their business model

746
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,980
is completely different from Gemu.

747
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,380
They care about sales, not doctors.

748
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,570
Doctors there

749
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,530
have no say.

750
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,010
I know.

751
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,700
Then I don't get it.

752
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,810
Is it just for more money?

753
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,530
Is making money shameful?

754
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,250
No, it's not.

755
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,700
But we can't just focus on the now.

756
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,050
We have to think about the future.

757
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,530
Future?

758
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,620
Okay, tell me.

759
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,420
What's your plan?

760
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,090
This is my plan.

761
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,180
Our future.

762
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,290
That's a big diamond.

763
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,050
Not bad, huh?

764
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,050
Let me sum up

765
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,290
your plan for our future.

766
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,420
We stay at Gemu.

767
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,250
If it goes well,

768
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,330
we keep working here.

769
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,700
If not, we go back to your hometown,

770
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,810
and take over your aunt's clinic.

771
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,050
That it?

772
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,700
Can you stop being so negative?

773
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,940
Why wouldn't it go well?

774
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,010
We're doing fine now, aren't we?

775
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,620
You think it's fine?

776
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,490
I think it's fine.

777
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,050
Never thought about more?

778
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,090
Like what?

779
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,290
People are strange sometimes.

780
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,900
For a lot of things,

781
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,180
when you don't think about them,

782
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,140
you can just go with the flow.

783
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,810
But once you figure them out,

784
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,940
there's no going back.

785
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,940
What do you mean?

786
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,530
I don't get it.

787
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,170
Ever heard of life skill points?

788
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,650
Like when you create a character in a game,

789
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,010
assigning their attributes.

790
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,900
Agility,

791
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,090
charm, or intelligence.

792
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,130
Every attribute fits a certain role.

793
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,050
Maybe we're born

794
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,050
with our attributes set.

795
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,820
Pretty people become actors,

796
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,980
athletic ones play basketball,

797
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,610
smooth talkers go into business.

798
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,940
My hands are made for scalpels,

799
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,460
not diamond rings.

800
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,690
I'm not pressuring you.

801
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,690
Not at all.

802
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,300
You don't have to say yes now.

803
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,460
I just mean, when you're ready.

804
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,050
What if,

805
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,460
that day never comes?

806
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,130
Learn anything new at the seminar?

807
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,260
You know what?

808
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,210
The fish is actually good today.

809
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,050
Really?

810
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,010
Smells nice.

811
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,570
Sir,

812
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,050
how many students have you trained?

813
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,570
Not counting undergrads,

814
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,570
I've mentored a lot.

815
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,820
As for grad students,

816
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,170
I've mentored over a dozen classes.

817
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,570
One per year.

818
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,740
Wait, your year I had two.

819
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,570
In the hospital, only a few.

820
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,050
Do you keep in touch?

821
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,050
Not really.

822
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,380
They've become chief physician,

823
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,490
and are busy now.

824
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,860
Just a text or call

825
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,010
during holidays.

826
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,570
Remember your senior, Shi Jin?

827
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,570
Black Peony?

828
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,570
Super skilled.

829
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,570
Who could forget?

830
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,420
She was my most dedicated student.

831
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,570
So we were just filler?

832
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,570
No, no!

833
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,170
I put my heart into you two as well.

834
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,050
I mean she switched careers long ago.

835
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,820
Really?

836
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,170
What a waste.

837
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,170
The mentor-mentee bond is unique.

838
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,050
Those you believe in most

839
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,170
don't always succeed.

840
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,210
Turns out,

841
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,260
you two stayed by my side.

842
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,570
Your mentee Wei Xiaoxi is good.

843
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:10,780
She's smart.

844
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,780
Heard she graduated from our school too.

845
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,820
Train her well. She's got potential.

846
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,570
Here you are.

847
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,570
Did you hear? Wei Xiaoxi is leaving.

848
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,820
She's unbelievable.

849
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,860
Leaving is one thing,

850
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,050
but dragging others along too?

851
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,570
No conscience at all.

852
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,380
And you're blaming her?

853
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,050
The fact that doctors are still here,

854
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,460
sticking it out with you,

855
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,690
is already impressive.

856
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,860
But you?

857
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,570
One minute you're making them sign slave contracts,

858
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,980
the next you're docking their pay.

859
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,170
With all these tricks,

860
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,340
no wonder they're leaving.

861
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,490
Four doctors,

862
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,900
all heading to Jiao Ai together.

863
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,420
Just like when Du Jun left.

864
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,010
All because of your ridiculous contract.

865
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,380
Even I get dizzy reading it.

866
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,610
Pages and pages of complicated formulas.

867
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,460
It's a contract,

868
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,090
not a math exam.

869
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,610
What?

870
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,940
Mr. Chu.

871
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,690
what's your take on this?

872
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,380
Every time I bring up work, she argues.

873
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,420
Always complaining.

874
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,530
-So mature. -This fish is really good.

875
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,130
This fish is really good.

876
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,130
I need another plate.

877
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,650
You two want some?

878
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,460
No!

879
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,460
What are you staring at?

880
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,460
Am I wrong?

881
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,300
A good surgery

882
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,740
is all about precision.

883
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,420
Every move should be simple, exact.

884
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,260
Yet here you are,

885
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,690
messing around with nonsense.

886
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,900
Ever thought of a different approach?

887
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,570
So what's your bright idea?

888
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,940
Not my problem.

889
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,980
So your plan

890
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,780
is to let doctors invest, right?

891
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,380
Exactly.

892
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,420
No one wants to sign contracts

893
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,340
because they don't want to lose control.

894
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,610
But if a doctor wants to leave,

895
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,740
no penalty fee can stop them.

896
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,900
When I first joined Gemu,

897
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,090
I had my doubts too.

898
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,340
But look at me now,

899
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,740
I'm the one convincing you.

900
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,340
So now you actually feel part of Gemu.

901
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,130
Guess I deserve

902
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,690
some credit for that, huh?

903
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,490
Make it double.

904
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,570
Breakfast is on me.

905
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,420
How's that?

906
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,650
Employee partners.

907
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,420
It was really Qiao Yang's idea?

908
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,610
Yeah.

909
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,980
I think if we cut open Qiao Yang's brain,

910
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,610
there'd probably be no business section in there.

911
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,860
But the way she came up with this idea...

912
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,460
I just never thought of it.

913
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,980
It's actually a pretty good idea.

914
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,300
But it's a bit difficult to put into practice.

915
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,860
Like how do we divide the bonuses?

916
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,260
Truth is

917
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,860
people always complain about fairness, not how much they get.

918
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,010
I'm concerned that share distribution

919
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,650
might lead to conflicts.

920
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,900
Here's what I think.

921
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,340
We take out a portion of the shares,

922
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,010
and let them invest in the shares.

923
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,260
We set a cap.

924
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,420
Those with more funds can buy more.

925
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,300
This could replace the penalty fee,

926
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,860
and let these doctors have no worries.

927
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,010
It'll also ease some of our funding problems.

928
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,420
Rewards definitely work better

929
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,820
than punishments.

930
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,610
Anyone who's raised kids knows that.

931
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,170
Managing employees is pretty much the same.

932
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,690
Milk? Want some?

933
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:01,610
Yeah.

934
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,340
So much?

935
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,460
No surgeries this morning?

936
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,300
I only have one major surgery today.

937
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,340
Brainwashing you.

938
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,900
Once you sign the contract,

939
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,570
the female doctors will definitely sign too.

940
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,980
Once they sign,

941
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,300
the male doctors will follow.

942
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,210
I'm clever, right?

943
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,340
You're being

944
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,780
pretty objective.

945
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,130
It's true.

946
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,530
Don't hesitate, Dr. Lu.

947
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,260
Sign already.

948
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,090
Come on.

949
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,010
I said it's on me.

950
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,490
You sign, I'll sign.

951
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,420
You're too sneaky.

952
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,820
Alright.

953
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,300
I'll sign now.

954
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,980
But you're paying for these.

955
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,170
I'll wait for you in the office.

956
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,490
Mr. Dong,

957
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,490
they say the chloasma is related

958
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,740
to liver problems.

959
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,650
Is that true?

960
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,690
The causes are pretty complex.

961
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,090
Basically,

962
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,420
melasma is a stubborn

963
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,090
pigmentation disorder.

964
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,380
What we're doing now

965
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,570
is using lasers

966
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,380
to break it down.

967
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,490
Then, with some oral meds,

968
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,490
you should see results

969
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,010
in about a month.

970
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,130
Mr. Dong,

971
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,090
I'm planning a trip for Chinese New Year.

972
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,530
That okay?

973
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,820
No problem at all.

974
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,130
Just wear sunscreen.

975
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,210
Even sunbathing

976
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,210
is fine.

977
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,300
Just remember sunscreen, okay?

978
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,010
Got it.

979
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,530
Your son?

980
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,650
Yeah, my son.

981
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,780
He's gotten so big!

982
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,050
Here, take your mom's mask.

983
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,940
Make sure to follow the instructions.

984
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,900
Okay? One last reminder,

985
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,490
sunscreen is a must.

986
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,130
Okay.

987
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,820
You can go home now.

988
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,340
Mr. Dong,

989
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,570
Happy New Year! Thank you!

990
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,740
Happy New Year!

991
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,570
Bye!

992
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,530
-Bye! -Let's go.

993
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:54,980
How sweet.

994
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,050
Her husband wasn't supportive,

995
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,420
but her son was.

996
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,300
He said beauty gives life energy.

997
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,940
He wants his mom to stay pretty.

998
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,780
Really?

999
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,300
First time seeing a son accompany

1000
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,900
his mom for treatment.

1001
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,740
Yeah, same here.

1002
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,820
Honestly, I feel guilty.

1003
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,570
I never even thought

1004
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,090
about doing this for my mom.

1005
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,340
Bring her in.

1006
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,050
I will, I'll find time for it.

1007
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,300
Thanks for helping Ms. Li.

1008
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,490
No big deal.

1009
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,460
Come on, don't be so formal.

1010
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,530
If you need anything,

1011
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,820
just ask.

1012
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,650
Then I might just go all out.

1013
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,340
Wait,

1014
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,780
you're not planning another policy change, are you?

1015
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,260
Ms. Zhou, have mercy!

1016
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,090
We are still figuring out the contract thing.

1017
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,300
I don't need more nicknames.

1018
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,260
Definitely not.

1019
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,130
One last thing,

1020
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,940
whatever plan you've got in your mind,

1021
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,740
I'm not agreeing to it.

1022
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:56,900
Gotta go now.
