1
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,900
You can donate a cornea or something like that.

2
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,050
But giving away your whole face...

3
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,930
I just can't accept it.

4
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,660
Long,

5
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,490
this time,

6
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,850
Daddy will bring you a big present.

7
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,740
Tell me,

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,930
what do you want?

9
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,900
Nazhua.

10
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,130
Where am I supposed to catch one for you?

11
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,620
Nazhua?

12
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,260
How many times have I told you? It's Nazha.

13
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,290
Come on, say it with me:

14
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,290
Nazha.

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,410
Nazhua.

16
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,330
Nazha.

17
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,980
Nazhua.

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,930
Nazha.

19
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,660
Nazhua.

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,820
Nazhua.

21
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,850
A killer without blinking.

22
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,380
A man-eater without adding salt.

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,130
Nazha,

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,220
how long are you gonna keep making trouble?

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,850
Long,

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,410
look, what's on TV?

27
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,380
It's Nazhua!

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,010
Daddy, I wanna watch Nazhua!

29
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,820
I'll play shuttlecock with you.

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,500
Look, there's another little kid.

31
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,850
Buddy,

32
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,100
what's your name?

33
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,610
Deng Xiaoshu.

34
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,570
Deng Xiaoshu.

35
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,380
How old are you?

36
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,610
Six.

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,660
Six years old.

38
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,850
My son's eight.

39
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,170
Say hi.

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,060
Hi.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,980
Hi.

42
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,690
Xiaoshu,

43
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,850
does your dad usually watch cartoons with you?

44
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,890
Yes.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,260
But Grandpa said Dad is dead.

46
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,130
So we might not be able to watch anymore.

47
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,380
Xiaoshu,

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,730
come sit with me.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,170
Let's watch it together.

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,290
Xiaoshu!

51
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,540
Did you see that little boy just now?

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,450
Where did he go?

53
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,410
I didn't notice.

54
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,380
Xiaoshu!

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,780
Xiaoshu!

56
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,380
Xiaoshu!

57
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,540
Actually, your dad isn't dead.

58
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,060
He's a general in the Heaven.

59
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,690
He knows you like Nazha,

60
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,380
so he went on a mission to chase after him.

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,780
Why are you covering your face?

62
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,610
Because, just like your dad,

63
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,940
I'm also a general from the Heavenly Court.

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,010
We both belong to the Southwest Division,

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,290
on a secret mission in the mortal world.

66
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,690
That's why we can't show our faces.

67
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,540
Can you see my dad?

68
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,290
Of course I can.

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,410
It's as easy as one plus one.

70
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,140
Next time you see him on a mission,

71
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,460
tell him

72
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,490
that I made a Wind Fire Wheel.

73
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,170
Sure.

74
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,220
Ms. Qiao,

75
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,410
have some chocolate.

76
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,610
Turns out Qi Dacheng is allergic to exercise,

77
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,900
and he didn't even know it himself.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,700
After getting injured,

79
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,490
he stopped all intense physical activities,

80
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,490
so even if he got it,

81
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,730
he never had a chance to have a reaction.

82
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,930
That's quite a rare condition.

83
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,660
I've never heard of it before.

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,900
It's a strange disease discovered in the 1990s.

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,220
The pathology is still unclear.

86
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,730
Luckily, each episode lasts only 20 to 30 minutes,

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,730
and once recovered, he's just like a normal person.

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,410
This chocolate is pretty good.

89
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,340
Give me another piece.

90
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,490
I'll get it for you.

91
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,410
Everyone, listen up.

92
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,370
Qi Dacheng's allergic reaction is under control.

93
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,250
The donor issue has also been resolved.

94
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,780
I know everyone is ready to go.

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,580
The surgery is in one hour.

96
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,410
Make the most of your time. Let's get started.

97
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,410
Mr. Deng,

98
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,730
the surgery will take a long time.

99
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,410
You should go back and rest.

100
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,460
Dr. Zhou,

101
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,490
can you take a picture for me?

102
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,220
Sure.

103
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,900
Thanks.

104
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,340
Give your phone to her.

105
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,850
Come.

106
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,460
Come over here.

107
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:31,930
Come on.

108
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,020
Come here.

109
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,340
I've been injured for eight years, our son is eight years old.

110
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,140
We've never taken a photo together.

111
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,220
Come.

112
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,340
Smile, make a heart with your hands.

113
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,580
Got it.

114
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,020
Dr. Zhou,

115
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,220
can you add a beauty filter for me?

116
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,340
No problem.

117
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,100
Thank you!

118
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,290
1, 2, 3.

119
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,140
How nice.

120
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,660
Look.

121
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,050
If I don't wake up,

122
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,930
the thing I told you about...

123
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,730
Stop it. I won't do it.

124
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,290
You must...

125
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,580
Hello, Long.

126
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,410
Don't worry.

127
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,540
Ever since the accident,

128
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,250
he's been trying to persuade me to remarry.

129
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,780
I know

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,580
he's not afraid of the surgery failing.

131
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,410
If it fails,

132
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,170
he won't be a burden to me anymore.

133
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,610
Isn't he just silly?

134
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,780
Speak to your mom. Come.

135
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,290
Long wants to talk to you.

136
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,490
Come on, speak nicely.

137
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,410
Hello?

138
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,100
Your dad's about to go into surgery.

139
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,980
Do your homework properly.

140
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,780
Or I'll deal with you when I get back.

141
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,930
Why are you still crying?

142
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,140
You're making him worry.

143
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,730
Hello?

144
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,930
How's it going?

145
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,700
Is everything okay? Going smoothly?

146
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,810
The surgery is about to start.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,730
That's good.

148
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,610
How's your back doing?

149
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,340
If the surgery takes too long,

150
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,540
don't push yourself too hard.

151
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,020
Take breaks when needed.

152
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,460
I know what I'm doing.

153
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,410
The surgery will go on until tomorrow night.

154
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,340
Don't wait up for me.

155
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,250
We'll talk when I get back tomorrow.

156
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,730
Everything will be fine.

157
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,580
That's it.

158
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,060
16:30.

159
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,770
Let's begin.

160
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,610
First, let us bow and pay tribute to the donor.

161
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,300
Begin donor extraction.

162
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,250
Pay attention to the depth and location.

163
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,730
Why aren't there any shots of Deng Lan?

164
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,130
How could there be?

165
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,580
That would be so disrespectful to the deceased.

166
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,060
Blood pressure?

167
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,220
95 over 75.

168
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,370
Very good.

169
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,460
Suction the blood.

170
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,100
Got it.

171
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,300
Jingwen,

172
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,250
your turn.

173
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,610
Not bad.

174
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,420
You haven't lost your touch after all these years.

175
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,770
Can you keep it up?

176
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,980
We'll see how it goes.

177
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,610
One hour and twenty-six minutes.

178
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,220
First stage complete.

179
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,130
Tissues and blood vessels look good.

180
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,940
Flush the vessels.

181
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,770
Once cleaned, send the transplant part

182
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,980
to Qiao Yang's team.

183
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,650
Now it's a race against time.

184
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,180
The earlier we deliver it,

185
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,530
the higher the survival rate of the transplanted tissue.

186
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,220
Now proceeding to the second stage of the surgery.

187
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,420
Within four and a half hours,

188
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,980
we must complete the vascular connection.

189
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,180
Otherwise, the donor tissue won't survive.

190
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,370
This is the key to success.

191
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,490
One mistake will make all our efforts in vain.

192
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,700
Everyone, stay alert.

193
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,010
Just watching the screen is kinda boring.

194
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,820
How about going to the operating room?

195
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,420
What's the point?

196
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,370
You can't get in anyway.

197
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,700
The view here is clear enough.

198
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,220
We're going anyway.

199
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,530
The blood vessel diameters are inconsistent.

200
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,250
Connecting them will be challenging.

201
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,250
I can cut the larger vessel down to size,

202
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,730
making the two ends match.

203
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,610
I've encountered similar situations before.

204
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,180
It can be solved.

205
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,250
- Well done. - Thanks.

206
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,010
Have some water.

207
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,770
Beautiful work.

208
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,060
Jingwen,

209
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,220
take a break.

210
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,650
Alright.

211
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,340
Ms. Zhou.

212
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,220
What are you doing here?

213
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,300
We wanted to experience it firsthand.

214
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,850
What stage is the surgery at now?

215
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,730
Six blood vessels on the face need to be connected.

216
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,530
This step is the most difficult.

217
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,700
Every second counts.

218
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,490
The survival of the transplanted tissue

219
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,580
depends on this step.

220
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,010
You know,

221
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,580
facial blood vessels are as thin as matchsticks.

222
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,010
We have to quickly suture them

223
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,130
with over a dozen stitches.

224
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,610
Also, the blood vessel diameters of both faces

225
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,700
are inconsistent,

226
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,820
like connecting a large water pipe to a small one,

227
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,650
it's a huge technical challenge.

228
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,420
Anastomosis complete.

229
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,700
Just in time.

230
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,730
The first hurdle is over.

231
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,850
Release the blood flow.

232
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,340
You kept a steady hand even after all those years

233
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,010
at the private hospital,

234
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,220
must've practiced a lot.

235
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,130
Oh no, bleeding.

236
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,850
Stop the bleeding quickly.

237
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,700
The donor tissue was chilled.

238
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,820
After blood flow resumed,

239
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,820
the vessel expanded and the sutured ends didn't hold.

240
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,940
Gauze.

241
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,980
Hurry.

242
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,300
Blood pressure?

243
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,460
100 over 70.

244
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:29,940
Heart rate?

245
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,530
100.

246
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,610
Blood loss?

247
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,180
400.

248
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:32,770
Urine output?

249
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,300
100.

250
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,130
Prepare plasma.

251
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,890
I'll get it.

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,420
Quick, clamp the blood vessel!

253
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,010
No way!

254
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,700
If we clamp it right after connecting,

255
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,610
the vessel will thrombose, and the transplanted face will die.

256
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,650
But if you let the blood keep flowing,

257
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,650
Qi Dacheng will die.

258
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,700
Which do you save: the life or the face?

259
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,460
Both.

260
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,700
It's worth taking this risk.

261
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,420
Stop the bleeding!

262
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,420
Blood pressure?

263
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,370
Sixty over forty.

264
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,180
Heart rate?

265
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,820
One twenty.

266
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,420
Blood loss?

267
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,220
Fifteen hundred.

268
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,820
Urine output?

269
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,490
One twenty.

270
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,730
The bleeding has stopped.

271
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,530
Blood pressure is stable.

272
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,250
Both the face and life are saved.

273
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,490
His blood pressure dropped,

274
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,570
but mine just shot up!

275
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,460
The next step is nerve suturing.

276
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,420
This is the most complex challenge

277
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,810
in facial transplantation surgery.

278
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,940
It's also the key to giving the patient a new life.

279
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,250
Every nerve connection

280
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,220
is like weaving new links

281
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,770
on a delicate spider web.

282
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,660
We're reconstructing a network

283
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,490
of sensation and expression.

284
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,380
This process is very time-consuming,

285
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,900
testing both technique

286
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,490
and patience.

287
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,860
It requires the joint efforts of all our colleagues

288
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,090
to overcome this challenge.

289
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,980
Whether it looks good or not is up to you now.

290
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,660
Don't worry, leave it to me.

291
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,620
Time to put your aesthetic skills to work.

292
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,660
Facial structure is important,

293
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,460
but reshaping it

294
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,620
to become a normal-looking face is even more crucial.

295
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,570
Done.

296
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,220
That was tough.

297
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,220
It wasn't easy.

298
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,330
We did it!

299
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,180
H-How is it?

300
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,420
The surgery was a success.

301
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,290
You can go see him later.

302
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,810
Thank you! Thank you so much!

303
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,620
Don't worry.

304
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,250
Exhausted?

305
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,010
Happy birthday.

306
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,700
How'd you know?

307
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,700
Your WeChat ID has it clearly written.

308
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,570
Afraid I'd find out?

309
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,250
Do you know what I feel like doing right now?

310
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,140
What do you feel like doing?

311
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,140
Eating meat.

312
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,810
There are cameras here. Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

313
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,620
I mean barbecue!

314
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,420
Are you dumb?

315
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,490
Barbecue?

316
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,730
Hurry up!

317
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,810
I'm feeling so great today!

318
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,860
This definitely calls for a celebration.

319
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,810
You open the wine, I'll wash the glasses.

320
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,490
Today was such a thrilling day.

321
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,860
You have no idea what I went through.

322
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,290
In over 20 years of practicing medicine,

323
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,980
I've never felt this way before.

324
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,940
I never thought

325
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,730
I would perform surgery alongside Mr. Chu

326
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,050
and Qiao Yang.

327
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,770
And it wasn't just any surgery,

328
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,770
it was a particularly meaningful one.

329
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,180
That feeling...

330
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,860
I don't know if you can imagine it.

331
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,250
Is it like when our clinic first opened?

332
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,660
No.

333
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,250
How do I even describe it?

334
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,770
It's like when your favorite soccer player

335
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,530
scores that winning goal in the World Cup final.

336
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,860
That moment of victory.

337
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,810
That feeling.

338
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,980
It's what I'm feeling now.

339
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,660
Is it really that dramatic?

340
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,010
Not dramatic at all.

341
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,420
You have no idea how difficult this surgery was.

342
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,290
When we succeeded,

343
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,050
everyone was cheering.

344
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,420
It really wasn't easy.

345
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,090
I haven't been this exhausted in a long time.

346
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,810
What's the date today?

347
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,530
I have to remember this day.

348
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,660
It's a special day.

349
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,330
Let's see...

350
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:18,980
Cheers!

351
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:23,620
To the amazing Dr. Zhou!

352
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,730
To the greatness of medical science!

353
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,180
Five years...

354
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,730
Every time I practiced,

355
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,570
I didn't know

356
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,980
if I'd ever get the chance to do this surgery.

357
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,770
But if I didn't practice,

358
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,090
I was afraid that when the right donor came,

359
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,420
I wouldn't be prepared.

360
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,570
You said that fifteen minutes ago.

361
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,330
You've been repeating it like eight hundred times.

362
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,490
Alright, stop drinking for now.

363
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,090
Are you looking down on me?

364
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,050
If it weren't for my sleep deprivation

365
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,620
lowering my immunity,

366
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,770
I can handle two pots of this.

367
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,810
See?

368
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,420
Yeah.

369
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,250
Come.

370
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,140
A pile of shit?

371
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,570
What pile of shit?

372
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,570
It's your birthday cake.

373
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,730
Doesn't it look like a pile of shit to you?

374
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,620
Sorry!

375
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,530
Lower your voice.

376
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,460
What are you doing?

377
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,620
Thanks. Thank you so much.

378
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,570
Stop singing.

379
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,010
Alright, it's midnight.

380
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,250
Midnight?

381
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,700
I'm gonna see Qi Dacheng.

382
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,050
Come back!

383
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,140
Sit down!

384
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,050
Qi Dacheng is in the ICU.

385
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,250
The medical staff is watching him.

386
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,180
He doesn't need you.

387
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,730
The ICU?

388
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,380
You did a great job

389
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,940
with today's surgery.

390
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,660
It was thrilling.

391
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,090
I know that surgeries like this

392
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,620
are something you'll rarely encounter in your life.

393
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,180
But no matter how well you did,

394
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,980
once the battle is over,

395
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,620
you need to rest properly,

396
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,810
right?

397
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,180
Otherwise, no one can handle it.

398
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,010
What?

399
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,090
Why are you looking at me like that?

400
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,460
I just remembered

401
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,810
when we first met.

402
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,860
You were still a resident doctor back then.

403
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,420
I can't even remember

404
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,330
when you went to Munich.

405
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,420
Munich?

406
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,530
That was so long ago.

407
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,810
I remember that time,

408
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,140
it was the first time I met you.

409
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,420
Mr. Vanderlich asked me to come downstairs and meet you.

410
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,940
You were a medical representative back then.

411
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,620
I had just finished a major surgery.

412
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,570
I was so excited.

413
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,090
I saw you, my fellow countryman,

414
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,980
and kept chatting with you. Do you remember?

415
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,090
Of course I remember.

416
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,290
Because that was when I decided

417
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,570
you were the person I was looking for.

418
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,940
I also remember that when you were quiet,

419
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,570
you seemed very gentle.

420
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,570
But once you started talking about your specialty,

421
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,380
you shone brightly.

422
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,860
Just like earlier.

423
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,220
I really miss those days.

424
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,700
Every day was a challenge.

425
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,010
Every day was thrilling.

426
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,660
Though it was tough,

427
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,940
I really enjoyed it.

428
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,530
And now, too,

429
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,220
there are new challenges every day.

430
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,090
It's different.

431
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,420
Now I have you.

432
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,700
I know I've been so busy lately,

433
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,010
sometimes I get impatient with you.

434
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,700
I'm thinking, once we're done with all this,

435
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,420
we should take a proper vacation.

436
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,810
Make a wish.

437
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,700
Do you think wishes on shit will come true?

438
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,380
If you truly believe.

439
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,490
Your wish is for Qi Dacheng to recover soon

440
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,140
right?

441
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,900
I pray there's no rejection reaction,

442
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,220
and that Qi Dacheng

443
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,090
can regain his happiness in life soon.

444
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,530
That's it?

445
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,530
That's it.

446
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,050
There's no me?

447
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,940
Who are you?

448
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,660
Don't be so petty.

449
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,420
You haven't paid the bill.

450
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,250
I'll make you a big cake.

451
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,730
You're so disgusting.

452
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,570
Your phone's ringing.

453
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,940
Answer it for me.

454
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,090
It's midnight.

455
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,290
It's definitely a woman calling.

456
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,810
A woman named Dadan.

457
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,900
Daddy,

458
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,180
Mommy's asking when you'll be back.

459
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,460
Daddy?

460
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,290
Mr. Chu is calling.

461
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,380
Answer it.

462
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,250
Why aren't you answering?

463
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,140
What if it's something urgent?

464
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,730
It's fine.

465
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,770
I had some questions to ask him earlier.

466
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,660
I'll talk to him later.

467
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,980
What questions?

468
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,420
You should enjoy your success today.

469
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,940
We'll talk tomorrow, okay?

470
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,530
If you don't tell me,

471
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,530
I'll call him.

472
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:35,980
Look at this.

473
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,940
In this pile of files Li Qi gave me,

474
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,140
I don't know why this is here.

475
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,530
Honey, don't misunderstand.

476
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,140
First of all, I wanna clarify that I don't think

477
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,980
this is a very serious matter.

478
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,380
I don't know what Li Qi wants to do.

479
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,380
I don't care.

480
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,380
What I wanted to tell you is,

481
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,660
I feel that lately

482
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,490
there has been some issue between us.

483
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,860
I don't know if

484
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,420
I haven't done something well.

485
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,490
But I feel like

486
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,490
you haven't told me a lot of things.

487
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,570
You've only told me half of many things.

488
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,290
Including the Qiao Yang matter.

489
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,570
Including the Mr. Chu matter.

490
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,250
Of course, I'm not saying all this

491
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,620
to question you.

492
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,900
I don't believe this is true.

493
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,660
What's written here is all true.

494
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,770
I gave her an injection,

495
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,140
and she jumped off a building.

496
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,220
I was also expelled.

497
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,730
There's even more exciting stuff.

498
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,460
Do you wanna hear?

499
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,250
I'm back to the hospital.

500
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,140
Excuse me,

501
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,490
did you see

502
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,380
the girl at this table?

503
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,290
She just left.

504
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,090
She left?

505
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,730
Your complexion doesn't look right.

506
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,380
After doing such a face-transplant level surgery,

507
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,090
shouldn't you be leaving a mark in history?

508
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,770
Shouldn't your tail be up in the air?

509
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,050
You're not bad either.

510
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,530
Your performance today should at least score 80 points.

511
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,220
80?

512
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,380
Where did I lose the other points?

513
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,810
Your stamina is too weak.

514
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,010
It's obvious you don't exercise much usually.

515
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,860
After a while, your body stiffens up.

516
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,730
After a while, your body stiffens up.

517
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,980
That's true.

518
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,090
I really need to work out.

519
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,660
Oh right, happy birthday.

520
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,460
Thanks.

521
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,090
Welcome to the 40 club.

522
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,620
Bet you didn't expect that.

523
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,180
Your first birthday wish at the stroke of forty

524
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,530
came from me.

525
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,700
Come, happy birthday!

526
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,860
Happy 40th.

527
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,290
Is it necessary to repeat "forty"

528
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,660
so many times?

529
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,770
Forty's great.

530
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,730
We have experience and wisdom.

531
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,530
And most importantly, we have choices.

532
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,770
We can choose what we want

533
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,620
and reject what we don't.

534
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,860
How freeing is that, right?

535
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,290
Freedom is always relative.

536
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,490
Do you know what the greatest advantage

537
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,940
of this industry is?

538
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,570
What?

539
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,860
Money.

540
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,330
Congrats.

541
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,290
You finally figured it out.

542
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,490
Having money means having more possibilities.

543
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,250
Plastic surgery is the most creative,

544
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,900
almost artistic field in medicine.

545
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,180
Technological innovation in this field

546
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,570
is far bolder than in other fields.

547
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,940
In our industry,

548
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,620
aesthetic sense is the foundation,

549
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,290
and technology is the future.

550
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,180
There's a vast world beyond the cocoon.

551
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,330
Of course, I wanna be in a place

552
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,620
where I can run farther and faster.

553
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,140
You put that so well.

554
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,660
Here's to you. Cheers.

555
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,660
I really envy you,

556
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,570
living so freely all the time.

557
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,700
Doing whatever you want,

558
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,810
not afraid of anything.

559
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,090
Earlier, while resting in the operating room,

560
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,940
I was thinking.

561
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,860
When Mr. Chu said to pick three people,

562
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,420
my first thought

563
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,290
was the doctors at Gemu Hospital.

564
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,700
I wanted to give the young people a chance,

565
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,860
never even considered myself.

566
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,810
If you hadn't named me,

567
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,090
I wouldn't have come.

568
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,770
If I hadn't come,

569
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,180
I'd probably regret it to death.

570
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,770
Since when did I become this kind of person?

571
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,700
Anyway, back in college,

572
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,460
you always wanted to be number one in everything.

573
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,010
Always fighting for it.

574
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,380
Even fought over a mentor until you were battered and bruised.

575
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,620
And now...

576
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,980
You're a boss.

577
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,810
Gotta look at the big picture, right?

578
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,380
Boss?

579
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,050
What good is being the boss?

580
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,180
Let me tell you, I'm not happy at all right now.

581
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,530
I'm exhausted every single day,

582
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,530
seeing patients while managing the hospital.

583
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,180
I have to take responsibility for everything.

584
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,380
It never ends.

585
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,220
Even Li Qi is walking all over me now.

586
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,490
She better not push me too far.

587
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,530
If she does,

588
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,620
I'll fall out with her.

589
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,900
Are you planning to go dark?

590
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,530
In your eyes,

591
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,140
haven't I always been the villain?

592
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,140
Then don't die too soon,

593
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,460
or the plot will get boring.

594
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,700
Don't worry.

595
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,900
I'm pretty hard to kill.

596
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,220
Missed it.

597
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,940
Told you your stamina's lacking.

598
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,010
- Your turn. - Watch me.

599
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,380
Happy birthday.

600
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,610
Thanks.

601
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,740
I called my dad four or five times this morning.

602
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,420
He hung up on me every time.

603
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,610
If he's got guts, he should just block me completely.

604
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,090
Acting like a kid at that age...

605
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,900
He's that old already,

606
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,260
why are you still fighting with him?

607
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,130
Do me a favor?

608
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,380
Go ahead.

609
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,050
Help me set up a meeting with him.

610
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,130
Pick a quiet place, okay?

611
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,090
I told you to find a quiet place,

612
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,530
not somewhere this remote.

613
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,340
This is too far out.

614
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,820
What's going on?

615
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,740
Why are there

616
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,490
parent-child activities today?

617
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,460
How are we supposed to chat here?

618
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,740
Ji Xuefeng,

619
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,860
every time I ask you to do something,

620
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,170
you're always so unreliable.

621
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,490
You really amaze me.

622
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,740
Where's my dad?

623
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,460
You're amazing!

624
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,460
Alright, gotta go.

625
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,610
How about this?

626
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,460
Amazing!

627
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,300
That's nothing.

628
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,740
Wow!

629
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,380
Your knife skills haven't gotten rusty at all.

630
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,650
Nice.

631
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,740
Ji tricked me again.

632
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,940
I called you, but you didn't answer.

633
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,980
I had to send your close associate to invite you.

634
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,740
Alright, everyone, attention please!

635
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,050
Our event

636
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,460
is about to begin.

637
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,420
Mengmeng, stop playing for now.

638
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,050
Go back to your seat.

639
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,530
How about we switch to another restaurant?

640
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,460
There's an event here today.

641
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,340
It's too noisy, we can't talk.

642
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,380
Let's go.

643
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,340
Sit down.

644
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,170
Dadan, where's your parents?

645
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,740
This is my grandpa.

646
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,820
Sit down please.

647
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,530
Help me out.

648
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,940
Otherwise, I can't play the game.

649
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,460
That mom over there, please sit down too.

650
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,010
Me? No...

651
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,460
- Dad... - Everyone, attention please!

652
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,690
Alright, sit.

653
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:58,940
But...

654
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,380
Alright, listen to me, everyone.

655
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,490
Why are you sitting here?

656
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,050
I'm not leaving. I'm his grandpa.

657
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,090
Let me first explain

658
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,690
the rules of our event.

659
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,530
Next question!

660
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,090
Why can't the fox stand up?

661
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,340
Once again, Dadan's family is the first to answer.

662
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,090
If you don't plan on sticking it yourself,

663
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,610
don't be the first to answer.

664
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,340
Our family has a division of labor.

665
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,130
I'm in charge of buzzing, they're in charge of answering.

666
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,740
Quick.

667
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,900
Think fast.

668
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,530
Fox...

669
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,420
has low blood sugar?

670
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,860
No, bone marrow disorder!

671
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,170
The fox didn't eat!

672
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,940
Time's up!

673
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,090
What a pity...

674
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,300
You'll have to stick another punishment sticker.

675
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,940
How can it be? Low blood sugar?

676
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,460
Why didn't you say hypokalemia?

677
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,210
Wuren!

678
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,610
Because the fox is cunning!

679
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,130
Wuren, great job! Got it right again!

680
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,210
Cunning?

681
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,460
This question is so tricky!

682
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,780
See? Look at how they did it!

683
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,610
Listen carefully!

684
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,340
What cleans the floor the best?

685
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,130
Sorry I'm late.

686
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,690
There was a bit of traffic.

687
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,380
Dad!

688
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,260
Dad, why did you just get here?

689
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,130
I didn't get a single question right.

690
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,780
Look at all these stickers on my face.

691
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,940
Who put these on you?

692
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,940
Grandpa's face is also covered!

693
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,340
Have some water, Uncle.

694
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,740
Well, I'm Qiao Yang's colleague.

695
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,940
You said that last time.

696
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,740
What's your name?

697
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,130
My name's Lu Ziyou.

698
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,050
Why did you run away last time?

699
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,460
I...

700
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,170
Water...

701
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,420
Let me introduce him, this is my son.

702
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,940
Stop drinking, did you say hi?

703
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,460
Hi.

704
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,380
He said it before you came.

705
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,460
And her.

706
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,860
Hi.

707
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,740
It was you.

708
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,940
It was you who didn't let my dad come home.

709
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,300
I'm gonna tell my mom.

710
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,340
Don't talk nonsense.

711
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,090
I'm not talking nonsense.

712
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,740
That night, you were the one who answered the phone.

713
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,900
You are with her now?

714
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,820
Go away,

715
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,780
go play somewhere else.

716
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,690
It must be you.

717
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,090
I can recognize your voice.

718
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,740
Go now.

719
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,780
Qiao Yang,

720
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,210
what kind of mess is this?

721
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:03,860
No, Uncle...

722
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,260
Is this how you live your life?

723
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,940
It's not what you think, Uncle.

724
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,570
Actually, you can just shut up.

725
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,260
I think things are just getting worse and worse.

726
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,690
People in your line of work

727
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,340
always have crooked thoughts.

728
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,940
If you stay in this environment for too long,

729
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,570
you'll be corrupted sooner or later.

730
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,490
You're already in your thirties.

731
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:22,980
At your age...

732
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,940
Thirties?

733
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,170
Do you even remember how old I am exactly?

734
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,740
Do you know it's my birthday today?

735
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,300
I specially brought a...

736
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,940
Who ate my cake?

737
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,740
Calm down.

738
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,570
Sit.

739
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,940
Qiao Yang, why didn't you tell me

740
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,780
it was your birthday?

741
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,570
Seriously...

742
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,940
In the past ten years,

743
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,820
I've only gone home seven or eight times.

744
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,650
Every time we barely say a few words,

745
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,650
and we end up arguing.

746
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,940
Dad, I'm really exhausted.

747
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,260
Ten years, only seven or eight visits?

748
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,610
And you're tired from that?

749
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,780
You sound pretty proud of it.

750
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,570
Even Ji visits more often than you.

751
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,690
Don't mention that person again.

752
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,690
We're already divorced!

753
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,460
I'm an adult now.

754
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,940
Where I work and who I date...

755
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,610
Do I have to report everything to you?

756
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,170
Not everything in life has a right or wrong answer.

757
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,940
Can't we just find a different way to get along?

758
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,610
Can't we try to understand each other?

759
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,820
Respect each other's choices and freedom?

760
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,050
You call this freedom?

761
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,460
This is called degeneration.

762
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,210
Degeneration?

763
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,460
Jiao Ai

764
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,130
means a charming and lovely young girl.

765
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,210
It implies that every beauty seeker who leaves Jiao Ai

766
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,820
can be reborn.

767
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,170
Beauty, we decide.

768
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,170
Happiness, you decide.

769
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,090
Welcome to Jiao Ai.

770
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,530
Our goal

771
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,170
is to break the current business model.

772
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,650
We aim to provide the best value

773
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,860
for beauty seekers.

774
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,460
Jiao Ai aims to make cosmetic surgery accessible to everyone

775
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,530
and create a new era for cosmetic surgery.

776
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,940
Let's not talk about how well

777
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,380
this video is made.

778
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,130
Jiao Ai's momentum recently

779
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,260
has been really strong.

780
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,570
Let's discuss this.

781
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,460
Regarding Jiao Ai's current approach,

782
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,820
how should we respond?

783
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,340
They're located just two streets away from us.

784
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,090
This is clearly aimed at taking our market share.

785
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,090
With the current promotion,

786
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,610
I'm sure they will compete with us on price.

787
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,340
With such low prices,

788
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,650
all the profit will come from the materials

789
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,420
and the equipment used.

790
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,650
Who will suffer?

791
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,050
Isn't it the patients?

792
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,300
Will this last?

793
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,820
Ms. Zhou made a very valid point.

794
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,900
But we can't interfere with others' business.

795
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,380
We can only focus on ourselves.

796
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,300
If they keep

797
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,050
this price for six months, we won't be able to play this game.

798
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,900
They're doing low-end products,

799
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,170
we should focus on our brand.

800
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,820
We provide high-quality technology and services.

801
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,820
Right, we should all work together.

802
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,380
So, about the departmental merger we postponed before,

803
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,650
should we now push it forward on the agenda?

804
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,740
Don't look at me.

805
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,690
This is a big matter, I can't make the decision alone.

806
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,860
Let's hear everyone's opinion.

807
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,740
Everyone, please speak.

808
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:24,940
Then let me speak.

809
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,570
The department merger

810
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:29,090
involves the future development layout of our company.

811
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,300
We have one

812
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,690
bigger issue we haven't solved yet.

813
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,340
The hospital director position.

814
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,260
Since Du Jun left,

815
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,690
there's been a huge gap.

816
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,090
Although Mr. Chu is here,

817
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,940
he's only the honorary director.

818
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,130
This gap hasn't been filled.

819
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,130
Now we're facing internal and external issues.

820
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,940
Because we're lacking a central figure.

821
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,650
I think Jingwen makes a good point.

822
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,490
But didn't we already make a decision on this?

823
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,780
The only qualified candidates are these few senior directors.

824
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,490
Ms. Meng has no personal ambition,

825
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,300
her mind is full of her child.

826
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,050
So, she's not suitable.

827
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,380
Professionally, Ms. Qiao has been gaining a lot of attention recently,

828
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,460
but she just transferred from the Third Hospital.

829
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,740
Her performance is too far behind, so it might not be appropriate.

830
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,940
You've also made it clear before.

831
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,860
Given your relationship with Mr. Qin, you're not suitable for the director position.

832
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,420
So, that leaves only Dong.

833
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,380
He has a solid reputation professionally,

834
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,300
he's far ahead in performance,

835
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,130
and he's made the greatest contribution to our company.

836
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,740
His personal desire is also very strong.

837
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,010
There's nothing to discuss here.

838
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,130
Are these facts that she's analyzing?

839
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,130
Ms. Li understands doctors very well.

840
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,940
What she says is very comprehensive.

841
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,300
I personally agree.

842
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,650
So, if everyone agrees,

843
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,570
then it should be Dong...

844
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,460
I disagreed.

845
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,940
Based on your analysis,

846
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,490
the most important criteria for us right now

847
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,900
should be performance, right?

848
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,690
No.

849
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,260
I've emphasized it multiple times.

850
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,610
It's a comprehensive consideration.

851
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,170
Performance is, of course, the most...

852
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,260
I agree.

853
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,860
We should measure with performance.

854
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,460
I fully agree.

855
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,900
I also think it makes a lot of sense.

856
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,010
But you didn't focus on this earlier

857
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,420
make it a key point.

858
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,780
How about this: Let's set a time

859
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,340
and have the directors

860
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,860
speak with their performance.

861
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,460
We'll hold an open election for the director.

862
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,460
First,

863
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,460
this will increase our business volume.

864
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,610
Second, it will help us find the right candidate.

865
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,900
And third, it'll allow us to compete with Jiao Ai.

866
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,420
This way, we achieve three things at once.

867
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,260
Isn't it great?

868
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,780
I have no problem with that.

869
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,860
Then it depends on the other directors'

870
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,690
personal desires.

871
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,260
I have a very strong personal desire.

872
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,900
I'll sign up first

873
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,530
for the open election.
