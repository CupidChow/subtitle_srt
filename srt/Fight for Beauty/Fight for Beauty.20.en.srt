1
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,290
Meeting in Room 3.

2
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,330
I got meeting tomorrow morning.

3
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,410
You got the message?

4
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,100
Mine at 10:10.

5
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,020
Barely any bonus,

6
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,260
but plenty of hassle.

7
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,330
Meeting?

8
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,130
Did you receive the message?

9
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,330
Ding Manheng's mom is suffocating.

10
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,100
I should record her and post it online.

11
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,220
It would go viral.

12
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,060
Parents like her

13
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,410
treat their kids like property.

14
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,540
Zero respect for their children's choices.

15
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,780
Way too common.

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,890
An illness isn't just one person's problem.

17
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,450
It's a family problem.

18
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,980
The patient is the one who's sick.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,410
Yet she has no say

20
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,940
in her own treatment.

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,890
I think for this area

22
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,660
a W-shaped revision would be better.

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,690
Space the stitches wider.

24
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,100
Jia, get a thicker thread.

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,380
Here, Ms. Qiao.

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,570
Well done.

27
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,060
You can read minds now?

28
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,500
Better cherish this, Ms. Qiao.

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,890
I'm about to starve.

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,660
No idea how much longer I'll last.

31
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,290
Your bonuses got cut too?

32
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,780
They said it's a tough time,

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,170
so half the bonus is paid upfront.

34
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,100
Not sure

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,940
if we'll ever see the other half.

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,340
Might even get a pay cut.

37
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,660
That happened at my last hospital.

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,260
A few months later, it shut down.

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,290
Wait, this situation...

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,610
That bad?

41
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,540
Of course.

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,170
Ms. Qiao,

43
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,690
you ever check your salary?

44
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,820
Please,

45
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,540
don't bring that mood to work.

46
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,660
I'm innocent.

47
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,690
Handsome,

48
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,690
they're all in a bad mood right now.

49
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,850
Don't make it worse.

50
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,450
Right.

51
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,940
Wang Qian,

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,410
where are you?

53
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,500
Where did you put

54
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,410
the files I asked for yesterday?

55
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,850
Seriously?

56
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,660
Stop complaining.

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,820
They're busy with Ji Jie's matters.

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,570
Barely have time to breathe.

59
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,170
No wonder

60
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,730
he's been half-asleep all day.

61
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,450
Why don't you get a bigger tank for

62
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,540
this little black fish?

63
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,980
It has a tank.

64
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,500
Fish have rights too, you know.

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,570
With a tank this small,

66
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,450
it'll be very boring in it.

67
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,890
It has water and food.

68
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,170
It's happy in it.

69
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,850
Let me ask you something.

70
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,130
Do you check your salary?

71
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,780
Yeah.

72
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,380
The performance bonus changes every month.

73
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,220
Really?

74
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,010
I thought you just spent everything.

75
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,130
Never looked at your salary.

76
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,130
Come on, I have to raise a child.

77
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,220
Let me check mine.

78
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,980
Let me see.

79
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,820
That much?

80
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,340
Of course.

81
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,820
I was planning to treat you

82
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,130
after getting paid.

83
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,340
Now I feel like

84
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,570
I'm an idiot.

85
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,130
How about you buy me a meal?

86
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,820
I know a new BBQ place.

87
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,980
Alright. Tonight then.

88
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,380
Let's bring Wang Qian and Wei Xiaoxi too.

89
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,570
Give you poor young folks a little comfort.

90
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,340
You look thinner lately.

91
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,980
How could I not?

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,660
I'm doing the work of two people,

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,170
covering for Chen Mingjie as well.

94
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,580
Eat more.

95
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,490
Gluteal flaps have two tricky parts.

96
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,490
First, the sciatic nerve.

97
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,700
You got that right.

98
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,170
But you completely missed the second:

99
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,490
Vascular pedicle torsion.

100
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,780
That's because the posterior skin branches of the

101
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,490
inferior gluteal artery are generally shorter,

102
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,220
so I should use a longer segment to separate the artery and vein?

103
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,460
Exactly.

104
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,850
You get a reward. A piece of gluteus maximus.

105
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,020
That's sirloin.

106
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,460
More like external oblique.

107
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,540
Same texture.

108
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,900
Not even close.

109
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,700
Glutes are big muscles.

110
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,050
Obliques are small ones.

111
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,410
Different mobility.

112
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,660
No way they feel the same.

113
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,340
Fair point.

114
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,020
What fair point?

115
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,170
That's enough.

116
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,850
Any more and we'll be back in the OR.

117
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:01,980
Cheers.

118
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,250
Ms. Qiao,

119
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,780
There's something

120
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,050
I've always wanted to ask.

121
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,100
Go ahead.

122
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,250
Why did you leave the Third Hospital?

123
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,050
A lot of people have asked me that.

124
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,170
I give a different answer every time.

125
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,610
Which one do you want?

126
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,490
The real one.

127
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,100
Impulse.

128
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,050
That's a bit of a cop-out.

129
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,780
Don't underestimate impulse.

130
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,850
So much of human civilization

131
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,370
was driven by it.

132
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,250
Impulse is instinct.

133
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,140
It's intuition.

134
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,930
If you trust your gut

135
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,660
when making a decision,

136
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,980
you probably won't regret it.

137
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,140
Right?

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,730
Got it?

139
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:52,930
Yeah.

140
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,220
So impulse is a devil.

141
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,220
And an angel.

142
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,930
A toast!

143
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,460
Chinese New Year's almost here.

144
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,100
Wait.

145
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,900
Give me a chance

146
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,460
to toast Ms. Qiao.

147
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,540
Now you're being thoughtful.

148
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,340
To you! Bottoms up.

149
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,700
Can she hold her liquor?

150
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,100
What's going on?

151
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,250
Does she have surgery tomorrow?

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,220
Good.

153
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,020
Ms. Qiao,

154
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,980
I've always known you care about me.

155
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,050
I know it in my heart.

156
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,250
Even recently,

157
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,250
we've all been short on clients.

158
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,460
You let me join Ding Manheng's surgery.

159
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,540
On one hand,

160
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,460
you want to give me more practice.

161
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,250
More experience.

162
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,100
I know

163
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,700
you also wanted me to earn more.

164
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,660
Alright, let's not get too sentimental.

165
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,340
Training you

166
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,980
is good for me too.

167
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,700
If you mess up, I'll be the one in trouble.

168
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,540
If you get good at this,

169
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,170
my surgeries get easier as well.

170
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,490
Now eat up.

171
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,140
Ms. Qiao is all tough talk but soft-hearted.

172
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,780
She just wants the best for me.

173
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,580
That's right.

174
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,290
All surgeons know

175
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,250
a real mentor

176
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,490
is harsh, short-tempered,

177
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,170
and sets high standards.

178
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,930
That's just how it is.

179
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,140
The important thing is they're willing to teach,

180
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,050
to guide you,

181
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,410
to give you the chance to do surgeries.

182
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,050
Exactly.

183
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,410
That's what a real mentor does.

184
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,730
Ms. Qiao.

185
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,290
Recently,

186
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,780
I had a bad attitude,

187
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,810
and said some harsh things

188
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,930
to you.

189
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,980
I hope you don't take it to heart

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,050
I mean it.

191
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,610
Ms. Qiao,

192
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,730
I remember everything

193
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,410
you've done for me.

194
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,780
A toast to you.

195
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,050
So sincere?

196
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,340
Drink on your knees then.

197
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,540
Alright.

198
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,490
Come one, sit down.

199
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,460
What are you doing?

200
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,980
Alright, bring the drinks.

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,980
Wang Qian, drink it.

202
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,660
I'll remember

203
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,730
what you said today.

204
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,370
Calling me mean and grumpy.

205
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,060
Fine, rewrite the plan

206
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,580
tonight.

207
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,490
Make sure it's on my desk

208
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,060
by 8 AM tomorrow.

209
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,940
Now eat up.

210
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,220
Get energized.

211
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,420
Next, about equity.

212
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,130
Gemu Hospital was co-founded

213
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,370
by Mr. Qin Gui and Ms. Zhou Jingwen

214
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,530
during their marriage, along with other partners.

215
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,490
So the shares they jointly own

216
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,130
are considered marital property.

217
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,730
Ms. Zhou has the right to an equal split.

218
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,610
Mr. Qin fully acknowledges

219
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,530
Ms. Zhou's contributions

220
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,180
to Gemu Hospital.

221
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,940
So he's willing to compensate her

222
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,980
with cash equal to half his shares

223
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,890
as a divorce settlement.

224
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,650
No.

225
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,130
I discussed this with my wife.

226
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,580
We'll go with Ms. Zhou's proposal.

227
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,820
Mr. Qin, think carefully.

228
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,220
Giving up shares could destabilize the company.

229
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,300
And the other shareholders...

230
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,010
It's fine, I'll talk to Mr. Tang.

231
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,460
No worries.

232
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,060
It's okay.

233
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,130
Mr. Qin,

234
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,850
I understand your feelings for your wife,

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,220
but as your lawyer

236
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,820
I must warn you,

237
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,490
splitting shares is risky for the company.

238
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,890
I strongly advise against it.

239
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,010
You're right.

240
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,650
To minimize risk,

241
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,890
I have a new plan,

242
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,980
which is the opposite of what you just proposed.

243
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,490
I'm willing to offer half of my shares in cash

244
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,650
as Mr. Qin's divorce compensation.

245
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,010
But all the shares must be mine.

246
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,700
Is that okay?

247
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,300
You want all the shares?

248
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,580
What's your take on this?

249
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,490
Wasn't this what you wanted at the start?

250
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,220
Back then,

251
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,890
I was thinking about the situation at Gemu.

252
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,770
I'm also thinking about Gemu.

253
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,300
Didn't you say

254
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,220
you would follow my lead on everything?

255
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,700
Then what am I in Gemu?

256
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,980
Welcome to my world.

257
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,340
Cold? Let's go.

258
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,850
Why the rush?

259
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,340
Is Dadan home alone?

260
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,420
I'm not in a hurry.

261
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,730
Dadan's with the nanny.

262
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,220
Then let's stay a bit longer.

263
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,100
Alright.

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,700
What are your plans for the Chinese New Year?

265
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,340
Surgeries, of course.

266
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,730
I've scheduled surgeries on the 2nd, 4th, and 5th.

267
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,980
I've noticed these patients

268
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,300
are very smart.

269
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,460
They really know how to use the holiday as recovery period

270
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,530
for major surgeries.

271
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,700
How many surgeries do you have?

272
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,730
None.

273
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,420
I never schedule surgeries during holidays.

274
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,100
They get time off, so do I.

275
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,610
Won't your female patients be disappointed?

276
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,370
I plan to take Dadan diving.

277
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,340
Want to join us?

278
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,300
I'm not going.

279
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,220
There are people everywhere during the holiday.

280
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,100
Diving, huh?

281
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,730
Underwater? Who's there?

282
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,940
Well, it's true.

283
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,100
Why is your hand so cold?

284
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,340
Put it in my pocket.

285
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,530
Well your pockets...

286
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,220
How do you fit everything in there?

287
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,770
What's all this stuff?

288
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,890
A pen.

289
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,610
Why a pen?

290
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,300
Wait, wait, wait.

291
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,530
And I also found…

292
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,650
Why's there a book?

293
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,890
A dictionary.

294
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,530
You're like Doraemon.

295
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,340
I've noticed you guys' pockets

296
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,580
are bottomless.

297
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,610
We girls can't fit anything in ours.

298
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,530
It's the same in our industry,

299
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,340
we benefit from the pink tax.

300
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,220
When's the last time you saw

301
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,980
a male image

302
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,340
on a cosmetic surgery ad?

303
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,100
Most people who come for plastic surgery are women.

304
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,100
There are some men too.

305
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,340
But they're few.

306
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,100
Have you noticed that

307
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,850
actually most of the girls who come for surgery

308
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,980
are pretty normal, and quite good-looking.

309
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,700
As for the men who are with them,

310
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,610
I think many of them could use some improvement.

311
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,100
But they're all confident.

312
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,060
Not like these girls

313
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,980
who keep nitpicking their own looks.

314
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,010
I used to be confident,

315
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,850
but after you said that,

316
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,530
I'm feeling a bit

317
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,250
self-conscious now.

318
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,730
Come here, let me take a look.

319
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,300
This face of yours

320
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,650
is exactly what we plastic surgeons hate the most.

321
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,250
Why?

322
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,010
There's no room for improvement.

323
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,300
Too perfect.

324
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,060
How about this?

325
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,650
I'll talk to Zhou Jingwen about this.

326
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,180
We'll use your image for Gemu's ads.

327
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,060
Say you're our most successful and

328
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,460
natural case.

329
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,100
A great way to show off our skills.

330
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,460
This looks like a fake ad.

331
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,370
I think it looks just like a natural face.

332
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,820
Really?

333
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,940
I'll check it out.

334
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,610
Let me see if you've had any injections in your lips.

335
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,650
Have I?

336
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,890
What about your nose?

337
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,730
You can talk about everything,

338
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,700
big or small, about this hospital.

339
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,850
Say whatever's on your mind.

340
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,980
Then I'll speak.

341
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,060
Mr. Dong.

342
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,340
Sir.

343
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,250
Why did my salary decrease as soon as you became the director?

344
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,820
What do you mean by that?

345
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,730
What are you saying?

346
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,890
Be honest,

347
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,530
is it a twisted view of humanity

348
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,180
or a loss of morals?

349
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,730
You know that annual leave was cut in half.

350
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,850
The vacation time was reduced,

351
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,730
but work hours increased.

352
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,850
I've taken on so much more work.

353
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,460
You should be more specific.

354
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,700
Well, let me start with our toilet paper.

355
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,370
Toilet paper?

356
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,220
Go ahead.

357
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,370
It's happened several times.

358
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,580
After my surgeries, I went to the restroom,

359
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,770
and I found...

360
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,850
There's no paper.

361
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,100
Our budget for reception is too low.

362
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,300
No more black tea, no juice.

363
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,100
Evian's been replaced with tap water.

364
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,730
Now, I feel embarrassed handing guests

365
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,610
those little paper cups.

366
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,770
You're using paper cups for guests?

367
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,300
That's a problem.

368
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,890
Use glass cups from now on.

369
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,010
We need to reduce disposable consumption.

370
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,850
I don't really have much to say.

371
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,940
But I read an article this morning.

372
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,460
I want to share it with you.

373
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,770
"Signs a company is going downhill."

374
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,420
"Strict attendance, start cutting costs."

375
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,300
"Bonuses delayed, benefits cut."

376
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,820
"Next comes…"

377
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,980
"Loss of key staff."

378
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,460
"Internal gossip."

379
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,220
Lu,

380
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,420
you want a megaphone?

381
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,490
You can read it out for everyone.

382
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,730
Hamlet?

383
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,420
You know it?

384
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,890
Classic lines.

385
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,130
Ms. Meng's daughter starred in it.

386
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,650
Really? She's quite the lead.

387
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,100
Made with money.

388
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,180
You have to sign up for classes now.

389
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,300
The more classes you take,

390
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,700
the more important the roles you'll get.

391
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,650
For this role,

392
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,370
it costs

393
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,060
10,000.

394
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,650
Such a good look.

395
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,250
If she likes it, it's worth the money.

396
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,420
She doesn't.

397
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,460
She negotiates every time we go.

398
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,010
I'm almost a negotiation expert now.

399
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,770
Then why do you ask her to go?

400
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,530
For the certificates.

401
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,770
If you don't have kids, you wouldn't know.

402
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,340
School admission depends on these certificates.

403
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,980
Why is it so cold in here?

404
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,730
Didn't you notice the heater's down?

405
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,530
Now everyone's wearing more clothes.

406
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,420
Oh my.

407
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,650
This nonsense keeps happening everyday.

408
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,530
Ridiculous.

409
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,420
I brought this up today.

410
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,650
They brushed me off.

411
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,220
What did you bring up?

412
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,580
Nothing.

413
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,490
I went in for a minute and left.

414
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,340
Listen,

415
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,180
don't expect empathy from capitalists.

416
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,460
The card we hold

417
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,370
is mutual choice, got it?

418
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,180
Ms. Meng,

419
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,420
sounds like you've got some plans?

420
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,460
It's so cold in here.

421
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,940
What plans could I have?

422
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,060
Wherever I go, I'm still doing surgeries.

423
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,420
Ms. Zhou.

424
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,180
Ms. Li.

425
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,580
You can come clean later.

426
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,770
I have a headache now.

427
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,100
Ms. Zhou,

428
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,100
I'm here for you.

429
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,180
You have complaints about the hospital too?

430
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,730
No, Ms. Zhou,

431
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,940
I want surgery.

432
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,420
You want jaw angle surgery?

433
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,820
How old are you?

434
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,820
I'll be 58 after the Chinese New Year.

435
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,130
Don't get used to seeing things at the hospital

436
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,820
and think surgery is no big deal.

437
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,770
This jaw angle surgery is a big deal.

438
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,100
You need to think carefully.

439
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,730
Talk to your family about it.

440
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,980
I'm tired today.

441
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,490
Come back another day.

442
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,090
I'll do a proper consultation then.

443
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,380
Okay.

444
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,620
Ms. Zhou,

445
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,220
if you have a headache,

446
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,010
just do this often.

447
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,460
Okay.

448
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,220
Ms. Zhou, are you ok?

449
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,180
I'm fine.

450
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,380
You're practicing your neck?

451
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,250
Looks like you're getting good at it.

452
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,810
Got time for a quick chat?

453
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,010
If I say I'm busy, would you stop?

454
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,050
Go ahead, what's up?

455
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,620
The hospital's cost-cutting policy

456
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,700
isn't working.

457
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,860
Those small administrative moves you're making,

458
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,940
people grumble,

459
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,700
but they'll deal with it.

460
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,290
But cutting bonuses?

461
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,660
That's crossing the line.

462
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,490
I just said I'd delay the payout,

463
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,050
not that I wouldn't pay.

464
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,980
You and I are fine,

465
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,180
but many people live off those bonuses.

466
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,250
Their base salary is low.

467
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,180
After rent, it's gone.

468
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,770
If you take away their bonuses,

469
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,940
how can they survive?

470
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,940
How will they willingly stay

471
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,900
in Gemu?

472
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,700
Why wouldn't they be willing?

473
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,700
Don't you know what's going on at the hospital?

474
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,090
Li Qi took a bunch of people.

475
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,460
Suppliers are hounding me

476
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,530
for payments.

477
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,330
We're running a hospital,

478
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,530
not a charity.

479
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,050
My goal is not to make everyone happy,

480
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,140
but to keep Gemu running.

481
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,220
It's about keeping Gemu alive.

482
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,460
Are you short of breath?

483
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,010
Sit down and rest.

484
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,860
So annoying.

485
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,090
Look at what I've got this morning.

486
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,220
Feels like a rant session.

487
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,530
Oh my, there are several!

488
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,490
The snacks aren't varied enough.

489
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,380
Guests don't want to sit long.

490
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,180
Makes sense.

491
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,420
See that?

492
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,530
The ones actually complaining

493
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,530
don't have much in their mind.

494
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,140
But the ones who say they have no opinion

495
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,810
do you know what they're really thinking?

496
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,460
Ms. Meng,

497
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,660
can you send me the address of the ping pong hall?

498
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,290
Thank you!

499
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,420
Dai.

500
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,140
Ms. Zhou.

501
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,380
My 11 AM client tomorrow,

502
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,220
she's not coming.

503
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,980
Check on Zhou Yali for me.

504
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,420
I forgot her date.

505
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,220
Move her up.

506
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,770
Ok.

507
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,980
Yes, I'm Ding Manheng's parent.

508
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,860
Who's this?

509
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,290
Oh, Manheng' teacher!

510
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,530
Hello.

511
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,050
What? She skipped the exam?

512
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,620
How's that possible?

513
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,490
I really didn't know.

514
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,620
She's supposed to graduate this year.

515
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,420
So what happens to her diploma?

516
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,250
Please have a look.

517
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,380
Okay, thanks.

518
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,660
I'll talk to her.

519
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,770
Thank you.

520
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,660
Found it?

521
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,420
Almost.

522
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,620
Got it, Ms. Zhou.

523
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,530
This one?

524
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,490
Yeah, move her up.

525
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,050
Okay.

526
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,250
Why are the curtains closed in the middle of the day?

527
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,490
Too bright.

528
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,620
I made plans with Mr. Sun.

529
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,940
We'll have dinner after you're discharged.

530
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,290
After four months, when you've recovered,

531
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,940
you'll start an internship in his department.

532
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,940
Let's wait till I graduate.

533
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,290
Next semester's gonna be busy.

534
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,140
Okay.

535
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,330
You need to finish your thesis.

536
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,420
How's that going?

537
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,490
Working on it.

538
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,620
Also,

539
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,530
how'd your finals go?

540
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,380
They just ended.

541
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,050
Grades aren't out yet.

542
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,660
What's wrong?

543
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,250
Mom?

544
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,770
How long were you planning to lie to me?

545
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,810
Your teacher

546
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,250
already called me.

547
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,460
What did he say?

548
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,220
I always thought you were an honest kid.

549
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,380
Do you know what skipping your exam means?

550
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,980
No diploma.

551
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,810
You'll be considered a dropout.

552
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,770
With that, we can't hire you at my company.

553
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,420
Even Mr. Sun wouldn't be able to help.

554
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,180
Do you get that?

555
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,250
I didn't mean to.

556
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,050
Then why?

557
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,250
I don't wanna talk to you.

558
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,220
You weren't like this before.

559
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,660
You used to tell me everything

560
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,700
and discuss with me.

561
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,770
What, you sick now?

562
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,900
And you changed

563
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,620
like a whole different person?

564
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,980
How many times have I told you?

565
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,900
Don't be scared.

566
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,460
Don't let illness beat you.

567
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,620
Once the surgery's done,

568
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,660
you'll be just like everyone else.

569
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,700
Everything will go back to normal.

570
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,770
What's not normal about me?

571
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,290
Mom, tell me, what is normal?

572
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,700
A stable job,

573
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,700
dating, marriage, kids.

574
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,530
That's how normal people live.

575
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,290
And a girl should have a complete body.

576
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,290
Look at yourself now.

577
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,660
Is this normal?

578
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,900
So if I lose it, I'm not me anymore?

579
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,250
That thing defines who I am?

580
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,770
Where are you going?

581
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,770
Bathroom.

582
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,010
Not many kids play ping-pong

583
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,050
these days.

584
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,180
It's part of the deal for piano class.

585
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,290
Piano has conditions now?

586
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,770
Her conditions.

587
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,530
She learns one thing,

588
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,420
and I'll have to agree to something else.

589
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,730
Well, hobbies are good.

590
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,700
I did talked to Li Qi.

591
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,220
Ms. Li.

592
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,090
That was a lot

593
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,620
to take in today.

594
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,140
I need to process it.

595
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,010
Let me think about it.

596
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,660
Ok.

597
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,730
Time's up, I gotta go.

598
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,810
I'm going to pick up my daughter.

599
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,050
She has a piano class today.

600
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,290
But I'll finish out this month.

601
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,490
Honestly, I thought of everyone,

602
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,490
except you.

603
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,700
Can you tell me why?

604
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,010
Li Qi told me,

605
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,140
doctors are like athletes.

606
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,090
Without talent, no matter how hard you work,

607
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,620
you'll never be a champion.

608
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,090
And if you've got talent and work hard

609
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,090
but don't have a good coach

610
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,050
or a solid team,

611
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,090
it's all wasted.

612
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,570
Makes sense, right?

613
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,220
I do think so.

614
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,380
Of course, that's true.

615
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,220
And good doctors need a good platform.

616
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,860
I think

617
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,940
at Gemu,

618
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,810
we give good doctors a solid platform.

619
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,250
Look at private hospitals out there,

620
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,090
doctors barely have a say.

621
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,940
Right?

622
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,460
Only Gemu does.

623
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,530
Everyone loves an ideal, right?

624
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,380
Ms. Zhou,

625
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,730
let me get real with you.

626
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,700
My husband just got laid off.

627
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,700
The buffer period ends this weekend.

628
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,660
For someone like him, coming from a big company,

629
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,220
old and with a high position,

630
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,940
if he wants to start a business, he has no resources,

631
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,250
and if he wants to find another job,

632
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,290
there probably aren't many good opportunities.

633
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,940
So for me,

634
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,900
talking about ideals is pointless.

635
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,810
I made this choice simply.

636
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,380
Where the money is, that's where I go.

637
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,570
I totally get it.

638
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,140
I know things are tough at Gemu right now,

639
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,330
but next month…

640
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,810
Next month? Ms. Zhou,

641
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,380
I can't think that far ahead.

642
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,530
After the Chinese New Year, it's the new semester.

643
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,730
All my daughter's classes need to be paid for.

644
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,770
And it's at least six months upfront.

645
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,940
I've got a mortgage too.

646
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,250
Chu Ning.

647
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,220
It's time, Chu Ning.

648
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,900
Hurry, you've got piano class.

649
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,380
Just played for half an hour.

650
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,140
No time to waste.

651
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,220
Last time, we were stuck in traffic for half an hour.

652
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,900
Hurry up.

653
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:50,860
Sir,

654
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,810
we'll make another appointment.

655
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,900
Sure.

656
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,250
I'm sorry,

657
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,050
-Ms. Zhou. -It's fine.

658
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,530
It's always like this.

659
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,810
We agree, then you back out.

660
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,050
Don't blame me if I can't practice piano hard.

661
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,700
Enough with the talk.

662
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,250
We're paying for it.

663
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,490
Hurry, wipe your sweat.

664
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,010
We're leaving, Ms. Zhou.

665
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,900
See you.

666
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,860
Hurry up.

667
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,220
Say goodbye to Ms.Zhou.

668
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,010
Goodbye.

669
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,010
Bye.

670
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,810
Dr. Meng,

671
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,050
see you at the hospital tomorrow.

672
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,570
What happened here?

673
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,980
How did she disappear?

674
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,860
She wasn't there when we took her blood pressure.

675
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,900
I've looked everywhere.

676
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,980
Upstairs, downstairs.

677
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,050
Checked all corners.

678
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,700
Nothing.

679
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,940
Ms. Qiao, you're here.

680
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,730
What's going on?

681
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,180
Your daughter is missing.

682
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,220
That's impossible.

683
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,010
She's probably in the bathroom.

684
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,700
She's always like this.

685
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,010
Whenever she gets nervous, she runs to the bathroom.

686
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,660
I looked, she's not there.

687
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,860
Let's call her.

688
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,380
Her clothes are still here. She didn't go far.

689
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,490
She didn't take her phone.

690
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,530
So for me,

691
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,460
talking about ideals is pointless.

692
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,290
I made this choice simply.

693
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,620
Where the money is, that's where I go.

694
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,810
Ding Manheng.

695
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,490
You know me?

696
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,140
I not only know your name,

697
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,380
but I also know you didn't finish this semester.

698
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,770
You didn't get your degree.

699
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,900
And you argued with your mom, right?

700
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,660
And you know my mom?

701
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,090
Found her.

702
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,900
She's here.

703
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,050
When was this?

704
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,770
This was half an hour ago.

705
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,730
It's so late, where could she have gone?

706
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,620
Don't worry.

707
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,250
She didn't bring her phone, she can't have gone far.

708
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,380
Let's split up and look for her, we'll catch up.

709
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,250
Hello?

710
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,940
Can you play it again?

711
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,460
Okay, I got it.

712
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,660
Manheng's found.

713
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,530
She's downstairs

714
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,900
with one of our colleagues.

715
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,620
This is unacceptable!

716
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,860
I'll teach her a lesson.

717
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,940
She doesn't want to see you.

718
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,290
You're the doctor who gave me the surgery plan,

719
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,010
but didn't show up, right?

720
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,770
Are you still cold?

721
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,570
Not cold.

722
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,620
Just a bit hungry.

723
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,530
Got anything to eat?

724
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,380
You have surgery tomorrow.

725
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,380
You can't eat or drink for eight hours before.

726
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,290
No food for you.

727
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,010
What did she say?

728
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,180
She said she's hungry.

729
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,330
Talk to her.

730
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,940
I'll go calm her mom down.

731
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,980
Okay.

732
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,900
Guess I owe you one.

733
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,980
Here.

734
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,810
Aren't I not supposed to eat before surgery?

735
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,290
You said you didn't want the surgery, right?

736
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,570
Next time you run away, at least bring your phone.

737
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,220
And wear a couple more clothes.

738
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,730
Look at you, got caught and dragged back like this.

739
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,730
So embarrassing.

740
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,330
Tell me,

741
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,570
what are you really thinking?

742
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,570
I didn't mean to skip the exam.

743
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,090
But that day

744
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,900
I had something really important.

745
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,530
I asked the teacher if I could reschedule the exam.

746
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,940
The teacher said the makeup exam would be next year.

747
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,330
What exam?

748
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,620
The final exam.

749
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,570
My mom already has everything planned for me.

750
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,700
She wants me to work at her company right after graduation.

751
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,250
Without the final exam,

752
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,770
I can't get my diploma.

753
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,700
I haven't figured out how to tell her yet,

754
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,660
but she already knows.

755
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,900
I got it now.

756
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,380
So your mom cooks you healthy meals every day,

757
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,140
but you actually love

758
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,010
McDonald's.

759
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,900
I know

760
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,140
it wasn't easy for her to raise me alone.

761
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,220
She worries so much about me,

762
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,490
and asks people for favors.

763
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,940
And actually, I haven't figured it out myself either.

764
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,770
I just know I don't like healthy meals.

765
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,090
But I don't even know if what I love is

766
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,530
McDonald's or something else.

767
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,010
So, what were you doing on exam day?

768
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,010
You know I like swimming.

769
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,180
There was a brand event

770
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,700
at our pool that day.

771
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,380
Someone kept staring at me.

772
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,090
You know, most people glance a couple times and move on.

773
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,250
But she just kept staring at me.

774
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,660
And even followed me to the locker room.

775
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,900
That's a creep.

776
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,730
Didn't you call the police?

777
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,380
No, she's a woman.

778
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,860
She said she was the brand manager.

779
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,010
And she wanted me to do a commercial.

780
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,570
Well, that sounds good.

781
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,050
So you went for the commercial that day?

782
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,770
Good.

783
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,460
I had breast cancer surgery last year.

784
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,460
You know, most people, when they go into surgery,

785
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,490
especially for cancer,

786
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,140
they think about

787
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,700
what regrets they have in life,

788
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,620
what they still want to do.

789
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,810
But when I was lying there,

790
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,730
my mind was completely blank.

791
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,660
I couldn't think of anything.

792
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,620
That person chased me to the locker room.

793
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,140
I had a lot of reasons in my mind

794
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,420
to refuse her.

795
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,530
Yet I ended up agreeing.

796
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,700
You know what Ms. Qiao,

797
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,490
on the day of the shoot,

798
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,010
there were so many people on set.

799
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,420
There were people for the lighting,

800
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,420
people for changing clothes,

801
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,860
even someone for ordering food.

802
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,090
I never thought that

803
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,090
shooting a ten-second commercial

804
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,770
would need so many people involved.

805
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,290
Since that day,

806
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,940
whenever I think about the future,

807
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,330
my mind has so many new possibilities.

808
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,810
But if you ask me what they are,

809
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,900
I can't really say.

810
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,140
But what I can say for sure is,

811
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,420
imperfections are also a kind of beauty.

812
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,180
You've really thought this through.

813
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,460
This surgery

814
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,940
isn't just about implants, prosthetics,

815
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,140
or autologous tissue.

816
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,570
You can also choose not to do it.

817
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,730
Dr. Qiao.

818
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,980
Hello.

819
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,010
Come.

820
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,730
Come.

821
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,250
Playing both dad and mom.

822
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,900
Maybe I'm not doing that great.

823
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,660
There are things I can't really understand.

824
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,900
Aren't you going in?

825
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,010
Dr. Qiao,

826
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,980
besides what you said,

827
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,330
maybe there's another choice.

828
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,940
Ding Manheng's illness was inherited from her mom.

829
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,610
We should have thought about that.

830
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:16,860
Yeah.

831
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,210
Her mom had it tough too.

832
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,820
She got sick in her 30s.

833
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,530
Her husband worked in Guangzhou,

834
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,050
and didn't come back when she called.

835
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,650
Two years later,

836
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,010
he came back just to talk about divorce.

837
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,420
Ding Manheng was still in elementary school back then.

838
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,820
Everyone at her workplace sympathized with her.

839
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,780
But she didn't want anyone's pity. She was strong.

840
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,380
That's why life was hard for her.

841
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,860
She feared her daughter getting the same illness.

842
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,820
But look, what she feared came true.

843
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,050
It really did.

844
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,900
Life is just so ruthless.

845
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,980
It doesn't stop just because you're afraid.

846
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,610
She wore a prosthesis for years,

847
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,610
never could bring herself to get surgery.

848
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,420
This generation of moms

849
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,860
really doesn't take care of themselves.

850
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,570
Really.

851
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,780
They're too shy to talk about beauty,

852
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,980
whlie they do care about it.

853
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,090
Just think about it.

854
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,420
Her prosthetics

855
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,170
was the biggest loss of her life.

856
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,530
If you ask me, the biggest function of a woman's chest

857
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,690
is to breastfeed.

858
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,210
Nothing else matters.

859
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,050
So whether there's a loss or not, who cares?

860
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,780
Well, seems it doesn't matter to you.

861
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,820
What's the commercial?

862
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,170
A photo?

863
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,170
These people just want

864
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,940
to use you as a gimmick.

865
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,010
They take no responsibility.

866
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,650
When people start talking,

867
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,860
you'll be the one they judge.

868
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,860
Give me the contact for the person in charge.

869
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,610
I'll call and get the photos back.

870
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,170
That was my idea.

871
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,490
What did you say?

872
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,170
I used to think if I'm sick, I'm sick.

873
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,570
If I get better, everything's fine.

874
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,460
But the people around me,

875
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,650
including you, mom,

876
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,570
think I'm not normal now.

877
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,780
And I need to hide it.

878
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,820
It's like losing a breast makes me ashamed to be seen.

879
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,650
Over time,

880
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,420
I started doubting myself.

881
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,340
But on the shoot day,

882
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,860
everyone was watching me.

883
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,610
If it was any other day,

884
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,460
I'd have put on a brave face.

885
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,010
But that day, I felt so comfortable.

886
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,340
I found that showing my imperfection is just fine.

887
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,820
With only one breast,

888
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,420
I can still feel I'm special,

889
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,380
I'm beautiful.

890
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,900
I know what you want to say.

891
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,460
But you know,

892
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,170
I've been through all of this.

893
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,050
I don't want my daughter

894
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,570
to go through all of it again.

895
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,610
I understand.

896
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,050
Mom.

897
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,650
Mom.

898
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,570
I understand.

899
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,650
So I think,

900
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,650
you should do this surgery,

901
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,170
because you care more than I do.

902
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,300
Mom,

903
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,900
even though our ideas about completeness

904
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,170
might be different,

905
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,420
it doesn't change the fact that

906
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,130
you have a beautiful daughter,

907
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,090
and I have a mom who's a little strict

908
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,820
but still very beautiful.

909
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,380
My daughter's the most beautiful.

910
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,650
The most beautiful!

911
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,090
Mom,

912
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,980
not only is your daughter beautiful

913
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,300
she's talented too.

914
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,570
When did you learn this?

915
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,170
I didn't even know.

916
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,300
Come on, beautiful lady.

917
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,530
Let's dance together.

918
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,780
Let's do it.

919
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,570
I can't.

920
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,260
Let's do the trendiest dance.

921
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,170
Come, I'll teach you.

922
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,420
-Right, left, right, right. -I can't.

923
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,420
Left, right, left, left

924
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,490
Ms. Zhou,

925
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,260
I gave you my first-ever

926
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,490
cosmetic procedure.

927
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,260
I'm so touched.

928
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,900
But just so you know,

929
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,490
I'm not giving you a discount.

930
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,460
A discount right away would be scary.

931
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,820
Those 299

932
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,940
or 399 procedures,

933
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,210
I wouldn't dare try them.

934
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,210
I think finding a cosmetic doctor

935
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,740
is kinda like dating.

936
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,980
Professional and legit, first priority.

937
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,380
Same aesthetic taste is also important.

938
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,650
It's best to take it slow.

939
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,740
Try some small procedures first.

940
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,260
That's why I'm here.

941
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,980
A neck wrinkle shot first.

942
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,460
Alright.

943
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,340
Try it out today,

944
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,650
then decide if you wanna

945
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,340
stick with me long-term.

946
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,340
Deal.

947
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,570
Chin up.

948
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,530
Here goes.

949
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,460
Hurts?

950
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,300
Not really.

951
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,380
You've got a high pain tolerance.

952
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,940
What's got you so happy?

953
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,820
Bonus day, of course!

954
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,490
Bonus?

955
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,170
Yeah.

956
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:10,690
Really!

957
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,980
Let me see yours.

958
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,460
Put up QR banners

959
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,740
at reception,

960
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,340
and at the lobby.

961
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,980
Check details in the group chat.

962
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,610
Ji Jie,

963
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,340
I need a word with Mr. Qin.

964
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:21,900
Ok.

965
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,490
Thank you.

966
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,940
Didn't I tell you?

967
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,980
Supplier payments come first.

968
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,260
Bonuses can wait a bit.

969
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,380
No one will lose a cent.

970
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,740
I need to talk to you too.

971
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,820
This comes first.

972
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,420
Jingwen, you're a doctor.

973
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,860
In terms of medicine and healthcare,

974
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,980
I respect your professional choices and judgment.

975
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,340
And I won't interfere.

976
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,690
But in management,

977
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,980
can you respect mine?

978
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,380
And stop interfering with me?

979
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,130
You seem a bit off today.

980
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,420
I remember an event two years ago.

981
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,820
I was meeting a business partner late.

982
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,650
We had a long meeting.

983
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,610
I walked him out when it was over.

984
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,260
At that spot,

985
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,820
I turned back

986
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,690
and saw this building

987
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,780
with every room still lit.

988
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,260
I know it was because everyone was here.

989
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,050
At that moment

990
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,210
I felt really warm.

991
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,650
Everyone's working overtime, and you feel warm?

992
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,980
Don't say stuff like that, it's kinda cold-blooded.

993
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,380
What I mean is

994
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,980
people are more important than anything.

995
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,650
That's why I gave out the bonuses first.

996
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,740
I'll handle the suppliers.

997
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,980
This is a hospital.

998
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,860
Doctors are the most valuable resource.

999
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,650
Even if I leave one day,

1000
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,900
Gemu will keep running.

1001
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,610
But if the doctors leave,

1002
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,780
it won't do.

1003
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,860
You're leaving?

1004
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,490
I've been thinking a lot the past couple days.

1005
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,490
I think you're right.

1006
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,340
Splitting the shares 50/50 isn't a good idea.

1007
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,860
If Gemu is our child,

1008
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,210
it needs you more than me.

1009
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,460
If we're divorced, the kid's yours.

1010
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,050
From now on,

1011
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,460
I'm just Gemu's senior employee.

1012
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,170
And you

1013
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,610
will no longer be the boss's wife.

1014
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,610
You'll be the boss.

1015
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,170
Come on.

1016
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,340
How come middle-aged men are so fragile?

1017
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,610
You think if I get the shares,

1018
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,900
I'll kick you out?

1019
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,380
Is that what you think of me?

1020
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,610
Then what else?

1021
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:49,980
Give me 5% as a memento?

1022
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,210
I'll give you 10%

1023
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,130
for your hard work here.

1024
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:54,980
How about that?

1025
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,090
I really agree with what you just said.

1026
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,940
I've been thinking a lot too.

1027
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,980
I want to renegotiate the contracts with the doctors.

1028
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,610
And raise their share percentage.

1029
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,300
In other words, the longer they've been here,

1030
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,900
the more they will get.

1031
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,210
Like Ms. Meng,

1032
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,610
they can get a higher share.

1033
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,490
Let's talk more about it in my office.

1034
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,610
Okay.

1035
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,940
Let's bring up this bonus plan

1036
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,940
to motivate the younger folks.

1037
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,940
And get Gemu more talent.
