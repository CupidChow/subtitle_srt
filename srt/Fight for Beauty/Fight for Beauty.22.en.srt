1
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,180
2.8 million?

2
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,850
Keep it down.

3
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,900
2.8 million,

4
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,820
all at once.

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,460
When am I going to earn 2.8 million?

6
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,980
How come Mr. Drop has so much money?

7
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,690
Mr. Drop?

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,100
He should be Mr. Money.

9
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,570
He's always been the top earner

10
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,900
in our hospital.

11
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,690
Now he's not just the director,

12
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,620
he's also a savior of the hospital.

13
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,460
Totally redeeming himself!

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,570
Well,

15
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,260
about the staff buy-in,

16
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,490
can we buy it?

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,380
Yeah.

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,570
Just have to sign the new contract with Ji Jie.

19
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,290
With what we've got,

20
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,340
we could only buy like 0.001% of a share.

21
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,380
Meaningless.

22
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,290
I still want to be a shareholder.

23
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,980
Even if it's a small share, it's still a share.

24
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,500
The contracts are all signed.

25
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,410
Everyone's signed.

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,940
Finally, I can have a good New Year.

27
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,660
Thanks for your hard work.

28
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,500
Holiday's almost here.

29
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,060
I think we can hold off on recruitment.

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,220
Let's do it after the holidays.

31
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,940
It's already been sent out.

32
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,780
The assistants keep complaining to me.

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,940
I can't delay it any longer.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,500
Okay.

35
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,450
Mingjie,

36
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,850
Has the patient for the eyebrow filler come?

37
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,780
The hyaluronic acid eyebrow filler patient.

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,410
Xu Yuan.

39
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,660
She's here.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,340
Pre-op photos taken.

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,540
Vision checked too.

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,540
Everything's by the procedure.

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,980
She agreed to be filmed.

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,340
Then,

45
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,780
I'll go prep.

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,690
What's wrong with him?

47
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,410
Looks like he hasn't woken up.

48
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,610
He's lost his soul.

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,570
He proposed to Wei Xiaoxi, she turned him down.

50
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,340
They broke up.

51
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,610
That tear mole of yours is pretty cute.

52
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,450
Do you feel uncomfortable?

53
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,780
I'm scared it'll hurt.

54
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,130
Please go easy on me.

55
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,940
Don't worry, I'll be super gentle.

56
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,780
Let's schedule the follow-up after the holiday.

57
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,380
If there are any issues, just let me know.

58
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,940
Anyone else?

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,380
No.

60
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,170
If you have errands to run, better hurry.

61
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,340
Traffic is a mess everywhere.

62
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,890
Ok.

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,290
You can go too.

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,570
I'm in no rush.

65
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,260
I'll tidy up a bit before I leave.

66
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,340
If you're sad, it's ok.

67
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,220
Don't hold it in.

68
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,140
We've all been there.

69
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,780
Traffic was bad?

70
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,050
Why is it clear now?

71
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,290
Almost off work?

72
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,220
All because you came late.

73
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,700
I thought I forgot the marriage certificate.

74
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,460
Went home to get it.

75
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,580
Then I realized you had it.

76
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,900
If they're off work

77
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,610
we'll come back next time.

78
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,460
Wanna grab something to eat?

79
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,580
We're already here, might as well take a look.

80
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,980
Hello.

81
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,370
We booked number 11 for the divorce process

82
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,580
11?

83
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,580
Why are you so late?

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,610
We've been calling you all afternoon.

85
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,100
Traffic,

86
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,540
I guess.

87
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,580
Well, too late now.

88
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,700
Our copier broke.

89
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,660
Come back next time.

90
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,610
Alright.

91
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,810
Next time then.

92
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,140
When's next time?

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,730
We're closed for the Chinese New Year.

94
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,370
Come back after the 7th.

95
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,930
So…

96
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,810
guess we'll come again after the Chinese New Year.

97
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,540
The copier's fixed.

98
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,250
I'm heading out.

99
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,700
Hey, number 11,

100
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,850
our copier's working now.

101
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,100
Are you still getting a divorce?

102
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,930
Qiao Yang, can you believe it that

103
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,250
Dad wore a floral shirt?

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,930
When I first bought it, he yelled at me.

105
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,250
Said it was way too flashy,

106
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,490
and swore he'd never wear it.

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,540
Now? He loves it more than anyone.

108
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,900
This chicken is amazing.

109
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,580
Where'd you buy it?

110
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,020
Send me the link.

111
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,220
I didn't buy it.

112
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,930
Our cleaner, Li Juan,

113
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,370
gave it to me.

114
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,610
The local specialties of their hometown.

115
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,220
Why didn't she give me any?

116
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,780
I didn't do anything to her.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,810
Not about that.

118
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,930
She thinks her face is too big,

119
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,050
and wants a jaw reduction.

120
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,850
Isn't she over fifty?

121
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,490
Way too late for that.

122
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,980
Yeah, no way.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,810
She loves looking good.

124
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,610
Had Mr. Dong remove her melasma.

125
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,490
I was wondering why I hadn't seen her.

126
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,780
Her son took her on a trip.

127
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,410
Saw it on her social media.

128
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,020
Look.

129
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,370
This is Ms. Wang?

130
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,660
Ms. Wang?

131
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,930
Ms. Li.

132
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,340
No wonder she doesn't bring you food.

133
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,930
That outfit's too sexy!

134
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,460
I barely recognized her.

135
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,050
She's really got life figured out.

136
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,610
People always say, "Live for yourself."

137
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,170
But most people don't know how.

138
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,460
They're lost without a guidebook.

139
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,490
Like you said.

140
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,340
Without instructions,

141
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,930
they don't know what to do.

142
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,290
You don't seem like that kind of person.

143
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,930
Not sure.

144
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,020
I was born 7.4 pounds.

145
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,700
Probably 7 pounds of rebellion.

146
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,420
Speaking of that...

147
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,980
Remember back in med school?

148
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,580
There was a patient.

149
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,580
Mr. Chu had already given instructions,

150
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,650
but you disagreed.

151
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,980
Said there was a better plan.

152
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,300
I don't remember the case.

153
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,850
But you kept arguing with Mr. Chu.

154
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,730
I still remember that scene.

155
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,980
It's stuck in my head.

156
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,100
That really happened?

157
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,250
You must've thought

158
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,980
I was so full of myself.

159
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,250
No.

160
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,420
I was jealous.

161
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,850
Not because you didn't care,

162
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,340
but because it never crossed your mind

163
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,340
what might happen

164
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,770
if you defied a senior doctor.

165
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,940
Or whether challenging authority

166
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,730
would get you in trouble.

167
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,530
You just did it.

168
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,180
Like you'd never been

169
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,700
put down before.

170
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,340
I don't remember that at all.

171
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,100
Was my plan even right?

172
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,890
Of course not.

173
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,650
Dr. Chu even had everyone

174
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,700
rehearse your surgical plan.

175
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,820
It was full of flaws, a complete mess.

176
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,650
So embarrassing.

177
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,730
Not at all.

178
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,370
You had no doubts.

179
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,250
Maybe that's your gift.

180
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,820
Maybe it's genetic.

181
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,730
Took after my mom.

182
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,700
Your mom?

183
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,940
I never told you?

184
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,820
When I was four or five,

185
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,580
my parents' marriage was already a mess.

186
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,130
Constant fighting.

187
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,530
I was terrified.

188
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,700
It always ended with my dad storming out.

189
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,370
Guess what my mom would do?

190
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,250
What?

191
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,220
Play piano.

192
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,890
Play piano?

193
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,650
Bet you didn't see that coming.

194
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,610
You play piano?

195
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,610
Doctors can't be artistic?

196
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,650
Fair point.

197
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,060
I really admire my mom.

198
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,100
No matter how it started,

199
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,980
whether she was crying or furious,

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,700
by the end, we'd always be laughing.

201
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,370
So I figured,

202
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,730
everyone needs to find

203
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,250
their own piano in life.

204
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,460
No matter what happens,

205
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,850
if you can just sit down and focus on playing,

206
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,220
nothing seems like a big deal anymore.

207
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,820
So,

208
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,610
medicine is your piano?

209
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,980
Guess so.

210
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,490
Nice.

211
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,010
What about yours?

212
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,340
Gemu?

213
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,770
Me?

214
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,730
You have no idea

215
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,730
I almost lost Gemu.

216
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,340
Why?

217
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,890
Back in 2017,

218
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,940
I was in Munich.

219
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,010
Got my specialist certification.

220
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,770
I could've stayed there.

221
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,100
I was all set to open my own clinic.

222
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,300
Even found a nice spot.

223
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,300
Really beautiful.

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,420
There's a window view

225
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,770
of the Isar River.

226
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,940
But right before signing the contract,

227
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,250
I just couldn't sleep.

228
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,650
So I told Qin, “Let's go back home.”

229
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,730
This industry was so new,

230
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,890
so underdeveloped.

231
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,770
If I stayed, I'd just be another specialist.

232
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,460
But back here,

233
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,250
there's so much more to do.

234
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,700
Like now.

235
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,250
Running into you again.

236
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,010
Fate.

237
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,250
To fate.

238
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,650
Guess who sent me

239
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,820
the first New Year's greeting?

240
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,250
Who?

241
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,940
Cheng Dabao.

242
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,820
The one who had a breast reduction?

243
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,610
How's he doing?

244
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,300
Got a job.

245
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,850
He's learning construction supervision

246
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,370
from a senior.

247
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,100
And Hao Xin,

248
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,820
she started

249
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,610
a dance studio

250
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,610
with her friend.

251
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,850
Business is booming.

252
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,890
Sounds good.

253
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,100
What about your patient, that genius student?

254
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,180
Liu Miao?

255
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,580
Well,

256
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,460
did you notice

257
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,850
our clinic app has been updated?

258
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,420
Hard to miss.

259
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,100
The old version was practically useless.

260
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,490
Nothing was accurate.

261
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,180
She fixed it?

262
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:35,890
Yeah.

263
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,180
She just casually optimized it.

264
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,460
Impressive, right?

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,180
She's only a freshman.

266
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,100
Then I asked her

267
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,420
if she could turn our website

268
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,980
into a Lantern Festival gift.

269
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,890
She just sent me her

270
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,650
Alipay account.

271
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,820
Unbelievable…

272
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,940
See that?

273
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,370
You're not the only one taking advantage.

274
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,130
Looking at it now...

275
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,610
Every New Year,

276
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,180
getting these messages from patients

277
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,770
is really heartwarming.

278
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,820
Here you go again,

279
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,770
getting all sentimental.

280
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,940
Remember Taozi?

281
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,060
Yeah, of course.

282
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,850
She just got married to Ding Zhike.

283
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,820
Well, I just

284
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,010
got divorced.

285
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,610
Did you cry?

286
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,460
Nope.

287
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,730
We had a good talk.

288
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,220
I cried my eyes out.

289
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,850
Not like you.

290
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,490
So many fireworks.

291
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,460
Smog alert for tomorrow.

292
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,220
But so beautiful.

293
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,700
Like a galaxy.

294
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,460
We're so small.

295
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,060
Guys, listen to this.

296
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,700
At first, I was like you.

297
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,890
I thought Gemu was a good hospital.

298
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,770
I thought a hyaluronic acid injection was nothing.

299
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,730
But right after they injected it,

300
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,220
my eyes started hurting.

301
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,940
It hurt so much that

302
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,100
I felt like digging my own eyeball out.

303
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,300
Now I can't see anything with my right eye.

304
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,010
Ms. Xu,

305
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,130
please calm down.

306
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,770
We'll do everything we can to address your concerns.

307
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,650
Let's go to the VIP room

308
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,100
and talk about the issue.

309
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,580
Can you give me my eyesight back?

310
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,100
The doctor said

311
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,850
the damage is irreversible.

312
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,130
My right eye is permanently blind.

313
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,100
Here's the diagnosis from the hospital.

314
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,060
Take a look.

315
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,220
I make a living from live streaming.

316
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,420
Take a look.

317
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,940
Seems real.

318
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,010
Yeah, it's true.

319
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,940
Ms. Zhou.

320
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,730
It was her.

321
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,820
She gave me the injection.

322
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,820
Ms. Zhou,

323
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,010
this lady just said,

324
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,370
you gave her a hyaluronic acid injection,

325
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,340
and ruined her eye.

326
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,300
Is that true?

327
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,820
How can a big hospital

328
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,650
like Gemu do this?

329
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,890
Are we still doing the procedure today?

330
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,820
Maybe we should just cancel it.

331
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,770
Zhou Jingwen.

332
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,370
Give me back my eye.

333
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,580
Ms. Xu,

334
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,420
we're truly heartbroken

335
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,250
about this.

336
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,250
But I know at this point,

337
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,220
any apology will be useless.

338
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,340
All we can do now is

339
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,730
go through this with you.

340
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,060
So, if you have any requests,

341
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,610
please feel free to tell us.

342
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,650
Okay.

343
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,340
Give me my eyesight back.

344
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,250
I make my living from live streaming.

345
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,770
How am I supposed to

346
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,250
face my fans now?

347
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,890
Dr. Wu from Tongren Hospital

348
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,060
has an expert session tomorrow afternoon.

349
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,180
I've already made an appointment for you.

350
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,010
He's the best eye specialist in our country.

351
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,650
There's no certainty in medicine.

352
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,820
The earlier you treat it,

353
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,700
the higher the chance of recovery.

354
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,010
I'll go with you tomorrow.

355
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,890
Thank you so much.

356
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,980
You want to make my other eye blind too?

357
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,300
Is that it?

358
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,890
If you don't trust the doctor we found,

359
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,940
you can find one yourself.

360
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,650
Whether domestic or abroad,

361
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,060
we'll cover the cost.

362
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,940
If the blindness is really caused

363
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,100
by hyaluronic acid embolism,

364
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,490
we'll...

365
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,100
Are you accusing me of scamming you?

366
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,650
Ms. Xu,

367
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,980
Ms. Zhou is just worried about you.

368
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,580
Our hospital guarantees

369
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,650
we will take full responsibility for every patient.

370
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,060
If your

371
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,220
hospital was really responsible,

372
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,700
my eye wouldn't be blind.

373
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,730
See you in court.

374
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,340
Alright, got it, honey.

375
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,060
In your case,

376
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,660
I recommend fixing the ear shape.

377
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,900
That'll do.

378
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,380
What do you mean fixing?

379
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,940
These are my elf ears.

380
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,380
Can't you tell?

381
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,380
Elf ears.

382
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,220
That must've cost quite a bit, huh?

383
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,620
And you used cartilage,

384
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,380
not just filler, huh?

385
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,730
All done in one shot.

386
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,330
No need to do it all the time.

387
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,420
Just do these procedures on the list.

388
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,530
I think these ears need to go with

389
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,010
a high nose bridge,

390
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,660
fair skin, and fox eyes.

391
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,660
Otherwise, these elf ears are wasted.

392
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,620
Which hospital gave you

393
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,140
the procedures on this list?

394
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,140
Jiao Ai.

395
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,570
Why didn't you choose to do it at Jiao Ai?

396
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,530
I compared a few places.

397
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,860
Could you just follow the list

398
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,770
and do them for me?

399
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,730
Well honey,

400
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,250
I'll recommend

401
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,420
our ear specialist, Dr. Lu.

402
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,420
He'll give you better advice.

403
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,010
Alright?

404
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,530
Ok.

405
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,570
Any expert

406
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,900
will be fine.

407
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,770
Tian.

408
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,700
Take care, this way.

409
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,420
There are really all kinds of people.

410
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,900
Ms. Qiao, do you think someone like this

411
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,010
would go to a restaurant

412
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,810
and take the menu

413
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,460
from the place next door?

414
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,700
Jiao Ai is really making money without any limits now.

415
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,570
I wonder how Wei Xiaoxi is doing.

416
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,770
Your cosmetic surgery looks amazing!

417
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,180
It's also a bit of a problem.

418
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,010
Everyone keeps complimenting me.

419
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,380
No one on the street can stop staring at me.

420
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,250
Seen my husband?

421
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,770
He's handsome and capable.

422
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,140
But ever since we had a daughter,

423
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,460
everything changed.

424
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,380
Yeah, exactly.

425
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,050
Everyone who sees this kid has the same look

426
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,770
on their face as you two.

427
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,660
My husband is pretty chill about it.

428
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,660
He says ignore them.

429
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,140
But my daughter,

430
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,380
keeps asking me

431
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,180
whether she's really my biological child.

432
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,490
Show her pictures of you when you were little.

433
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,620
I didn't look like this when I was a kid either.

434
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,140
What if…

435
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,900
she looks like your husband

436
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,620
when he was little?

437
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,730
You mean

438
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,490
my husband had surgery too?

439
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,090
How could I

440
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,090
have never thought of that?

441
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,490
By the way, you just said my daughter

442
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,700
has what kind of face??

443
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,530
Resting bitch face.

444
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,770
Yeah, that one.

445
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,660
Doctor,

446
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,900
do you think I should get one too?

447
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,010
Our consultant is not familiar with

448
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,050
these professional things.

449
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,460
Let me see.

450
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,330
Here.

451
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,140
Your bone structure is really nice.

452
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,730
The rest are just minor issues.

453
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,330
Your throat feels uncomfortable?

454
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,770
It's fine.

455
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,330
Go on.

456
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,530
You've had a lot of procedures before.

457
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,770
You had your bones thinned.

458
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,660
That weakens the support for your muscles.

459
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,050
As we get older,

460
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,180
the sagging and drooping of the face

461
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,250
will become more noticeable for you.

462
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,050
Look,

463
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,050
your jawline on both sides here

464
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,250
is a bit blurred, right?

465
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,330
Now that you mention it, yeah.

466
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,810
My jawline looks unclear.

467
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,570
I just got it done, why's it like this?

468
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,810
It's fine, those are just small issues.

469
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,530
You just need a contour fix.

470
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,730
Compared to major surgeries,

471
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,010
you need to focus more on anti-aging and maintenance.

472
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,180
But these procedures

473
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,140
need to be done in the right order.

474
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,220
I suggest you take a whole year,

475
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,980
and do them in cycles.

476
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,810
Don't rush.

477
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,730
If anyone tells you it can all be done at once,

478
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,980
they're lying.

479
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,810
Doctor,

480
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,140
I really can't thank you enough.

481
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,810
I'm so glad I ran into you today.

482
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,420
From now on, I'll always come to you.

483
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,050
Sure.

484
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,570
I'll set up the treatment plan for you today,

485
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,250
and explain everything in detail later.

486
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,770
If you top up now, there's a discount.

487
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,860
You'll also get some free procedures.

488
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,770
You can figure out the best payment plan for her.

489
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,900
Thanks a lot.

490
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,980
Here you go.

491
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,330
What are you doing? You scared me.

492
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,010
Nice one, Wei Xiaoxi.

493
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,810
I spent three hours on that client.

494
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,980
My voice is all gone.

495
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,050
I only brought her here

496
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,570
because we're familiar.

497
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,770
But you

498
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,570
just refused her?

499
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,460
I'm not wrong, am I?

500
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,810
Her husband clearly had work done.

501
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,010
That “resting bitch face” look is pointless.

502
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,810
You're smart,

503
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,490
and saw they had work done.

504
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,180
We need to find out their needs.

505
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,290
Got it?

506
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,660
She's worried about her kid's eyes.

507
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,980
The couple have big,

508
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,290
Western-style eyes.

509
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,570
If she wants to do it, let her.

510
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,140
She's spending money

511
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,330
to feel good,

512
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,900
so we're happy too.

513
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,050
You just need to listen to her complaints.

514
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,250
Then create the treatment plan based on my proposal.

515
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,330
It's really that simple.

516
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,700
Interns do this better than you.

517
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,940
Do you get it?

518
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,290
My plans

519
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,290
have higher prices than yours.

520
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,180
Those procedures have a high repeat rate.

521
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,330
They could become our core clients.

522
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,180
But if you're not happy,

523
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,570
you can report to Ms. Li.

524
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,810
She's looking for me this afternoon anyway.

525
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,490
Want to join?

526
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,420
Good, Wei Xiaoxi.

527
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,730
Good.

528
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,050
Little black fish,

529
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,250
you're so lucky.

530
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,180
You're living in a mansion now!

531
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,490
I get the diver in the water,

532
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,050
but why an astronaut?

533
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,860
So it's not lonely anymore.

534
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,810
You should get it a friend of its kind.

535
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,290
Why put two toys there?

536
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,140
What if they start fighting?

537
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,660
What if they fall in love?

538
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,010
Dr. Lu,

539
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,090
I knew you'd be here.

540
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,980
Can Zhang Yang meet you for a consultation tomorrow afternoon?

541
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,620
With me?

542
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,490
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.

543
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,490
There's a tough lady,

544
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,570
I sent her to you.

545
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,490
Tough lady?

546
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,460
You couldn't handle her?

547
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,700
Then I'll take her.

548
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,250
Alright.

549
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,180
Her face

550
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,940
has been worked on in at least eight hospitals.

551
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,180
Especially her elf ears, they're very eye-catching.

552
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,050
You'll like it.

553
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,530
Ms. Qiao,

554
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,420
I think we should just reject her.

555
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,460
If something goes wrong, we won't be able to explain it.

556
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,140
We already have Xu Yuan's case.

557
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,090
How's it going with Ms. Zhou?

558
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,010
What's going on?

559
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,250
When was Xu Yuan's injection?

560
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,050
Chen Mingjie said it was on

561
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,730
the last workday before the new year.

562
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,090
Everyone was rushing to leave.

563
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,290
And Ms. Zhou had things to do that afternoon,

564
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,810
so it was a bit chaotic.

565
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,730
Do you feel uncomfortable?

566
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,090
I'm scared it'll hurt.

567
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,490
Please go easy on me.

568
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,140
Don't worry,

569
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,220
I'll be super gentle.

570
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,380
Relax.

571
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,810
Let's begin.

572
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,460
Ms. Qiao,

573
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,380
got a minute?

574
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,490
Got a moment to talk?

575
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,290
I'm busy,

576
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,180
just say what you need to say here.

577
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,700
Wow, how quickly things change.

578
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,940
No kindness at all.

579
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,420
I've always

580
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,980
considered you a friend.

581
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,420
Just one minute.

582
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:46,860
Go ahead.

583
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,090
I was feeling nostalgic the other day,

584
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,770
and found something.

585
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,810
Didn't you leave all your stuff behind?

586
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,050
What are you nostalgic about?

587
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,530
Material things don't matter.

588
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,900
What's important is what's worth keeping.

589
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,770
What?

590
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,900
You'll see.

591
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,460
I'm not that curious.

592
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,050
It's about Qiao Hui.

593
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,220
Once people lose their curiosity,

594
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,660
the world stops moving forward.

595
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,220
I'll wait you here.

596
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,180
Let's talk.

597
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,220
One, two.

598
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,460
One, two.

599
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,700
One, two.

600
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,770
Didn't expect that, huh?

601
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,860
Pretty quick progress, huh?

602
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,380
I've been practicing every day since you brought me here.

603
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,530
Can't be the punching bag anymore.

604
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,570
The afternoon you gave Xu Yuan the injection,

605
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,090
were you in a hurry to go out for a divorce?

606
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,770
You think this will

607
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,770
affect my profession?

608
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,700
Are you even professional?

609
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,330
What exactly did you inject Qiao Hui with?

610
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,730
The label says hyaluronic acid,

611
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,290
but the needle's thicker than usual.

612
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,460
You should know what it is, right?

613
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,290
You give them this batch of hyaluronic acid.

614
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,490
AMO Derma was banned in 2006.

615
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,730
How many people have been disfigured

616
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,010
and had their lives threatened because of it?

617
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,570
And you used it to inject Qiao Hui?

618
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,220
I really didn't know back then.

619
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,140
You're a doctor.

620
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,620
Couldn't you tell?

621
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,180
How did Li Qi get this stuff?

622
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,220
I always thought it was just an accident

623
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,570
Guess I was naive.

624
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,940
Zhou Jingwen,

625
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,010
how many dark secrets do you still have?

626
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,770
Did you not drive today?

627
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,140
Get in the car.

628
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,490
Rye bread,

629
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,010
two soft-boiled eggs,

630
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,180
no cheese, no mayo.

631
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,250
I don't eat in the car.

632
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,770
Your back pain's acting up again?

633
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,140
I'll book your acupuncture for this afternoon.

634
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,490
Get a session.

635
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,140
And what's wrong with your arm?

636
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,090
You came early

637
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,940
to ask about Xu Yuan, right?

638
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,940
I'll handle it...

639
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,330
-Just leave it to me. -Just leave it to me.

640
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,050
I've memorized your classic lines.

641
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,530
She's coming for you.

642
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,460
Things got messy.

643
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,980
Let me talk to her first.

644
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,730
Alright?

645
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,380
Why don't you ask

646
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,380
what actually happened?

647
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,220
Did something go wrong with the injection?

648
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,660
Or did you actually think that

649
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,730
it's my fault?

650
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,900
I never thought like that.

651
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,980
Last night, Qiao Yang chewed me out.

652
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,420
I actually feel good about it.

653
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,980
At least in her eyes what happened

654
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,700
made her really angry and disappointed.

655
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,980
It means she's the only one

656
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,220
who still has expectations for me.

657
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,700
She's always cared about you.

658
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,900
Done staring?

659
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,620
Are you the boss here?

660
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,290
I'm here on behalf of Gemu.

661
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,460
Why didn't you take me to Gemu?

662
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,090
Zhou Jingwen too scared to see me?

663
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,860
She already told me about your situation.

664
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,730
My personal advice is

665
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,290
you need to keep treating it.

666
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,530
Don't give up.

667
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,140
Maybe there's still hope.

668
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,810
I know your tricks.

669
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,330
Just dragging it out.

670
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,530
Then it'll just fade away.

671
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,770
Listen up,

672
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,330
I don't have time to play games.

673
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,620
I know your boss, Mr. Qin

674
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,490
is Zhou Jingwen's husband.

675
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,490
They're in this together.

676
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,900
Putting on a show for me.

677
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,700
Here's the deal.

678
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,180
You say you can make decisions,

679
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,900
so I'll say it straight.

680
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,490
Fire Zhou Jingwen.

681
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,700
That's not too much to ask, right?

682
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,420
Of course.

683
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,010
Even if

684
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,380
you don't say it,

685
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,420
we'd still do it.

686
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,860
Anything else?

687
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,290
I want thirty million.

688
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,660
I'll give you time for the money.

689
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,700
But for Zhou Jingwen,

690
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,530
I want results by tomorrow.

691
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,900
Fire her?

692
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,010
Is she joking?

693
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,420
Thirty million?

694
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,620
Has she lost her mind?

695
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,050
In situations like this,

696
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,050
the worst thing is being led around.

697
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,420
I agree with what Mr. Tang said.

698
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,490
You know, over the past year,

699
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,730
we've faced so many challenges.

700
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,700
No matter what happened

701
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,420
or how messy it got,

702
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,420
we got through it smoothly.

703
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,220
Do you know why?

704
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,810
Because of me.

705
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,660
My elders always said

706
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,530
I have a lucky fate.

707
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,940
I turn misfortune into blessings.

708
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,730
I think

709
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,730
we should take this seriously.

710
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,250
We can't be careless.

711
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,010
Her vision now

712
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,620
is actually 0.05.

713
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,660
That's not the same as being totally blind.

714
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,980
But she insists

715
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,660
you blinded her.

716
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,090
How do you fight that?

717
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,620
You can't.

718
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,140
Influencers these days

719
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,940
have plenty of ways to blow things up.

720
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,700
If we refuse,

721
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,940
she can go online right away

722
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,010
and say she reached out to us,

723
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,330
but we had no

724
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,090
intention of solving the problem.

725
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,090
So I think,

726
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,290
considering

727
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,250
the hospital's situation right now,

728
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,810
Ms. Zhou might have to take the fall.

729
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,980
No, no,

730
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,050
I don't agree.

731
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,730
Firing someone isn't a game.

732
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,530
Even if she's reinstated later,

733
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,570
the damage is done.

734
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,700
No, I...

735
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,770
Think it through.

736
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,810
We must be careful.

737
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,460
Well…

738
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,620
Mr. Qin,

739
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,530
what do you think?

740
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,530
I'm sorry

741
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,380
for causing trouble for everyone.

742
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,940
Yes,

743
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,530
doctors should always be cautious.

744
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,940
No excuses.

745
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,810
Fine,

746
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,010
I'll leave Gemu.

747
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,860
My only condition is that

748
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,140
all current medical responsibilities

749
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,380
to be transferred to Qiao Yang.

750
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,700
That elf-ear client you sent me

751
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,980
talks way too much.

752
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,140
My throat is dry from talking.

753
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,290
And?

754
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,250
After all that,

755
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,460
she finally agreed to remove the cartilage.

756
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,050
Seriously, who invented

757
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,140
elf ears?

758
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,180
So messed up.

759
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,860
People will do anything just to make money.

760
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,460
Is this chicken leg for me?

761
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,380
What's wrong?

762
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,380
Are you upset?

763
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,650
Thinking about Xu Yuan.

764
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,530
Do you think Ms. Zhou really has to leave this time?

765
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,650
You don't want her to go?

766
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,170
Yeah.

767
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,570
Give me my chicken leg back.

768
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,900
You're thinking too small.

769
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,610
I just think

770
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,090
this whole thing seems fishy.

771
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,610
From what I know about her after all these years at Gemu,

772
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,820
she's the type of person

773
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,650
who rarely even receives a tiny complaint.

774
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,210
How could she make such a mistake?

775
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,820
I met with Xu Yuan this morning.

776
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,820
How was it?

777
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,420
She really has a problem with her right eye.

778
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,530
And she really wants money too.

779
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,610
But I'm confused.

780
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,610
The treatment process was fine.

781
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,460
Her vision was normal before the injection.

782
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,130
And the diagnosis report wasn't forged.

783
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,610
It was really caused by a blood vessel blockage.

784
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,090
As for Zhou Jingwen,

785
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,170
maybe we just don't know her that well.

786
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,490
Anyway, I think

787
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,050
her technique is definitely not the problem.

788
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,570
I think you want to leave with Ms. Zhou, huh?

789
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:07,980
Think bigger.

790
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,010
Shut up.

791
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,460
Not again, Jia.

792
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,300
I'm here.

793
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,300
Come on.

794
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,860
What are you looking at?

795
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,860
Do I have something on my face today?

796
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,300
Jia,

797
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,610
how many times have I told you?

798
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,340
Your wardrobe door never closes properly.

799
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,860
The clothes are stuck outside.

800
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,650
If you keep doing this,

801
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,210
I'm just going to weld that wardrobe door shut.

802
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,340
And you won't be able to get anything.

803
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,690
Okay, Ms. Zhou.

804
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,610
I'll make sure next time...

805
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,340
You'll do it again next time, won't you?

806
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:45,860
Ms. Zhou,

807
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,170
I can't take it anymore.

808
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,340
I think we should just weld her wardrobe door shut now.

809
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,210
And weld Jia to the door as well.

810
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,050
That'll teach her a lesson.

811
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,860
Okay, and I'll weld your mouth shut too.

812
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,900
Before you weld my mouth shut,

813
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,860
let me update you on the patient's info first.

814
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,740
Wang Xianzi.

815
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,980
Female, 26.

816
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,340
Undergoing columella elongation and ear cartilage nose tip surgery.

817
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,650
Thank you, Dr. Qiao.

818
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,860
Then, please follow me.

819
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,090
Hello, Ms. Ye.

820
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,860
I'm sorry.

821
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,570
You had an appointment with Dr. Zhou Jingwen.

822
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,010
It's been canceled.

823
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,740
Dr. Zhou Jingwen had an emergency.

824
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,690
Would you like to see

825
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,690
another doctor?

826
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,170
What are you looking at?

827
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,090
Ms. Zhou.

828
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,820
She's had eight surgeries lined up today,

829
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,170
working non-stop since this morning.

830
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,490
Who?

831
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,690
The patient, I guess.

832
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,460
Probably hungry.

833
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,210
It's already 5 PM.

834
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,530
She's definitely hungry.

835
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,300
We're doing eye bags next, right?

836
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,300
I can handle it myself.

837
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,490
You guys go eat something.

838
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,260
No way. I can't leave.

839
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,050
If I leave, the surgery won't go smoothly.

840
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,980
Anyone can do the surgery.

841
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,980
What time's the next one?

842
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,460
This is the last one, Ms. Zhou.

843
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,820
I suddenly feel so tired.

844
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,530
You've worked hard.

845
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,690
Thank you.

846
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,530
Thanks.

847
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,740
Finally.

848
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,090
What are you guys doing?

849
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,490
I may have quit being a doctor,

850
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,300
but I'm still your boss.

851
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,010
This hospital is full of my eyes.

852
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,050
You all better be careful.

853
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,490
Especially you, Dr. Lu.

854
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,530
I'm watching you.

855
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,260
Ms. Zhou,

856
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,170
just come back to see us sometimes.

857
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,690
It's all yours now.

858
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,980
Welcome to Yuan's livestream.

859
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,210
If you like me,

860
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,860
click Follow in the top left corner.

861
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,210
Thanks to Jordan and Seti for the gifts.

862
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,490
I see so many familiar fans.

863
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,380
Of course, I'm not ending the stream yet.

864
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,260
You're not going to date?

865
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,260
No way.

866
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,740
Who would I date?

867
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,300
This bear?

868
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,490
Come on.

869
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,380
Streaming late at night,

870
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,210
who's not a lonely soul?

871
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,170
Plans for the near future?

872
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,490
I might have to deal with a lawsuit.

873
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,210
She promised me on WeChat the day before.

874
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,050
She promised me so well.

875
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,980
Said I could come for a follow-up.

876
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,860
Look, the door's closed.

877
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,170
Everyone's gone.

878
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,340
The worst part is, she blocked me on WeChat.

879
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,900
I called, no one picked up.

880
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,490
My right eye's blind from their diagnosis.

881
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,490
Look, here it is.

882
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,340
This is what the hospital gave me.

883
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,780
The diagnosis.

884
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,170
I can't see anything out of my right eye.

885
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,260
How am I supposed to live?

886
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,050
I have to spend…

887
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,010
Qiao Yang asked me that day,

888
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,050
you're a doctor,

889
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,050
how could you mix up AMO Derma with hyaluronic acid?

890
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,050
I didn't even know how to answer her.

891
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,300
I've been

892
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,050
asking myself this for 16 years.

893
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,210
How could this happen?

894
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,530
How could I mix up AMO Derma with hyaluronic acid?

895
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,050
Am I even a doctor?

896
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,380
For years, I've asked myself,

897
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,260
if I hadn't gone to medical school,

898
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,530
if I hadn't become a doctor,

899
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,210
if I hadn't founded Gemu,

900
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,900
what would my life even mean?

901
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,900
What's the point of being here?

902
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,980
I feel like there's a hole in my heart.

903
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,530
Nothing can fill it.

904
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,980
The more I try to fill it,

905
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,530
the bigger it gets.

906
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,820
When I left Gemu,

907
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,940
I realized

908
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,260
in this life,

909
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,490
the most precious thing is to leave

910
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,420
something behind in others' hearts.

911
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,570
What are you doing here?

912
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,650
Just checking,

913
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,610
making sure no one's after you.

914
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,610
Not here.

915
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,420
Let's grab a drink somewhere

916
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,420
Sure.
