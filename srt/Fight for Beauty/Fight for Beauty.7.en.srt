1
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,740
Mr. Chu,

2
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,620
so you're stationed here now?

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,540
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

4
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,460
If we'd known, we wouldn't have come.

5
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,130
It's a recent thing.

6
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,330
My apprentice thought that after I retired,

7
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,410
I seemed restless at home,

8
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,690
afraid I'd get bored.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,020
They wanted to look after me.

10
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,130
So they arranged this easy job for me.

11
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,820
Mr. Qin.

12
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,290
You're joking, right?

13
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,130
Mr. Qin.

14
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,820
There are rumors that Germu performed plastic surgery for a murderer.

15
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,820
Is that true?

16
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,940
Can you comment on this matter?

17
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,170
Is it possible to reveal information about the murderer?

18
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,100
Ms. Li, is it true?

19
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,540
Please address this directly, Mr. Qin.

20
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,570
Ms. Li.

21
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,290
A lot of reporters have shown up,

22
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,690
saying your patient is a murderer.

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,010
Pause for a moment.

24
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,100
How can we stop now?

25
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,540
Get out!

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,060
What are you waiting for?

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,780
Keep going!

28
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,610
Ms. Li went into the operating room herself,

29
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,850
even the nurse couldn't stop her.

30
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,170
But it was all in vain.

31
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,060
Now they're probably interrogating Ms. Zhou.

32
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,780
She's really unlucky,

33
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,610
ending up with a murderer.

34
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,100
Murderer Undergoes Secret Plastic Surgery:

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,690
Hospital Becomes Accomplice.

36
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,570
Jingwen,

37
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,690
can you explain

38
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,890
what's going on here?

39
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,820
Ms. Li, I was just about to talk to you.

40
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,170
From now on, when I'm in surgery,

41
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,130
don't let anyone come in

42
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,060
to tell me irrelevant things, okay?

43
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,410
Alright, it won't happen again.

44
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,010
You should be more careful too.

45
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,690
You're not even verifyingthe

46
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,130
patient's real identity anymore?

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,730
Did you pick today on purpose?

48
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,450
Trying to cause chaos at Gemu, huh?

49
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,380
Let me explain.

50
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,730
We've been making internal adjustments recently.

51
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,780
These two surgeries

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,340
weren't scheduled through our consultation process.

53
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,980
The directors arranged them themselves.

54
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,130
Whatever people say, you just believe it?

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,130
Who's the murderer?

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,100
That scarred-face guy.

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,850
His facial scars were caused by a car accident.

58
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,100
Mr. Tang, look up Zhao Zheng online.

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,290
"Zhao" like the surname, and "Zheng" like in "struggle."

60
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,290
There's news about him.

61
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,100
He used to drive long-distance buses.

62
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,380
One time, while driving on a mountain road,

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,290
a rock hit his head.

64
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,170
He kept operating the bus to save the passengers,

65
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,010
only collapsed after bringing the bus to a stop.

66
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,500
The news caused a big stir back then.

67
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,500
It's true!

68
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,820
If the murderer isn't him, then...

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,540
It's my patient,

70
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,490
Lin Qiang.

71
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,900
I'm a murderer.

72
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,340
It was manslaughter.

73
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,370
I accidentally killed my cousin.

74
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,290
Do you know what it feels like

75
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,340
to have glass stuck in your neck?

76
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,370
It's like turning on a faucet.

77
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,930
But instead of water, it's blood pouring out.

78
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,370
In just a few seconds,

79
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,580
half the body is covered in red.

80
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,580
He falls to the ground,

81
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,140
Convulses a few times, and loses consciousness.

82
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,250
It's Hemorrhagic shock.

83
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,700
I looked it up online.

84
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,730
I don't even remember what happened at the time.

85
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,900
My mind went completely blank back then.

86
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,290
Ten years...

87
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,170
and I still can't recall

88
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,170
what happened.

89
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,140
Why are you telling us this?

90
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,290
There are no mirrors in prison.

91
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,730
So, after a long time,

92
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,850
you forget what you look like.

93
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,250
But once you're out, it's different.

94
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,050
There are mirrors everywhere.

95
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,580
Glass doors,

96
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,580
elevators,

97
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,020
Phone screens...

98
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,050
You can see yourself everywhere.

99
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,700
I hate myself.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,170
I despise this face.

101
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,780
I really don't wanna see it anymore.

102
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,850
I sympathize with your experience.

103
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,730
But I can't perform surgery to make someone beautiful look ugly.

104
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,100
That's the bottom line for a plastic surgeon.

105
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,290
No one would do it.

106
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,020
Actually, if you wanna change your appearance,

107
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,610
you don't necessarily have to go from beautiful to ugly.

108
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,050
Isn't it interesting?

109
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,610
Many people deny it,

110
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,220
but judging by appearance is human nature.

111
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,930
Just because Zhao Zheng looks like a bad guy,

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,980
we instinctively assume

113
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,170
he's the murderer.

114
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,290
What's the difference?

115
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,810
Whether it's Zhao Zheng or Lin Qiang,

116
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,580
its' the same, isn't it?

117
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,980
Gemu still performed surgery on a murderer.

118
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,100
We're doctors, not judges.

119
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,290
Lin Qiang has already served his time for his crime.

120
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,050
His rights now are no different from ours.

121
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,660
When he came to Ge Mu,

122
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,170
we was just a patient.

123
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,540
A patient's past crimes

124
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,290
shouldn't affect

125
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,810
a doctor's professional judgment.

126
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,290
But what if this case

127
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,370
seriously damages the hospital's reputation?

128
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,730
The surgery had no economic benefit

129
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,540
and even hurt Gemu's public image.

130
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,490
I just don't see the point.

131
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,580
Alright,

132
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,660
stop being so righteous.

133
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,290
You there, the one cracking sunflower seeds, stop arguing.

134
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,410
And you,

135
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,610
no need to take a stance.

136
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,370
At this point, none of that matters.

137
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,370
The pressure from the outside is so great now.

138
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,610
It's just one patient.

139
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,050
If we decide not to do the surgery,

140
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,930
so what?

141
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,660
The key is where the experts have checked

142
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,810
and what stage they're at.

143
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,850
Is there any specific opinion on it?

144
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,610
Qin Gui and Mr. Chu are with them.

145
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,050
They just replied to my message.

146
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,290
They're preparing to head back.

147
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,580
Let's wait for their assessment.

148
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,460
The public opinion has already started to ferment.

149
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,050
We need to think of ways to remedy the situation.

150
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,660
I'll handle the media.

151
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,340
Don't we need to learn from this?

152
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,780
I know you doctors are soft-hearted.

153
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,460
When someone asks, you just agree.

154
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,370
In the future, we do the consultation and oversight.

155
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,700
You just focus on the surgery.

156
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,020
As for Lin Qiang,

157
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,250
let's arrange for his discharge.

158
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,810
No,

159
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:34,780
What?

160
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,100
He still needs to undergo the second phase of surgery.

161
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,810
There's a second phase?

162
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,700
Ms. Qiao,

163
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,730
This is not the time to be willful.

164
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,660
I'm not being willful.

165
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,980
I'm talking about professionalism.

166
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,290
The most important thing in surgery is the overall design.

167
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,610
It's about making an aesthetically harmonious judgment.

168
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,340
If he does the first phase but not the second,

169
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,100
it'll really ruin the result.

170
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,810
I can't agree to that.

171
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,370
I agree with Qiao Yang.

172
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,290
The surgery should continue.

173
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,050
Lin Qiang's surgery is a fact.

174
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,610
All the rumors will pass.

175
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,490
We must give the patient a good resolution.

176
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,730
Just think carefully.

177
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,930
If this continues to escalate,

178
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,370
and the deceased's family comes forward to oppose it,

179
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,170
it won't just affect our surgery rating.

180
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,140
It'll have serious consequences for Gemu's future.

181
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,780
So if the surgery is halted halfway,

182
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,290
Gemu's reputation, which we've worked hard to build,

183
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,290
will be ruined.

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,900
How about this,

185
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,100
I'll go meet the family on behalf of Gemu.

186
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,850
Does that sound good?

187
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,820
You're really crazy today.

188
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,610
You're not so bad yourself.

189
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,770
They already rushed to the operating room.

190
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,220
And your surgery didn't stop.

191
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,180
It's different.

192
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,370
Zhao Zheng is innocent.

193
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,980
In a sense, Lin Qiang is also innocent.

194
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,010
I can understand that.

195
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,700
Prejudice really can kill.

196
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,940
Otherwise, Zhao Zheng

197
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,100
wouldn't have gone all out to get plastic surgery, right?

198
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,580
So, what exactly

199
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,730
is the situation with Lin Qiang?

200
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,220
Lin Qiang has a cousin named Zheng Cong.

201
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,130
They are the same age.

202
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,340
On the day the college entrance exams ended,

203
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,100
the two kids wanted to go to a bar to celebrate.

204
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,420
Unexpectedly, they ran into a group of thugs.

205
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,820
They started fighting for some reason.

206
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,770
In the chaos,

207
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,530
Lin Qiang grabbed a beer bottle to defend himself.

208
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,300
Unexpectedly, he accidentally killed someone.

209
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,300
The one who died was his cousin.

210
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,850
Oh my god...

211
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,010
His parents divorced when he was young.

212
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,010
His dad worked away from home and didn't take care of him.

213
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,180
His mom remarried

214
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,580
and left him with her sister

215
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,530
— his aunt.

216
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,610
So he grew up with his cousin Zheng Cong.

217
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,940
Zheng Cong's mother must have been heartbroken.

218
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,460
Losing both sons at once...

219
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,130
No wonder Lin Qiang has been hiding everywhere.

220
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,420
Anyone would be crushed by something like that.

221
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,580
Heaven and earth are ruthless,

222
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,820
treating all things like straw dogs.

223
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,250
As doctors,

224
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,130
we've long become indifferent to life and death.

225
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,130
It only takes a second.

226
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,060
It's so unpredictable.

227
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,700
So was her death also just fate?

228
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,460
You're drunk.

229
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,180
We still have work tomorrow. Let's go.

230
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,730
I'm asking you a question!

231
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,180
Lin Qiang killed someone by mistake,

232
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,300
served nine years in prison,

233
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,650
and paid for his mistake.

234
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,250
What about you?

235
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,300
If it weren't for you, she wouldn't have died at all.

236
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,220
And here you are talking to me about fate.

237
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,130
Hello?

238
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,940
What are you doing?

239
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:12,890
You can't go in there!

240
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,460
Is that Qiao Hui?

241
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,180
You can't go in!

242
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,300
That's Qiao Hui, isn't it?

243
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,060
Who is it?

244
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,300
Are you Zheng Cong's mother?

245
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,060
Who are you?

246
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,940
I'm here about Zheng Cong.

247
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,650
I'm not accepting any interviews.

248
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,250
This happened a long time ago.

249
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,060
I don't wanna talk about it.

250
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,250
Actually, I'm a doctor.

251
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,340
Lin Qiang's doctor.

252
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,530
Qiang?

253
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,700
He's sick?

254
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,420
Is this Zheng Cong?

255
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:00,940
Yeah.

256
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,300
They really do look alike.

257
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,580
When they went out together,

258
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,770
people always thought they were twins.

259
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,420
After his mother divorced, she didn't want him anymore.

260
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,060
It's not an exaggeration to say that I was the one who raised him.

261
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,300
I lost count of how many times I mistakenly called him "son."

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,580
What kind of illness does Qiang have?

263
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,010
Actually, I'm a plastic surgeon.

264
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,650
When Lin Qiang came to me,

265
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,700
he wanted to change his appearance,

266
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,850
so that no one in the world would recognize him.

267
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,060
I've never encountered a patient like this before.

268
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,370
He said that after being released from prison,

269
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,730
he wandered through more than a dozen cities,

270
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,010
taking odd jobs everywhere,

271
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,010
living a day-to-day existence.

272
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,770
Did he come to see you after he was released?

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,130
He didn't dare to come see me.

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,220
Do you wanna see him?

275
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,370
Alright.

276
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,370
After the filler is done, you look more rugged.

277
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,770
Next week,

278
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,580
once the implant surgery for the chin is done,

279
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,490
you'll look even more masculine,

280
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,820
completely changing your temperament.

281
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,700
But I'm not trying to change my temperament.

282
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,700
I just wanna make sure no one recognizes me.

283
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,130
Are you really that afraid of being recognized?

284
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,650
How long are you planning to keep hiding?

285
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,770
To be honest, I never planned to come out.

286
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,490
In these ten years after the incident,

287
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,650
I felt most at ease staying in the prison.

288
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,250
Of course, it feels secure there.

289
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,770
You can escape reality without guilt.

290
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,700
But now that you're out,

291
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,980
you still have to face it sooner or later.

292
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,100
You're right.

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,300
But I'm just a coward.

294
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,460
Just think of me as a deserter.

295
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,300
Anyway, after the surgery, I'm going to Shanghai.

296
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,980
From your hometown to Rongchuan,

297
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,340
now from Rongchuan to Shanghai.

298
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,100
How far are you planning to run, deserter?

299
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,700
Next stop, the Northeast?

300
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,890
Further away, Russia?

301
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,420
Next time I see you, will it be at the North Pole?

302
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,940
No, definitely not.

303
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,060
I'm afraid of the cold.

304
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,940
Get some rest.

305
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,650
Were there many people on the train?

306
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,700
Did you get some sleep?

307
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,530
It was okay, but I couldn't sleep.

308
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,850
Good news!

309
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,370
The evaluation went smoothly.

310
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,100
The license for Level Four surgeries is pretty much secured.

311
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,220
Your idea of inviting a top expert

312
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,100
is incredible.

313
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,250
Absolutely genius!

314
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,820
With Mr. Chu joining,

315
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,980
Gemu is now more powerful than ever.

316
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,420
Also,

317
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,300
you and Qiao Yang were right.

318
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,700
The hype about Lin Qiang's incident

319
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,850
has already cooled down on the internet.

320
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,220
Do you remember my classmate Quan from Shanghai?

321
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,650
The one who opened a factory there.

322
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,460
I talked to him on the phone,

323
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,420
and he agreed to let Lin Qiang work there.

324
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,610
There's no problem with Quan.

325
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,940
Gemu will issue a statement later,

326
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,460
clarifying that Lin Qiang never

327
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,850
discussed his identity

328
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,890
with us before.

329
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,650
That way, the whole matter will be over.

330
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,940
Why didn't you discuss this with me first?

331
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,490
Relax.

332
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,530
I just talked to Lin Qiang

333
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,700
in your name.

334
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,770
He's really grateful to you.

335
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,890
Yeah.

336
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,340
We can issue a statement

337
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,940
saying that Lin Qiang concealed his identity,

338
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,850
and protect Gemu.

339
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,770
But what about Lin Qiang?

340
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,940
He still has to face so much malice.

341
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,980
Wouldn't we just

342
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,980
be adding fuel to the fire?

343
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,490
I didn't think that far ahead.

344
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,300
I just wanted to

345
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,610
share your workload.

346
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,940
I appreciate it,

347
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,820
but can't you at least ask me

348
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,370
what I need?

349
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,580
What exactly do you need?

350
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,610
More work?

351
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,010
Far from home?

352
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,980
Jingwen, we talked about this before marriage.

353
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,580
I promised to support you working after we got married.

354
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,980
I support you being a good doctor.

355
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,010
I support you managing the hospital

356
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,330
and medical affairs.

357
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,220
When you do well, I cheer for you.

358
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,140
I do all this

359
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,730
just to make you happy.

360
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,090
But I've already let you handle so many things.

361
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,940
Can you please

362
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,570
not interfere with everything else?

363
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,090
Lately, I really don't understand you.

364
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,570
It feels like you've gone overboard.

365
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,140
You wanna take on every job

366
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,620
and title.

367
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,490
After all, Lin Qiang is

368
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,660
Qiao Yang's patient.

369
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,810
If anyone needs to travel for this, it should be Qiao Yang.

370
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,290
I just don't understand

371
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,490
why you're so eager to take on

372
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,860
these long-distance business trips.

373
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,050
If you keep being like this,

374
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,050
what's gonna happen to our family?

375
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,770
How about our life?

376
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,420
There has to be some balance, right?

377
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,460
Wait.

378
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,620
I just said one thing,

379
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,770
why are you saying so much?

380
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,180
Aren't we just talking about work?

381
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,940
Are you menopausal?

382
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,620
What? You're treating me to this?

383
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,180
This is just the appetizer. There's a main course coming.

384
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,220
What main course?

385
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,730
Steamed buns.

386
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,570
Steamed buns are the main course?

387
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,420
Big steamed buns.

388
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,980
Big steamed buns?

389
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,980
You look like a big steamed bun yourself.

390
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,010
So stingy!

391
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,860
Here.

392
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,380
It's on me.

393
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,700
Fine.

394
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,380
Two of these.

395
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,900
Sure.

396
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,690
Isn't that your former patient from the Third Hospital?

397
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,620
Yeah, Fang Ting.

398
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,100
Golden Horn.

399
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,770
You brought me here for a follow-up checkup?

400
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,620
Just a little retrospective on my work.

401
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,050
I didn't know you were so narcissistic.

402
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,530
What's narcissistic about it?

403
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,450
Sometimes when I can't figure things out,

404
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,420
I just wanna see my former patients.

405
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,900
Maybe I can find some answers.

406
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,530
Are you troubled by something again?

407
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,180
Lin Qiang's surgery.

408
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,620
I stood my ground firmly against everyone.

409
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,530
But when I'm alone,

410
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,730
I keep asking myself,

411
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,970
should this surgery really be done?

412
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,730
As for his surgery, here's what I think.

413
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,290
If there were

414
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,380
10,000 people

415
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,900
asking us to make them uglier,

416
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,820
we should refuse them 10,000 times.

417
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,530
But Lin Qiang just happens to be the 10,001st.

418
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,730
The pain he's enduring now

419
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,050
is unimaginable to us.

420
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,180
We may not understand him,

421
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,900
but we should choose to respect him.

422
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,210
Besides, I don't think

423
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,820
you'd actually make him uglier.

424
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,820
If surgery

425
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,730
can relieve someone's pain,

426
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,690
then why shouldn't we do it?

427
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,290
Dr. Lu, you look pretty sexy

428
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,660
when you're being wise.

429
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,450
But I still feel uneasy.

430
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,100
Especially every time a patient

431
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,530
wants to change their fate through plastic surgery.

432
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,050
That feeling of unease just gets stronger and stronger.

433
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,140
There's no universal standard for plastic surgery.

434
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,850
The success or failure of surgery is very subjective.

435
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,180
Right now, you should

436
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,100
adjust your mindset.

437
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,580
Figure out what you can do

438
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,010
and what we can't do.

439
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,580
I get it, but...

440
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,260
Maybe it's just the fate of a plastic surgeon.

441
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,100
I'll stay here.

442
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,780
You go buy a few more sets for me.

443
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,780
Aren't you treating?

444
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,170
I'll reimburse you.

445
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,490
Why are you so nervous?

446
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,210
Stingy.

447
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,620
Boss.

448
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:33,970
What would you like?

449
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,620
What kind of filling do the buns have?

450
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,140
Already paid.

451
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,730
We have beef, braised pork, and pickled veggies.

452
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,620
Give me two beef and two pickled veggies.

453
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,250
Sure.

454
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,490
Want some soy milk?

455
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,250
Give me two.

456
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,140
Sure.

457
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,650
Soy milk is three yuan each.

458
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,410
Okay.

459
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,340
Business seems good.

460
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,410
Not bad.

461
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,730
If surgery

462
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,540
can relieve a person's pain,

463
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,860
then why shouldn't we do it?

464
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,100
Ms. Qiao,

465
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,900
is it too natural?

466
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,580
I still feel like

467
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,250
the changes aren't that significant.

468
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:09,970
For my next surgery,

469
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,380
can the changes be more drastic?

470
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,540
Let's take it slow with the next surgery.

471
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,210
Ms. Zhou,

472
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,930
thank you for arranging the job in Shanghai for me.

473
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,580
You're welcome.

474
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,210
Before you go to Shanghai,

475
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,300
why not visit your aunt back home?

476
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,730
What are you trying to do?

477
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,900
Your facial structure is identical to your cousin's.

478
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,140
That's the real reason for your face change, right?

479
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,730
What's it to you?

480
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,780
You're doctors.

481
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,060
Just focus on my surgery.

482
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,450
Don't worry about anything else.

483
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,490
Lin Qiang,

484
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,860
do you think having surgery

485
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,140
can help you escape your past?

486
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,380
You'll still dream about that face.

487
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,860
I went to see your aunt.

488
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,380
Actually, I've always wanted to dream of her.

489
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,690
I keep dreaming of her,

490
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,250
and she never speaks to me.

491
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,380
Maybe she's still mad at me.

492
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,140
You probably think

493
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,730
I've long forgotten about Qiao Hui.

494
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,970
I can't forget.

495
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,900
This pain is something I'll never forget.

496
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,380
It's become muscle memory,

497
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,380
deeply ingrained in my body.

498
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,820
Pain isn't always a bad thing.

499
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,010
It keeps you sober and clear-headed.

500
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,010
You want me to meet my aunt

501
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,970
with this face?

502
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,970
Don't you think that's cruel?

503
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,900
Your aunt told me that she did hate you.

504
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,140
But now, the pain in her heart

505
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,300
has nothing to do with your face.

506
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,340
I thought Mr. Chu,

507
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,410
being the carefree, wandering type,

508
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,100
would only agree to a position like honorary advisor or something similar.

509
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,340
That would have been good enough.

510
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,140
But now, he's become the honorary director.

511
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,410
Watching Ge Mu grow so rapidly.

512
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,650
It's quite exciting.

513
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,410
Really?

514
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,100
Of course!

515
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,780
Look, this month we've got someone.

516
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,170
Next month, we'll bring in Someone else.

517
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,010
Ge Mu

518
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,970
is gonna dominate the world soon!

519
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,820
Nice!

520
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,930
You have such a great vision.

521
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,060
I can't help but admire you.

522
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,580
What an extraordinary man!

523
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,820
Ms. Li,

524
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,580
why are you taking it so seriously?

525
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,580
To be honest with you,

526
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,170
it's hard to adapt to such rapid changes.

527
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,140
I'm not saying Mr. Chu is bad.

528
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,250
Everyone in the industry knows

529
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,930
he's famous for fiercely protecting his apprentices.

530
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,300
All he talks about is his two disciples.

531
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,820
Where does that leave me

532
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,250
any space here?

533
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,060
Haven't you heard the saying?

534
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,580
The calmer the surface,

535
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,380
the swifter the current below.

536
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,300
There's no such thing as an unbreakable alliance in this world.

537
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,450
You've never heard the story of three monks with no water to drink?

538
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,140
Don't be fooled by how impressive the recent moves

539
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,250
from the plastic department look.

540
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,060
Is there actually a profitable business behind it?

541
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,970
Have you calculated their revenue this month?

542
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,900
Is it increasing or decreasing?

543
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,540
If it's dropping significantly,

544
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,650
why?

545
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,730
Now that you mention it, Ms. Li,

546
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,060
I haven't really thought it through before.

547
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,580
But when I think about it, you might be right.

548
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,620
So, what are you implying?

549
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,730
I'm not implying anything.

550
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,540
I'm just saying,

551
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,010
the merger of departments

552
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,450
might still be a possibility.

553
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,450
Talking too much truth

554
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,490
annoys people.

555
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,300
Say too much, and you offend others.

556
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,210
I'll just leave it at that.

557
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,540
Anyway, Tang has been

558
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,580
totally overwhelmed by them lately.

559
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,730
Let's wait and see,

560
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,100
there will be new changes.

561
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,780
Did the doctor say where it is?

562
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,100
Go ask.

563
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,210
Qi Dacheng.

564
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,100
You've lost weight.

565
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,450
Come on, let's go.

566
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,930
You didn't eat anything this morning, right?

567
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,060
Yeah, empty stomach.

568
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,010
Name?

569
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,060
Qi Dacheng.

570
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,620
Qi Dacheng is a worker.

571
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,100
Eight years ago, due to an industrial accident,

572
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,060
a steel bar

573
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,820
happened to hit the position of his nose bridge,

574
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,210
causing severe damage

575
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,340
to his nasal and oral cavities.

576
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,210
Afterward,

577
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,340
he underwent four facial reconstructive surgeries,

578
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,900
but his face still isn't right.

579
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,010
The most painful thing is,

580
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,780
the patient wasn't just disfigured,

581
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,140
the wounds also triggered chronic pain,

582
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,540
and he suffers from it year-round.

583
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:35,580
It hurts!

584
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,490
Where does it hurt?

585
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,780
Head.

586
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,450
Head.

587
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,210
Face.

588
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,690
The painkillers don't work.

589
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,170
Three years after the accident,

590
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,340
Qi Dacheng, through Dr. Qiao Yang,

591
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,540
found Mr. Chu,

592
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,540
because Mr. Chu had participated

593
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,860
infacial allograft surgeries abroad.

594
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,540
This was Qi Dacheng's only hope.

595
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,340
I've performed facial allograft surgeries

596
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,450
twice in the United States.

597
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,580
This type of surgery, to date,

598
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,060
has only been performed about forty times worldwide.

599
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,900
Each surgery involves many doctors, often over a hundred.

600
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,060
The surgery takes a long time,

601
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,730
from at least a few hours

602
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,210
to dozens of hours.

603
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,450
It's not just skin transplantation,

604
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,900
it involves all the facial organs.

605
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:16,140
And the most difficult part is it must be done in one go.

606
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,930
That's why the success rate of this surgery

607
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,820
is less than fifty percent.

608
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,100
But this patient is different,

609
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,620
he's not undergoing a full face surgery,

610
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,780
it's a half-face procedure,

611
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,930
which makes the surgery a bit less difficult.

612
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,540
However, facial transplant surgery is still on the cutting edge

613
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,540
and one of the most challenging surgeries.

614
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,820
Chu,

615
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,300
how confident are you?

616
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,900
There aren't many successful cases worldwide,

617
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,010
mainly because of the high technical difficulty,

618
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:47,730
and also because it's very rare to find families

619
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,100
willing to donate facial tissue.

620
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,540
As you can see,

621
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,140
this surgery has very high requirements for the donor‘s age,

622
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,690
skin color, the width and height of the face,

623
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,060
as well as the alignment

624
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,380
of the facial features and bones.

625
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,010
Therefore, our donation bank

626
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,620
has always lacked suitable donors,

627
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,140
and the probability of a successful match

628
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,580
is only one in five hundred thousand.

629
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,010
But today, the donor has finally appeared.

630
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,490
Hello?

631
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,380
Deng Lan registered

632
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,210
for body donation during his lifetime.

633
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,900
You are his registered executor.

634
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,650
Do you agree to proceed with the body donation?

635
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,970
For the past five years,

636
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,380
all departments of the Third Hospital,

637
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,100
including myself, have been actively preparing and following up.

638
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,060
We have done three cadaver practice runs,

639
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,540
mainly to ensure everyone masters

640
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,780
each detail of the surgery.

641
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,410
Because the core technology of this procedure,

642
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,450
when compared to current technological advancements,

643
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,730
I don't think is the most difficult.

644
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,300
What I think is the most difficult is

645
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,010
coordinating so many doctors from various departments,

646
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,580
a collective effort that requires close collaboration.

647
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,690
The preparation and control of the details,

648
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,930
that's the hardest part.

649
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,930
Mr. Chen, it's getting late,

650
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,690
I suggest that former doctors,

651
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,380
Mr. Ji and Qiao Yang,

652
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,780
assist me as the deputy surgeons.

653
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,060
Mr. Chu,

654
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,380
sorry,

655
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,210
but Qiao Yang

656
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,410
has already left our hospital.

657
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,860
But I've retired.

658
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,580
Let me explain.

659
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,930
First of all, this patient

660
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,820
found me through Qiao Yang.

661
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,580
It mainly involves a core technique

662
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,900
for vascular anastomosis.

663
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,490
It's been five years.

664
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,300
Apart from the surgical practice

665
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,100
we've organized,

666
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,900
I believe none of you here

667
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,250
would want to spend more of your personal time

668
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,450
on the endless preparation

669
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,580
for this surgery, right?

670
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,210
Is that the case?

671
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,380
If so,

672
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,340
please raise your hand.

673
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,690
Maybe I'm being uninformed,

674
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,410
but let me know.

675
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,060
No one?

676
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,100
But there is one person who didn't raise their hand.

677
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,820
Qiao Yang.

678
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,380
She has been

679
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,970
quietly practicing.

680
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,300
I believe no one here

681
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,650
can master this technique

682
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,820
better than she can.

683
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,580
I‘d like to take three more doctors with me,

684
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,380
as substitutes.

685
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,250
They may not get a chance,

686
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,450
but this is an opportunity for the hospital,

687
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,930
and also an opportunity for the doctors.

688
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,540
As long as you participate, it's an honor.

689
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,930
Everyone, feel free to sign up.

690
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,820
I'll make a statement first,

691
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,930
I genuinely wanna go,

692
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,250
but as a dermatologist,

693
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,580
I can't really be of much help.

694
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,730
Ms. Li,

695
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,340
how about you cancle my three

696
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,250
liposuction surgeries?

697
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,450
I'll go then.

698
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,860
What do you think?

699
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,140
Shall I tell the customers

700
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,410
that you're canceling their appointments

701
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,820
to observe the face transplant surgery?

702
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,620
Then, let's give the less experienced doctors a chance.

703
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,170
This is a rare opportunity.

704
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,540
Don't be shy, everyone.

705
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,450
If you wanna go, raise your hand

706
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,340
so we know.

707
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,210
I'll sign up.

708
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,300
Me too.

709
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,690
Who else?

710
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,210
Dr. Lu, are you raising your hand

711
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,380
or is it your neck that hurts?

712
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,780
I...

713
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,170
I'm raising my hand.

714
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,540
Alright, then we'll send Lu Ziyou,

715
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,930
Chen Mingjie, and Wei Xiaoxi.

716
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,860
You three

717
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,410
will represent Gemu to participate in the face transplant surgery.

718
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,780
Ms. Zhou, you need to go too.

719
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:16,900
Me?

720
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,900
I've read her paper

721
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,100
on reverse free vascular anastomosis

722
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,250
and preauricular skin flap transplantation for nasal reconstruction.

723
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,650
Her technique has an exceptionally

724
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,540
high success rate for vascular anastomosis,

725
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,930
which is perfect for someone like Qi Dacheng.

726
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,210
So, I'd like to formally invite Ms. Zhou

727
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,900
to join this surgery.

728
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,620
Okay.

729
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,210
Jingwen, Qiao Yang,

730
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,900
this is the first time we'll be doing surgery together

731
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,210
I'm really looking forward to it.

732
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,540
Then, I'll gladly accept the invitation.

733
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,450
Thank you for the opportunity.

734
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,450
Time is tight, and the task is urgent.

735
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,780
Now, I officially announce

736
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,300
that the donation procedure is starting.

737
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,300
Transplant surgery is a race against time.

738
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,250
We must complete the vascular anastomosis

739
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,650
within six hours

740
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,170
to ensure the survival of the transplanted tissue.

741
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,210
So, the surgery will be divided into two teams, working simultaneously.

742
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,690
One team, led by Ms. Li and Mr. Ji,

743
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,260
will be responsible for harvesting the donor's facial tissue.

744
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,450
The other team, consisting of me and Qiao Yang,

745
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,490
will be responsible for excising the scar tissue from Qi Dacheng's face

746
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,010
and completing the transplantation.

747
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,260
Facial transplantation is very special.

748
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,530
It requires not only functional restoration

749
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,740
but also aesthetic harmony.

750
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,220
We must ensure

751
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,380
that every doctor present fully understands

752
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,180
each step of the surgery from start to finish,

753
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,490
every detail

754
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,740
and every procedure.

755
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,090
The size and depth of the tissue removed by both teams

756
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,410
must be perfectly matched.

757
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,820
There cannot be even the slightest error.

758
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,410
I think we can use a guide rail

759
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,340
to assist with the cutting of the facial bones.

760
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,930
By using two identical molds,

761
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,780
we can remove the excess parts,

762
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,900
ensuring the connection parts

763
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,780
align perfectly.

764
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,610
We'll also try to make sure the connection is seamless,

765
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,180
ensuring that the donor's

766
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,340
and recipient's facial bones fit together perfectly.

767
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,820
Sure.

768
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,490
This could really help us

769
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,340
significantly shorten the surgery time.

770
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,490
Ms. Zhou, this was your idea, right?

771
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,780
Even using molds,

772
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,410
such a large surgery must be fixed in shape.

773
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,700
Each person's skull is different.

774
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,820
This is a problem.

775
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,180
It's like trying to combine

776
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,570
two different models of cars

777
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,970
using a mold of a third car.

778
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,300
Although the mold we have isn't very precise,

779
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,130
it can help us

780
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,380
remove the similarly sized tissue as much as possible.

781
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,090
After excising the tissue from both sides,

782
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,740
we can immediately proceed with the anastomosis.

783
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,180
Then we can focus on

784
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,130
adjusting the blood vessels and nerves as needed.

785
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,610
For this kind of emergency surgery,

786
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,570
custom molds are simply unrealistic.

787
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,740
We now

788
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,340
have less than five hours left.

789
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,740
Every minute we delay

790
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,450
lowers our chances of success.

791
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,780
Alright, I agree with Qiao Yang's plan.

792
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,260
Okay, I think

793
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,220
this plan is feasible.

794
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,180
Let's get started.

795
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,090
We need to work quickly.

796
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,570
Mr. Chen!

797
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,220
Mr. Chen!

798
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,970
The donor's family has changed their mind about the donation.

799
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,260
They want to meet the surgery leader.

800
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,300
The process is fine.

801
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,340
Right now, the person causing a scene outside is Deng Lan's father.

802
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,530
Actually, he initially agreed,

803
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,050
but when he got to the door, he regretted it.

804
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,180
Move aside.

805
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,300
Move over.

806
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,260
Stop taking photos, move aside!

807
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,530
Excuse me.

808
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,380
It's cold on the floor.

809
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,860
Let's get up first.

810
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,570
Sir,

811
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,050
I'm the director of this hospital.

812
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,740
If you have any concerns, you can speak to me.

813
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,050
Sir,

814
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,740
I'm not an unreasonable person.

815
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,410
Donating organs is a good deed,

816
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,380
and it was my son's choice.

817
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,900
I should support it.

818
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,090
But when I arrived at the hospital,

819
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,450
that's when I found out what was happening.

820
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,340
Donating a heart or a kidney

821
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,050
is fine,

822
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,260
but removing the face?

823
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,010
I just can't accept it.

824
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,900
We completely understand.

825
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,740
When I'm dead,

826
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,700
I won't even be able to recognize my son in the heaven anymore.

827
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,090
Where's the hospitalization form?I can't find it.

828
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,740
Do you have it?

829
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,900
Which one is the hospitalization form?

830
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,970
I only have a payment slip here.

831
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,050
Move aside.

832
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,380
Excuse me.

833
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,260
Wait here, I'll go get them.

834
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,740
This person...

835
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,090
How could they bump into someone

836
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,490
and not even apologize!

837
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,740
Watch your step!

838
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,220
Be careful!

839
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,130
Watch your step!

840
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,860
Watch your step,

841
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,450
there's a sheet over there.

842
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,930
Dacheng!

843
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,740
Qi Da Cheng!

844
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,260
Qi Dacheng,

845
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,570
can you hear me?

846
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,740
Does your ear feel like it's covered?

847
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,930
No.

848
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:07,930
Do you feel dizzy?

849
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,780
No.

850
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,740
Do you feel anxious?

851
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,050
No.

852
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,930
This is strange.

853
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,410
Do a CT scan of the brain

854
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,740
to rule out the possibility of epilepsy.

855
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,010
What was the blood pressure you measured earlier?

856
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,860
160.

857
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,130
No history of high blood pressure?

858
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,050
No.

859
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,050
No high blood pressure, no anemia.

860
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,260
He suddenly fainted.

861
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,380
Has this happened before?

862
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,450
No, never.

863
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,090
Alright, I'll make some arrangements.

864
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,860
Doctor,

865
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,740
this won't affect my surgery, right?

866
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,090
Let's first conduct a full check-up.

867
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,570
The donor's family is causing a scene in the waiting room.

868
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,260
How can we perform surgery without resolving the donor issue?

869
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,610
Even if we can convince them,

870
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,900
we can't take an uncertain risk.

871
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,260
If the patient's condition is unstable,

872
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,970
performing surgery would be irresponsible.

873
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,050
Then we solve the problem.

874
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,740
We've been preparing for five years,

875
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,050
and today is the day.

876
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,260
We've waited five years

877
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,010
just to find the right donor.

878
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,380
Now, there are only four hours left,

879
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,260
and you want us to give up? That'd be the responsible thing to do?

880
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,260
Mr. Chu,

881
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,740
how's Qi Dacheng's condition?

882
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,220
Have you found the cause of the fainting?

883
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,340
From the reports we've gotten,

884
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,820
everything is normal.

885
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,860
Since that's the case,

886
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,610
let's pause for now.

887
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,490
I know no one's willing to give up,

888
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,660
but Qi Dacheng's sudden condition

889
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,660
is inexplicable.

890
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,010
If we rush blindly,

891
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,010
it could lead to regrets no one can fix.

892
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,570
Let's call it quits for now.

893
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,260
Everyone, return to your posts.

894
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,050
You're not gonna give up too, are you?

895
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,570
What are you thinking?

896
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,490
Listen to me.

897
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,260
No one's allowed to move Deng Lan's body.

898
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,130
Wait for my call.

899
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,660
Wait a moment.

900
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,260
Qiao Yang, what are you doing?

901
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,130
I just wanna ask one question.

902
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,900
Stop being reckless.

903
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,930
Who can guarantee

904
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,860
that we'll have another donor?

905
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,380
If we give up now,

906
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,490
we're only giving up on these five years of preparation.

907
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,970
What about Qi Dacheng?

908
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,050
If we give up now,

909
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,570
it could mean giving up on his entire life.

910
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,380
We only have three hours left.

911
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,050
In these three hours,

912
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,610
if we can't solve Qi Dacheng's issue,

913
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,410
I'll give up.

914
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,050
But until then,

915
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,090
I ask everyone to make sure to keep Deng Lan's body.

916
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,090
Give Qi Dacheng one more chance.

917
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,970
Please!

918
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,090
Please!

919
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,450
What did you have for breakfast?

920
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,090
We were so focused on getting checked this morning

921
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,260
that I didn't eat anything.

922
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,900
Don't worry.

923
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,260
Think carefully,

924
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,700
besides the tests,

925
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,700
did you do anything else?

926
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,410
I came straight to the hospital for the check-up.

927
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,050
I didn't do anything else.

928
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,930
Do you have a family history of illnesses?

929
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:06,740
What do you mean?

930
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,740
Like high blood pressure, heart disease, etc.

931
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,700
in your grandparents' generation.

932
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,260
No.

933
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,900
The CT scan result of his brain is out.

934
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,090
Everything looks normal.

935
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,450
Why are you so out of breath?

936
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,090
There were too many people,

937
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,380
and the elevator was too slow.

938
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,090
I ran up the stairs in one go.

939
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,900
I know you're in a hurry.

940
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,380
Earlier, you said you dropped the report.

941
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,300
You ran downstairs to pick it up?

942
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,220
Move aside.

943
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,260
Slow down.

944
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,570
Watch your step.

945
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,570
Is that when you started feeling itchy?

946
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,380
And then fainted?

947
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,740
Roll up your pant leg.

948
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,930
I pressed the elevator button.

949
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,410
What happened to her?

950
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,260
I'll talk to you later.

951
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,410
I'm free in a bit.

952
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,260
Mr. Qin,

953
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,380
let me introduce you.

954
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,050
These three are evaluation experts from the consulting company.

955
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,090
This is Mr. Qin.

956
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,740
Hello.

957
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,610
Qing, come.

958
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,740
Take the experts for a tour first.

959
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,610
I need to speak with Mr. Qin for a moment.

960
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,380
This way, please.

961
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,410
Consulting company?

962
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:24,740
What's going on?

963
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,610
I was the same reaction when I saw it.

964
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,260
Mr. Chu and the two department heads are doing a face transplant today.

965
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,930
Maybe we can discuss this when they return.

966
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,860
No,

967
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,260
it's better to talk about it now

968
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,700
because they're not here.

969
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,410
Otherwise, it might be a bit awkward.

970
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,570
To be honest,

971
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,740
in the past few months,

972
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,570
dermatology and plastic surgery

973
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,660
have been drifting further apart in performance.

974
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,900
With the growing strength

975
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,050
of our experts,

976
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,740
our surgical capabilities are stronger than ever,

977
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,180
but the performance keeps declining.

978
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,900
Doesn't that warrant some serious reflection?

979
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,010
Can I say this

980
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,010
in front of Mr. Chu

981
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,380
and the two department heads?

982
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,490
It's the truth, so it's okay to speak openly.

983
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,450
Since we're being honest,

984
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,130
let me show you this.

985
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,570
If we merge the staff and assets,

986
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,740
we could reduce costs by at least 30%.

987
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,130
Has Tang seen this data?

988
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,050
This was arranged by Tang.

989
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:33,260
Otherwise, would I have been able to invite these evaluation experts?

990
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,130
Mr. Qin,

991
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,970
take this and review it.

992
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,970
I'll accompany the experts for now.
