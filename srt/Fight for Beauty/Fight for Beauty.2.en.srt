1
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,930
What's wrong?

2
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,490
Mr. Ji,

3
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,130
don't you remember me?

4
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,690
You do look a bit familiar.

5
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,940
I'm Zhou Jingwen.

6
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,170
I'm from the Class of 2006.

7
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,850
You were my supervisor during my residency.

8
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,410
I remember you liked to eat

9
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,940
the hawthorn cake from the shop behind the campus.

10
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,730
Am I right?

11
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,450
You remember that too?

12
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,690
Mr. Ji, I'll leave you two.

13
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,100
Okay.

14
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,450
Zhou Jingwen...

15
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,450
Sorry, I don't remember you clearly.

16
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,340
It's okay if you don't remember me.

17
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,820
As long as I remember you, that's what matters.

18
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,010
I still remember back when we were at school,

19
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,500
we used to talk about you often.

20
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,340
Class of 2006...

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,850
So you're classmates with Qiao Yang?

22
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,260
Yes.

23
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,570
But I'm not really close with her.

24
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,100
Mr. Ji,

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,130
it's settled.

26
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,260
Meet me at Gemu the day after tomorrow.

27
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,610
I can't promise that.

28
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,660
I'm tied up right now.

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,500
No worries. I'll ask you again tomorrow.

30
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,010
This year's summit forum is at this hospital?

31
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,660
Yes.

32
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,100
Can you invite me?

33
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,980
Okay, I'll arrange it for you.

34
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,260
Great!

35
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,100
Qiao Yang.

36
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,540
Dr. Qiao,

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,610
look who it is!

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,290
Your old classmate Zhou Jingwen.

39
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,340
Mr. Ji,

40
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,170
the video meeting is about to start.

41
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,130
Almost forgot!

42
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,410
You two keep talking. I'll go ahead.

43
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,730
Zhou,

44
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,290
let's keep in touch.

45
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,940
Sure, I'll be in touch.

46
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,570
Zhou Jingwen,

47
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,660
you don't deserve to be a doctor.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,570
Qiao Yang,

49
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,850
we'll see about that.

50
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,810
I remember when I came here to report with my teacher back then,

51
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,100
I was trembling with fear.

52
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,850
I only dared to look at the floor.

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,140
Now, this building feels pretty tall.

54
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,580
It was built just two years ago.

55
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,410
It's been over ten years since I last came back, and there's a lot of change.

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,410
So, you came back to the Third Hospital just for nostalgia?

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,700
That's not it.

58
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,340
I came to talk to Mr. Ji about collaboration,

59
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,250
to see if he might come to Gemu.

60
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,490
I knew it.

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,020
You didn't dare come back for ten years,

62
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,340
and now you're here to poach people.

63
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,980
You haven't changed one bit.

64
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,370
I'm being honest and upfront.

65
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,050
I offered

66
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,170
better terms than what we offered Du Jun.

67
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,290
I think Mr. Ji might be a little interested.

68
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,730
That guy gets excited over anything, even discounted eggs at the supermarket.

69
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,340
Mr. Ji is about to perform a surgery,

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,930
a highly influential one.

71
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,050
After it's done,

72
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,370
he'll definitely be one of the top three craniofacial surgeons.

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,410
It's normal for people to try to poach him.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,410
If you're interested in Gemu,

75
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,050
I can consider it.

76
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,140
Quit that thought.

77
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,370
At your private hospital,

78
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,170
you spend the whole day performing double eyelid surgeries.

79
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,050
My back can't handle

80
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,490
that kind of strain.

81
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,610
You might not know this,

82
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,410
but private hospitals occupy 80% of the market.

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,580
In the future, if these patients want cosmetic surgery,

84
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,490
they'll definitely come to Gemu.

85
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,100
Maybe.

86
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,700
But I know that anyone who gets something wrong at your place

87
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,930
will definitely come back to the Third Hospital to find me.

88
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,140
Most experts do not suggest

89
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,220
complete surgical removal and think that a 20 percent removal

90
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,340
is the most ideal case.

91
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,700
The only person supporting you on this is me.

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,730
Yeah, indeed, my teacher.

93
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,730
Keep going to say.

94
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,020
You definitely will say but...

95
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,490
However,

96
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,980
what a true doctor should be concerned about

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,220
is how to elevate a patient's pain.

98
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,980
The question right now isn't about choosing the better surgical plan,

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,850
but rather, are you willing

100
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,780
to risk your entire career for this?

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,020
Dr. Yang,

102
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,980
I would say yes.

103
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,980
I've been waiting for this moment

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,290
every second of my life.

105
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,020
And the chances of dying?

106
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,540
Recklessness isn't bravery.

107
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,810
Can you decrease the chances of dying to a minimum?

108
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,290
Telling me to take a gamble,

109
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,780
like I'm your little lab rat.

110
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,460
If the surgery succeeds,

111
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,700
you'll be famous.

112
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,610
If it fails,

113
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,490
I'm the one who dies.

114
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,020
Are you crazy?

115
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,140
If it goes wrong,

116
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,410
it'll ruin her, and it'll ruin you.

117
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,140
I'm not doing your damn surgery!

118
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,370
Even if I did, it'd be useless.

119
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,700
We'll have more opportunities later, right?

120
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,850
What opportunities?

121
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,610
More chances to make a monster?

122
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,980
This huge lump is still there.

123
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,660
If I don't do it, I'm a monster.

124
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,250
If I do it, I'm still a monster.

125
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,050
So, you don't accept

126
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,170
the 20% partial resection plan, right?

127
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,370
Absolutely not!

128
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,170
Surgery is meant to relieve the patient's suffering,

129
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,460
not to satisfy a doctor's desire for practice.

130
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,490
You promised I could get a full resection!

131
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,250
You're a liar!

132
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,850
Monsters deserve to be deceived?

133
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,020
Monsters deserve to die?

134
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,410
I just want to live like a normal person.

135
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,770
Welcome to our hospital.

136
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,370
Our hospital has a history of 100 years,

137
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,820
and it is a comprehensive hospital

138
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,490
integrating research, teaching, and clinical services.

139
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,580
Currently, we have

140
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,370
206 chief physicians,

141
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,730
304 associate chief physicians,

142
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,850
and 407 attending physicians.

143
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,850
Mr. Chen,

144
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,340
is this you?

145
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,220
Yes,

146
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,770
why, doesn't it look like me?

147
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,420
No.

148
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,650
Seems like your hospital is hard to manage.

149
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,250
Look how much it has worn you out.

150
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,610
You've lost at least 30 pounds.

151
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,060
It's not just 30 pounds.

152
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,180
It's 50 pounds.

153
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,220
50 pounds?

154
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,300
All thanks to them,

155
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,180
my fatty liver has recovered.

156
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,650
This is Cheng Cheng, chief physician.

157
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,850
- Mr. Cheng. - Nice to meet you, Ms. Liu.

158
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,420
Welcome.

159
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,250
Nice to meet you.

160
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,180
This is Ji Xuefeng,

161
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,300
associate Director of the Department of Plastic Surgery,

162
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,580
and our subject leader.

163
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,180
Nice to meet you.

164
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:37,980
You too.

165
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,460
You're so young and talented.

166
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,100
You're too kind.

167
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,700
Mr. Chen,

168
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,820
are these all the elites in the plastic surgery department?

169
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,420
Yes, they are.

170
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,340
Ms. Liu,

171
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,820
nice to meet you.

172
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,180
I'm Zhou Jingwen, Director of the Plastic Surgery Department at Gemu.

173
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,490
I come here to observe and learn today.

174
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,180
Gemu...

175
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,770
I'm Qiao Yang,

176
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,580
a Plastic Surgery Physician.

177
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,940
Sorry,

178
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,060
I'm off today.

179
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,180
I specifically came over

180
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,770
because I wanted to share with you

181
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,650
a special case from our hospital.

182
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,370
Please, this way.

183
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,850
Please.

184
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,060
Choosing the full resection surgery

185
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,940
is a huge challenge for our hospital

186
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,420
and the entire team.

187
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,010
We are taking a great risk.

188
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,980
Pass it please.

189
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,490
As you can see,

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,100
this patient of mine

191
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,890
is a young girl,

192
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,220
only 23 years old.

193
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,980
If, for the next few decades,

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,490
she has to live

195
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,300
with a face like this,

196
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,180
she'll never have a day

197
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,010
of peace and happiness.

198
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,130
So, after in-depth discussions

199
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,250
with the patient

200
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,490
and her family,

201
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,610
we decided to take a chance

202
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,220
and fight for her future.

203
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,700
The preliminary plan

204
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,460
is in your hands。

205
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,460
Please feel free to offer your advice.

206
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,420
Dr. Qiao.

207
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,300
The plan is still not mature.

208
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,700
She's stepping into unknown territory here.

209
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,100
But we'd love to hear your opinions.

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,340
This young girl has really been through a lot.

211
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,610
Fang Ting, don't worry,

212
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,180
leave it to Dr. Ji, there's no problem.

213
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,490
Our hospital is also paying special attention to this case,

214
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,300
especially with this full resection surgery.

215
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,340
It's truly remarkable.

216
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,610
Only someone as courageous as Dr. Ji is willing

217
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,850
to take the risk with the patient.

218
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,370
You truly are a role model for us.

219
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,460
It's a shared risk between the patient and the doctor,

220
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,130
but of course, the most important prerequisite

221
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,980
is that we must have our own judgment.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,180
Mr. Ji has led us through

223
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,010
a very detailed pre-surgical discussion,

224
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,490
and we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation

225
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,100
of all the risks.

226
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,060
Our whole team

227
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,180
will face any potential issues

228
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,730
with the clinical experience

229
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,820
we've accumulated over the decades.

230
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,370
So, we are quite confident

231
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,820
about this full resection surgery.

232
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,610
Of course, there have been a lot of opposing voices in our department.

233
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,730
Ms. Liu,

234
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,610
you may not remember,

235
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,370
but the year I graduated,

236
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,490
you came to our school for a lecture.

237
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,220
You said on stage,

238
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,730
"Every advancement in medicine

239
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,060
requires overcoming opposition,"

240
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,700
and "Every development in medicine

241
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,300
requires daring to be the first in the world."

242
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,490
Thank you.

243
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,730
You remember that very clearly.

244
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,490
Thank you.

245
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,850
Your words have left a deep impression on us.

246
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,340
So, this time,

247
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,940
Mr. Ji really bears tremendous pressure.

248
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,610
Especially Ms. Li,

249
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,980
who has given the greatest support

250
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,610
to the full resection plan.

251
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,340
Look at this,

252
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,490
they've really put a lot of effort into this plan.

253
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,130
Young girl,

254
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,370
with such a dedicated attending physician,

255
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,420
you must not give up hope, okay?

256
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,300
Can I have a copy of the plan?

257
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,980
I see every one has one.

258
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,460
Sorry, we ran out of paper.

259
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,700
Mr. Chen,

260
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,220
let us know when you're doing the surgery.

261
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,180
We'd all love to observe together.

262
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,820
Okay?

263
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,650
Definitely.

264
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,300
You're always welcome to visit and give guidance.

265
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,420
I know you.

266
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,530
You've always looked down on the people in the department.

267
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,890
Don't even talk about your colleagues.

268
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,490
Me, my parents, your dad,

269
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,060
who have you ever cared about?

270
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,940
Who have you ever respected?

271
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,010
There's no one in this world you care about.

272
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,770
You only care about yourself.

273
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,370
Thank you for the high praise.

274
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,610
What did Ms. Li say?

275
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,940
Do you think by pulling this stunt,

276
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,300
she'll just relent?

277
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,340
What if something goes wrong?

278
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,180
What about your future then?

279
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,940
Full resection is what I want.

280
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,770
Fang Ting has the right to live a normal life.

281
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,700
You don't have to always be so stubborn.

282
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,890
She's not Qiao Hui.

283
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,650
Are you done now?

284
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,890
It's been so many years already.

285
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,700
Alright, enough.

286
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,980
Ms. Li disagrees.

287
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,890
But Fang Ting went to see her.

288
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,730
She said either the full resection,

289
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,700
or she'd leave the hospital immediately.

290
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,370
Tomorrow at 8 AM, there will be a consultation with all the experts in the hospital.

291
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,420
They'll study your plan.

292
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,580
You'll be the lead surgeon.

293
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,940
Happy?

294
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,010
Mr. Ji isn't coming?

295
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,130
You really have fast news.

296
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,980
If it weren't for my meeting with the boss of Jinli

297
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,490
this morning at the Sheraton,

298
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,730
I'd have gone too.

299
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,370
I had eyes everywhere at the scene.

300
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,530
Han from the Fourth Hospital, Ma from the Seventh Hospital,

301
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,820
and Lu from Huakehui.

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,300
They're all my friends for many years.

303
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,610
They gave me a live broadcast the whole time.

304
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,580
I heard someone made a surprise entrance.

305
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,100
Sorry,

306
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,370
I still need to check some information.

307
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,180
Sir,

308
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,060
I got into this school to study under you for my master's degree.

309
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,940
I had the same score as Qiao Yang,

310
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,490
so why did you choose her over me?

311
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,370
Zhou Jingwen, right?

312
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,890
I finally got it.

313
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,300
For clinical students applying to a master's program,

314
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,850
only one person can be chosen from each department.

315
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,730
For this,

316
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,420
I even went to see Mr. Feng of your department.

317
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,700
He scolded me, saying,

318
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,530
"Don't be too greedy.

319
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,770
Not all good students

320
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,060
can go to you alone."

321
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,820
I tried my best.

322
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,770
There was nothing I could do.

323
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,250
There was nothing I could do.

324
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,460
Just because Qiao Yang is from your department?

325
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,850
Whether to choose her or not

326
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,010
has nothing to do

327
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,530
with her being from my department.

328
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,850
I picked her by drawing lots.

329
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,370
What?

330
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,890
I'm gonna smoke a cigarette.

331
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,060
Your brother gave me this.

332
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,300
There's twenty thousand in it.

333
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,890
Take it.

334
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,610
Otherwise, he won't sleep well.

335
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,650
He's been like this since he was a kid.

336
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,100
He's such a timid guy.

337
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,130
If you're scared, think about it some more.

338
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,300
It's not too late to regret now.

339
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,340
Back in middle school,

340
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,220
the tumor wasn't this big.

341
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,340
My classmates gave me a nickname, "Golden Horn".

342
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,060
I got so mad

343
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,060
I tore up their homework.

344
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,100
Later, the tumor grew bigger and bigger,

345
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,940
but my popularity got better and better.

346
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,490
All the essays about good deeds

347
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,650
were about me.

348
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,100
But after that,

349
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,100
people's first reaction to seeing me was fear.

350
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,250
They called me a monster, a freak.

351
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,580
They said I look like a horse, a fish, or a dinosaur.

352
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,220
Basically, not like a human.

353
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,140
This is me as a kid.

354
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,330
You were pretty cute back then.

355
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,330
How about now?

356
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,290
A bit chubbier.

357
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,660
People always say

358
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,620
being cute as a kid is all about genetics.

359
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,180
Now I'm counting on you.

360
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,050
Thinking about it now,

361
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,090
"Golden Horn" was kind of a cute name.

362
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,530
Ting,

363
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,010
don't be nervous.

364
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,660
It'll be over soon.

365
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,330
Didn't you want to go to Xinjiang?

366
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,620
I'll take you there.

367
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,140
We can go wherever we want,

368
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,090
okay?

369
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,180
Please stop here.

370
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,770
Don't be scared.

371
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,620
Brother,

372
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,860
when it's done,

373
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,220
just focus on your own stuff.

374
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,700
Don't wear yourself out like this anymore.

375
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,620
Don't be afraid.

376
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,250
Ji,

377
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,900
your ex-wife is really something.

378
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,180
After all that mess, she's still the lead surgeon.

379
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,460
Do you have something on her or what?

380
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,700
Luo,

381
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,570
there's a reason why you're losing hair.

382
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,290
Don't take it the wrong way.

383
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,330
Look at your current wife.

384
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,570
Wasn't she a nurse in our department before?

385
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,700
Now she's a full-time housewife,

386
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,380
doing facials and looking after kids every day.

387
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,010
Nice and easy.

388
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,810
But Qiao Yang just doesn't know how to enjoy life.

389
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,730
She's here every day,

390
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,460
fighting with us like it's life or death.

391
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,530
Luo, your wife is an executive at a Fortune 500 company,

392
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,700
making way more than a doctor.

393
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,570
So

394
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,290
why are you still here working as my assistant?

395
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,660
Wouldn't it be better to just go home and look after kids?

396
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,220
Not comfortable?

397
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,090
Turns out, I'm also afraid of dying.

398
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,140
I've been in the operating room countless times.

399
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,220
Only once was I the one lying on the table,

400
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,770
as the patient.

401
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,770
I was probably about your age back then.

402
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,420
The doctor told me

403
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,250
to close my eyes.

404
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,010
I said no,

405
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,290
I need to keep them open

406
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,010
because I was scared

407
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,180
it might be my last look at the world.

408
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,290
The lead surgeon was also a woman.

409
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,180
Gray hair,

410
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,330
wearing a big mask,

411
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,460
smiling kindly at me.

412
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,570
She said,

413
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,220
"Don't be afraid.

414
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,330
You're responsible for taking a nap,

415
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,730
and I'm responsible for waking you up."

416
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,090
Today's the same.

417
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,010
You take a nap,

418
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,050
and I'll be the one to wake you up.

419
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,090
Don't be afraid, sweetheart.

420
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,250
What are you all staring at?

421
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,490
Don't you want to get off work or what?

422
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,220
A few days ago, I watched a medical drama.

423
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,140
I don't get it. Why do these shows

424
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,860
always portray surgeries

425
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,530
as either overly serious

426
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,980
or ridiculously tense?

427
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,050
The moment they see bleeding, they start yelling.

428
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,570
"Oh no, bleeding!"

429
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,090
Making such a fuss.

430
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,290
If it's bleeding, just stop it, that's it.

431
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,250
If someone got that scared,

432
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,140
they would've been eliminated back in med school.

433
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,900
The nerves around the eyes are the most concentrated.

434
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,250
Be mindful of nerve protection.

435
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,460
Is there any here?

436
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,010
No, you can make the incision.

437
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,180
This big "potato".

438
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,770
Digging it out of the ground

439
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,330
sure isn't easy.

440
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,980
Please come in.

441
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,290
Come, have a seat.

442
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,090
You've met her, right?

443
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,220
This is Ms. Li from the Department of Plastic Surgery.

444
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,570
Nice to meet you. Have a seat.

445
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,570
Please.

446
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,620
Hello, Ms. Li.

447
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,380
Take a seat.

448
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,010
Ms. Li.

449
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,330
Take a seat.

450
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:38,810
Alright,

451
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,700
let's watch the surgery.

452
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,220
Come.

453
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,570
Sit.

454
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,140
Please.

455
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,700
Hello.

456
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,700
Have a seat.

457
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,700
It's started.

458
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,420
The bleeding's a bit much.

459
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,330
Stop the bleeding first.

460
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,050
Blood pressure?

461
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,980
Ninety-seven over seventy-five.

462
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,980
The excision's going well.

463
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,700
If everything goes smoothly,

464
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,220
it'll be done in half an hour at most.

465
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,530
Gauze.

466
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,330
There's too much bleeding.

467
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,090
I can't see the source.

468
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,980
Transfusion.

469
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,490
Suction.

470
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,660
Right here.

471
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,010
Blood pressure?

472
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,180
Seventy-six over forty-five.

473
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,570
Transfusion.

474
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,900
Where's the blood?

475
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,620
I'll get it.

476
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,380
The blood bag's here.

477
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,140
Found the bleeding point.

478
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,490
Cauterize it.

479
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,250
Don't be afraid.

480
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,570
You're responsible for taking a nap,

481
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,530
and I'm responsible for waking you up.

482
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,570
Blood pressure is stable.

483
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,460
Continue the surgery.

484
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,900
Truly breathtaking.

485
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,420
Indeed.

486
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,090
This surgery was amazing.

487
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,660
Every step was handled perfectly.

488
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,770
Simply flawless.

489
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,010
The future truly belongs to the young generation.

490
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,250
It's impressive how capable they are.

491
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,770
Alright.

492
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,010
Next, we'll do some examinations.

493
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,250
Don't worry.

494
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,420
We'll develop a suitable plan for you.

495
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,250
Alright.

496
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,380
Thank you, doctor.

497
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,290
You're welcome.

498
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,090
Don't be afraid.

499
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,050
Rong, don't be scared.

500
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,620
Ms. Zhou,

501
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,730
in this case, she'll have to face the public again.

502
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,460
Isn't that too cruel?

503
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,490
The real cruelty was inflicted

504
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,900
by the person who scarred her.

505
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,570
As for making the surgery public,

506
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,730
it was her decision.

507
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,860
But will all these scar repairs

508
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,420
really help her?

509
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,140
Then you tell me, what will help her?

510
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,250
Beast.

511
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,770
An absolute beast.

512
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,620
How could anyone do that?

513
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,770
I did the calculations.

514
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,620
There are over 30 large scars,

515
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,660
each over three centimeters.

516
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,810
Including the smaller ones, there are over 70 scars in total.

517
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,860
Oh my God.

518
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,250
That's just inhuman.

519
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,860
Just the major scar repairs alone

520
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,250
will take at least six hours.

521
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,250
Six hours

522
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,570
for scar repairs?

523
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,250
If it were you,

524
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,810
would you be interested in this surgery?

525
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,660
Three hours.

526
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,290
The patient has agreed to a public surgery.

527
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,140
Ms. Zhou,

528
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,380
your plan is truly bold.

529
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,380
Look around,

530
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,050
who in our hospital can take on this surgery?

531
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,810
Who dares to take on such an operation?

532
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,940
A team of eight hands, maybe.

533
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,140
Four people working together.

534
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,810
The problem is, can Jiang Rong be split into four parts?

535
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,860
Can you stop being so sarcastic?

536
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,700
Ms. Li,

537
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,810
can we arrange top media coverage for the surgery day?

538
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,140
Of course we can.

539
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,140
If you can complete the surgery in three hours,

540
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,490
I'll get all the famous bloggers from every platform

541
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,250
for you.

542
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,460
That's great!

543
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,810
Just three hours.

544
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,010
Not only will we repair the scars on the front,

545
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,660
we'll also perform abdominal tightening.

546
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,250
I'll make the plan as soon as possible.

547
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,250
Three hours, two surgeries?

548
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,140
103, change the fluid.

549
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,330
Fang Ting, right?

550
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,380
Yes.

551
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,940
Did Dr. Qiao come by?

552
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,460
She got promoted.

553
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,420
She's no longer in this department.

554
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,010
So she doesn't care about us anymore?

555
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,620
Alright, all done.

556
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,660
Thank you.

557
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,940
Qiao Yang,

558
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,490
congratulations.

559
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,900
Qiao Yang?

560
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,180
She's the Director

561
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,860
of the Hair Transplant Center.

562
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,460
Yes.

563
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,250
Qiao Yang.

564
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,940
The Director.

565
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,770
Now that you're leaving, it might be hard to see you again.

566
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,460
Given your situation,

567
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,140
I'll see you soon.

568
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,810
Stubborn as always.

569
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,180
This decision was made by Chen.

570
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,180
Fang Ting's surgery went well,

571
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,140
and the hospital values her highly.

572
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,620
Last month, Sui retired,

573
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,490
leaving the Hair Transplant Center without a director.

574
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,700
It's a good opportunity to train her.

575
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,460
Didn't you two get divorced?

576
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,090
Why are you still speaking up for her?

577
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,660
Aren't you afraid your wife will get jealous?

578
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,460
No.

579
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,380
I just think it's a pity for her skills

580
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,940
to be wasted in hair transplant.

581
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,940
She was born to perform surgeries.

582
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,700
And you know

583
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,770
her bad temper.

584
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,620
If she stays there too long,

585
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,420
one day she might...

586
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,730
I suggest you look at the bigger picture.

587
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,220
We are a department of plastic surgery,

588
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,980
different from other departments.

589
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,530
Safety and discipline cannot tolerate any mistakes.

590
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,420
The more skilled you are,

591
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,490
the more cautious you must be.

592
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,940
Qiao Yang is an exceptional talent.

593
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,570
Yeah.

594
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,290
I know this better than you.

595
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,770
Yeah.

596
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,860
In terms of medical talent,

597
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,330
passion for work,

598
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,140
and dedication,

599
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,290
she's incomparable.

600
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,010
That's why we must protect her well.

601
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,140
Grind her temper down completely.

602
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,050
I'm doing this for her own good.

603
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,900
- Don't worry. - But Ms. Li...

604
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,980
I think she...

605
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,940
Ms. Li...

606
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,180
Waiter.

607
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,220
Can I have the menu?

608
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,730
Here.

609
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,660
I'll have what she's having,

610
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,770
and two bottles of beer.

611
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,050
- Sure. - Hu.

612
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,140
What's the most expensive set meal you have here?

613
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,810
The "Sea, Land, and Air" set meal, 788.

614
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,730
One of those, it's on her.

615
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,460
No problem.

616
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,860
No cilantro, please.

617
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,530
Okay.

618
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,010
I remember you don't like cilantro.

619
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,770
You probably won't believe this, but...

620
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,290
When we were in school,

621
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,730
you were the person I admired the most.

622
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,220
I still remember when you won the top prize

623
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,490
at the student award in your first year.

624
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,460
And in 2010,

625
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,700
that paper you wrote

626
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,140
in Chinese Journal of Otolaryngology...

627
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,460
About using auricular cartilage

628
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,860
to repair unilateral cleft lip nasal deformities.

629
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,900
I haven't forgotten, right?

630
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,900
Back then, I knew...

631
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,900
You were the only one from our school

632
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,050
who could really make it.

633
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,940
I can't compare.

634
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,090
Excuse me.

635
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,330
You know, as doctors...

636
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,010
We work ourselves to exhaustion in surgery, working non-stop.

637
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,730
And we still have to maintain good doctor-patient relationships,

638
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,180
otherwise, we'll get complaints.

639
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,460
I bet in big hospitals, it's even more troublesome.

640
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,900
The worst is when people disturb me while eating.

641
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,220
What exactly do you want?

642
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,620
You have one minute.

643
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,660
We're both in the same field,

644
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,140
why haven't we crossed paths before?

645
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,050
We didn't have a good conversation when we met that day.

646
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,460
Shall we?

647
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,730
I'll drive.

648
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,530
Cheers.

649
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,980
Forty seconds left.

650
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,380
Mom!

651
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,010
Mom!

652
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,660
It's been half a year already.

653
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,620
Her husband is about to be sentenced.

654
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,530
Jiang Rong wants to undergo scar repair surgery.

655
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,050
This surgery is difficult and it's a hot topic.

656
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,570
I think you're the only one for the job.

657
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,770
How much does a surgery at the Third Hospital pay?

658
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,530
I'll pay you three times as much.

659
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,620
Qiao Yang,

660
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,730
think about it.

661
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,330
I really admire people like you.

662
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,420
You'll do whatever it takes to achieve your goal.

663
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,130
You can act

664
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,780
like nothing ever happened.

665
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,690
Don't forget to pay the bill.

666
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,860
What's going on here?

667
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,650
She had a botched plastic surgery.

668
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,380
After that botched surgery,

669
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,170
her boyfriend dumped her.

670
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,050
Who? Qiao Hui?

671
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,050
She got addicted to plastic surgery.

672
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,260
Isn't that ridiculous?

673
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,050
The fee is based on the number of hair follicles.

674
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,610
For your situation,

675
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,610
about 2,800 units.

676
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,490
It'll cost quite a bit.

677
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,740
But the hair follicles at the back

678
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,090
of your head aren't that many.

679
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,420
They won't be enough to support the front.

680
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,780
I think that little cap you're wearing is just fine.

681
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,170
Forget it.

682
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,300
What the hell?

683
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,570
I can't even fix my hair.

684
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,260
Next.

685
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,780
Mr. Ji.

686
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,170
Even you have needs?

687
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,570
No one's after me.

688
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,490
No one?

689
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,260
Haven't seen patients in a while.

690
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,170
I haven't had enough yet.

691
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,690
Ms. Li asked you to do hair treatment,

692
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,860
you actually agreed?

693
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,340
This isn't like you at all.

694
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,490
Everything has a price.

695
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,780
I figured it out already.

696
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,380
After Fang Ting's surgery,

697
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,050
she'd give me a piece of her mind.

698
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,900
Otherwise, how would she keep control?

699
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,530
From now on, we'll be equals.

700
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,780
I'm also a director.

701
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,420
You're not normal.

702
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,690
Have you made up your mind?

703
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,570
You won't be able to perform surgery here.

704
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,010
You sure you can accept that?

705
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,570
Do I have any other choice?

706
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,010
It doesn't matter anymore.

707
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,260
There are plenty of surgeries I can do outside.

708
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,690
Wait a minute.

709
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,090
You're not planning to leave, are you?

710
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,050
They say

711
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:28,900
you've been in touch with the Plastic Surgery

712
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,980
and Surgical Association Hospital.

713
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,490
Why did you come today?

714
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,530
Spying for military intelligence?

715
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,980
Or did Ms. Li send you

716
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,530
to check on my attitude?

717
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,900
Having another fight with your wife?

718
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,530
It's about your dad.

719
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,420
Isn't that Yang?

720
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,570
You haven't been back in a long time.

721
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,210
Auntie Qian.

722
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,900
Come visit more often!

723
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,460
Okay!

724
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,010
Yang?

725
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,050
Why can't the door open?

726
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,420
The lock's broken. We replaced it with a new one.

727
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,460
Where's my dad?

728
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,010
He went out.

729
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,010
Why didn't you say anything before coming?

730
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,780
- Come in. - Wait.

731
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,940
Ji Xuefeng said he went to the emergency room.

732
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,780
Why is he wandering around alone?

733
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,570
He went to buy groceries.

734
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,570
I advised him, but he didn't listen.

735
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,570
Every time he gets sick, he becomes even more stubborn.

736
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,090
When he gets back, you should try talking to him.

737
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,530
I'll go grab some stuff from my room.

738
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,340
Getting married is really troublesome.

739
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,650
I'm not even talking about renovations.

740
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,570
Just tidying up took two weeks.

741
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,820
You stuff is outside.

742
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,210
If you think any of it's useful, feel free to take it.

743
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,260
Um...

744
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,090
There were too many people.

745
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,570
I got stepped on a few times.

746
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,900
Seriously.

747
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,090
Qi loves fish, right?

748
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,570
How about we...

749
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,570
What are you doing here?

750
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:47,980
I'm fine.

751
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,460
It's just gout, an old problem.

752
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,980
Ji Xuefeng's

753
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,570
overreacting.

754
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,050
You can make braised perch now?

755
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,490
That's quite an advanced dish.

756
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,940
Wen Li's cooking still needs improving.

757
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,050
Where's my mom's piano?

758
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,260
I sold it.

759
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,980
That fancy stuff

760
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,090
wasn't useful to us.

761
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,820
Can you please consult me

762
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,210
before selling anything of my mom's in the future?

763
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,820
Also, when you need something, don't always bother Ji Xuefeng.

764
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,820
I'm still alive.

765
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,380
Can't you just call me?

766
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,090
What's wrong with asking him for help?

767
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,940
If he's willing.

768
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,980
Would I be able to reach you?

769
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,570
Would you pick up if I called?

770
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,650
Yang, are you staying for dinner?

771
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,010
You could've told us.

772
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,940
We don't have any good dishes at home.

773
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,690
But there's fish.

774
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,300
I'm not picky.

775
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,460
This year's International Nurses Day,

776
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,860
a series of events were held all over the place...

777
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,210
Your cooking skills have improved.

778
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,260
Not bad, huh?

779
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,420
A few days ago, about your surgery...

780
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,570
The full excision was the right choice.

781
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,980
Have you looked at the plan?

782
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,860
Ji Xuefeng really did a great job.

783
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,420
It's bone fibrous proliferation,

784
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,780
not just a simple fibroma.

785
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,260
The scope of the lesion is large.

786
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,740
It's been growing for seven to eight years.

787
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,050
Complications like fractures are highly probable.

788
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,260
In cases like this,

789
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,530
if you don't remove everything cleanly in one go,

790
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,530
Later,

791
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,050
the orthopedic department will have to clean up after you.

792
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,300
What do you mean?

793
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,530
When we had the consultation, Mr. Wang from the orthopedic department was there.

794
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,530
He had no objection on the plan

795
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,570
with a 20% excision.

796
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,420
Wang Zhi?

797
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,690
Of course,

798
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,900
he wouldn't object.

799
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,460
He never objects.

800
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,780
Recently, the case of a domestic violence death

801
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,940
has been causing continuous public concern. The verdict was given yesterday.

802
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,570
According to reporters,

803
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,460
the defendant's wife is currently under treatment

804
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,860
and did not attend the hearing.

805
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,210
These years of domestic violence incidents

806
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,610
have caused widespread concern from all walks of life.

807
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,130
I can't stand this kind of thing.

808
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,740
They even killed their own child.

809
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,820
Is that still human?

810
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,210
For women, the most important thing is to marry the right person.

811
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,260
If you pick the wrong person,

812
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,860
your whole life is ruined.

813
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,010
How did you come to this conclusion?

814
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:55,940
Let's not talk about others,

815
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,260
just look at Qi's ex-boyfriend.

816
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,900
He's too sly.

817
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,860
There's no good life with him.

818
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,380
It's better now with Dou.

819
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,740
He directly told Qi,

820
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,690
let us handle the wedding.

821
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,090
We'll make all the decisions.

822
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,210
He's a good kid.

823
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,420
Qi's soft.

824
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,570
She's easy to bully.

825
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,260
Take that day, when we were picking the wedding dress.

826
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,820
The saleslady just said a few words,

827
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,780
and she was sold on it.

828
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,570
Wedding dresses

829
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,490
are just one-time items.

830
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,570
Yeah, and it costs more than 20,000 yuan.

831
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,570
Fortunately, your dad made the decision.

832
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,940
That's how we picked the right one.

833
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:32,940
Right?

834
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,050
The red one.

835
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,380
The Chinese-style cheongsam.

836
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,570
How festive!

837
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,050
Are you picking clothes for her wedding?

838
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,090
What's wrong with that?

839
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,300
Well done!

840
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,260
When's Qi's wedding?

841
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:47,740
At the end of the month.

842
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,530
Qiao,

843
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,900
why didn't you tell Yang?

844
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,530
We thought you were too busy.

845
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,780
We were afraid you wouldn't be able to come.

846
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,490
What's she busy with?

847
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,530
She's busy every day now,

848
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,300
planting sesame seeds on people's heads.

849
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,740
Hair transplants are also a surgical specialty.

850
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,340
Can't you show some respect

851
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,210
for other technical departments?

852
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,210
I'm full.

853
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,340
You all enjoy your meal.

854
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,340
If you were half as obedient as Qi,

855
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,860
you wouldn't be in this mess.

856
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,530
Why are you going to do that? What's the point?

857
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,820
Can't people live if they don't have hair on their heads?

858
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,130
Sometimes, I really think that

859
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,050
Ji Xuefeng is actually your real son.

860
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,090
You two have the same values, it's uncanny.

861
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,570
You think it's meaningless.

862
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,570
But some people care.

863
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,570
I have this skill,

864
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:41,010
and I can make people live more decently and beautifully.

865
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,650
How is that meaningless?

866
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,340
What meaning?

867
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,260
Can beauty make you full?

868
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,900
When your mother was at that point,

869
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,490
she couldn't even get off the ground.

870
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,210
But she insisted on wearing a wig

871
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,300
every day.

872
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,860
Did she recover because of that?

873
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,820
It's medicine.

874
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,570
It's my professional skill that can treat her.

875
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,210
But you didn't treat her.

876
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,860
Is this Wang Qi's wedding dress?

877
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:25,740
Yeah.

878
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,570
Give it to me.

879
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:27,490
I'm Wang Qi.
