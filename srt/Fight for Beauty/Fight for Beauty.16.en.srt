1
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,660
Auntie, look!

2
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,820
This is the lake-view apartment I was telling you about.

3
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,850
Over there?

4
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,260
- Right? - That's the park.

5
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,410
Isn't that just a pond?

6
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,770
No, it's right across the bridge.

7
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,210
Hmm... looks nice.

8
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,930
Alright.

9
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,690
As long as you like it,

10
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,690
that's all that matters.

11
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,410
Yeah, we can...

12
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:51,980
Right?

13
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,100
Hello.

14
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,900
This is my daughter.

15
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,460
Hi.

16
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,180
Auntie always talks about

17
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,460
how kind and caring you are.

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,740
Our car's coming soon.

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,620
Why don't you come with us?

20
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,180
Right, Auntie?

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,540
Yeah.

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,290
Where to?

23
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,380
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,490
To check out the apartment.

25
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,730
Auntie didn't mention it?

26
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,660
Here, take a look.

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,890
This lake-view unit

28
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,260
has a fantastic location,

29
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,570
great sunlight,

30
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,850
and a lovely neighborhood,

31
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,690
perfect for retirees!

32
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,610
No, thanks.

33
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,100
It's okay, just have a look.

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,060
The layout is...

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,100
I said no.

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,340
She and I have things to talk about.

37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,010
Alright then.

38
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,410
Auntie, I'll head out.

39
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,690
Let's keep in touch, okay?

40
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,340
Sure.

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,170
Bye!

42
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,290
Take care!

43
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,130
Okay, Auntie.

44
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,980
Don't just chat with random people like that.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,540
Why are you giving them your number?

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,380
These people prey on the elderly, you know that, right?

47
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,100
I know.

48
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,570
Come, sit down.

49
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,850
Listen,

50
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,690
I just play along

51
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,060
with them for fun.

52
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,850
They're so sweet with their words!

53
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,850
They even remind me, "Auntie,

54
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,170
it's raining today,

55
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,820
bring an umbrella!"

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,220
No matter what you say,

57
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,290
how much you say, they never get tired of talking!

58
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,100
And the best part?

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,380
They give out

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,220
free gifts

61
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,540
just for chatting,

62
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,730
eggs,

63
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,170
umbrellas, little fans, toothbrushes...

64
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,500
even bath mitts!

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,730
Do you want some?

66
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,340
Wow, you're sharp.

67
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,340
But aren't you afraid of getting scammed?

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,980
Hey, you haven't eaten yet, have you?

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,540
Come on,

70
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,540
let's go grab a bite at Zhou Kai's restaurant!

71
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,540
- Come. - No,

72
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,170
I'm good.

73
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,260
I just wanted to talk to you for a bit.

74
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,060
Here, have some water.

75
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,100
Do you remember back in high school entrance exams?

76
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,340
I got the top score in the whole town!

77
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,820
You? First place?

78
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,340
Wow, that's impressive.

79
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,610
Back then, you said it was worth celebrating

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,010
and took me out for braised pork trotters.

81
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,380
That was my first time ever eating at a restaurant.

82
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,850
Pork trotters, huh?

83
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,410
That meal was expensive!

84
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,610
And your brother, Zhou Kai,

85
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,820
he was such a troublemaker!

86
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,540
Remember how he slapped

87
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,540
your teacher's son?

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,260
She was furious, demanded a huge compensation

89
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,610
and penalty,

90
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,610
and wanted to expel him.

91
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,570
I was so worried.

92
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,690
Then one day, out of nowhere,

93
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,700
she called me in and said,

94
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,100
"Forget it. No punishment,

95
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,730
no compensation."

96
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,730
That was great news, right?

97
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,170
We had to celebrate!

98
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,170
What was it we ate again?

99
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,220
Braised...

100
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,410
Braised pork trotters.

101
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,490
Oh, by the way, about that house,

102
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,170
look over there, past the bridge.

103
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,290
That young guy already signed for it.

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,410
Over there.

105
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,050
See that little hole over there?

106
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,220
And look, there's a yellow duck!

107
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,850
Surprised?

108
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,850
You're home early.

109
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,250
Have you been waiting long?

110
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,050
Not too bad.

111
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,020
There was a little issue with my intel.

112
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,810
My source told me you'd be home early this afternoon.

113
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,290
I rushed back to get everything ready,

114
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,050
after all, this is our first time

115
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,850
celebrating our wedding anniversary alone.

116
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,610
Let's open the wine!

117
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,660
I brought some dishes to go with it.

118
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,850
I didn't even know you bought this.

119
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,140
I actually made steak for you.

120
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,020
Want to try some?

121
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,100
Maybe later.

122
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,290
Today, I'm really craving braised pork trotters.

123
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,780
Looks good.

124
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,980
What do you call this dish back in your hometown?

125
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,700
Just Minnan-style braised pork trotters.

126
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,700
If you like it,

127
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,220
I can learn how to make it.

128
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,540
Then you can have it anytime.

129
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,810
Otherwise, we're just eating steak over and over again.

130
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,810
No need, you already cook so much.

131
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,100
You don't have to learn this too.

132
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,370
Don't flatter me like that,

133
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,930
or I'll get cocky.

134
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,220
After all, when I proposed,

135
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,250
I made you a bunch of promises.

136
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,140
Like always listening to you,

137
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,140
never letting you feel wronged.

138
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,700
But honestly, I've barely kept any of them.

139
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,050
Except for handling all the household chores,

140
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,490
on that one, I did okay.

141
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,700
Actually, I know how to cook too.

142
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,220
Really?

143
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,250
Yeah, when I was a kid, I cooked at home every day.

144
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,370
You've never really talked much

145
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,540
about your childhood.

146
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,050
You mentioned your family passed away,

147
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,140
so I didn't want to ask,

148
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,540
in case it made you sad.

149
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,460
Tell me about your childhood.

150
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,250
All I remember

151
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,100
is that chubby photo of you I once saw.

152
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,540
What were you like as a kid?

153
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,220
As a kid?

154
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,900
I was dashing and charming,

155
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,930
adored by thousands of girls.

156
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,580
Is that joke too cliche?

157
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,410
Yeah.

158
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,780
Especially with the braised pork trotter.

159
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,610
Maybe it's because my parents

160
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,020
had me pretty late in life.

161
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,370
They loved me very much, of course,

162
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,460
but our home always

163
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,490
felt different from my classmates'.

164
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,490
Other families were always lively and bustling,

165
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,660
but our house was always quiet.

166
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,140
Did I ever tell you

167
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,540
that I was really short as a kid?

168
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,050
I only hit this height

169
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,730
when I got to high school.

170
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,810
I was always seated

171
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,170
in the front row at school.

172
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,490
No one really noticed me.

173
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,930
I didn't have many friends either.

174
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,140
Every day, I'd go to school alone,

175
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,780
then come home,

176
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,900
go straight to my room to read,

177
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,930
and then back to school again.

178
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,220
A simple, repetitive cycle.

179
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,250
I would've never guessed.

180
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,250
Your parents seem so warm and outgoing now,

181
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,140
and you...

182
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,930
I've practically become a social butterfly, right?

183
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,660
Do you know when I started to change?

184
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,700
When I was studying in Germany.

185
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,340
Back then,

186
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,250
I was alone in a foreign country,

187
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,610
with no family, no friends.

188
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,660
I didn't even speak the language.

189
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,340
To practice my speaking,

190
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,730
I forced myself to talk to people more.

191
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,780
Over time,

192
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,220
I ended up opening up.

193
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,140
Back to my childhood,

194
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,340
maybe I was just too lonely back then.

195
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,610
So I always imagined that one day,

196
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,410
when I had a family of my own,

197
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,050
it would be full of laughter and warmth.

198
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,810
Even if there were occasional arguments,

199
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,980
even if the house was sometimes chaotic,

200
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,580
to me,

201
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,730
that's what warmth feels like.

202
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,530
If that's the case,

203
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,130
our home must seem awfully quiet.

204
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,300
You know, one of my most vivid memories

205
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,220
was the first time you spent Chinese New Year at my house.

206
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,220
New Year's Eve,

207
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,610
the whole factory compound

208
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,060
was filled with fireworks and firecrackers,

209
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,940
popping and crackling nonstop.

210
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,490
The Spring Festival Gala was on TV.

211
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,890
My dad, with his loud voice,

212
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,770
was calling up everyone he knew to send New Year's wishes.

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,300
My mom was bustling around,

214
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,730
preparing dishes for the relatives coming over the next day.

215
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,370
You were busy too, walking back and forth,

216
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,300
constantly on the phone,

217
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,890
giving instructions about things at the hospital.

218
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,820
That night

219
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,130
was the happiest night

220
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,340
of my life.

221
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,340
Thinking about it now...

222
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,940
If in that picture,

223
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,340
there was also our child...

224
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,250
That would be perfect.

225
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,300
Do you remember in Munich,

226
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,370
that Turkish supermarket called Ken's?

227
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,420
It was about two kilometers from our hospital.

228
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,130
Of course, I remember.

229
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,850
They had a wrap

230
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,130
that you loved, right?

231
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,250
I didn't love it at all.

232
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,490
It's just that my shift ended at 7 PM,

233
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,610
and that was exactly when they had a 50% discount.

234
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,940
So that was my only choice.

235
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,010
I...

236
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,820
Back then, I actually thought you loved eating those wraps.

237
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,850
So I foolishly bought them for you every day.

238
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,100
If I had known...

239
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,580
The winter of 2017 was especially cold.

240
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,940
Do you remember?

241
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,980
After Oktoberfest, there was a heavy snowfall.

242
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,770
Whenever I had a night shift,

243
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,220
you would bring that wrap

244
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,650
and a cup of coffee to wait for me.

245
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,980
One night, I had to perform an extra surgery,

246
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,610
and by the time I came out, it was past 2 AM.

247
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,770
I didn't see you there,

248
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,220
and I panicked.

249
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,980
I called you,

250
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,460
but your phone was off.

251
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,980
I ran to your department to find you,

252
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,940
and from a distance, I saw you talking to Dr. Chase,

253
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,530
discussing work.

254
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,180
I just sat on a hospital chair, keeping you company,

255
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,220
drinking bitter coffee,

256
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,850
eating that impossibly hard wrap,

257
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,340
staying with you until dawn.

258
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,420
Then, we went back to our apartment together.

259
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,730
Do you remember?

260
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,650
I don't remember at all.

261
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,940
It's like I lost that memory.

262
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,250
I was so terrible back then.

263
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,730
What kind of work could be so important,

264
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,940
- that I had to talk about it at that hour? - You weren't terrible at all.

265
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,460
That night,

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,850
I knew that you were the person I wanted to rely on for the rest of my life.

267
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,850
Because we could work hard together,

268
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,700
talk about work together, endure hardships together.

269
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,460
That night,

270
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,340
was when I felt happiest.

271
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,340
Haven't we

272
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,940
always been like this?

273
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,340
We started Gemu together,

274
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,580
we face

275
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,850
work challenges together.

276
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,180
See? We should communicate

277
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,650
more like this, right?

278
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,980
A lot of problems,

279
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,730
as long as we talk things through,

280
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,100
can be solved.

281
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,370
Right?

282
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,650
You just said that your most beautiful vision

283
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,700
is a family together

284
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,770
with a child.

285
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,820
But to me, that's the scariest,

286
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,420
most terrifying image. Do you know that?

287
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,060
I once told you my family had all passed away.

288
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,220
That was a lie.

289
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,580
This afternoon, I went to see my mother.

290
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,100
I have a younger brother.

291
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,100
Ever since he was born,

292
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,220
my mother saw me as unnecessary.

293
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,370
She never truly loved me.

294
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,700
Stop!

295
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,490
Alright,

296
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,580
stop crying.

297
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,220
I told you to look after your brother.

298
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,890
Why are you crying?

299
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,100
Before, when you said you wanted children,

300
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,700
I just went along with it.

301
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,940
But I never wanted one.

302
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,060
Because my childhood was too painful.

303
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,180
I don't wanna pass that pain

304
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,460
on to the next generation.

305
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,060
So all these years...

306
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,980
I never really understood you.

307
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,650
I'm sorry.

308
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,820
I should've told you the truth.

309
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,580
I was gonna

310
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,530
give you a surprise.

311
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,370
Let's get a divorce.

312
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,730
Done.

313
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,980
We made it through another round.

314
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,850
Gemu's project is officially wrapped up.

315
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,940
From today until the day after tomorrow,

316
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,220
all teams get time off.

317
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,940
You're allowed to go completely off the grid.

318
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,180
Thank you, Ms. Guo!

319
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,730
Xuan,

320
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,820
how about one last hot pot meal together?

321
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,730
No problem.

322
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,490
My treat!

323
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,530
Xuan, you're the best!

324
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:47,980
Guo,

325
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,180
I gotta bow down to you for this.

326
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,420
Go ahead, then.

327
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,770
Let me see you do it.

328
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,130
I was just joking!

329
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,890
A man bows to no one!

330
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,420
Xuan.

331
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,300
Do it!

332
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,980
What's it to you?

333
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,220
It's not just you.

334
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,820
Xuan,

335
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,610
is that dog Duke?

336
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,010
Let's all do it together.

337
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,770
I'm not doing it alone.

338
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,820
You said it. We didn't say.

339
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,340
Yeah,

340
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,250
Something you're not supposed to see.

341
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,700
Coming.

342
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,060
Lift your head.

343
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,580
Alright.

344
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,850
Ding Zhike!

345
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,890
Here!

346
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:31,420
I'm here.

347
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,370
- Hurry. - Coming!

348
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,100
I'm coming.

349
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,010
Still in the RV.

350
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,770
Let me finish this scene first.

351
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,980
Let me put your coat on.

352
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,700
Next time we run this scene,

353
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,580
we'll do it just like that.

354
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,490
Where's the prop?

355
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,610
We have two blood packs in total,

356
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,730
one on your left shoulder, one on your right abdomen.

357
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,700
When this one explodes,

358
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,940
just turn your head to the right.

359
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,890
Got it.

360
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,940
How is it?

361
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,610
Looks good.

362
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,180
Alright?

363
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,010
Let's roll for real this time.

364
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,980
Be careful.

365
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,100
Alright.

366
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,820
If you get hungry later, eat something.

367
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,940
I'm heading over.

368
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,530
Be careful.

369
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:05,860
Okay.

370
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,860
Take care of yourself.

371
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,700
Bye!

372
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,810
Alright, rolling for real.

373
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,180
Camera on.

374
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:14,940
Recording.

375
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,900
Ready—

376
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:17,730
Action!

377
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,900
Massive fire at Shilin Film City.

378
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,860
After receiving the report,

379
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,570
twelve ambulances were immediately dispatched.

380
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,330
The emergency center just called,

381
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,810
all nearby hospitals are at full capacity.

382
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,180
Fourteen injured patients have been redirected from Renmin Hospital.

383
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,420
Gemu is the closest,

384
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,940
and we have experience treating burns.

385
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,460
They should arrive in about five minutes.

386
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,250
Tell the nurses to check emergency supplies.

387
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,090
Also, clear out the treatment rooms and operating rooms.

388
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,700
- Got it. - Hurry!

389
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,050
Attention, everyone!

390
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,250
There's an emergency situation.

391
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,660
Non-urgent patients will need to pause their visits.

392
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,860
Grab some gift packs.

393
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,220
Got it.

394
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,940
Get a few more people to help.

395
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,330
Take as many as we have.

396
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,980
All department doctors, report to the main hall.

397
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,570
Thank you!

398
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,770
Everyone, can I have your attention, please?

399
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,570
Sorry for the inconvenience,

400
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,860
but we have an emergency situation.

401
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,420
Please cooperate with us.

402
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,460
Today, the customers who has an appointment...

403
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,810
No, all customers today

404
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,900
will receive a complimentary care package.

405
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,330
Next time you visit,

406
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,900
you'll get a 5% discount.

407
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,180
Look,

408
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,220
An entire row of buildings burned down.

409
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,490
The scene is pretty bad.

410
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,700
Get ready for a tough battle.

411
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,380
How is it?

412
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,810
How are the injuries?

413
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,570
Not looking good.

414
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,250
I'm worried we won't have enough blood.

415
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,380
We also need more iodine packs and dressings.

416
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,570
We have fourteen patients coming in,

417
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,140
but only twenty doctors in total.

418
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,180
We can't handle all of them.

419
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,940
What happened?

420
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,420
A dozen burn victims

421
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,380
are being sent here right now.

422
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,570
All available doctors are gathering in the main hall.

423
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,460
Lu, Hu!

424
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,900
You two were in the burn unit before.

425
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,940
You'll be our main team.

426
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,700
Where is Qiao Yang?

427
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,940
She's in surgery.

428
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,980
Let's go.

429
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,620
Quick.

430
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,250
Careful, take it slow!

431
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,250
Slow down.

432
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,180
Steady!

433
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,180
Come.

434
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,090
Go.

435
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,660
Keep going.

436
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,700
Push them inside!

437
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,330
Go inside.

438
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,180
Keep going.

439
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,620
Temperature normal.

440
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,490
No internal organ damage.

441
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,140
Hu, this patient is yours.

442
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,530
What's the condition here?

443
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,330
Second-degree burns on the arm.

444
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,660
Other areas have been covered with dressings.

445
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,290
Chen Mingjie!

446
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,220
This one's yours, go!

447
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,770
Ms. Zhou, leg burns.

448
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,330
This wound is yours.

449
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,140
You can handle it.

450
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,770
Come with me!

451
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,620
Wei Xiaoxi!

452
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,220
Don't just stand there, get in here!

453
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,900
Save my legs!

454
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,050
Severe burns on both legs.

455
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,220
No time for debridement.

456
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,090
Qiao Yang, this one's yours.

457
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,460
Cool him down first.

458
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,220
Then proceed with debridement.

459
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,730
The wound is too large, I can't do this alone.

460
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,530
Figure it out yourself.

461
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,250
Start an IV.

462
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:58,900
Okay.

463
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,250
Hold on, this might hurt.

464
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,730
Make way!

465
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,460
Stay strong,

466
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,530
almost done.

467
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,530
Hold on, I know it hurts.

468
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,140
This saline isn't cool enough.

469
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,330
Get some colder ones.

470
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,730
Dr. Lu,

471
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,810
temperature is under control, fluids administered.

472
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,290
Preliminary diagnosis: deep second-degree burns.

473
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,420
No signs of infection.

474
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,730
Leave it to me, go take care of others.

475
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,460
Ms. Zhou,

476
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,980
this is the last patient.

477
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,700
What's the condition?

478
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,490
Possible explosive injury.

479
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,900
Entered through the right anterior chest, penetrated the chest wall,

480
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,180
reached the posterior chest wall,

481
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,180
but did not pass through completely.

482
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,980
His throat is slightly swollen.

483
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,180
Intubation isn't an option for now.

484
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,900
Give him oxygen first.

485
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,900
My rough estimate,

486
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,420
there are at least a dozen shrapnel pieces

487
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,620
deep in his chest cavity.

488
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,010
Pneumothorax.

489
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,940
Apply pressure dressing, prepare for surgery.

490
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,770
Test results are in.

491
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,090
Surgery isn't possible right now.

492
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,980
He has Rh-negative blood.

493
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,940
Excuse me...

494
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,250
Sorry. We're closed for the day.

495
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,380
No, I'm looking for someone.

496
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,180
Shilin Film City caught fire, right?

497
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,380
Lots of injured people were brought here.

498
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,490
Is there a burn victim

499
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,290
named Ding Zhike?

500
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,290
I'll check for you.

501
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,730
What was he wearing?

502
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,980
A black tank top.

503
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,460
Yellow hair, short guy.

504
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,420
Have you seen him?

505
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,180
Is it that guy?

506
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,660
The one with a hole in his chest?

507
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,290
For now, we can only perform basic debridement.

508
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,380
Then, we'll do a closed chest drainage procedure.

509
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,420
This should temporarily manage the pneumothorax.

510
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,570
I've asked Wei Xiaoxi to monitor him.

511
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,420
Keeping a close watch on his drainage status.

512
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,330
Now, all we need is blood.

513
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,570
Rh-negative blood can't be sourced on short notice.

514
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,620
The blood bank doesn't have any in stock either.

515
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,620
We'll have to find a donor.

516
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,490
In his condition,

517
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,220
he can hold on for a maximum of eight hours.

518
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,810
Surgery is a must.

519
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,730
If only Mr. Chu were here...

520
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,330
When can we reach him?

521
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,940
I just tried.

522
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,140
He's still on a plane, won't land for another ten-plus hours.

523
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,980
It's not soon enough.

524
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,420
Ms. Zhou,

525
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,290
this is Ding Zhike's family.

526
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,490
Hello.

527
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,620
I'm Taozi,

528
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,420
Guo Xuan's makeup artist.

529
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,660
We've met before.

530
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,900
I remember you, Taozi.

531
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,730
Ding Zhike is your...

532
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,810
I'm his girlfriend.

533
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,220
How is he?

534
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,980
Come, he's over here.

535
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,050
Here?

536
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,290
You can't go in yet.

537
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,980
Can you reach any of his family?

538
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,660
He needs immediate surgery.

539
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,700
A large blood transfusion is necessary.

540
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,980
He has Rh-negative blood, it's rare.

541
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,290
The blood bank doesn't have any.

542
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,460
R what blood?

543
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,860
Isn't he type A?

544
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,330
He's type A, but Rh-negative.

545
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,810
It's commonly known as "panda blood."

546
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,330
Only a matching donor

547
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,460
can save him.

548
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:22,900
That's right.

549
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,900
And ideally, the donor shouldn't be a direct relative.

550
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,140
I don't have his family's contact info.

551
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,900
But I can check his phone.

552
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,570
Does he have any family in Rongchuan?

553
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,290
No.

554
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,140
His family is in Shaanxi.

555
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,620
Only he and his brother moved out.

556
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,180
His brother got married last year and returned home.

557
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,620
Let's focus on finding a donor first.

558
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,180
Can I see him?

559
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,180
Not yet.

560
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,810
He's in isolation and under intensive care.

561
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,050
We're also waiting for blood before we can operate.

562
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,660
Will he die?

563
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,460
Alright.

564
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,490
Be careful.

565
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,010
Check when they'll arrive.

566
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,730
Got it.

567
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,490
Keep up!

568
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,140
Alright.

569
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,570
Double-check everything.

570
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,250
What's the situation?

571
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,980
Don't ask anything.

572
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,010
Was it a dog bite?

573
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,900
I fell.

574
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,420
Your wound is irregular

575
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,530
and has lacerations.

576
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,730
It must have been caused by a large dog

577
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,860
with a strong bite force.

578
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,460
Even if the dog was vaccinated,

579
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,460
you still have a risk of rabies infection.

580
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,380
Honestly, repairing this wound isn't difficult,

581
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,660
but you must tell me the truth

582
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,290
so I can provide the right treatment.

583
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,620
Beds five and six have relatively small burn areas.

584
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,700
We have performed cooling and pain management.

585
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,810
Bed seven has a larger burn area,

586
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,090
third-degree burns on the palm, second-degree burns on the arm.

587
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,700
Ms. Zhou,

588
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,530
none of them are leaving today.

589
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,660
Everyone, just follow Ms. Zhou's instructions, okay?

590
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,810
Alright. Don't worry.

591
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,900
Thank you, guys.

592
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,660
The key is postoperative care.

593
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,660
We must prevent shock,

594
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,180
keep the airway clear,

595
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,140
and remove necrotic tissue

596
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,330
when changing the dressing.

597
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,180
Fluid replacement, infection control, and symptomatic treatment.

598
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,700
Thank you.

599
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,460
Lu,

600
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,860
I'll leave the staffing arrangements to you.

601
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,460
Got it.

602
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,900
Dr. Wei, go grab a meal first.

603
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,810
I'll watch over things for you.

604
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,460
It's fine. I'll handle it myself. Don't worry.

605
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,090
The wound on his upper right chest

606
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,700
has a diameter of about thirteen centimeters.

607
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,380
In his condition,

608
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,380
we should consider a lower abdominal flap transplant.

609
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,460
Lower abdomen?

610
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,010
Will it be enough to cover?

611
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,810
More or less.

612
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,330
I think

613
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,050
the anterolateral thigh flap

614
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,050
is large enough in area.

615
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,490
But it would require microsurgical anastomosis.

616
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,010
The thigh area is sufficient,

617
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,330
but like you said,

618
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,700
we would still need to do vascular anastomosis,

619
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,980
which makes the procedure more complex.

620
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,660
And there's also the risk of flap necrosis.

621
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,700
What worries me the most right now is the blood supply.

622
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,290
Rh-negative...

623
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,090
I've sent out requests for help in all my circles,

624
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,140
but there's no response.

625
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,220
The hospital is experiencing

626
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,140
a severe blood shortage right now,

627
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,770
especially for his rare blood type.

628
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,980
Did you admit Ding Zhike?

629
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,010
Yes.

630
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,810
The police are looking for you.

631
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,770
Can you determine what caused this?

632
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,940
Based on the wound,

633
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,940
the possibility of a close-range explosion is higher.

634
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,330
Alright.

635
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,860
We have understood the basic situation.

636
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,220
Thank you for your cooperation.

637
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,730
If Ding Zhike wakes up,

638
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,900
please notify us immediately.

639
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,050
Come, this way, please.

640
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,570
Taozi,

641
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,810
what did the police want with you just now?

642
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,730
They just wanted to understand the situation.

643
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,860
I just want to ask you one thing,

644
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,900
Was it Ding who caused the fire?

645
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,010
It wasn't him.

646
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,050
He's in charge of fire.

647
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,700
He was the closest to it.

648
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,140
If it wasn't him, who else was it? Tell me.

649
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,220
It really wasn't him.

650
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,900
It definitely was him.

651
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,420
It had to be him. Otherwise, why would the police look for him?

652
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,140
No.

653
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,570
We just wanna understand the truth of the situation.

654
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,420
Is that so hard?

655
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,250
It wasn't him.

656
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,460
Look at my leg.

657
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,330
It's all injured like this.

658
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,530
Will I ever be able to marry a wife?

659
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,530
Look at my hands.

660
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,050
It'll take at least half a year to heal.

661
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,980
At least half a year.

662
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,810
Am I not going to work?

663
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,330
Alright.

664
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,050
I understand everyone's mood.

665
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,250
But the police investigation results

666
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,050
haven't come out yet, right?

667
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,490
This fire wasn't started by her.

668
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:06,770
Right?

669
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,290
You're getting angry at a young girl,

670
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,620
but that's not gonna solve the problem.

671
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,770
The most important thing for you right now

672
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,860
is to return to your rooms,

673
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,980
get some good rest, and focus on your recovery.

674
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,770
Alright?

675
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,420
Why are you just standing around?

676
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,220
Go back to your rooms.

677
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,330
If I don't work,

678
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,620
how am I supposed to live?

679
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,730
Am I supposed to just live on air?

680
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,940
Sleep well.

681
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,180
Your injuries will heal faster.

682
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,090
Seriously...

683
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,140
Ms. Qiao,

684
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,380
let's have a small meeting.

685
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,900
Stop crying.

686
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,380
The police are still investigating.

687
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,620
You're already accusing him.

688
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,570
Now you wanna transfer him?

689
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,090
That's not necessary.

690
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,860
It wasn't necessary before.

691
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,460
Since you've been here,

692
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,980
it's been quite lively around here.

693
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,460
Let me count for you.

694
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,860
Jiang Rong, Hao Xin, Lin Qiang,

695
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,660
and now we've added an arsonist.

696
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,700
Are you afraid that Gemu doesn't have enough money for trending topics?

697
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,900
Look at how much advertising money I've saved for you.

698
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,010
Besides,

699
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,010
this just proves my natural talent.

700
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,330
Whatever I do, it turns into a hit.

701
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,700
Personally, I don't mind.

702
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,380
At worst, it's just some PR trouble.

703
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,730
But Gemu image can't take so much turmoil.

704
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,420
Ding Zhike is still in danger.

705
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,940
We should save him first.

706
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,940
If he suddenly passes away now,

707
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,490
how much damage would that do to Gemu's image?

708
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,980
Yes, we wanna save him.

709
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,530
But we still can't find the blood.

710
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,490
There's nothing we can do about that.

711
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,660
Sorry, I'm late.

712
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,530
I have something to tell you.

713
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,980
Meng Haoran?

714
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,900
Is it really him?

715
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,010
You recognize him even wrapped up like that?

716
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,010
It's definitely him.

717
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,860
Look at this picture.

718
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,940
Look at this one.

719
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,660
See?

720
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,730
He's been wearing that hat for over a hundred years.

721
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,620
Who are you talking about?

722
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,660
Meng Haoran.

723
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,460
The male team leader.

724
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,050
He was already acting in major productions when he debuted.

725
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,730
The very crew that caught fire today,

726
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,250
he was visiting colleagues there.

727
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,140
Who told you that?

728
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,810
He went straight to the VIP ward.

729
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,330
Guo Xuan.

730
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,700
No one saw you, right?

731
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,620
I've said it's fine.

732
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,380
Is Duke alright?

733
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,770
I had Xiao Xu take him home.

734
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,860
He'll get a good scolding when we get back.

735
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,660
But it's not its fault.

736
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,180
He's usually very well-behaved and obedient.

737
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,660
He's never hurt anyone.

738
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,900
With all that noise,

739
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,940
he was frightened.

740
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,700
Does it still hurt?

741
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,700
My injury is fine now.

742
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,860
You should head back quickly.

743
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,730
If we get caught on camera, it'll be troublesome.

744
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,220
It's fine if we get caught.

745
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,290
It'll drive Fang Yu crazy.

746
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,050
And then you'll marry me.

747
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,140
Meng Haoran,

748
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,860
get a grip.

749
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,860
If this thing blows up,

750
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,290
you'll be the one who gets trouble, and I'll be the one who gets scolded.

751
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,570
We're both finished.

752
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,330
Hurry up and leave.

753
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,570
Just looking at you for one more second annoys me.

754
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,570
It's always like this.

755
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,090
Like we're doing something wrong.

756
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,140
Go look at the people from the crew.

757
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,380
If they're caught on camera, at least they have an excuse.

758
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,180
Hat, glasses, mask.

759
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,700
Is this better now?

760
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,220
Meng!

761
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,940
Meng!

762
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,420
Meng!

763
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,420
Guo Xuan is in our hospital?

764
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,730
What happened to her?

765
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,010
Animal bite.

766
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,660
Nothing serious, I've already treated it.

767
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,420
Great.

768
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,250
One is a top host,

769
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,860
the other is an arsonist.

770
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,290
Gemu has two ticking time bombs.

771
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,290
If you ask me, we should transfer Ding Zhike as soon as possible.

772
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,250
So Guo Xuan's case can be kept confidential,

773
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,810
but Ding Zhike has to be transferred?

774
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,900
What kind of logic is that?

775
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,700
I'm just considering the patient's well-being.

776
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,250
We're just a specialty hospital,

777
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,530
our capabilities are indeed limited.

778
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,220
It's not about doubting your abilities.

779
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,250
The transfer won't trouble you or Ms. Zhou.

780
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,010
I'll handle it.

781
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,980
He has an open pneumothorax right now.

782
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,140
This often leads to hemothorax.

783
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,010
Hemothorax?

784
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,490
That means internal bleeding in the wound.

785
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,770
If he goes into shockand

786
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,730
we don't have blood ready,

787
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,010
he'll be beyond saving.

788
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,770
This situation is too dangerous.

789
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,050
I absolutely do not agree to the transfer.

790
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,090
You were the one who said surgery must be done within eight hours, right?

791
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,530
There are five hours left.

792
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,090
Without blood, how can we operate?

793
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,380
The blood bank just called.

794
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,290
We found the blood.

795
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,290
The donor is from Shanghai.

796
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,620
The fastest they can arrive is four hours.

797
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,900
Five hours is more than enough.

798
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,770
Let's go!

799
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,770
The pacing is too slow overall.

800
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,220
Tighten up the edits for me.

801
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,570
Can't you find more footage?

802
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,140
You're editing an operation video,

803
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,660
do you think it has any tension?

804
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,660
Duke.

805
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,340
Stop barking, Duke.

806
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,130
Come here.

807
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,900
Duke.

808
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,010
Go away!

809
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,530
Go away!

810
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,860
Are you okay, Xuan?

811
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,460
Come on.

812
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,860
Someone!

813
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,780
Ms. Qiao,

814
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,740
I've been closely monitoring

815
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,820
as you instructed.

816
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,530
Recording every half hour.

817
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,090
Continuous oxygen at one liter per minute.

818
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,170
His vital signs are all stable.

819
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,170
No abnormal breathing.

820
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,980
No changes in the drainage fluid.

821
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,260
The next four hours are the most critical.

822
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,300
You absolutely cannot let your guard down.

823
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,570
Especially with the drainage.

824
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,050
If anything unusual happens, call me immediately.

825
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,010
Stay alert.

826
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,530
Stop acting like you're half-asleep all the time.

827
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,210
Dr. Wei,

828
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,690
you've already done a great job.

829
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,610
This was our responsibility.

830
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,050
Everyone sees your effort.

831
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,170
Keep going!

832
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,170
Doctor,

833
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,340
are you planning to stop treating him?

834
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,420
Who told you that?

835
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,530
The fire has nothing to do with Ding Zhike.

836
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,940
He was framed.

837
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,980
His personal information has been dug up online.

838
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,380
They're saying he caused the explosion and fire by smoking,

839
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,690
he doesn't deserve to be saved.

840
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,170
But it really wasn't his fault!

841
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,380
Pealse!

842
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,900
Saving lives is our duty.

843
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,380
What they say doesn't matter.

844
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,300
Dog bites are usually irregular.

845
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,860
The wounds are hard to treat.

846
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,900
Especially in areas with a lot of movement,

847
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,090
the tension here is quite high.

848
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,090
Whether the scar heals as expected

849
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,210
depends on your post-op tension-reducing care.

850
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,860
I'd say you need to stay hospitalized for at least a week.

851
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,900
But don't worry.

852
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,460
We'll use laser treatment later.

853
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,380
In about six months,

854
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,900
the scars on your face

855
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,690
will be barely visible under makeup.

856
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,340
You'll have no problem on camera.

857
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,050
Do you have any other concerns?

858
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,530
I wanna ask...

859
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,010
about the injured from the Shilin Film City fire.

860
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,460
How are they doing?

861
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,210
About a dozen people were hurt.

862
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,170
Some are lightly injured, some seriously.

863
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,690
And...

864
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,090
Sorry, I need to take this call.

865
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,820
Hello?

866
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,860
How could this happen?

867
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,090
The blood donor backed out.

868
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,980
The blood bank arranged for pickup,

869
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,570
but he never even got on the plane.

870
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,900
This case has national attention.

871
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,010
He's afraid of online backlash.

872
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,650
He doesn't wanna get involved.

873
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,610
If he doesn't come, Ding Zhike is doomed.

874
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,170
What did I say earlier?

875
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:10,090
Look at public opinion now,

876
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,380
everyone has already decided Ding Zhike is guilty.

877
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,420
If something happens to him at Gemu,

878
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,210
even the gods won't be able to explain it away.

879
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,460
The last flight he can take is at 6:30.

880
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,420
Otherwise, it'll be too late.

881
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,130
What time is it now?

882
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,130
5:30, there's one hour left.

883
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,340
I'll call my friends in Shanghai,

884
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,980
see if I can pull some strings.

885
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,420
Then I'll work on the transfer arrangements.

886
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,460
Transfer him now?

887
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,090
Wouldn't the problem

888
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,380
be the same there?

889
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,210
That's just sending him off to die.

890
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,570
So you'd rather let him die here?

891
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,210
You...

892
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,380
Taozi said

893
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,780
Ding Zhike was framed.

894
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,050
Guo Xuan,

895
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,610
why don't you tell me where you are?

896
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,050
I'll come find you, okay?

897
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,210
Taozi,

898
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,490
earlier, you said Ding Zhike was framed.

899
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,900
Do you have any evidence?

900
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,210
I don't.

901
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,570
But someone can prove it.

902
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,050
Who?

903
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,420
Tell me.

904
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,940
I don't dare...

905
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,130
He's dying.

906
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,490
What's there to be afraid of now?

907
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,490
I know this person?

908
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,170
Taozi?

909
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,490
What are you doing here?

910
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,340
Guo Xuan,

911
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,570
are you feeling better?

912
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,690
I sent you so many messages.

913
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,690
Did you see them?

914
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,010
Really?

915
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,740
I got injured

916
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,010
and have been resting here.

917
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,860
Let me see.

918
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,650
Ms. Guo,

919
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,210
did you get hurt at Shilin Film City?

920
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,860
Shilin Film City?

921
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,980
Oh, the one that caught fire?

922
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,570
Yeah.

923
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,490
What does that have to do with my injury?

924
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,860
My boyfriend is Ding Zhike, the pyrotechnician.

925
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,130
Not very tall,

926
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,650
with yellow hair.

927
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,490
Do you remember him?

928
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,530
It doesn't matter anymore.

929
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,050
He's badly injured now.

930
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,210
He needs a blood transfusion to undergo surgery.

931
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,690
What does that have to do with me?

932
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,690
Before the fire, he called me.

933
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,210
He said he saw you.

934
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,740
He saw me?

935
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,050
Yes.

936
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,530
Then he must‘ve mistaken me for someone else.

937
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,650
Impossible.

938
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,340
While we were on the phone,

939
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,010
I heard a dog barking,

940
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,900
and someone screaming.

941
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,130
That was your voice.

942
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,940
Then the fire started.

943
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,980
What are you trying to say?

944
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,340
I...

945
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,210
Here's the situation, Ms. Guo.

946
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,460
Ding Zhike is also in our hospital.

947
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,210
Right now, the whole internet is saying

948
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,980
the fire

949
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,050
was caused by him smoking.

950
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,820
Everyone is condemning him.

951
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,650
We finally found

952
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,460
a matching blood donor,

953
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,340
but because of the rumors, they backed out.

954
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,900
So we're hoping, Guo Xuan,

955
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,090
only you can prove his innocence.

956
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,690
Only you can save his life.

957
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,130
I don't even know what you're talking about.

958
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,490
I need to rest and recover.

959
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,010
Please leave.

960
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,860
Okay?

961
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:05,820
Alright.

962
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,340
Get some rest.

963
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,740
I won't see you out.

964
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,570
Come.

965
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,650
Guo Xuan,

966
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,740
just record a short video,

967
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,900
say a few words, that's all.

968
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,570
Please.

969
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,090
Everyone will believe you.

970
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,690
Taozi,

971
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,420
I really wanna help you,

972
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,210
but I can't record that video.

973
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,690
Why not?

974
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,860
I've never even met your boyfriend.

975
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,050
Guo Xuan, please.

976
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,490
I'm begging you.

977
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,210
This is a life at stake!

978
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,940
I know it's a life.

979
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,940
But I can't lie.

980
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,210
You're already lying.

981
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,900
What did you just say?

982
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,420
You're afraid people will find out about your affair, aren't you?

983
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,980
I'm warning you.

984
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,010
Don't talk nonsense.

985
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,130
You sent me to the set to do makeup for Meng.

986
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,740
His pinned WeChat avatar,

987
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,690
it's the same as yours.

988
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,380
A matching couple avatar.

989
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,210
- Shut up! - I know everything.

990
00:40:59,230 --> 00:40:59,690
Stop!

991
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,860
You two have been together for a long time.

992
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,420
I said shut up!

993
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,210
The moment you got injured,

994
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,050
Meng showed up faster than Mr. Fang.

995
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,420
- This is about someone's life. - Get out!

996
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,490
I said get out!

997
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,460
Get lost!

998
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,210
Mr. Fang...

999
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,090
Mr. Fang, did you know...

1000
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,300
I don't wanna know.

1001
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,340
She needs to rest.

1002
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,460
You two, leave.

1003
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:21,900
Come.

1004
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,490
Come with me.

1005
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,980
Taozi, you were way too impulsive just now.

1006
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,610
I just asked all the patients in those rooms.

1007
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,260
They said that when the fire started,

1008
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,340
they were all busy working.

1009
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,420
None of them noticed anything.

1010
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,860
How are those people doing?

1011
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,900
Who's keeping an eye on the patient rooms?

1012
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,740
Lu and Chen Mingjie.

1013
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,210
It's Xuan.

1014
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,940
Ding said he saw her holding Duke.

1015
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,740
Duke is Meng's dog.

1016
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,420
Ding even asked me

1017
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,820
what their relationship was.

1018
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,130
I scolded him

1019
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,570
for being nosy.

1020
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,570
What breed did you say Duke is?

1021
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,260
A German Shepherd.

1022
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,780
It's huge.

1023
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,340
One time, it jumped up at me,

1024
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,740
it was almost as tall as I am.

1025
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,380
That matches up.

1026
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,860
The wounds on her face

1027
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,130
were caused by a large dog bite.

1028
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,980
Who was Mr. Fang who just went in?

1029
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,860
He is Fang Yu.

1030
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,610
Xuan's manager.

1031
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,170
And also her husband.

1032
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,090
Are they on good terms?

1033
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,610
I remember when we were doing the show,

1034
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,650
I never saw him.

1035
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,460
Their relationship is just so-so.

1036
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,650
I've been working with Xuan for five or six years now.

1037
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,380
Whether it's recording shows or filming,

1038
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,420
she never posts about him on her social media.

1039
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,740
And he rarely comes to the set.

1040
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,460
But that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

1041
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,610
You don't post about Mr. Qin on your social media either.

1042
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,610
Could you be divorced?
