1
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,900
Those three young men were having a meal.

2
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,460
Your mom happened to pass by.

3
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,820
She saw the bottles on the table

4
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,770
and reached out to take them.

5
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,540
The guys didn't refuse,

6
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,020
but they wanted to finish eating and drinking first.

7
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,410
Then, they would have given her the bottles.

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,490
But your mom wouldn't let it go

9
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,570
and insisted on taking them right away.

10
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,130
Does your mom have some mental issues?

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,490
She's just getting old,

12
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,620
her mind's not as clear anymore.

13
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,820
She moves pretty fast, though.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,130
Has she trained for this?

15
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,260
Look,

16
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,900
she beat up all three of them.

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,170
Over a few bottles?

18
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,010
Was that necessary?

19
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,980
Sorry.

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,890
Alright, you guys figure it out

21
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,820
among yourselves later.

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,690
Here, your mom's over there.

23
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,260
You're here.

24
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,260
What trouble did you get into this time?

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,260
You really don't see yourself as an outsider, huh?

26
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,500
Get up.

27
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,410
Your daughter's here to take you home.

28
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,610
Why are you taking off your seatbelt?

29
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,220
Buckle up, we're still on the road.

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,220
Okay.

31
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,380
What are you doing?

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,220
I really can't with you.

33
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,450
You've got skills, huh?

34
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,610
Taking on three guys at once,

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,010
and they were all young.

36
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,340
That brat tried to steal my phone.

37
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,260
He even touched my bag!

38
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,850
The police checked the security footage.

39
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,290
They didn't touch you at all.

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,730
Want some water?

41
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,730
No.

42
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,660
Call Zhou Kai.

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,660
I'll take you home.

44
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,570
Stop touching things, okay?

45
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,500
Hey! Stop that!

46
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,410
Where do you live?

47
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,940
What's wrong?

48
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,260
My... my tooth hurts.

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,290
Come on, brush your teeth and wash your face.

50
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,890
What are you doing?

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,060
Come on, brush your teeth and wash up.

52
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,660
Did you not hear me?

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,450
I've been calling you, and you didn't respond at all.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,410
Didn't I tell you to change?

55
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,610
This one's comfortable.

56
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,780
I wanna give it my daughter.

57
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,140
Just change into it.

58
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,100
I've prepared two more sets for you.

59
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,540
This pink one is so pretty!

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,220
Come on.

61
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,290
Go brush your teeth.

62
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,540
You don't need to take that to brush your teeth.

63
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,610
That's mine.

64
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,700
Here.

65
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,340
Come.

66
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,410
Brush your teeth first.

67
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,290
Come on.

68
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,020
What's wrong?

69
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,020
My tooth...

70
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,140
It's swollen.

71
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,730
I'll take you to the doctor tomorrow.

72
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,730
It's fine.

73
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,580
Aren't you going back to school soon?

74
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,100
You focus on your stuff.

75
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,540
I've been working for years already.

76
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,020
Didn't you come to visit me at the hospital before?

77
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,340
Right.

78
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,410
Your brother Zhou Kai,

79
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,780
he's such a troublemaker.

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,170
He went to hang out at the internet café again.

81
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,050
Then the teacher called me.

82
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,730
Asked me to go to the office.

83
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,540
I got so angry, look,

84
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,980
my tooth's swollen now.

85
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,660
It's driving me crazy.

86
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,810
Has anything happened to you in the past years?

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,140
Did you hit your head or get sick?

88
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,780
No.

89
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,580
I'm perfectly fine.

90
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,980
How's your mom doing now?

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,780
Is she alright?

92
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,980
She just fell asleep.

93
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,460
I'll take her to the hospital tomorrow.

94
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,980
Let me go with you.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,610
It's fine. I can go by myself.

96
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,140
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

97
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,100
No, no need to go out of your way.

98
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,810
Good night.

99
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,930
Yun.

100
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,020
What seems to be the problem today?

101
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,250
Her face is swollen here.

102
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,020
Could you take a look?

103
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,980
Her left cheek is swollen.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,930
Alright, I'll take a look.

105
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,540
Thank you.

106
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,460
Okay, please rest your head back.

107
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,020
Don't worry. Relax.

108
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,580
Alright, keep your head straight and lie down.

109
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,490
Relax.

110
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,610
Listen to the doctor.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,540
Okay, please open your mouth.

112
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,370
Open.

113
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,660
Open your mouth wide.

114
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,540
Good, very good.

115
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,780
Relax, don't be afraid.

116
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,410
It's fine.

117
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,290
Lie still and don't move.

118
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,050
It's fine.

119
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,140
Just check your tooth.

120
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,580
It won't hurt.

121
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,850
Just cooperate and open your mouth.

122
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,490
We just need to take a quick look.

123
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,610
Let's try again.

124
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,930
Open your mouth wide.

125
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,410
Turn your head.

126
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,170
Very good.

127
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,020
Open your mouth wide.

128
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,700
Good, very good.

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,900
Are you thirsty?

130
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,730
Do you want some water?

131
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:22,730
It's fine.

132
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,020
Don't pull me.

133
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,810
Who are you?

134
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,730
Stop fooling around.

135
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,460
This is a hospital, keep quiet.

136
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,650
Sorry.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,650
Let's go.

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,610
Where's my wallet? Where's my son?

139
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,820
I'm your son.

140
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,250
You didn't bring your wallet when you left the house.

141
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,010
My wallet...

142
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,530
You took my wallet, give it to me.

143
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,180
Getting more forgetful with age.

144
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,980
Here's the wallet, Dad.

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,820
He doesn't even recognize his own son.

146
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,010
Where's my son?

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,060
Come, I'll go find my son.

148
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,300
My son...

149
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,010
Sir,

150
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,820
your son is inside here.

151
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,980
Yes, your son is inside.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,850
He's here.

153
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,490
Are you dating her?

154
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,820
Are you seeing her?

155
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,490
I'm pursuing her.

156
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,370
But I haven't caught up yet.

157
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,820
Pursue her.

158
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,010
Regarding your mom's condition,

159
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,460
it can be basically diagnosed

160
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,610
as Alzheimer's disease.

161
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,700
There's no cure for this illness at the moment.

162
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,530
The most important thing is companionship.

163
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,850
Try not to let her be alone.

164
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,130
Stay with her more.

165
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,700
You're here.

166
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,730
Let's see.

167
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,340
Did you see the water he threw?

168
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,530
Stop teasing the kid.

169
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,180
It's a silk doll made by Hua's mom.

170
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,180
Silk doll?

171
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,420
Yes, try it.

172
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,220
Silk doll.

173
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,530
Her mom wants your number.

174
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,250
She said when Hua grows up, she'll visit you.

175
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,770
It's so spicy!

176
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,420
It's okay.

177
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,580
Elderberry.

178
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,980
Shredded potatoes.

179
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,850
Can't you taste it?

180
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,180
Elderberry. Do you like it?

181
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,580
It's a bit spicy.

182
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,370
You'll get used to it the more you eat.

183
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,100
This place is really beautiful.

184
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,580
The last time I saw such a view

185
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,820
was over ten years ago.

186
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,940
It was when my dad took me back to our hometown.

187
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,460
Yesterday, Dadan was planning to play chess with your dad.

188
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,420
Call him.

189
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,730
Save it.

190
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,530
My phone's out of battery.

191
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,300
Can I borrow your phone?

192
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,010
Mine's out of battery too.

193
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,890
Thinking about leaving soon,

194
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,220
why do I suddenly feel a little anxious?

195
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,650
What's there to be anxious about? I'm here.

196
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,060
Let's go.

197
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,730
No. Don't go.

198
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,250
I wanna stay here.

199
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,890
Wait until it gets dark to watch the stars.

200
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,490
No need to wait until night.

201
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,820
I'll show you a gorilla right now.

202
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,370
Are you stupid?

203
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,610
Acting like a gorilla.

204
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,940
Your gorilla expression is all wrong.

205
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,730
Look at you.

206
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,770
What expression?

207
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,980
Dr. Lu.

208
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,530
Do you like elderberry?

209
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,650
Dr. Lu.

210
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,650
I dislike you.

211
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,530
You're so ugly.

212
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,650
Well, I happen to look even more like it than you.

213
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,820
Interested in medical aesthetics training?

214
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,060
One flyer per person, don't be stingy.

215
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,580
Here.

216
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,490
Study it.

217
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,130
Interested in medical aesthetics training?

218
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,130
Discounts available!

219
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,420
Let's go.

220
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,650
There are promotions and discounts!

221
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,890
No prior experience needed.

222
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,490
Tuition is only 28,800 yuan.

223
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,890
Partnered with multiple medical aesthetics institutions.

224
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,130
Thread-lifting enhancement.

225
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,530
Industry certification and direct job placement.

226
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,340
Limited spots available, first come, first served!

227
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,130
These shady medical aesthetic services...

228
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,220
Wasn't there a crackdown on them recently?

229
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,700
Didn't take long for them to pop up again.

230
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,530
The cost is low, but the profit is high.

231
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,850
Fortune favors the bold.

232
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,010
Look, they've gotten smarter now.

233
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,420
No phone numbers or addresses,

234
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,340
just a QR code.

235
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,610
Hurry, make some noodles.

236
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,580
- Customers are here. - Mom?

237
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,300
Quickly!

238
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,770
Where did you go?

239
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,490
Zhou Kai, Mom's back.

240
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,490
Mom,

241
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,980
where did you go?

242
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,820
Go inside.

243
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,220
Alright, let's go home.

244
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,580
Go home first.

245
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,340
Then...

246
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,250
Alright, I got it.

247
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,010
You go ahead.

248
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,980
And you two are...?

249
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,610
First time meeting, Jingwen.

250
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,650
Thank you.

251
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,770
And this is...?

252
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,130
My brother-in-law?

253
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,980
How long has this restaurant been open?

254
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,580
We've been open for almost two years now.

255
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,220
I always said that since we were here,

256
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,610
we should go find you.

257
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,730
But Zhou Kai is so stubborn.

258
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,460
He wouldn't let me tell you.

259
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,650
What are you guys talking about?

260
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,250
There's a whole pile of dishes that haven't been washed.

261
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:17,980
Wash the dishes.

262
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,060
Eat while it's still hot.

263
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,460
Speak properly.

264
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,650
Thirty-six yuan.

265
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,010
I'll pay.

266
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,890
She's been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

267
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,980
Don't let her wander around alone.

268
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,940
Take good care of her.

269
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,890
What does that have to do with you?

270
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,940
How does it not concern me?

271
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,610
The police even called me.

272
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,420
You said yourself, even if the whole family died,

273
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,700
it had nothing to do with you.

274
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,700
Give it back.

275
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,220
Give it back to me.

276
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,370
Stealing money from the house.

277
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,180
Zhou Jingwen!

278
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,420
Have you no conscience?

279
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,890
This is my own bonus from my exams.

280
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,530
It's my money!

281
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,420
Give it back!

282
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,300
Your money?

283
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,010
Other daughters bring money home.

284
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,100
You took the money.

285
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,340
What about my wedding in the future?

286
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,700
What if Mom gets sick?

287
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,770
All you ever think about is yourself.

288
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,890
If you have the guts to leave, don't come back.

289
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,490
I never planned on coming back.

290
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,220
Even if the whole family dies, it has nothing to do with me.

291
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,370
That was when you were kids.

292
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,340
It was just angry words.

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,220
I wasn't just speaking out of anger.

294
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,580
I really never planned on coming back.

295
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,610
I just never expected

296
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,010
that after all these years, she would turn out like this.

297
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,300
I still haven't forgiven her.

298
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,460
Who are you?

299
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,650
Jingwen!

300
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,460
No need, I'll drive myself home.

301
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,220
Charge!

302
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,530
This is really comfortable.

303
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,700
I wanna give it to daughter.

304
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,180
Your mother's condition

305
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,770
can basically be confirmed

306
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,940
as Alzheimer's.

307
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,010
There is no cure for this disease at the moment.

308
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,850
The most important thing is to be there for her.

309
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,940
Try not to leave her alone.

310
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,250
Spend more time with her.

311
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,490
Found it.

312
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,010
You took my little cutie.

313
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,370
Then will you come to see me?

314
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,180
Good boy.

315
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,250
Did you get the new medicine?

316
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,180
Yes, I brought it.

317
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,060
Once a day.

318
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,820
The stitches come out next Wednesday.

319
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,010
Okay.

320
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,610
In the meantime, make sure the wound doesn't get wet.

321
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:36,940
Got it.

322
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,650
Also, keep the diet light

323
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,490
and pay close attention.

324
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,340
If the wound gets red or swollen,

325
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,010
make sure to come to the hospital right away.

326
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,220
Qi Dacheng!

327
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,890
Don't run!

328
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,610
Don't run, Qi Dacheng!

329
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,610
Qi Dacheng!

330
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,220
Stop running!

331
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,490
Qi Dacheng, you can't run!

332
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,180
Qi Dacheng!

333
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,420
Don't run!

334
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,810
- Dad! - Qi Dacheng!

335
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,530
- Dad! - Are you okay?

336
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,330
Dad!

337
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,250
Dr. Qiao,

338
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,050
Long...

339
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,250
He went for a checkup.

340
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,140
Go ahead, run.

341
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,010
Keep running.

342
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,420
Qi Dacheng, were you a long-distance runner before?

343
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,620
Are you especially good at running?

344
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,700
Back then, when you ran out of our hospital,

345
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,660
you told me your child was in trouble.

346
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,730
Did I stop you?

347
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,010
Then why did you change your phone number?

348
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,620
Why did you make it so we couldn't contact you?

349
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,380
Do you know that your condition

350
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,220
requires regular medication to prevent rejection?

351
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,290
If you get an infection,

352
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,700
you could lose your life.

353
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,290
Dr. Qiao, listen to me.

354
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,330
Listen to me.

355
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,050
Five years.

356
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,220
We waited five years for this donor.

357
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,090
Qi Dacheng,

358
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,490
so many people put in so much effort

359
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,090
to get you this surgery.

360
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,660
And you just ran away?

361
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,860
Do you know how worried we all were?

362
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,940
Do you know that by doing this,

363
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,770
you've broken the hearts of so many doctors?

364
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,730
Dad!

365
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,220
Are you feeling any better?

366
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,570
I'm fine now.

367
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,770
Did you finish your checkup?

368
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,860
This doctor took me through it all.

369
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,730
We can go home now.

370
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,530
No, you can't go home.

371
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,530
He's in a dangerous condition, he can't leave.

372
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,700
Dr. Qiao,

373
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,770
are you done scolding me?

374
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,420
No.

375
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,220
Listen to me.

376
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,460
Listen to what?

377
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,730
Look.

378
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,620
Wherever I go, my medicine goes with me.

379
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,250
I was afraid I'd forget one day,

380
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,700
so I even wrote it down in a notebook.

381
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,330
See?

382
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,940
I haven't missed a single day.

383
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,770
Then why did you run when you saw me?

384
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,660
Don't you know you have an exercise-induced allergy?

385
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,380
I got nervous when I saw you and forgot.

386
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,530
I usually don't run at all.

387
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,010
I know how I looked when I left back then.

388
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,250
You must have been really worried.

389
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,660
But every word you told me,

390
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,220
I remember them all clearly.

391
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,460
You saved my life.

392
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,620
I regret performing your surgery.

393
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,460
Dad,

394
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,290
didn't you say Dr. Qiao is really gentle?

395
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,810
Why is she so fierce?

396
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,660
What are you laughing at?

397
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,980
The kid didn't lie,

398
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:13,900
did he?

399
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,090
Dr. Qiao is just looking out for me.

400
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,460
I made all of these myself.

401
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,730
Pick whichever one you like and take it.

402
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,050
Alright.

403
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,380
If the weather gets colder,

404
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,730
I'll make you a down jacket.

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,620
Sounds good.

406
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,490
You're really skilled.

407
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,180
So, is this house yours?

408
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,460
No.

409
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,570
We're renting it.

410
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,330
Long needs to go to school,

411
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,770
and this place is closer to the school.

412
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,860
You know about Dacheng's condition.

413
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,010
He can't go out.

414
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,570
The rent here is cheap,

415
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,460
and business is good.

416
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,700
We can cover our food,

417
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,730
plus both of their

418
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,620
medical expenses.

419
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,220
That's great.

420
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,140
Really great.

421
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,810
Go cook the pork.

422
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,090
You still don't know how to cook it?

423
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,570
Yours tastes better.

424
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,290
Alright, I'll go.

425
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:57,860
Okay.

426
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,860
Dr. Qiao,

427
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,570
there's an old street up ahead.

428
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,770
You guys can take a walk.

429
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,660
The food will take a while.

430
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,700
I'll call you when it's ready.

431
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,250
Alright.

432
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,290
Stop running.

433
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:05,810
Walk slower!

434
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,330
Don't worry, I'm fine.

435
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,050
- Don't faint again. - Lion.

436
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,050
Lions run the fastest!

437
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,980
Who's the second fastest?

438
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,250
Tigers.

439
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,490
And the third?

440
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,380
Cats.

441
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,770
And last is the little chick.

442
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,460
- Right? - Right!

443
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,010
Wow,

444
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,220
Dr. Lu, you can even tutor math!

445
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,180
What do you mean?

446
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,010
You do it?

447
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,180
My P.E. teacher taught me math.

448
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,010
I'm no good.

449
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,700
Just a few days here,

450
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,570
and it feels more exhausting than working a month in the hospital.

451
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,250
Not easy, huh?

452
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,140
So now you know what exhaustion feels like?

453
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,290
But you look pretty happy.

454
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,570
I saw you smiling all day.

455
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,810
If I still couldn't smile,

456
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,620
wouldn't that let you down?

457
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,090
You went to such lengths to bring me here,

458
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,770
just so

459
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,380
I could feel the beauty of life,

460
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,490
and not sink into despair

461
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,860
over one accident.

462
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,770
Right?

463
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,420
What accident?

464
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,620
Did you lose a patient?

465
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,530
Almost.

466
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,530
Were you scared?

467
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,330
As doctors,

468
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,460
is death the thing you fear the most?

469
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,050
I'm not afraid of my own death,

470
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,420
but I am afraid of others dying.

471
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,980
Focus on your homework.

472
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,010
Why are kids so nosy?

473
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,330
Do this question on your own.

474
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,180
Come on, let's go for a walk.

475
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,460
I used to roll my eyes at those stories,

476
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,940
people getting hurt

477
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,010
and then running off to Tibet

478
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,180
for some kind of spiritual healing.

479
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,290
Never thought I'd

480
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,380
become the main character of one myself.

481
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,050
You know,

482
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,180
this vulnerable side of you

483
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,290
is kind of charming.

484
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,900
Can I ask you a question?

485
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,490
Go ahead.

486
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,530
What happened to your breast?

487
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,090
It's okay,

488
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,570
you don't have to answer if you don't want to.

489
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,900
I'm just curious.

490
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,810
Why did you wait until now to ask?

491
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,380
That first time we went to a hotel,

492
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,770
you saw it but didn't react at all.

493
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,530
I was pretty surprised.

494
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,420
That's just basic professionalism

495
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,420
for a surgeon.

496
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,810
Dr. Lu is quite the gentleman.

497
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,490
When I had just divorced Ji Xuefeng,

498
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,810
I was diagnosed with breast cancer.

499
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,660
Being a doctor,

500
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,050
after the initial shock,

501
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,900
I calmed down pretty quickly.

502
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,490
It wasn't as scary as I thought.

503
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,090
If you're sick, you just get treated.

504
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,250
I decided to have a mastectomy without hesitation.

505
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,810
It was the best option anyway.

506
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,180
I was lucky,

507
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,140
the surgery was a success,

508
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,770
and I haven't had a recurrence since.

509
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,730
That's great.

510
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,490
After all, in life, besides life and death,

511
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,730
nothing else really matters.

512
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,770
From a scientific perspective,

513
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,940
the true function of breasts in women

514
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,770
is for breastfeeding.

515
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,770
Since I never planned to have kids,

516
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,620
that function was meaningless to me.

517
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,140
And think about it,

518
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,900
who decided the beauty standards

519
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,460
for women's breasts?

520
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,090
Breast augmentation is painful.

521
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,810
Do you remember my patient, Ding Manheng?

522
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,770
That young, vibrant girl

523
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,140
who was diagnosed with breast cancer.

524
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,380
But she never felt like

525
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,220
losing a breast

526
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,490
made her life incomplete.

527
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,180
I share her perspective,

528
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,490
so I understand her completely.

529
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,220
Do you wanna hear how I really felt at that moment?

530
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,900
At the time, I thought...

531
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,980
this woman

532
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,420
is so cool.

533
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,620
Praises that don't touch on real emotions

534
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,860
are just empty words.

535
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,090
But I truly felt it.

536
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,940
When we looked at each other,

537
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,770
I finally understood

538
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,570
what true perfection is.

539
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,940
I know you don't want emotions

540
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,290
to take up too much of your energy.

541
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,090
You don't wanna define our relationship.

542
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,900
I respect your choice.

543
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,010
I've thought about it too.

544
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,490
My hope for our future

545
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,700
is that you'll be my girlfriend.

546
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,380
That we can have a future together.

547
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,420
Didn't you say before

548
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,730
that you don't care about the outcome?

549
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,980
Don't break your own character!

550
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,090
All I know is, every day I'm with you,

551
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,220
my heart is filled with endless exclamation marks.

552
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,770
And I want every future day to feel the same.

553
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,810
Oh, there's a market today!

554
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,570
Let's go buy some groceries.

555
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,010
You should show off your cooking skills for lunch!

556
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,140
Be my girlfriend.

557
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,010
Did you hear me? Be my girlfriend!

558
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,140
- Where are you going? - Look, they have radishes here!

559
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,730
Hurry over!

560
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,810
Is there anything else to fill out?

561
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,620
No.

562
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,980
Let's wait for a moment.

563
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,940
Please have a seat.

564
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,420
Take a seat.

565
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,620
What are you looking at?

566
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,570
Hey,

567
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,220
look at the one wearing the hat.

568
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,090
Isn't that the person who was on the news before?

569
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,620
No way.

570
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,660
Quick, check it.

571
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,220
Okay.

572
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,460
Hello.

573
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,140
You must be Ms. Zhou.

574
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,010
I'm Duan Mengmeng.

575
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,140
How many times have you had your nose done?

576
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,860
Three or four times, I think.

577
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,860
My nose is like a seesaw,

578
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,940
press the middle,

579
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,050
and both sides lift up.

580
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,180
That sounds tricky.

581
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,180
What material was used previously?

582
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,090
Was it Gore-Tex or rib cartilage?

583
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,180
The nose isn't important.

584
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,380
Look at my eyes instead.

585
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,770
Open your eyes wider.

586
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,770
Wider.

587
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,700
This is ptosis.

588
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,460
No,

589
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,570
don't you think my eyes

590
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,770
are different sizes?

591
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,050
That's completely normal.

592
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,180
No one in the world

593
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,220
has perfectly symmetrical eyes.

594
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,140
But it bothers me.

595
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,290
I want to open up the inner corner of my right eye

596
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,290
to make them symmetrical.

597
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,980
Let me take a look.

598
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,660
Ms. Zhou.

599
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,810
What's going on?

600
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,770
Didn't you see there's a patient here?

601
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,180
There's an urgent matter that requires your signature.

602
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,330
Sorry about this.

603
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,660
That online activist Duan Ling,

604
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,980
she's now changed her name to Duan Mengmeng.

605
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,860
This woman

606
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,380
has had dozens of cosmetic surgeries.

607
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,620
But she's also sued hospitals dozens of times.

608
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,730
Every time, it's because she was dissatisfied with the results

609
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,530
and wanted to defend her rights.

610
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,810
She's already been blacklisted

611
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,530
by countless hospitals.

612
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,770
Now, in Rongchuan,

613
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,220
there's practically no hospital left

614
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,420
that dares to take her in.

615
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,490
Last month, she sued another hospital,

616
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,770
the one at Exit C of the subway station.

617
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,460
Ms. Zhou, tell me,

618
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,810
she's had so many procedures,

619
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,220
not a single one satisfied her.

620
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,620
Why do you think that is?

621
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,180
Everyone, take a look.

622
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,490
This is her current face.

623
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,140
It's a complete mess.

624
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,010
Look at her eyes, nose,

625
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,730
mouth, chin, even the jawline,

626
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,770
shes had work done on everything.

627
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,050
But all of them turned out badly.

628
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,570
Her mouth is infected,

629
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,420
her nose has perforations,

630
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,090
and her cheekbones are uneven.

631
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,250
So I plan to do a full reconstruction for her.

632
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,570
That's too risky, isn't it?

633
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,530
We understand the sentiment.

634
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,900
Seeing a patient like this,

635
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,380
which one of us here wouldn't want to help her?

636
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,330
We all do.

637
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,460
In the past, for cases like this,

638
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,420
we've had plenty of arguments with consultants,

639
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,140
haven't we?

640
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,620
Yes.

641
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,140
But this patient,

642
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,980
her case is really quite special.

643
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,490
We need to be extra cautious.

644
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,490
Mr. Chu,

645
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,940
you have the most experience.

646
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,380
What's your take?

647
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,330
Looking at the scans,

648
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,770
see this lower part?

649
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,140
The bone here

650
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,220
is almost entirely shaved down.

651
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,460
There's nothing left to work with.

652
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,620
And looking at her in person,

653
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,010
her skin has already

654
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,810
been stretched to the limit.

655
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,980
There's hardly any room left for adjustments,

656
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,980
right?

657
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,900
Now, can this reconstruction

658
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,810
be done?

659
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,860
Technically, yes.

660
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,330
But I worry about causing her further harm.

661
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,940
It could do more harm than good.

662
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,010
That's exactly my point.

663
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,140
Exactly.

664
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,700
That's right.

665
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,530
Look.

666
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,460
With so much prior history,

667
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,940
if anything goes wrong again,

668
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,290
who takes responsibility?

669
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,810
Right?

670
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,460
I had no idea you used to run this kind of institution.

671
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,900
You never mentioned it before.

672
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,010
The industry developed too fast,

673
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,490
and there was a huge talent gap.

674
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,490
Some friends pulled me in,

675
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,220
so I helped them set things up.

676
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,770
For those of us with experience,

677
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,730
we have a responsibility to contribute to the field.

678
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,570
Eat up.

679
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:23,900
Alright.

680
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,380
So, in our hospital,

681
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,380
do we have people who came from these kinds of institutions?

682
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,660
We mainly collaborate with downstream institutions.

683
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,490
As for you,

684
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,900
just focus on teaching for a while.

685
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,700
Teach the subject well.

686
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,090
You don't need to worry about anything else.

687
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,250
But...

688
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,220
teaching completely inexperienced people

689
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,420
and in just one week,

690
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,980
getting them to learn thread lifting?

691
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,250
I have no teaching experience.

692
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,810
I don't even know how to teach.

693
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,380
Ms. Li.,

694
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,010
I don't think I can help you with this.

695
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,090
My dear,

696
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,980
we've known each other for so many years.

697
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,290
You have talent, vision,

698
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,010
and you dream of being a great doctor.

699
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,420
I've seen it all.

700
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,290
To be honest,

701
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,810
among the new generation of doctors at Gemu,

702
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,420
you're the most outstanding.

703
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,050
But talent alone isn't enough.

704
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,010
Besides skill,

705
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,900
the most important thing in life

706
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,290
is making the right choices.

707
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,330
If you make the right choice,

708
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,770
if you're heading in the right direction,

709
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,900
your abilities will take you even further.

710
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,250
But if you choose wrong,

711
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,220
the harder you work,

712
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,420
the further you'll be from your goal.

713
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,460
I've suffered too much from this myself.

714
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,180
It's only in the past two years that I've started to wake up.

715
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,700
Cheng Xiaoli

716
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,900
was in the same year as you, right?

717
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,380
Yes.

718
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,940
She wasn't nearly as talented as you.

719
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,090
But look at her now,

720
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,900
she teaches effortlessly,

721
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,730
earns a ton of money from lectures.

722
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,940
Look at your bag, how many years have you carried it?

723
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,290
Every time I see you, you have that same bag.

724
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,700
Do you know what kind of bag

725
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,180
Cheng Xiaoli carries now?

726
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,570
Ms. Li,

727
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,770
you're absolutely right.

728
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,530
Choice is crucial.

729
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,660
That's why I chose Jiao Ai.

730
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,460
Now, my career is on track.

731
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,010
I have plenty of clients.

732
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,620
Right now, I just wanna

733
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,250
focus on doing my job well,

734
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,140
to live up to the opportunity

735
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,380
you gave me.

736
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,940
Speaking of opportunities,

737
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,730
let me share a little story of my own.

738
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,250
I entered the workforce early.

739
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,940
A poor kid learns to take charge early.

740
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,140
In 2004,

741
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,900
I was working as a technician at a beauty salon.

742
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,140
At that time, there was a supplier named Chong.

743
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,980
He was...

744
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,490
always getting handsy with the girls.

745
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,010
He was truly disgusting.

746
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,700
Everyone avoided him.

747
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,620
Even the boss's wife kept her distance.

748
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,140
Except for me.

749
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,730
I took the initiative to work with him.

750
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,620
The more we interacted, the more familiar we became.

751
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,570
In the end, I was able to open my own shop,

752
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,490
all thanks to

753
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,730
the clients he introduced to me.

754
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,620
I understand what you're saying.

755
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,570
Opportunities have to be fought for and created by oneself.

756
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,140
I'm just...

757
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,900
worried...

758
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,220
Worried about safety?

759
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,620
When cars were first invented,

760
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,330
people were worried about safety too.

761
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,330
And now?

762
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,860
The same situation,

763
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,980
some people see risk,

764
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,980
some see opportunity.

765
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,380
I never give up

766
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,730
on any possibility.

767
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,380
Who knows what tomorrow will bring?

768
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,380
It's okay.

769
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,460
Take your time, no rush.

770
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,620
Waiter.

771
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,330
I see you're not a fan of eating greens.

772
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,490
We should eat meat,

773
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,810
not suffer through grass.

774
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,860
No.

775
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,460
It's fine, really.

776
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,010
Excuse me,

777
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,330
can we have a filet mignon?

778
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,180
Sure, no problem.

779
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,090
No need, Ms. Li.

780
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,770
It's fine.

781
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,220
We haven't even eaten much yet.

782
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,660
I'll cover the bill, take your time eating.

783
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,250
I've got things to do.

784
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,050
This way please.

785
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:08,900
Take your time.

786
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,490
Alright.

787
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,530
Take care, Ms. Li.

788
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,530
Wait.

789
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,260
Jingwen.

790
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,490
- Come. - Mr. Chu.

791
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,940
I suggest that for patients like Duan Mengmeng,

792
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,090
it's best to start with psychological counseling first.

793
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,170
Are you kidding me?

794
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,570
I came to you for service,

795
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,570
not to hear you criticize me.

796
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,610
What do you mean by "comprehensive repair"?

797
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,650
I think you're just desperate to make money.

798
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,210
Calm down, let's talk it through.

799
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,340
Have some water first.

800
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,050
I've seen plenty of people like you.

801
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,380
Tricks won't work on me.

802
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,490
Duan Mengmeng.

803
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,650
No,

804
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,260
I should call you Duan Ling, right?

805
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,900
Then just say it straight.

806
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,090
Can you fix my eyes or not?

807
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,570
In the early days, at the unlicensed black clinic,

808
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,380
which you referred to

809
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,530
as the so-called"famous doctor's" place,

810
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,570
you suffered a lot of losses.

811
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,490
This led to severe damage to your jaw and facial bones.

812
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,260
If I keep working on your face,

813
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,130
your entire face could collapse.

814
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,610
I know.

815
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,340
Looks like you have a lot of experience.

816
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,130
You should've done a repair two or three years ago.

817
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,820
Instead, you went ahead with so many procedures.

818
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,530
Why?

819
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,490
Are you trying to say that I've lost my mind?

820
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,900
I suspect you have Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD).

821
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,420
It's also known as body image disorder.

822
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,460
I wish

823
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,780
I did have BDD.

824
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,010
At least I wouldn't look ugly.

825
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,210
Look at my face,

826
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,820
who wouldn't be shocked when they see it?

827
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,050
No, BDD has nothing to do with appearance.

828
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,210
It's because you care too much about your looks

829
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,690
and exaggerate and imagine

830
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,530
flaws in yourself.

831
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,380
Then you become addicted to plastic surgery.

832
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,050
Addiction to plastic surgery

833
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,210
is also a form of BDD.

834
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,460
But you never reject any patients, right?

835
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,090
You did the procedure for that person

836
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,210
who was looking for her child.

837
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,010
So why are you refusing me?

838
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,050
No problem.

839
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,490
I'm more than willing to do the repair surgery for you.

840
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,940
But beyond that,

841
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,900
I won't do any other procedures for you.

842
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,380
I have a friend

843
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,980
who is very experienced with BDD.

844
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,530
I'll share her WeChat with you,

845
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,570
you can talk to her.

846
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,780
I thought you were someone of importance.

847
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,860
That's why I came to find you.

848
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,260
Don't pretend to be some benevolent doctor.

849
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,130
Zhou Jingwen,

850
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,300
the dirty things you did in the past,

851
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,650
do you really think no one knows?

852
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,300
You caused someone's death and ran off with the money.

853
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,300
Was that you?

854
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,780
Do you know plastic surgery is addictive?

855
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,090
Just help me one more time.

856
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,900
Zhong Shunhua's daughter told me

857
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,090
that you're actually a good person,

858
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,780
but unfortunately, your skills aren't up to par.

859
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,610
That remark didn't hurt much,

860
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,340
but it was deeply insulting.

861
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,170
In fact, that statement didn't mean much.

862
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,300
But when her mother woke up

863
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,820
and said "thank you" to me,

864
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,300
it made me feel incredibly ashamed.

865
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,130
From that day on,

866
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,130
that "thank you"

867
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,420
became a gun hanging over my head,

868
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,610
ready to fire at any moment.

869
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,610
That's why I ask you,

870
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,460
even if there's no legal responsibility,

871
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,690
can you really be at peace inside?

872
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,690
So, do you have an answer in your heart now?

873
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,530
When I was in Guizhou, during a surgery,

874
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,860
halfway through, the power suddenly went out.

875
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,780
Later, I had to finish the surgery using the light from my phone's flashlight.

876
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,530
When I walked out of the operating room,

877
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,980
everything outside was pitch black.

878
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,980
Someone lit a candle,

879
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,900
and we walked forward in the candlelight.

880
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,260
Beyond the candlelight,

881
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,130
we couldn't see anything ahead.

882
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,010
I wanted to review the surgery from that day,

883
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,210
but I realized I couldn't remember anything.

884
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,820
At that moment, I suddenly realized

885
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,940
that the doctors who stay there,

886
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,780
they go on like this every day, walking in the dark.

887
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,610
Every day, they save one person,

888
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,170
and then save the next.

889
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,380
If they can save one, they will.

890
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,740
They don't think about

891
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,010
whether they feel at peace or not.

892
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,610
It's rare for you to have

893
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,260
such feelings.

894
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,980
Sometimes,

895
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,570
being too fixated on your own feelings

896
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,940
can actually be a form of narcissism.

897
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,460
How you face failure is not important.

898
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,130
What matters is performing surgery,

899
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,300
doing surgery continuously,

900
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,690
doing it until you're old,

901
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,860
doing it until you die.

902
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,420
Here we go.

903
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,420
Meatballs.

904
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,050
What's been bothering you recently?

905
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,570
Suddenly you've started gardening.

906
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,300
Qi bought it.

907
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,170
Such a hassle.

908
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,490
She keeps urging me to water it.

909
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,090
You'd think

910
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,010
missing one watering wouldn't kill it.

911
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,650
Seriously.

912
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,980
Here.

913
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,130
Let's eat.

914
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,010
When will they be back?

915
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,650
Next week.

916
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:47,210
What's the difference between the cherry blossoms

917
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,610
and the peach blossoms in the yard?

918
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,210
Why do they have to go all the way to Wuhan to see them?

919
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,940
The one in the yard is a begonia,

920
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,260
and it's been growing there for decades.

921
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,740
Really?

922
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,780
I thought they were all the same.

923
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,420
You probably never really looked at them.

924
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:04,940
This meatball

925
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,780
is about 70-80% like the ones my mom used to make.

926
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,380
How come I can't get the taste just right?

927
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,740
I followed your mom's

928
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,260
recipe exactly.

929
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,570
I followed her recipe too.

930
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,460
It's your cooking pot that's not good.

931
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,260
When I leave later, give me your pot.

932
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,260
That won't do.

933
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,260
You only cook a few times a month.

934
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,380
Look how frugal you are.

935
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,490
From now on, I'll come here to eat every day.

936
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,170
Sounds good.

937
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,820
But you'll need to pay for the meals.

938
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,900
Fine, I'll pay.

939
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,050
Just don't back out later.

940
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,210
Before I went to Guizhou, I went to visit my mom.

941
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,780
You should visit her when you have time.

942
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,940
My meniscus

943
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,860
is getting worse.

944
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,940
Climbing mountains is difficult now.

945
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,460
Do you know my mom's eyebrow

946
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,130
is missing a section?

947
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,610
On the left side,

948
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,340
below the arch of the brow.

949
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,050
You had the same thing when you were little.

950
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,050
Really?

951
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,340
I don't know when,

952
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,650
but it grew back later.

953
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,820
Your mom even mentioned this before.

954
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,010
I never really noticed before

955
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,460
what my mom's eyebrows looked like.

956
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,490
Until the day I went to the funeral home to see her,

957
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,740
I stared at her for a long time.

958
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,820
I suddenly realized,

959
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,690
so this is how my mom's eyebrows looked.

960
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,780
At that moment, she almost seemed unfamiliar to me.

961
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,300
Why bring this up suddenly?

962
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,460
Actually,

963
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,900
I'm not as loving toward my mom as I thought.

964
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,260
I just couldn't bear to see her go.

965
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,940
Your mom was a person

966
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,820
who could really endure.

967
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,820
If it were someone else in that much pain,

968
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,740
they'd have seen a doctor.

969
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:22,860
You know,

970
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,610
we have an orthopedic doctor in the family,

971
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,860
but we didn't realize it was osteosarcoma.

972
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,010
We just kept thinking it was arthritis.

973
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,570
Arthritis.

974
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,420
She just kept applying the patches herself.

975
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,130
If we had found it two months earlier,

976
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,490
maybe there would've been a chance for treatment.

977
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,690
But in her case, not even a god could have saved her.

978
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,340
It's not your fault.

979
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,380
Don't blame yourself anymore.

980
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,690
That day, you said,

981
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,090
you didn't know whether your mom was happy.

982
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,650
But I remember she said

983
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,010
having a daughter like you

984
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,260
was the happiest thing for her.

985
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,900
She was very content.

986
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,170
What's wrong?

987
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:27,420
Did you pour the whole

988
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,460
bottle of vinegar in?

989
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,610
Why is it so sour?

990
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,460
No way.

991
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,900
Did you follow my mom's recipe?

992
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,260
No, this is my own.

993
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,820
You still can't get it right.

994
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,380
I won't pay for the meal.

995
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,130
You eat it yourself.

996
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,690
I just didn't add enough sugar.

997
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,460
Have more meatballs.
