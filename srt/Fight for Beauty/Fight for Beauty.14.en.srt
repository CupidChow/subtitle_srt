1
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,460
Ms. Meng already sent me your medical record.

2
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,490
You developed a tumor

3
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,290
when you were 31 during pregnancy, right?

4
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,100
Yes, that was to give birth to me.

5
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,050
It's been growing every year since.

6
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,460
I've been telling her to get it removed.

7
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,850
She kept saying she's too busy with work.

8
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,770
Look at it now. It's huge and scary.

9
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,900
You won't see it once I put on clothes.

10
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,820
Dr. Meng also said

11
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,930
even if it's removed, it'll grow back.

12
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,980
I want to get rid of it once for all.

13
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,260
Every year she says it's the last batch.

14
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,850
She finally retired this year,

15
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,450
but the school rehired her,

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,730
and she agreed again.

17
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,500
I said it's okay if you get back to work,

18
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,100
but you have to get the surgery done first.

19
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,450
Can I speak for myself?

20
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,500
Doctor, look.

21
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,170
It's growing on my face now.

22
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,010
I'm worried it'll affect my teaching.

23
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,100
Ms. Sun,

24
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,410
you're a top-rated teacher, right?

25
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,260
Yeah.

26
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,540
I've been teaching senior high students for 20 years.

27
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,610
The first batch of students I taught

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,540
are about your age.

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,410
No wonder.

30
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,660
I didn't dare to slouch when you walked in.

31
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,890
Not even with our director do I get this nervous.

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,660
Ms. Sun,

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,820
do you have any secret tips

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,980
you can share with me?

35
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,130
I really need to fix

36
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,540
this unmotivated apprentice.

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,500
Please don't joke.

38
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,340
Back to the main issue.

39
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,010
You have neurofibroma.

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,850
The good news is it won't turn cancerous.

41
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,010
But your tumor is quite large.

42
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,450
There might be bleeding during surgery.

43
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,290
After removal,

44
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,500
your breast shape might change.

45
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,690
You might need reconstruction.

46
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,220
Look, here.

47
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,540
This part...

48
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,260
What is Ms. Zhou doing?

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,780
She snatched the case,

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,610
and forced us to do

51
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,850
a simple surgery,

52
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,010
and now she's suspended.

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,380
Didn't she do all these for the second round of the surgery competition?

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,130
Ms. Qiao, did I say something wrong again?

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,690
No surgery is simple.

56
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,660
I'm just surprised

57
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,170
you're still concerned

58
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,450
about that damn competition.

59
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,260
I'm speaking up for you.

60
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,540
No need.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,890
The elevator is here.

62
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,100
Let's go.

63
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,220
You go up first.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,060
Wait, give that to me.

65
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,060
Go ahead.

66
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,820
Feeling humiliated?

67
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,500
A lot of parents are like this.

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,130
They don't care about their kids' feelings.

69
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,690
My dad's like that.

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,010
I said I'm not a child anymore.

71
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,450
Of course you're not.

72
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,690
You're tall and big.

73
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,100
Let's get to know each other.

74
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,500
I'm Qiao Yang, director of the plastic surgery department.

75
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,490
Can you arrange a surgery for me?

76
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,490
I need to know your situation first.

77
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,370
How old are you now?

78
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,250
23.

79
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,780
23...

80
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,660
At your age,

81
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,490
hormonal fluctuations are normal.

82
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,290
Theoretically, you'd be better if you

83
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,610
take medicine and lose weight.

84
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,250
Hormone adjustment, right?

85
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,490
I've done it. It didn't work.

86
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,100
So you thought of having surgery?

87
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,900
Your parents disagreed,

88
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,220
so you decided on your own?

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,700
I can do the surgery for you,

90
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,460
but the hospital has a rule

91
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,250
that we don't accept patients who take loans for surgery.

92
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,730
The consultant didn't tell me it's not allowed.

93
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,460
Impossible.

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,780
You must have misunderstood.

95
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,700
No, I didn't.

96
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,930
She didn't mention anything about loans.

97
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,220
What exactly did she say?

98
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,140
I found the surgery fee very high.

99
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,220
I can't afford it even with all my savings.

100
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,610
So I asked the consultant

101
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,220
if I could pay in installments.

102
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,170
She said there are many flexible

103
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,460
financing methods.

104
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,540
She even laughed at me not knowing it

105
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,780
as a university graduate.

106
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,250
Do you know about it?

107
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,340
Of course I do.

108
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,810
My dorm mate bought a phone online

109
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,020
with a loan.

110
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,730
Loans are very common now.

111
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,490
You know quite a lot.

112
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,490
Clever.

113
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,050
Then I asked

114
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,810
if I could take a loan.

115
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,610
She said it's my own business,

116
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,610
nothing to do with her.

117
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,340
So I said, fine, I'll get one,

118
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,660
and pay it back myself later.

119
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,340
Got something, Ms. Qiao?

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,250
Leaving work early?

121
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,780
Two appointments tonight.

122
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,250
Ingredients, equipment,

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,540
media, and clients need to be maintained.

124
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,930
My job is 24/7,

125
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,900
no off time.

126
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,140
I really envy you doctors.

127
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,490
With skills and abilities,

128
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,780
you only need to do your job well,

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,170
no need to worry about anything else.

130
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,700
Don't worry about your suspension.

131
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,220
I'll talk to Jingwen tomorrow.

132
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,730
I talked to Dabao.

133
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,490
Handling medical disputes

134
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,580
needs experienced people like us

135
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,700
to communicate with the family.

136
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,900
He told me it's a consultant

137
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,610
named Zhang Qing from our hospital

138
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,900
who suggested he lie about his occupation and apply for a loan.

139
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,050
This is not just a medical dispute.

140
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,290
Is that true?

141
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,170
He's making it up.

142
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,810
Don't be fooled by his baby face.

143
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,020
He's full of lies.

144
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,610
He deceives parents and the hospital.

145
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,810
You can't believe everything he says.

146
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,100
Indeed, we shouldn't listen to one side only.

147
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,850
So I suggest

148
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,780
making Dabao and Qing

149
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,980
to clarify things face to face.

150
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,900
You and Mr. Qin are smart.

151
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,490
You'll know who's lying.

152
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,580
Ms. Qiao,

153
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,290
I tried to help you with the 5G thing

154
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,980
cuz I know

155
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,610
we're all working for the betterment of Gemu.

156
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,850
There's no conflict of interest between us, right?

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,780
Ms. Li.

158
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,980
I'm just discussing the matter as it stands.

159
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,410
I also want to know

160
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,610
what Zhang Qing said to you.

161
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,730
Just now, at that spot,

162
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,580
Qing confessed.

163
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,730
She subtly gave that chubby kid

164
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,020
a small suggestion.

165
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,100
Unexpectedly, he followed through.

166
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,100
It's my fault. I failed to teach her well.

167
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,980
I just scolded her to tears.

168
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,730
It's her first offense.

169
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,490
If this gets out,

170
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,250
it'll be detrimental to Gemu,

171
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,290
and it's not good for your reputation.

172
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,930
We can't let one mistake

173
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,220
affect everyone, right?

174
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,220
It's to protect Gemu's image

175
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,810
and not to implicate everyone

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,140
that I think

177
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,250
we should handle it seriously

178
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,410
to set an example.

179
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,980
What do you think?

180
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,850
Ms. Qiao,

181
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,900
when you first came to Gemu, you said

182
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,580
your biggest interest in life

183
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,010
is only in surgery.

184
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,700
I admired that when I heard it.

185
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,850
To dedicate oneself to one thing for a lifetime,

186
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,490
what a realm that is.

187
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,580
For a trivia like this,

188
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,700
shouldn't we leave it

189
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,340
to the management department?

190
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,010
If I can ignore

191
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,530
matters of principle,

192
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,130
how good can my surgical outcomes be?

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,060
Sorry, Ms. Li.

194
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,650
I really have to get to the bottom of this.

195
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,890
Qing's aim was just

196
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,420
to bring more clients

197
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,820
to Gemu.

198
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,370
The consulting team works tirelessly

199
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,370
for performance.

200
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,980
Qing is really hardworking,

201
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,460
working day and night

202
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,340
even without time to date.

203
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,700
Now, for such a minor mistake,

204
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,610
are you going to pursue it to the end?

205
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,820
Let me put it another way.

206
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,610
Qing was wrong.

207
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,220
She admits it.

208
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,220
Qing works for me.

209
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,730
I want to protect her now.

210
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,130
Can you let it go for my sake?

211
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,850
No.

212
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,420
Qin Gui said loan cosmetic surgeries.

213
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,610
Did you find something?

214
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,180
Yes, I can confirm

215
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,300
Cheng Dabao took a loan for cosmetic surgery

216
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,420
due to Zhang Qing's inducement.

217
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,820
I also talked to Li Qi.

218
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,370
She didn't deny it,

219
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,940
but she also made it clear.

220
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,650
One, she's going to suppress this matter.

221
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,850
Two, she will defend Zhang Qing.

222
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,180
Are you still there?

223
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,890
Now the situation has become complicated.

224
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,250
I need to think about how to handle it.

225
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,370
Got it.

226
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,700
You don't want this to blow up, right?

227
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,580
You don't know Li Qi at all.

228
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,220
You should have told me first.

229
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,730
You shouldn't have talked to her rashly.

230
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,460
You wasted a good card.

231
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,060
Why are you so impatient?

232
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,460
How can I be patient?

233
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,890
Do you have to become a peacemaker

234
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,850
to keep Gemu fair and clean?

235
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,370
Zhou Jingwen.

236
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,180
think about it.

237
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,460
What is the bottom line of Gemu

238
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,650
is in your mind?

239
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,010
You are right.

240
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,490
This can't wait.

241
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,220
Hello, Gemu Hospital.

242
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,420
Sure.

243
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,180
You can come directly.

244
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,060
What are you doing?

245
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,980
I came here on time, but no one served me.

246
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,010
-Please wait a moment. -It's been over half an hour.

247
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,610
Is anyone going to help?

248
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,250
I've been waiting so long.

249
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,700
There's not even a bottle of water.

250
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,130
Please wait a moment.

251
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,010
What time did I make an appointment

252
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,850
with Dr. Zhang?

253
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,220
Even if she has a high position,

254
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,530
it must be handled seriously.

255
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,610
Li Qi and Tang didn't answer the phone.

256
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,940
I couldn't find them either.

257
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,250
Something happened.

258
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,490
Operations and consulting didn't come today.

259
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,460
They all took leave.

260
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,060
I don't know what's going on.

261
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,730
Next week's and

262
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,770
the week after's clients all came today.

263
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,420
This is really...

264
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,610
Calm down, everyone.

265
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,060
Come on.

266
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,340
Let's quiet down.

267
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,250
Ms. Zhou is here.

268
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,490
I'm truly sorry

269
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,770
to keep you waiting so long.

270
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,530
We'll find the doctors

271
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,650
you've booked with.

272
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,460
Sorry for the wait, really sorry.

273
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,100
I came first.

274
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,490
Why are they in front of me?

275
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,730
Yeah, we all made appointments.

276
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,980
Just receive patients as before.

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,130
We'll handle it well, okay?

278
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,980
Okay. Rest assured.

279
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,130
We will, okay?

280
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,530
Camera.

281
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,100
Hua.

282
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,180
I have a question.

283
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,730
Why didn't you notify me before you came?

284
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,700
Well.

285
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,250
Go to my office first.

286
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,420
Yeah. Go there first.

287
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,700
Mr. Qin's office.

288
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,100
Aren't you going to film a short video?

289
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,060
It's time.

290
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,420
Stop what you're doing.

291
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,370
Gather in the lobby.

292
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,460
Gather at the lobby now.

293
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,460
Gather in the lobby.

294
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,220
Gather in the lobby.

295
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,460
What's going on?

296
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,890
Jaw advancement failure surgery.

297
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,300
Look at this. It wasn't done well.

298
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,010
Are you Wang Zhizhi?

299
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,650
Yes, Dr. Lu.

300
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,180
I think there are some faint lines here.

301
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,850
Your chin is a typical

302
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,100
jaw advancement failure.

303
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,820
Open your eyes.

304
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,060
This needs to be fixed.

305
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,580
I just want to slim a little bit.

306
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,300
Dear,

307
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,220
you have no fat to extract.

308
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,460
Take mine for him.

309
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,250
No waste.

310
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,340
Yeah.

311
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,580
Bite down.

312
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,180
Right, don't relax.

313
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,940
Move down a bit. Slowly.

314
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,460
But I want Ms. Meng to do it.

315
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,300
Ms. Meng?

316
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,250
She is off today.

317
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,010
Your figure is well-proportioned.

318
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,650
Really?

319
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,770
There's no need to do that.

320
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,100
I think so too.

321
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,700
Still have the strength to laugh?

322
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,580
This is the scene you want most, right?

323
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,220
No consultant at all,

324
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,010
facing patients directly.

325
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,220
So fulfilling.

326
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,980
Stop it.

327
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,250
You look terrible

328
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,420
when we were in the lobby.

329
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,820
I don't want that either.

330
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,890
Li Qi wanted to get us for that.

331
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,340
I've thought of countless possibilities.

332
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,610
I never expected she'd play missing.

333
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,980
I've known her for so many years.

334
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,420
No matter how angry she gets,

335
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,700
she never ignores clients.

336
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,460
This time, she's really angry.

337
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,610
I'll get to the bottom of the loan cosmetic surgery.

338
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,220
She can keep hiding.

339
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,010
I can wait.

340
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,340
Here.

341
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,820
Speaking of Du Jun,

342
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,100
he still keeps an eye on Gemu even when he left.

343
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,100
I didn't notice that

344
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,730
he has such a small mind?

345
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,730
Rongchuan doesn't have any other hospitals, does it?

346
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,940
Alright.

347
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,220
It's just an industry gathering.

348
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,580
What industry gathering?

349
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,130
This is called showing off.

350
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,580
Showing off wealth.

351
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,980
He wants to poach people

352
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,130
from Gemu.

353
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,180
Doesn't this prove

354
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,980
Gemu's strength in the industry?

355
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,770
You're quite good at finding excuses.

356
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,100
Did you see what he wrote

357
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,890
on the invitation?

358
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,180
Feel the place

359
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,890
where doctors truly shine.

360
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,610
Isn't this a dig at Gemu?

361
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,340
Look at this.

362
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,220
Have some water.

363
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,770
Are you hungry?

364
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,850
A new roast meat place opened on Nanping Street.

365
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,220
Last time I passed by,

366
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,490
there were so many people in line.

367
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,460
I just got a number online.

368
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,300
Shall we try it?

369
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,300
No. I'm full of anger.

370
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,010
What's this?

371
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,770
Cassia tea.

372
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,060
It's good for you.

373
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,090
The consultation storm isn't over yet.

374
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,810
Du Jun is stirring up trouble again.

375
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,330
I'm afraid you'll be mad.

376
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,380
Drink more.

377
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,140
No.

378
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,330
Did you call Tang?

379
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,810
What did he say about Li Qi?

380
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,010
Ms. Li has a sore throat.

381
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,010
Nothing serious.

382
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,050
She'll be fine in a few days.

383
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,220
I mean the loan cosmetic surgery.

384
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,900
He thinks it's impossible.

385
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,290
I think so too.

386
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,010
We have some differences

387
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,010
in management with Li Qi,

388
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,250
but her contributions to Gemu

389
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,660
over the years are evident.

390
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,900
It's unreasonable.

391
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,050
Why is it unreasonable?

392
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,980
You know what Li Qi is like.

393
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,730
-I... -Alright.

394
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,700
It's after work. Don't think about these things.

395
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,420
Relax.

396
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,810
Fate is

397
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,530
quite magical.

398
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,900
Even though I'm in the medical industry,

399
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,660
before meeting you, I never thought

400
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,940
I'd marry a doctor.

401
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,900
It's been nine years

402
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,380
since we first dated.

403
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,490
Though we've had some disputes,

404
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,860
thinking back,

405
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,420
it's mostly sweet.

406
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,490
Drive carefully.

407
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,490
I was touched

408
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,770
by what you said that day.

409
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,810
Your parents treat me well.

410
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,420
You all are tolerant of me.

411
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,730
You gave me a warm home.

412
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,290
I just feel that

413
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,330
I'm a terrible daughter-in-law.

414
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,700
Don't say that about yourself.

415
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,980
My parents really like you.

416
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,140
-They just don't know. -I know.

417
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,900
It's just that I can't fit in yet.

418
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,330
I can pretend to be close to them.

419
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,730
I'm good at that.

420
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,330
But I don't want to.

421
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,730
They're so nice.

422
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,860
Sometimes I just can't

423
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,220
face their warmth.

424
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,090
If you didn't tell me,

425
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,980
I wouldn't have known you thought this way.

426
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,940
You see, this is

427
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,860
our problem.

428
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,050
Lack of communication.

429
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,420
If we can talk it out,

430
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,180
it might be resolved,

431
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,660
right?

432
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,090
Maybe.

433
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,250
I just haven't figured it out yet.

434
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,420
Let's talk when I figure it out.

435
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,900
No rush, take your time.

436
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,010
Song Yuanyuan.

437
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,460
Coming.

438
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,980
What do you want to consult today?

439
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,900
My face.

440
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,900
Have you been here before?

441
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,940
You look familiar.

442
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,490
No, we've never met.

443
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,250
You've been watching dramas lately, right?

444
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,490
Is this one?

445
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,010
You played Suping.

446
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,660
Yes.

447
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,900
I did watch it.

448
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,660
You watched?

449
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,290
Yes, the last scene

450
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,220
was really good.

451
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,980
I was so moved.

452
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,530
Thank you.

453
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,570
You're young.

454
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,460
I wasn't that old.

455
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,620
I was born in 1990.

456
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,530
The one who played my daughter is two years older than me.

457
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,860
Should I praise you or her?

458
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,660
It means you're a good actress.

459
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,860
You can play both young and old.

460
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,010
Thank you.

461
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,770
Dr. Lu.

462
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,570
My problem is

463
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,010
that I'm not pretty enough.

464
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,250
I've never played a lead role.

465
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,490
How does that saying go?

466
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,490
After half a life, still a nobody.

467
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,490
That's me.

468
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,250
First, I think you're very pretty.

469
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,420
You want a lead role face, right?

470
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,810
That's right.

471
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,180
I want to be famous.

472
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,050
Understood.

473
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,420
It's not for fame or fortune.

474
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,050
I really love acting.

475
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,860
But I have to be famous

476
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,860
to get roles.

477
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,090
Or they won't ask me to play the roles,

478
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,770
right?

479
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,180
Then how to get famous?

480
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,730
Actresses have to be pretty.

481
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,330
Beauty is justice.

482
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,050
When I used to audition,

483
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,420
directors would say

484
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,660
I acted well, good acting.

485
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,420
But then

486
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,530
they'd hire someone prettier.

487
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,730
Acting isn't

488
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,220
that important.

489
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,660
I'm already 33.

490
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,900
If I can't play a lead,

491
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,700
I can only play moms.

492
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,220
I understand your feelings.

493
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,010
Let me see where to adjust.

494
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,810
No need to see.

495
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,900
Change everything.

496
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,530
Give me

497
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,570
an influencer's face.

498
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,380
We can't do that.

499
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,010
Um...

500
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,730
What do you call it here?

501
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,220
You know, do the eyes, nose and mouth.

502
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,860
Afterwards,

503
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,140
I'll be a stunning beauty.

504
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,180
How about this?

505
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,460
I'll make a plan for you today.

506
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,620
You can decide next time.

507
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,980
Next time?

508
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,460
Who else got

509
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,620
a message from Jiao Ai?

510
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,180
Did Ms. Qiao get it?

511
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,090
No idea.

512
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,050
I don't know.

513
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,980
Why are you keeping it from us?

514
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,770
What are you chatting about?

515
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,460
Okay. General anesthesia.

516
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,900
Alright.

517
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,730
I have it too.

518
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,770
Is it what you're talking about?

519
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,730
How come you're

520
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,140
so secretive?

521
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,980
Dr. Wei, what are you doing?

522
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,420
Wow. So many cases.

523
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,180
Ms. Qiao must be thrilled.

524
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,180
Give it to me. Don't mess it up.

525
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,380
Remember that one?

526
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,330
The super hard-to-get ticket

527
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,490
for the robot tech thing?

528
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,140
I got it.

529
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,220
I'm not going.

530
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,490
Don't you like it?

531
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,730
Are you upset? What's wrong?

532
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,660
You've seemed off since last night.

533
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,900
Is it because I'm doing the surgery

534
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,010
for Sun Xiao?

535
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,530
Can you stop overthinking?

536
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,090
Didn't I say yesterday?

537
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,250
Congrats to you.

538
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,180
You're good. Ms. Qiao trusts you.

539
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,460
That's what you deserve.

540
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,530
As long as you're not mad.

541
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,180
Come on, give me a smile.

542
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,900
So,

543
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,770
I need to improve my professional skills

544
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,660
No time to hang out with you.

545
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,570
What robot tech?

546
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,810
That's your thing.

547
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,220
I'm not interested at all.

548
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,860
I won't go either.

549
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,770
What do you want to do? I'll join you.

550
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,700
Really?

551
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,900
Did you also get Jiao Ai's message?

552
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,380
I did.

553
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,490
Let's go together.

554
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,860
Isn't that good?

555
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,490
With the hospital's situation now,

556
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,620
if we go, what will people think of Gemu?

557
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,980
Can you tone down

558
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,380
your sense of responsibility?

559
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,290
I'm not...

560
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,460
Okay, stop talking.

561
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,700
You don't have to go.

562
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,490
I'll go by myself.

563
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,490
Come on.

564
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,810
I mean, how about we just...

565
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,330
-Okay. -I...

566
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,220
Let's go.

567
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,220
Check this out.

568
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,860
What's wrong?

569
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,460
He's handsome.

570
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,220
Yeah.

571
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,620
A Russian kid studying in China,

572
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,140
crazy about girl groups,

573
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,420
wants to look Asian.

574
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,460
Who would've thought, right?

575
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,330
You know about fan circles?

576
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,490
What about girl groups?

577
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,700
Basically,

578
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,900
they're a bunch of hardcore fans

579
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,380
always online.

580
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,090
This case will definitely blow up.

581
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,620
That's impressive.

582
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,660
Where did you find this case?

583
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,140
I really put in the effort.

584
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,660
I saw him commenting

585
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,940
under another doctor's video,

586
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,220
so I DM'd him.

587
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,860
I had to sweet-talk him for days,

588
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,570
and finally got him

589
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,330
to come here.

590
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,250
If he refused,

591
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,330
would you have started learning Russian?

592
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,940
If you don't like this one,

593
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,250
there are other cases.

594
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,330
Alright, alright.

595
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,570
Take a break.

596
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,860
Cross-racial surgery is unrealistic.

597
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,810
Even if he came to me personally,

598
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,900
I'd refuse.

599
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,330
You were sweet-talking him?

600
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,660
Tell me,

601
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,420
what were you thinking?

602
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,620
Cross-racial is unrealistic,

603
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,140
but that's for other doctors.

604
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,900
Your skills are top-notch.

605
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,490
I think there's no surgery you can't do.

606
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,900
Are you flattering me?

607
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,180
Yes. I mean it.

608
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,290
I'm not as arrogant as you think.

609
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,290
As a doctor,

610
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,180
you need a bit of humility.

611
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,700
Don't think you can change the world

612
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,290
with your skills.

613
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,010
Have you gone mad?

614
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,220
What are you thinking

615
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,090
all day?

616
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,380
Can you eat all that by yourself?

617
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,860
Let me help you.

618
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,490
Dr. Qiao.

619
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,980
Why are you here?

620
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,180
Are you often here alone?

621
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,980
Are you here alone too?

622
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,490
Aren't they here too?

623
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,330
Stop it. They're all watching you.

624
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,050
Roll up the window and take a picture through it.

625
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,770
I'm impressed by these TV crew doing variety shows.

626
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,090
They follow you everywhere,

627
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,420
worse than an ex-boyfriend.

628
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,810
But don't worry,

629
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,700
I didn't meet you here because of them.

630
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,090
I'm not wearing a mic.

631
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,620
Then will you

632
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,700
do my surgery?

633
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,420
I still need to think about it.

634
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,140
Look, Dr. Qiao,

635
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,730
I returned all the online loans I took.

636
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,180
I even closed my accounts.

637
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,620
I promise I won't take loans again.

638
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,900
And I'll explain everything

639
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,700
to my parents.

640
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,330
I need to head over after lunch.

641
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,700
Okay.

642
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,490
It's over at that cinema.

643
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:48,900
Okay.

644
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,330
There.

645
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,010
I'm here today.

646
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,620
Cheng Big Chest.

647
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,050
To talk about it.

648
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,900
Haven't seen you in years. Your chest got bigger.

649
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,810
Why isn't he responding?

650
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,530
Colleague?

651
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,180
Stop it.

652
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,050
His girlfriend's over there.

653
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,730
What girlfriend? So old.

654
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,380
Is that his mom?

655
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,180
His mom's chest is pretty flat.

656
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,620
No wonder she raised him like that.

657
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,620
Turns out she pinned her hopes

658
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,010
on her son.

659
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,940
Yeah.

660
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,090
Don't mind them.

661
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,220
Having such big chest,

662
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,460
he is really a credit to his mom.

663
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,530
Annoying.

664
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,490
Come on.

665
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,810
What drink do you want?

666
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,250
Coffee.

667
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,490
Are you still drinking that cola?

668
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,090
Are you nuts?

669
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,250
She took action.

670
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,330
Let me see.

671
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,460
Which folder has the clients

672
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,050
that Ms. Zhou saw last week?

673
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,770
Find it yourself.

674
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,380
I haven't even sorted out my own stuff.

675
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,050
I...

676
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,900
Why is there no coffee in the machine?

677
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,900
Is anyone taking care of it?

678
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,660
Sure.

679
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,050
What?

680
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,090
Coffee!

681
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,090
Coffee.

682
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,980
Coffee is in that folder.

683
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,940
What folder?

684
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,570
Come with me.

685
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,140
Sir.

686
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,660
What's that smell?

687
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,860
Thank you, Dr. Qiao.

688
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,250
No problem.

689
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,460
Those two were my college dorm mates.

690
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,380
They used to bully me at school,

691
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,900
called me girly, gave me nicknames,

692
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,010
and kept touching my chest.

693
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,380
I didn't dare fight back.

694
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,420
You were so fierce just now.

695
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,380
When can I be like you?

696
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,940
You're not fierce?

697
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,220
You took a loan for cosmetic surgery behind your parents' back.

698
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,290
How much fiercer do you want to be?

699
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,490
You're already a tough guy.

700
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,810
Is that your ride?

701
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,940
Yeah, I'm heading off.

702
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,140
-Go. -Thank you, Dr. Qiao.

703
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,380
Dabao.

704
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,420
Why the bow?

705
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,220
Let me take a look.

706
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,090
Bye.

707
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,380
Your tailing skills are terrible.

708
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,220
Can we chat?

709
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,730
Are you okay?

710
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,940
I'm fine.

711
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,730
We really need to change the soil.

712
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:03,810
Jingwen.

713
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,770
are the doctors from our hospital

714
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,290
attending Du Jun's industry gathering today?

715
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,290
They will.

716
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,570
If it were me, I'd go too.

717
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,730
Actually,

718
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,290
running a hospital is like

719
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,460
growing plants.

720
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,380
To make it thrive,

721
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,770
you have to turn the soil,

722
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,660
water it, fertilize it frequently.

723
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,460
Only then can the roots grow strong.

724
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,140
Look at your pot, it's wilting.

725
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,250
The roots are rotten.

726
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,700
Rotten roots mean there's no saving it.

727
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,090
I'm just afraid

728
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,010
if we don't change the soil,

729
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,460
it'll still live well.

730
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,730
But if we force it,

731
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,090
will it die quickly?

732
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,180
It's really a tough choice.

733
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,380
If you were to change the soil,

734
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,220
how would you do it?

735
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,180
Actually, with Qiao Yang here,

736
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,330
I've been thinking about something.

737
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,940
I think Gemu

738
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,250
should have doctors meeting patients directly.

739
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,660
All treatment should be decided by doctors.

740
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,810
It means Gemu won't have

741
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,290
consultants in the future.

742
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,380
That's a bold idea.

743
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,420
But it requires some serious courage.

744
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,770
Sir,

745
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,010
lately, I feel like

746
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,490
I've been busy for most of my life,

747
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,730
but nothing's changed.

748
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,180
Back to square one.

749
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,050
Back then, I had nothing,

750
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,570
I wasn't afraid of losing anything.

751
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,010
Even if I got expelled from school,

752
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,980
I'd just start over somewhere else,

753
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,700
take the exams again,

754
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,180
start everything from scratch.

755
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,220
But now,

756
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,140
I don't have the courage to start over.

757
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,660
I feel like I've lived in vain.

758
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,770
No one's life is in vain.

759
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,290
Look,

760
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,490
you used to be like this,

761
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,090
only has a few young branches.

762
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,810
Now you're like this.

763
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,420
You have knowledge, skills, abilities,

764
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,700
and a strong mind.

765
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,730
No one can take that away from you.

766
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,860
Besides,

767
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,770
you're not alone now.

768
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,380
You've got Qin Gui, Qiao Yang, and me.

769
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,660
We're all on your side.

770
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,180
If the sky falls,

771
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,250
the tall ones like Qin Gui will hold it up.

772
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,050
If not, I'm average-sized,

773
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,660
I can help a bit.

774
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,770
Thank you, Sir.

775
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,620
Alright, leave these to you.

776
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,250
Check if my eyeliner is smudged.

777
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,220
Should we just leave?

778
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,090
It's an industry gathering, not a recruitment event.

779
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,660
Shouldn't we young doctors

780
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,140
see the world more?

781
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,140
What a great opportunity.

782
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,090
Put on the suit.

783
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,860
I don't want to. It's too hot.

784
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,810
You're so troublesome.

785
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,140
Sign in here?

786
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,420
Mingjie.

787
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,090
Deng Tao.

788
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,330
How many years since college graduation?

789
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,460
It's been a while.

790
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,180
You're back from Korea?

791
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,980
Yeah.

792
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,140
Who's this?

793
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,810
This is my girlfriend.

794
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,460
Hi, I'm Wei Xiaoxi.

795
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,900
Deng Tao, his college classmate.

796
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,180
You're doing well, huh?

797
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,900
Got a prettier girlfriend.

798
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,700
Let's exchange contacts.

799
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,810
I'm single.

800
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,330
Introduce me to your friends.

801
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,730
Scan me.

802
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,380
Okay.

803
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,380
You work at Gemu too?

804
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,210
Yeah.

805
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,260
You know Mr. Du well?

806
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,420
He's my mentor.

807
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,050
Don't miss this opportunity then.

808
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,380
Jiao Ai's on a roll now.

809
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,420
Who can compete?

810
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,530
Alright, I'm heading in.

811
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,420
Don't forget it.

812
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,570
You are

813
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,420
single for a reason.

814
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,740
How many have you dated?

815
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,530
Not many, you know them all.

816
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,690
Just those few.

817
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,260
What are you doing here?

818
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,780
What am I doing here?

819
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,610
What are you doing here?

820
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,780
Where's Wei Xiaoxi?

821
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:02,980
She's...

822
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,740
transforming into a butterfly.

823
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,900
Flying around.

824
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,690
Wait a minute.

825
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,460
How do you know she's here?

826
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,980
If she didn't come, would you?

827
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,210
You always stick with her.

828
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,210
That's right.

829
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,210
Stop looking.

830
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,170
Have a bite, come on.

831
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,860
I'll have a drink.

832
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,130
You've been in the industry for ten years?

833
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,820
Doesn't look like it, you look so young.

834
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,260
As a plastic surgeon,

835
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,900
do you do stuff to your face

836
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,900
on a regular basis?

837
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,980
We're basically guinea pigs.

838
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,210
We try out the injectables

839
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,490
before applying them to patients.

840
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,530
Sometimes the two sides of my face look different.

841
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,740
Look,

842
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,170
my left side is prettier than my right,

843
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,530
right?

844
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,740
I didn't notice your face was uneven.

845
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,610
Why are you here?

846
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,050
Came for a free meal. Continue.

847
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,210
Create your beautiful future with Jiao Ai.

848
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,460
Ladies and gentlemen.

849
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,860
So you take bad photos of me.

850
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,050
Welcome to Jiao Ai dinner party,

851
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,900
Next, let's welcome...

852
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,980
Why did she leave? Another fight?

853
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,260
No.

854
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,490
Treat her better.

855
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,610
Ladies and gentlemen,

856
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,090
let's warmly welcome Mr. Du Jun.

857
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,980
Welcome everyone.

858
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,340
Create your beautiful future with Jiao Ai.

859
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,860
I'm president of Jiao Ai, Du Jun.

860
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,300
Doctors and guests, thank you

861
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,530
for coming here tonight.

862
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,900
Thank you for recognizing Jiao Ai

863
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,570
and supporting it.

864
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,490
This year, Jiao Ai will

865
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,090
focus on talent recruitment.

866
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,610
As a doctor,

867
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,170
I understand what doctors need most.

868
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,210
One is a sense of achievement,

869
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,900
the other is belonging.

870
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,490
In Jiao Ai, as long as you have the ability,

871
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,610
we'll do our best

872
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,210
to build a brand for you.

873
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,820
In the future,

874
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,820
every doctor at Jiao Ai will be a star,

875
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,530
a super star.

876
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,490
Ms. Zhou,

877
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,860
isn't the consulting team on leave?

878
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,460
I'm here to record some client data.

879
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,490
There's too much backlog from before.

880
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,260
Your name is Ji Jie, right?

881
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,610
You know me?

882
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,780
No need to save electricity while working.

883
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,690
Thanks for your hard work.

884
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,690
Thank you.

885
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,980
Hello, where are you?

886
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,170
Cheers!

887
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,340
Thank you.

888
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,170
I don't eat beef.

889
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,050
You're a grown-up. Picky with food?

890
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,860
You didn't just call me here to eat, did you?

891
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,860
Of course not.

892
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,210
I called you to pay the bill.

893
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,050
What's up?

894
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,460
I talked to Cheng Dabao.

895
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,130
His reasons are solid.

896
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,380
I'll take on the surgery.

897
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,210
Having trouble finding new cases?

898
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,570
I can provide you with some cases.

899
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,980
Dabao's case is a no-go.

900
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,090
Until the loan cosmetic surgery thing

901
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,380
is clear,

902
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,300
this surgery must be on hold.

903
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,210
Think about it.

904
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,690
If Guo Xuan finds out,

905
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,260
she'll definitely make a big deal out of it.

906
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,050
I approached Dabao myself.

907
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,900
Guo Xuan has a sharp nose.

908
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,740
Already had a team follow me all day.

909
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,610
Let them know then.

910
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,900
Sure they'll make a fuss

911
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,210
about this case.

912
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,260
What do you think?

913
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,530
What do I think?

914
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,980
Now we're hitting a rough patch.

915
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,380
Our investigation just started,

916
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,900
and they've already caught us.

917
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,490
We have to keep digging.

918
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,490
As the saying goes,

919
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,740
the dog that gets hit by a stone barks the loudest.

920
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,260
That means we're on the right track.

921
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,130
These consultants,

922
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,010
guiding patients to take loans for surgery,

923
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,210
it's all with Li Qi's approval.

924
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,380
Yeah.

925
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,740
With the consulting team gone,

926
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,420
foot traffic is halved.

927
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,010
Those doctors can't keep their cool.

928
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,690
Thanks.

929
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,940
Foot traffic's like stock prices.

930
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,010
Patients chase highs and sell lows.

931
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,300
When things get better,

932
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,860
they'll come back.

933
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,820
After all, patients trust doctors,

934
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,010
not consultants.

935
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,820
But doctors

936
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,010
need to take on

937
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,090
the consultants' work.

938
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,490
And the number of patients

939
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,170
they receive will go down.

940
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,900
Taking you for an example,

941
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,610
you used to see 20 or more patients a day,

942
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,010
now it's only a dozen.

943
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,210
Workload up, performance down.

944
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,460
I know you don't care,

945
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,570
but other doctors

946
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,530
need to make a living.

947
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,860
Who said I don't care?

948
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,210
I'm not doing charity here.

949
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,170
I'm counting on you to help me

950
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,740
to achieve financial freedom.

951
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,260
Anyway, doing things

952
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,170
comes with a price.

953
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,780
You can't just stop working

954
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,860
due to some issues.

955
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,780
It's like having a tumor on your liver.

956
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,130
As a doctor,

957
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,610
you know the surgical risks,

958
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,740
the potential side effects.

959
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,460
But if you ignore it,

960
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,530
the tumor will keep growing, festering,

961
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,130
eventually turning malignant.

962
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,300
Your life won't be spared.

963
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,780
And you'll have no choice.

964
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,690
Well...

965
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,300
Right?

966
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,860
Can't you wish me well?

967
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,530
I'm just giving an example.

968
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,460
I should eat more

969
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,820
to live longer.

970
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,740
Eat more meat

971
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,420
to take a beating.

972
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,380
So annoying.

973
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,650
Dr. Qiao,

974
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,610
what do you think about loan cosmetic surgery?

975
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,740
No matter what,

976
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,610
loan cosmetic surgery is unacceptable.

977
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,900
It's a matter of principle.

978
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,380
But Dabao's situation

979
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,010
taught me something.

980
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,210
In future consultations,

981
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,050
I should pay attention to the reason why

982
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,210
they must have surgery,

983
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,010
and try to understand them.

984
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,650
I'll still do

985
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,340
Dabao's surgery.

986
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,050
This was shot today.

987
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,900
This was shot today, Xuan.

988
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,530
With such good material,

989
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,260
you're going to use it like this?

990
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,010
How should I edit it?

991
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,090
Ms. Guo, someone is looking for you.

992
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,980
Do you need me to teach you?

993
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,130
Please teach me.

994
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,010
What's wrong, Ms. Li?

995
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,570
Got something to trouble you with.

996
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,210
This way.

997
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,530
When will my tough days end?

998
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,610
I'm telling you, it's effective.

999
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,940
Are we still ordering box lunches?

1000
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,090
Again with the Guangdong style.

1001
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,170
You... you...

1002
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,780
Bring a pen over, Dai.

1003
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,940
Start with the follow-up calls.

1004
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,050
Who am I?

1005
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,090
Mr. Tang.

1006
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,860
What's so urgent?

1007
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,820
I still got something...
