1
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,460
Open the door!

2
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,050
Jiaxu!

3
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,180
Tong Jiaxu, open up!

4
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,100
Or I'll kick it down!

5
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,820
What are you doing?

6
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,930
Wait.

7
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,770
This should be it.

8
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,930
Jiaxu!

9
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,490
-Jiaxu. -Dr. Zhou.

10
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,050
Here, open up.

11
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,490
Tell Auntie if you're upset.

12
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,460
Open the door.

13
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,820
Open up!

14
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,410
Listen.

15
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,210
Jiaxu!

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,980
Hurry, open up.

17
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,740
Dr. Zhou.

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,410
Hello, Manager.

19
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,130
Open up!

20
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,180
Mom, stay out of it.

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,410
Lin,

22
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,850
-I got a screwdriver. -Jiaxu.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,780
Jiaxu!

24
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,730
-Give it to me. -Open up!

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,130
No, don't pry it.

26
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,260
Stop, stop, stop!

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,850
Who's paying if you break it?

28
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,540
How much?

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,410
I'll pay, okay?

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,260
Just open it.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,940
Hello, Lin.

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,340
This is the dress I like.

33
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,820
Wow,

34
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,540
how did you know?

35
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,730
The staff remembered you.

36
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,340
But,

37
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,890
Dad said it's not so good.

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,170
Is he wearing it, or you?

39
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,980
It's not his wedding.

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,260
It's yours.

41
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,100
Wear what you like.

42
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,010
Is that so hard to understand?

43
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,220
It's mine.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,570
Thank you!

45
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,010
I won't give a wedding gift, then.

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,450
Did Qiao Chunsheng set up this room?

47
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,220
How'd you know?

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,010
It's his style.

49
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,610
The ceremony's on the lawn.

50
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,570
You have to come!

51
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,410
Lin didn't suspect anything, right?

52
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,890
It's all handled.

53
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,730
Don't worry.

54
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,780
Weren't you fine before?

55
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,850
I just want to look good

56
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,380
in the wedding video.

57
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,010
Photos can be edited.

58
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,450
Videos make my face look bigger.

59
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,010
It's worse than I thought.

60
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,220
What's going on?

61
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,730
The wedding is starting soon.

62
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,940
You're still not done?

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,500
Look.

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,660
Still not done?

65
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,340
Did you get Botox?

66
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,940
What's wrong with your eyes?

67
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,660
Maybe I cried too much.

68
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,500
Feels hard to open them.

69
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,940
Having trouble breathing?

70
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,060
Feeling weak?

71
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,170
Jiaxu,

72
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,660
How much cheaper was that injection?

73
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,450
Compared to Gemu?

74
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,060
Half price.

75
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,820
Do you remember the packaging color?

76
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,690
What was it?

77
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,820
I think…

78
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,610
I think it was pink.

79
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,580
Meditoxin.

80
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,340
I'm calling an ambulance.

81
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,050
Hurry.

82
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,460
Is that really necessary?

83
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,580
Jiaxu, your Botox is smuggled.

84
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,340
Way over legal limits.

85
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,290
You're suffering botulinum poisoning.

86
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,810
You need the hospital ASAP.

87
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,730
This is an emergency.

88
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,410
No way!

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,290
I can't go to the hospital.

90
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,580
Aren't you doctors?

91
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,220
There must be another way!

92
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,460
I can't let Lin see me like this.

93
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,100
He hates plastic surgery faces.

94
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,810
He always brags

95
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,660
no amount of money

96
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,580
can beat his wife's natural beauty.

97
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,460
I just saw Lin upstairs.

98
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,050
Just a chubby guy.

99
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,930
There are plenty like him everywhere.

100
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,220
You're worried about losing him?

101
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,900
Your life or him?

102
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,810
Maybe this wedding isn't worth it.

103
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,410
Done yet?

104
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,050
Five more minutes.

105
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,810
Let's go.

106
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,100
Dr. Zhou,

107
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,140
please, I beg you.

108
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,900
No way.

109
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,170
Good thing I got here in time.

110
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,850
Your Gemu team

111
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,980
needs better diagnostics.

112
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,540
You're just quicker with your mouth than I am with my mind.

113
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,610
Nothing to brag about.

114
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,290
Being stubborn is your specialty.

115
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,730
Hurry.

116
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,780
Jiaxu!

117
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,810
Jiaxu, what's wrong?

118
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,220
Don't get too close!

119
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,900
What's happening to her?

120
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,020
Fake Botox.

121
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,170
Fake Botox?

122
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,660
Botox poisoning.

123
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,930
A little later, and she'd be dead.

124
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,930
Botox?

125
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,580
Where did she use it?

126
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,700
Her face.

127
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,930
Otherwise, no one would notice.

128
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,780
Where you going?

129
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,700
She hasn't even woken up.

130
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,050
Bring the cart in.

131
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,610
Aren't you going with them?

132
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,050
Who are you?

133
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,020
I've treated Tong Jiaxu before.

134
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,050
I'm a plastic surgeon.

135
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,900
A plastic surgeon?

136
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,220
People like you

137
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,050
keep brainwashing them.

138
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,930
Make normal girls obsessed with this stuff.

139
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,290
Jiaxu used to be pretty.

140
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,730
Pure and natural.

141
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,610
That's the Jiaxu I liked.

142
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,140
How long ago was that?

143
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,460
Don't tell me you don't know

144
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,170
she had her eyes and nose done.

145
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,900
We've been together since college.

146
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,050
I know exactly what she used to look like.

147
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,140
Better than you do.

148
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,930
So do you hate that she got surgery

149
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,410
or are you just scared your friends will find out?

150
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,780
And you'll lose face?

151
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,700
Why did she lie to me?

152
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,170
I thought when we got married and had a son,

153
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,540
he'd inherit her genes.

154
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,460
And be a handsome boy.

155
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,140
Why did she need surgery?

156
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,490
Why?

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,050
Because she wanted to be perfect for you.

158
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,460
That's why.

159
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,980
You know a lot of girls

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,410
aren't confident.

161
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,980
You're too harsh.

162
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,810
You love her face,

163
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,700
but can't accept that it was enhanced.

164
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,660
Do you even realize that for this wedding

165
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,020
she almost died?

166
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,170
And you're stuck on why she lied?

167
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,050
Do you even care

168
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,370
if she wakes up?

169
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,250
Lin.

170
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,900
You're awake.

171
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,340
You were poisoned by Meditoxin.

172
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,250
Your mom's on her way.

173
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,900
Don't worry.

174
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,290
What about my wedding?

175
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,170
Forget about it.

176
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,140
Wait until the Meditoxin

177
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,290
clears out first.

178
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,410
What about my husband?

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,410
Tong Jiaxu's awake.

180
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,730
Her mom's with her at the hospital.

181
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,020
Think it through carefully

182
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,250
whether you want to get married or not.

183
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,730
You're from Gemu?

184
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,610
I met your director recently.

185
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,370
Zhou Jingwen.

186
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,050
She's an old friend of a doctor from our hospital.

187
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,250
You mean Qiao Yang?

188
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,780
You know her too?

189
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,850
She's here.

190
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,700
He came with me.

191
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,850
With you?

192
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,250
So you two are…?

193
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,300
Where's my dad?

194
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,010
Dad?

195
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,610
Probably waiting backstage with Wang Qi.

196
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,770
He's probably sweating like crazy.

197
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,300
Dad?

198
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,530
Ladies and gentlemen,

199
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,100
welcome!

200
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,730
And you two?

201
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,250
The wedding is about to begin.

202
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,770
Please take your seats.

203
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,530
Sit on either side of the stage.

204
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,060
Let's sit, Ziyou.

205
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,980
Come on.

206
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,850
Go, find a seat.

207
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,490
I need some food first.

208
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,610
Groom, face the bride.

209
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,580
Hold out your bouquet.

210
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,060
And give it to your beautiful bride.

211
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,820
Bride's father,

212
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,370
lift your daughter's hand

213
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,060
and place it in the groom's.

214
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,420
Silence says more than words.

215
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,700
Now, Bride's father,

216
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,770
please seal this blessing with a hug.

217
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,700
The dress is gorgeous.

218
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,940
Not bad.

219
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,420
Thank you very much.

220
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,340
Bride's father, please take your seat.

221
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,770
I never even had a wedding.

222
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,530
Starting Gemu kept me too busy.

223
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,460
Had no time.

224
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,060
You love the spotlight so much.

225
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,300
Thought you'd have a wedding at Tahiti.

226
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,890
Isn't our bride stunning?

227
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,700
She is!

228
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,700
Then let's hear some applause!

229
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,490
Yeah!

230
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:11,940
Sir.

231
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,300
A huge thanks to everyone.

232
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,650
At this moment...

233
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,300
Sir.

234
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,010
the newlyweds

235
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,250
are so grateful to have you all here.

236
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:19,820
May I ask,

237
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,060
do you have any wisdom to share?

238
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,220
Any tips you could pass on to me?

239
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,180
Let's bow deeply.

240
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,060
Thank you all!

241
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,010
Just one thing.

242
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,530
You chose this path.

243
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,300
Even if you have to crawl, keep going.

244
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,010
So, the couple should call each other...

245
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,340
Then why'd you stop crawling

246
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,370
and start running?

247
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,820
She ran.

248
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,980
I had to chase her.

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,010
Did you catch her?

250
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,700
If I did, would we be talking?

251
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,300
I lost her.

252
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,940
We went our separate ways.

253
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,490
It's your turn now.

254
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,650
Look into each other's eyes.

255
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,490
Don't worry.

256
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,460
I've got a bike.

257
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,340
I can catch her.

258
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,130
Good luck.

259
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,580
Why doesn't Qiao Yang's sister have the same last name?

260
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,730
-At this moment, -She didn't tell you?

261
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,940
Our dear friends have a blessing...

262
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,250
What's your relationship with the bride?

263
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,180
That stiff-looking guy who walked her down

264
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,890
is my father.

265
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,220
And the woman next to her,

266
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,610
crying her eyes out, is her mother.

267
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,530
And my step-mother.

268
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,580
Your sister's beautiful.

269
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,300
You two seem close.

270
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,940
We had no interaction before.

271
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,580
Our friendship reached its peak just ten minutes ago.

272
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,220
What do you mean?

273
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,130
Maybe I saw

274
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,100
a bit of my younger,

275
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,650
obedient self in her.

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,340
Go hug the beautiful bride.

277
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,130
Big round of applause!

278
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,700
You? Obedient?

279
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,820
Since the day I met you,

280
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,420
you've been all sharp edges.

281
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,420
Today, we're surrounded

282
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,220
by the newlyweds' closest friends and family.

283
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,490
And four important guests.

284
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,820
About what I mentioned this morning,

285
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,340
just think about it.

286
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,060
What?

287
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,340
Come to Gemu. Name your terms.

288
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,010
I'm really curious,

289
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,980
given our relationship,

290
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,700
why do you keep coming to me?

291
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,820
What do you really want?

292
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,220
In two months,

293
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,580
we'll have known each other for 17 years.

294
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,420
So?

295
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,340
Not many people in the world

296
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,980
understand each other like we do.

297
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,770
We've seen each other at our worst.

298
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,420
Why not work together?

299
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,530
I don't understand you.

300
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,180
I'm still hungry.

301
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,770
And we're leaving?

302
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,100
You're not even taking a bite?

303
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,180
I'm not hungry.

304
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,460
What's wrong? Bad mood?

305
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,940
I'll treat you. What do you want to eat?

306
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,700
Anything if you're paying.

307
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,060
Then Japanese food.

308
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,820
How about it?

309
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,420
Qiao Yang.

310
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,580
What did you do at the Third Hospital?

311
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,730
He should've told you everything, right?

312
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,300
You should thank him.

313
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,770
He still cares about you this much.

314
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,890
Back then,

315
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,610
you insisted on choosing that major.

316
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,250
I disagreed.

317
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,420
And what did you say?

318
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,980
You said you loved it.

319
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,300
Wanted to do it for life.

320
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,770
I'm resigning,

321
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,940
not changing careers.

322
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,100
You quit everything halfway.

323
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,060
Marriage?

324
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,730
Divorced.

325
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,300
Job you picked?

326
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,940
Quit.

327
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,100
Shouldn't you

328
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,580
have some sense of responsibility in life?

329
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,100
Since you chose to be a doctor,

330
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,220
you should stay at the Third Hospital.

331
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,180
Life isn't just one path.

332
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,890
I have to be responsible for myself first.

333
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,220
That's selfish.

334
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,250
I'm selfish?

335
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,580
You picked Wang Qi's wedding dress.

336
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,580
What were you thinking?

337
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,940
What's wrong with my choice?

338
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,890
Looks fine.

339
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,340
It was fine.

340
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,370
And what, no dress, no wedding?

341
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,700
We wore military uniforms back then.

342
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,250
Yeah.

343
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,580
But you saw her in that dress today, right?

344
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,530
Look good?

345
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,530
I bought it.

346
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,700
Just for show.

347
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,060
You're just like your mom.

348
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,650
All about vanity.

349
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,130
Qiao Chunsheng,

350
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,530
you're a good doctor,

351
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,130
but never the best.

352
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,610
You know why?

353
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,980
Because you'll never understand

354
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,300
some simple things.

355
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,850
What? What's that supposed to mean?

356
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,770
Calm down!

357
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,490
Am I wrong?

358
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,180
Calm down.

359
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,820
Hey, you...

360
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,300
Qiao Yang!

361
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,580
Let go of him!

362
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,530
You wanna hit me?

363
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,530
-I'll hit you! -Stay calm.

364
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,010
Calm down!

365
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,980
Let's talk this out.

366
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,370
I apologized to Ms. Li.

367
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,460
Are you crazy?

368
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,580
Are you both crazy?

369
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,770
Don't be fooled by her tough act.

370
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,940
When you left,

371
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,220
she's regretting it.

372
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,650
She promised me if you come back...

373
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,580
Let her go.

374
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,180
No more hair stuff.

375
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,060
I'm telling you, that's just her.

376
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,370
Qiao Yang!

377
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,130
Always like this.

378
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,940
Runs from problems.

379
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,730
I'll talk to her later.

380
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,370
What's the point?

381
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,060
That's meaningless.

382
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,940
Leave it to me.

383
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,610
I'll talk to her.

384
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,250
I'll convince her.

385
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,370
No need. I know her.

386
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,460
She's always been like this.

387
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:26,850
Sir.

388
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,890
Who are you?

389
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,250
I…

390
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,250
Just a colleague.

391
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,420
Maybe more than a colleague.

392
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,820
Do you think in life

393
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,220
people should have some sense of responsibility?

394
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,980
That's just her.

395
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,850
Always like this.

396
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,580
Runs from problems.

397
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,700
You quit everything halfway.

398
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,340
You're just like your mom.

399
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,980
All about vanity.

400
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,010
Mom and dad

401
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,940
talked about divorce a lot.

402
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,980
We just don't click.

403
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,580
Imagine living with someone like that for most of your life.

404
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,180
Must've been tough.

405
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,610
Tong Jiaxu's wedding's off.

406
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,420
How long has it been since we've seen each other,

407
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,180
since I left the Third Hospital?

408
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:02,980
Look at you.

409
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,860
You haven't changed a bit, still so young.

410
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,010
Staying young is part of our job, right?

411
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,620
It's basic professionalism.

412
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,570
I went to Gemu the other day.

413
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,660
Nice renovation.

414
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,700
Too bad you already left.

415
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,290
Zhou Jingwen contacted you, right?

416
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,250
After working together for so many years,

417
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,810
I can say with confidence,

418
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,380
Gemu is definitely not right for you.

419
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,660
You don't seem to think much of Gemu.

420
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,730
You might not know Zhou Jingwen well.

421
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,940
Yeah.

422
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,860
I don't know her well.

423
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,490
But let me just say one thing.

424
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,810
When she came to the Third Hospital to recruit me,

425
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,250
she promised that if I came,

426
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,900
I'd have control over the hospital.

427
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,330
But what happened?

428
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,090
If it were really like that,

429
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,220
I wouldn't be sitting here today.

430
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,460
Gemu has everything,

431
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,660
but it's not pure.

432
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,810
The relationships are too complicated.

433
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,730
I joined a new hospital.

434
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,330
Jiao Ai.

435
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,140
Investors from Shenzhen.

436
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,570
Very ambitious.

437
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,420
Ready to make big moves.

438
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,250
They're hiring now.

439
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,380
Jiao Ai really needs

440
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,620
good doctors like us.

441
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,140
I'm flattered.

442
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,380
The investors have heard me talk about you many times.

443
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,140
They really want to meet you.

444
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,460
If you join us,

445
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,810
we'll be treated the same.

446
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,380
We'll be partners.

447
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,620
Qiao Yang.

448
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,770
Once you've decided, come over anytime.

449
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,180
If you want to talk about anything,

450
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,420
salary, benefits,

451
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,010
I'm available 24/7.

452
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,220
Those people in the notes are really important.

453
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,290
Be polite with them.

454
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,810
Let me know when you're done.

455
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,330
Show me the client list you've booked

456
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,140
for next week.

457
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,180
Found someone?

458
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,490
Yeah.

459
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,660
Qiao Yang.

460
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,050
If Dr. Qiao comes here,

461
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,250
that'll be big news.

462
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,140
I've got big news for you too.

463
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,250
Shenzhen capital, Du Jun's new hospital.

464
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,530
Not surprising.

465
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,330
You know who they had dinner with yesterday?

466
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,220
Qiao Yang.

467
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,050
Ms. Zhou.

468
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,090
They used to work together.

469
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,250
Dinner is normal.

470
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,050
Alright, as long as you're confident.

471
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,900
I've already tried to talk Mr. Tang out of it.

472
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,090
The director position is still vacant.

473
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,660
Merging now is too rushed.

474
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,660
The priority right now.

475
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,420
We need to decide on a director first.

476
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,620
Got time?

477
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,980
Come to my office for a quick chat.

478
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,420
No time, got a client.

479
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,770
Ms. Zhou, Ms. Li.

480
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,140
I'll be waiting.

481
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,570
Qiao,

482
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,140
if it's a procedure issue,

483
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,900
we'll find a way to solve it.

484
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,940
We already got the house ready for you,

485
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,860
and PSO is happy to provide you

486
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,330
with anything you need.

487
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,980
You absolutely have nothing to worry about.

488
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,140
So what exactly is your concern?

489
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,140
The paperwork isn't done yet anyway.

490
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,490
Just apologize to the Ms. Li

491
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,290
and pretend this never happened.

492
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,380
Be mad all you want,

493
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,730
but think about your father's health.

494
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,620
If you leave like this,

495
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,730
it'll kill him.

496
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,220
Do you know why Gemu

497
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,570
was able to become

498
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,460
the first private hospital with a Class Four license?

499
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,220
That's because our facilities

500
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,050
are far superior to those of other hospitals.

501
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,530
If you join Gemu,

502
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,220
you'll have plenty of surgeries.

503
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,570
Let's meet and talk.

504
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,380
Qiao Yang.

505
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,090
I'm here. Where are you?

506
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:38,860
Inside.

507
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,140
Great work, everyone.

508
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,570
Hurry up, Ran.

509
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,860
Get some water for our media friends.

510
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,010
You guys are too slow.

511
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,420
Can you be a little faster?

512
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,180
Why do you have time to pick me up today?

513
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,570
Aren't you preparing for the press conference?

514
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,940
Can't I miss you?

515
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,620
Besides, I can't be bothered with the press conference.

516
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,810
If Dong really becomes the director,

517
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,180
your plastic surgery department

518
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,730
will be in for a rough time.

519
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,810
Forget it.

520
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,980
I need to talk to you.

521
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,530
Du Jun's new hospital, Jiao Ai.

522
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,380
Pack up.

523
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,460
Okay.

524
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:30,980
Let's go.

525
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,090
Hurry up.

526
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:32,940
Ms. Li.

527
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,290
Any insider info?

528
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,700
Who's replacing Du Jun as director?

529
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,810
Ever heard of blind boxes?

530
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,330
Gotta be a surprise.

531
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,730
Talk to you later.

532
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,050
Qing, check what's happening.

533
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,330
They're holding a press conference today too?

534
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,010
That's clearly a challenge.

535
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,420
Du Jun is playing dirty.

536
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,330
Those Shenzhen investors

537
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,940
came all this way to poach him.

538
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,570
They're eyeing the Rongchuan market.

539
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,770
He's definitely going to hype this up.

540
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,180
If they get ahead of us,

541
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,330
the story will be

542
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,330
that Du Jun ditched us.

543
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,090
I can already picture it.

544
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,860
At the press conference,

545
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,570
he'll explain why he left Gemu.

546
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,700
Claiming that Gemu

547
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,730
couldn't fulfill his medical ambitions,

548
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,730
that Jiao Ai was the better choice.

549
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,620
Jiao Ai's launch

550
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,940
is stepping right on our heads.

551
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,570
Once they fire the first shot,

552
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,330
they'll establish themselves in the industry.

553
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,940
So we have to outshine them.

554
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,010
Winning is our only option.

555
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,980
Looks like

556
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,700
you've got a plan.

557
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,700
Let's pick them up first.

558
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,940
I haven't slept well for days.

559
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,570
After thinking it over,

560
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,090
I decided not to go to the US.

561
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,250
Really?

562
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,220
That's great!

563
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,090
You should've thought like this sooner.

564
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,810
I didn't even tell you

565
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,530
your father called Ms. Li.

566
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,980
They talked about it.

567
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,380
What are they talking about?

568
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,940
I never said I'd go back to the Third Hospital.

569
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,900
Then why did you ask me to meet here?

570
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,180
My resignation.

571
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,490
Help me handle it.

572
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,570
I don't want to see Ms. Li.

573
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,330
It'd be awkward.

574
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,620
Wait, you...

575
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,290
What?

576
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,220
I have urgent business today.

577
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,980
I'm counting on you.

578
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,090
Think it through first!

579
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,050
I know you mean well.

580
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,770
Thanks.

581
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,940
You're a good doctor.

582
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,810
And a good person.

583
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,570
All the best!

584
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,730
Pick up the tab for me.

585
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,250
Qiao Yang.

586
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,380
Think again.

587
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,530
I feel like something big is happening today.

588
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,250
Feels like a big deal today.

589
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,250
Sorry, excuse me.

590
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,220
Mr. Tang.

591
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,420
Really sorry.

592
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,770
Had a consultation, so I'm late.

593
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,700
Let's start.

594
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,220
Mr. Qin isn't here yet.

595
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,090
Let's wait for him.

596
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,490
Looking good.

597
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,330
Really?

598
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,330
Are they announcing the new director today?

599
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:23,810
Uh…

600
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,420
No such thing.

601
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,460
Don't spread rumors.

602
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,810
Am I out of the loop?

603
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,660
Weren't they talking about

604
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,700
merging departments?

605
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,140
What does that have to do with the director?

606
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,530
Don't guess or ask

607
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,090
about the higher-ups.

608
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,730
Mr. Dong, the director.

609
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,620
Hey, stop.

610
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,620
So you admitted?

611
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,330
Does that mean

612
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,330
you'll be up there soon?

613
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,660
Well…

614
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,330
That's up to the bosses.

615
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,940
No need to speculate

616
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,330
their decisions.

617
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,220
Just sit down.

618
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,770
Alright, alright.

619
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,730
Let's focus on the meeting.

620
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,730
Sorry, everyone.

621
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,090
Kept you waiting.

622
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,810
Let me introduce someone.

623
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,660
This is Dr. Qiao Yang.

624
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,940
She did Jiang Rong's surgery.

625
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,220
-Why is she here? -Qiao Yang.

626
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,490
Yeah, why?

627
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,460
What's she here for?

628
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,250
Joining us.

629
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,050
As you all know,

630
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,490
plastic surgery is all about appearances.

631
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,620
Specifically,

632
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,330
our patients'.

633
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,140
But if we're shaping others' looks,

634
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,900
we should first hold ourselves

635
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,490
to high standards.

636
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,010
To me,

637
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,220
a great cosmetic surgeon is defined

638
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,530
by excellent patient care

639
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,660
and top-notch surgical skills.

640
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,860
That's what truly matters.

641
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,810
Ms. Zhou told me

642
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,810
Gemu offers the best pay,

643
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,660
top facilities,

644
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,900
and hardest surgeries.

645
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,460
So I'm here.

646
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,770
Am I dreaming?

647
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,980
I'm actually colleagues with my idol?

648
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,860
Want me to bite you

649
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,900
to check if it's real?

650
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,730
I'll skip the formalities.

651
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,460
See you in the operating room.

652
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,860
That's it.

653
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,010
This is the waiting area.

654
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,050
Resident doctor's office.

655
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,010
The operating room is on the sixth floor.

656
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,380
The dermatology department is on the third floor.

657
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,940
My office.

658
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,380
It's so big.

659
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,250
Yours is over there, even bigger.

660
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,490
That's good.

661
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,180
Ms. Zhou.

662
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,860
Ms. Qiao.

663
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,050
Do you remember me?

664
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,490
Sorry...

665
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,900
You mentored me during my training.

666
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,770
Oh, it's you.

667
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,570
Your suturing was good.

668
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,010
Wei Xiaoxi.

669
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,140
She's one of

670
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,940
the most promising young doctors in Gemu.

671
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,180
Since you've worked with Ms. Qiao,

672
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,330
just stick with her and do the job.

673
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,330
Thank you, Ms. Zhou. Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

674
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,290
Don't rush to flatter me.

675
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,380
We're not close yet.

676
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,810
Send me the projects you've worked on.

677
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,980
I'll take a look.

678
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,660
You go ahead with the surgery.

679
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,770
I'll show Ms. Qiao around.

680
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,770
Ms. Qiao.

681
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,700
I happened to reread your article

682
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,530
on the correction of traumatic lower eyelid eversion

683
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,010
using the orbicularis oculi flap last night.

684
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,180
It's amazing.

685
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,900
That was written years ago.

686
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,010
Why still read it?

687
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,250
You should check out

688
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,220
Wang Chong's article from last December.

689
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,940
His technique is the latest.

690
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,460
Okay.

691
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,730
This is the consultation office.

692
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,290
Opposite it is Ms. Li's office.

693
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,810
Ms. Li.

694
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,620
Waiting so long for you.

695
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,900
Finally, you're here.

696
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,940
Li Qi,

697
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,490
Our company's vice president.

698
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,860
She's in charge of operations and consultations.

699
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,090
Nice to meet you.

700
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,420
A warm welcome!

701
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,250
I'm just the go-to person.

702
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,660
If you need anything, big or small,

703
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,570
feel free to ask.

704
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,570
Let's get to work.

705
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,770
Start working today?

706
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,460
You should get a makeover.

707
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,700
The studio is all set up.

708
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,460
Let's go.

709
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,570
So formal.

710
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,460
Ms. Meng, Mr. Dong.

711
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,220
Come here.

712
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,250
Let me introduce you.

713
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,940
He's in charge of plastic surgery related to the skin.

714
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,050
She's in charge of fat grafting.

715
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,730
These two are pillars at Gemu.

716
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,460
They're the backbone of our hospital.

717
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,660
We all depend on them.

718
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,730
With you and Ms. Zhou,

719
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,860
the four big names are all here.

720
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,140
We are flattered.

721
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,140
Ms. Li is a true speaker.

722
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,220
If he doesn't become a storyteller,

723
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,770
it'll be a waste of her talent.

724
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,330
I'm Meng Chunhui.

725
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,290
Qiao Yang.

726
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,220
I've heard so much about you.

727
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,940
We've seen your surgeries.

728
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:50,980
Impressive!

729
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,810
Nice to meet you!

730
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,050
Dermatology department, Dong Jinsong.

731
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,380
I apologize,

732
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,490
I still have clients upstairs.

733
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,090
Another time.

734
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,330
I'll talk to you another day.

735
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,290
The west room is mine.

736
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,330
Drop by if you're free, we can chat.

737
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,860
And have some academic exchange.

738
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,380
Ms. Li.

739
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,860
Wang Qian, come here.

740
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,010
Let me introduce.

741
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,620
Wang Qian will be your assistant.

742
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,700
You can boss him around.

743
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,010
Hello, Ms. Qiao.

744
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,660
I've set up your social media accounts.

745
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,700
I'll be recording some videos

746
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,330
of your work.

747
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,050
Let's see.

748
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,010
This is too much.

749
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,700
A top-tier cosmetic surgeon?

750
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,490
Highlighting your industry status.

751
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,180
A master of facial aesthetics?

752
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,860
Focusing on aesthetic principles.

753
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,620
Our field still has a high threshold

754
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,010
for regular clients.

755
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,730
They might not fully understand the technical terms.

756
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,620
This is a simple and straightforward promo page.

757
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,290
If you don't like it,

758
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,380
we can change it.

759
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,330
Looks good.

760
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,530
We've created a few designs.

761
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,490
You can take a look.

762
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,570
This one works.

763
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,700
I like it.

764
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,140
Pretty impressive.

765
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,700
Pretty ambitious.

766
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,140
Let's do another one.

767
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,330
Side shot, please.

768
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,220
Good, that's it.

769
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,460
These heels…

770
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,460
They're really torture for women.

771
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,460
-Looks good. -Be careful with the needle.

772
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,530
Thank you.

773
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,900
Looks fantastic!

774
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,490
Mm, not bad.

775
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,380
Send me a copy to my email later.

776
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,770
Sure.

777
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,490
Really?

778
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,530
I was worried you might not like this,

779
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,810
since you're so focused on your work.

780
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,090
How could I not?

781
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,700
If you don't love looking good,

782
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,250
how can you be a great cosmetic doctor?

783
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,290
Alright, looks good.

784
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,980
When I was at the Third Hospital,

785
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,140
I've only taken ID photos.

786
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,050
This is my first time taking such stylish photos.

787
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,810
The Third Hospital is different from ours.

788
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,290
Back then, you had to deal with all kinds of clients.

789
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,180
Here,

790
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,570
we have a consulting team to handle things for you in advance.

791
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,180
You don't need to worry about anything else.

792
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,570
Just focus on your surgeries.

793
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,010
Everything's arranged.

794
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:04,980
Ms. Qiao.

795
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,090
No need, thanks for your trouble.

796
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,940
You might not know me well yet.

797
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,980
I have my own way of doing things.

798
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,730
Of course.

799
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,420
But maybe…

800
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,530
I understand you

801
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,700
better than you think.

802
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,180
We got more outfits?

803
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,010
Seven more.

804
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,730
Let's do it.

805
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,530
Why add so much lower eyelid adjustment

806
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,420
for double eyelid surgery?

807
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,730
It's trending now.

808
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,900
A lot of clients want it.

809
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,330
Look,

810
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,620
these events are all about it.

811
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,010
Do you perform this surgery often?

812
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,980
I did hundreds of them

813
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,570
with Mr. Du.

814
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,900
A few hundred?

815
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,090
So if you have too many surgeries later,

816
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,420
just leave it to me.

817
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:46,810
Alright.

818
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,180
Then let's call them all over.

819
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,010
When?

820
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,620
Today, 2 PM.

821
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,380
All of them?

822
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,090
Yeah, find a big meeting room.

823
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,290
What a coincidence, an old friend.

824
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,700
Give me a hand.

825
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,730
What?

826
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,490
Print it.

827
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,490
How many copies?

828
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,620
Twenty-six.

829
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,050
First day and so many cases? So exciting.

830
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,180
This is exciting?

831
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,250
I'll have to show you more exciting stuff later.

832
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,980
I mean, we were pretty good.

833
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,250
Why do you want to work with me now?

834
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,180
I'm your boss.

835
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,810
We have a clear superior-subordinate relationship, Lu.

836
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,140
If I call you boss,

837
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,220
can you give me a raise?

838
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,290
Depends on your performance.

839
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,090
So, you're thinking about playing by the unwritten rules?

840
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,460
Work performance.

841
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,250
No, I mean,

842
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,380
why are you so boring?

843
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,250
I can't stand people who

844
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,010
mix work and life together.

845
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,290
I didn't say I want to mix them.

846
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,730
After work, I'll call you.

847
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,010
Don't block me.

848
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,140
So many hospitals,

849
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,700
why did you come to Gemu?

850
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,460
You came for me?

851
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,490
Stop being so full of yourself.

852
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,700
Good afternoon, everyone.

853
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,330
I'm Dr. Qiao Yang.

854
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,570
I'll be in charge of

855
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,620
your lower eyelid surgery.

856
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,220
As you can see,

857
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,730
these are your eyes.

858
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,490
Of course,

859
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,420
these are before the surgery fails.

860
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,530
What do you mean?

861
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,300
Isn't the surgery outcome

862
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,170
all about the doctor's expertise?

863
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,050
Besides, we've already discussed it with the consultation team.

864
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,570
It's just eyelid surgery,

865
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,570
a minor procedure.

866
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,170
You're right.

867
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,980
I called you all here today

868
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,460
to open your eyes a bit.

869
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,340
See this?

870
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,900
These eyes are thoroughly done.

871
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,570
Everyone paid with their eyes closed,

872
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,820
and left with their eyes wide open.

873
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,490
I bet you guys have already learned about

874
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,420
the lower eyelid surgery at other hospitals.

875
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,210
It involves lowering the outer corners

876
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,690
of your eyes to create a softer,

877
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,530
more innocent look.

878
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,260
It gives you those puppy eyes.

879
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,300
But here's a fact I need to share with you.

880
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,980
Apart from pathological reasons,

881
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,090
only when the angle

882
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,010
between the outer and inner corners

883
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,090
of your eyes exceeds 15 degrees,

884
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,300
what we call "droopy eyes,"

885
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,490
is this surgery really effective.

886
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,740
Otherwise, the results may not be obvious.

887
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,940
There could even be issues like

888
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,130
lower eyelid retraction

889
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,170
or incomplete eyelid closure.

890
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,650
Other side effects include

891
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,780
conjunctival eversion.

892
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:16,900
Okay, Wei Xiaoxi,

893
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,650
Wang Qian.

894
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,170
The material I'm handing out now

895
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,130
has a more detailed introduction

896
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,900
to this surgery.

897
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,420
If you don't understand,

898
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,980
feel free to ask our doctors.

899
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,170
This info is free,

900
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,460
so make sure to appreciate it.

901
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,530
You should appreciate our time first.

902
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,420
We're all busy,

903
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,420
yet you're having us listen to all this nonsense.

904
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,900
What you can do is on you,

905
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,300
what you can't do is also on you.

906
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,610
What do you think we are?

907
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,820
A joke?

908
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,380
Yeah.

909
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,090
Really.

910
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,780
I can do risky surgeries,

911
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,570
but are you sure you want to take the risk?

912
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,820
Ms. Li, you see this?

913
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,340
Ms. Li,

914
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,980
so we're really staying out of this?

915
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,340
If she talks like that,

916
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,210
how are we supposed to do our jobs?

917
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,260
How?

918
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,530
Keep improving our skills

919
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,050
and keep up the pace.

920
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,820
Keep up the pace?

921
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,420
The core of a hospital is always the doctors.

922
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,380
Just like the core of a sports car is the engine.

923
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,570
And we're just the wheels.

924
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,050
How it runs depends on the engine.

925
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,490
Now the good doctor is here.

926
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,210
And the engine's been upgraded.

927
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,900
That means the old way doesn't work anymore.

928
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,900
Did you hear what Ms. Qiao just said?

929
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,650
But we also referred clients to Ms. Zhou

930
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,490
for unsuitable procedures.

931
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,490
Why can she talk so gently

932
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,940
with her clients?

933
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:42,940
What's with her?

934
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,130
How could she behave like that?

935
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,530
She didn't even say a word.

936
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,780
And dismissed all our work.

937
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,860
I don't get it.

938
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,300
Ms. Qiao has her standard.

939
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,980
We should keep up with her.

940
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,130
Besides,

941
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,650
you think you're the only one who's confused?

942
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,380
But we should stick to Ms. Qiao's standard.

943
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,380
If anyone asks for me,

944
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,650
tell them I'm out.

945
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,650
Keep an eye on things.

946
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,570
Ms. Zhou.

947
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,650
They say getting a nose job makes your face darker.

948
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,530
Is that true?

949
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,900
I swear, my face looks darker already.

950
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,820
A little, yeah.

951
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,490
Don't worry.

952
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,530
How long has it been since you washed your face?

953
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,900
When you go home, take care of your skin.

954
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,340
You'll be back to normal soon.

955
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,260
Hold still.

956
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,460
Does this hurt?

957
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:27,650
A little.

958
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,530
A little, huh?

959
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,130
You'll be fine.

960
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,130
Ms. Zhou.

961
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,940
It's urgent.

962
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,050
Go ahead.

963
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,490
Sorry.

964
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,300
We need a refund.

965
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:39,820
Sorry,

966
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,130
our process doesn't work like this.

967
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,130
Ms. Qiao just started working here, still getting familiar.

968
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,010
Isn't she your new head doctor?

969
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,980
What she says doesn't count?

970
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,420
No, you misunderstood,

971
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,530
our process is...

972
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,380
I'm here.

973
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,380
Sorry, Ms. Zhou.

974
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,530
You're a doctor, she's also a doctor.

975
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:53,900
Yeah.

976
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,860
But you're saying different things.

977
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,050
Who should we listen to?

978
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,980
Exactly.

979
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,980
Don't worry.

980
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,940
Let's sit down first.

981
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,050
Mingjie, help them get settled.

982
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,130
I'll explain everything.

983
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,130
Ms. Zhou will clear things up.

984
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,260
Don't worry.

985
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,010
Ning.

986
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,300
So here's the thing.

987
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,940
The lower eyelid lift

988
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,300
is a very trendy procedure.

989
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,300
But after extensive research,

990
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,530
Ms. Qiao believes that this isn't the best solution

991
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,340
for improving the eye's aesthetic.

992
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,860
It carries certain risks.

993
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,460
Although I don't share her view,

994
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,820
but that's normal.

995
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,900
Same case,

996
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,650
different doctors, different opinions.

997
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,010
That's why we need multiple experts for consultations.

998
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,300
It's the safest way.

999
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,820
Stop talking in circles.

1000
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,940
What's the actual plan for us?

1001
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,900
What should be done and what shouldn't?

1002
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:34,820
Who do we listen to?

1003
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,010
Here's the plan

1004
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,090
Dr. Chen

1005
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,420
will rework a comprehensive plan

1006
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,420
for your eye aesthetic improvement.

1007
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,340
And for each plan,

1008
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,130
I'll discuss thoroughly with Ms. Qiao.

1009
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,460
Do you think this counts as double protection?

1010
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,050
Double protection?

1011
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,300
They don't agree with each other.

1012
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,460
Isn't that double the risk?

1013
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,980
If you're not satisfied with

1014
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,900
the double protection plan,

1015
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,340
you can ask for a refund.

1016
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,860
If you want to change the plan,

1017
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,940
we'll offer a 30% discount.

1018
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,010
30% off?

1019
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,260
30% off works.

1020
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,260
Alright, Mingjie.

1021
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,460
Take everyone to the lounge to relax.

1022
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,010
There's tea, snacks, and small gifts inside.

1023
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,130
Take your time to discuss,

1024
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,130
no need to rush the decision.

1025
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,980
Is that okay?

1026
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,780
Come on in.

1027
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,650
This way.

1028
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,090
Let's discuss inside.

1029
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,130
Let's sit down for a bit.

1030
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,130
Right, take a seat.

1031
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,460
Think it over, no rush.

1032
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,170
If you have any questions,

1033
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,650
I'll answer them, okay?

1034
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,380
Ning.

1035
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,010
Don't try to talk me out of it.

1036
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,940
I'm waiting for Mr. Li. Where is she?

1037
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,530
Why are you looking for her?

1038
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,010
She'll still have to get a solution from me.

1039
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,570
Are you trying to brush me off with a 30% discount?

1040
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,260
No way!

1041
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,130
You're our VIP.

1042
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,780
Come to my room.

1043
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,420
Come,

1044
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,570
I'll work out a plan for you.

1045
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,900
I'll personally help you review it

1046
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,570
Is that okay?

1047
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,650
Let me reiterate.

1048
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,820
I respect your medical views.

1049
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,650
If you feel a patient

1050
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,940
isn't suitable,

1051
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,300
and you want to mention the risks,

1052
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,380
that's fine.

1053
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,530
But why

1054
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,300
express it like this?

1055
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,650
This is how I express myself.

1056
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,130
Lower eyelid surgery

1057
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,780
sacrifices function for shape.

1058
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,090
It's a destructive procedure.

1059
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,900
Most people don't need it.

1060
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,050
If there's demand,

1061
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,570
then it exists.

1062
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,650
Every surgery has risks.

1063
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,530
Ms. Zhou,

1064
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,010
plastic surgery is a serious discipline.

1065
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,820
It's not just about beauty seekers.

1066
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,420
Yes.

1067
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,650
Plastic surgery is serious.

1068
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,420
But I remind you, Ms. Qiao,

1069
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,460
it's also a healthcare service.

1070
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,130
The goal is to meet

1071
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,980
the aesthetic needs of the client,

1072
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,900
as long as they have the demand.

1073
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,130
Is the need

1074
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,980
spontaneous or induced?

1075
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,940
Here,

1076
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,340
it's never about wanting or not wanting,

1077
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,820
but whether it's the right thing to do.

1078
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,460
What about ancient beauties?

1079
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,460
Xi Shi or Diao Chan, for example.

1080
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,130
Would they think

1081
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,260
they needed eyelid surgery?

1082
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,460
Only modern people would.

1083
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,570
One, marketing.

1084
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,650
Two, promotion.

1085
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,820
It's these two things

1086
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,900
that created the “aesthetic need.”

1087
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,530
Isn't that right?

1088
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,130
What's wrong with creating aesthetic needs?

1089
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,260
Back in Xi Shi's day,

1090
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,010
she would want a Mercedes?

1091
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,090
Then we couldn't invent cars?

1092
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,650
Times are changing.

1093
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,570
Technology is for creating needs

1094
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,780
and meeting needs.

1095
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,860
Creating needs?

1096
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,340
There's a high risk of failure with this procedure.

1097
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,300
Gemu never had

1098
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,570
these kinds of failures.

1099
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,010
Of course, no failures.

1100
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,490
But shouldn't it be like that?

1101
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,940
Lower eyelid surgery was invented

1102
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,650
by Mr. Hiroshi Kobayashi

1103
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,380
from Japan in 2004.

1104
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,690
It's been 20 years.

1105
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,900
In the past twenty years,

1106
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:24,940
based on experience,

1107
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,260
it should've been phased out already.

1108
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,260
Even by today's aesthetic standards,

1109
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,460
it's outdated.

1110
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,130
It still exists because

1111
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,570
your private hospitals,

1112
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,340
for the sake of selling services and profits,

1113
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,610
are promoting a mistake as a good thing.

1114
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,650
Without private hospitals like ours leading the way,

1115
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,300
testing new projects and technologies,

1116
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,420
do you think this industry would innovate so quickly?

1117
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,380
I'm not denying that.

1118
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,530
But the cost is the long-term complications for patients.

1119
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,130
You can't deny that, right?

1120
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,300
First day and it's already like this.

1121
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,650
Pretty funny, actually.

1122
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,260
We need some time to adjust.

1123
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,460
I'll try my best to adjust.

1124
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,980
But don't forget what you promised me.

1125
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,090
Do you know why

1126
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,380
I keep coming to you?

1127
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,300
You're the best doctor.

1128
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,650
To run Gemu well,

1129
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,460
I'll pay any price.

1130
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,490
I'll find the right people,

1131
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,490
do the right things.

1132
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,900
I want to change the public's view on cosmetic surgery.

1133
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,490
I want to change it.

1134
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,380
I want to provide the best service for our clients.

1135
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:28,650
Surgery.

1136
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:31,940
Does your hospital

1137
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,610
have any challenging surgeries I can take on?

1138
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,940
That's all I care about.

1139
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,650
Do you know why Gemu

1140
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,940
was able to become

1141
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,900
the first private hospital with a Class Four license?

1142
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,900
That's because our facilities

1143
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,650
are far superior to those of other hospitals.

1144
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,090
You saw Jiang Rong's surgery.

1145
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,130
The only problem is the lack of skilled doctors.

1146
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:51,900
Think about it.

1147
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,130
If you join Gemu,

1148
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,130
you'll have plenty of surgeries.

1149
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,130
I'll personally consult with the patients.

1150
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,780
I'll decide if I'll take them.

1151
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,380
I'll decide

1152
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,460
the surgical plan.
