1
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,050
Tong,

2
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,690
hurry up, the car will be here soon.

3
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,380
Are you ready, Tong?

4
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,820
Tong!

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,540
What's wrong, Tong?

6
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,980
Sis, I'm cold.

7
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,540
You're burning again.

8
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,820
I've already turned it up to the max, but it's not helping.

9
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,820
Mr. Xia has booked a hotel for us.

10
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,100
The conditions there are better.

11
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,450
Once we get there, everything will be fine.

12
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,980
Back in 2008, I knew

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,380
we'd make it sooner or later.

14
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,890
We've gone around in circles,

15
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,100
but we're still together.

16
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,850
Today, when Yan Dan told me,

17
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,260
I thought to myself,

18
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,610
could it be you?

19
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,380
And sure enough, it is.

20
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,980
See, we're so fated!

21
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,380
I only believed in fate

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,890
when I was a kid.

23
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,130
Now that I'm older, I've grown out of that.

24
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,690
The medical aesthetics world is small, after all.

25
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,850
What goes around comes around, it's inevitable.

26
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,570
Are you still mad?

27
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,570
I left Gemu

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,100
because Tang hurt my feelings,

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,130
not because of you.

30
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,780
I don't think

31
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,290
there's any personal grudge between us.

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,500
I completely agree.

33
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,500
Since you're lacking

34
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,220
a bit of medical knowledge,

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,130
let me remind you.

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,610
Yan Tong's condition is pretty serious, you know?

37
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,730
Are you serious?

38
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,220
I even had Mr. Du take a look,

39
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,220
and he treated it.

40
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,260
He said it'll take about a week to recover.

41
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,660
It's not as bad as you're making it sound.

42
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,340
Du Jun hasn't checked back in, huh?

43
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,170
Don't tell me about it.

44
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,450
This weekend,

45
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,290
during surgery, his heart started acting up,

46
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,170
and he fell.

47
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,260
He's still in the hospital now.Alright,

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,410
let's not talk about him.

49
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,570
What about you?

50
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,890
Are you really here

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,380
for those two kids?

52
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,170
This doesn't seem like you.

53
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,730
Are you here for Gemu?

54
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,610
Alright.

55
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,100
Since you've noticed the two kids,

56
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,570
it's their lucky day.

57
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,980
Let me thank you for them.

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,410
Starting today,

59
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,170
I'm officially handing them over to you.

60
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,660
If their condition is as serious as you say,

61
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,380
as a doctor, you can't just stand by and do nothing, right?

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,060
What's with Gemu and Jiao Ai?

63
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,980
There shouldn't be any barriers, right?

64
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,050
In the end, we're all here for the patients.

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,580
Li Qi,

66
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,170
I've known you for a long time.

67
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,730
But seriously, you've got to stop talking

68
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,050
in riddles like that.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,780
Your aesthetics training center's

70
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,250
been open for a while now.

71
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,460
And honestly, I don't believe Yan Dan and Yan Tong

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,810
are your only victims.

73
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,050
It's only a matter of time before the whole thing blows up in your face.

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,780
You think I came here today

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,460
to make a deal with you?

76
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,660
That look on your face,

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,410
same as back then.

78
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,140
Once you step out that door,

79
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,730
we're strangers.

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,140
I'll take this loss as a lesson learned.

81
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,930
I'll admit I lost.

82
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,580
But I'm not giving up.

83
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,410
We'll see how things play out.

84
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,220
Fine.

85
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,730
You don't wanna go to the police?

86
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,700
I will.

87
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,900
Zhou Jingwen!

88
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,780
If you wanna go down with me, that's fine.

89
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,170
I've got nothing to lose.

90
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,100
Unlike you.

91
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,290
You fought tooth and nail for seven or eight years to become a doctor.

92
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,540
If this scandal gets out,

93
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,170
all of that's gone, just like that.

94
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,460
What else can you even do

95
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,850
if you're not a doctor?

96
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,170
100K isn't much.

97
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,980
But it's enough to start fresh somewhere else.

98
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,850
Think about it.

99
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,250
You're doing pretty well for yourself now.

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,980
Looking at where you are today, I honestly feel

101
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,250
that 100 grand I gave you back then

102
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,340
is the best investment I ever made in my life.

103
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,340
Since that's your attitude,

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,900
you don't need to worry about

105
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,100
Yan Dan and Yan Tong anymore.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,780
What's done is done.

107
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,730
I accept the consequences.

108
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,930
But the fact that you're acting like you're untouchable,

109
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,540
talking to those girls like that,

110
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,340
because from the begining,

111
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,540
you're under a fake identity.

112
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,660
Even if they wanted to report you, they couldn't.

113
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,930
Because no one can trace anything back to a "Xia Ling,"

114
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,610
right?

115
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,490
Well, I have the call recordings between you and Yan Dan.

116
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,140
Alright then.

117
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,370
One more thing.

118
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,980
I want your opinion on something.

119
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,810
If Jiao Ai and Gemu merged,

120
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,020
what should the new name be?

121
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,900
Jiaoge? Jiaomu?

122
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,850
Or maybe Aige, Aimu?

123
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,610
You didn't know?

124
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,100
Just this morning,

125
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,340
Tang already confirmed the acquisition intent.

126
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,140
You

127
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,340
really shouldn't keep dwelling on

128
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,020
that little unpleasantness between us back in the day.

129
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,340
The equity transfer

130
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,810
is happening in the next couple of days anyway.

131
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,580
So think about it, what really

132
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,780
matters most right now?

133
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,370
Damn, I'm too late.

134
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,980
Hello?

135
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,730
Why weren't you answering my calls?

136
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,490
Did you see the messages I sent?

137
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,660
It's Li Qi. She's the one behind Yan Dan, Yan Tong,

138
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,220
and that training scam.

139
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,530
I know.

140
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,130
I just saw her.

141
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,460
She told me to stay out of it,

142
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,700
not to get involved with those two girls.

143
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,850
Wait, what?

144
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,250
And what did you say?

145
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,250
Say something!

146
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,730
You do realize Li Qi already moved Yan Dan and Yan Tong

147
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,340
somewhere else, right?

148
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,060
Look, I don't have the energy to explain everything right now.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,940
What's that supposed to mean?

150
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,420
Wait,

151
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,370
is this whole thing really that complicated?

152
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,700
Don't tell me you actually agreed to her terms.

153
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,490
All for Gemu?

154
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,940
We'll talk about this later.

155
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,850
You know what? Playing on a real court

156
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,340
is actually kinda fun.

157
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,010
Totally different from practicing at home.

158
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,130
Look at that day.

159
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,610
It was so good.

160
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,490
Where's Tang? Why isn't he here yet?

161
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,700
He said his dad just woke up this morning.

162
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,610
He's trying to make it over as soon as he can.

163
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,610
I'll call him, he has to come.

164
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,220
What's going on?

165
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,980
Come, this way, please.

166
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:52,890
Ms. Shi.

167
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,820
Ms. Shi.

168
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,130
Mr. Qin.

169
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,220
Welcome.

170
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,530
Remember her?

171
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,130
Same year as Qiao Yang.

172
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,730
Also one of Gemu's founders.

173
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,820
Zhou Jingwen.

174
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,370
Of course

175
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,250
I remember!

176
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,220
Hi, Shi Jin.

177
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,820
You were a legend at our school.

178
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,730
Still stunning as ever.

179
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,770
This must be Mr. Dong, right?

180
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,580
You're a huge name in my WeChat feed.

181
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,010
A few of my friends

182
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,650
are your regular clients.

183
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,300
You've made them

184
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,010
all age-defying beauties.

185
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,980
They even gave me a nickname,

186
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,370
"The Ladies' Friend."

187
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,010
Feel free to drop by any time!

188
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,100
Mr. Chu, Ms. Shi, shall we take our seats?

189
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,010
Please.

190
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,130
Come, Mr. Chu.

191
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,130
Let me offer you a toast.

192
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,890
For the past half year, I haven't had time for anything else,

193
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,460
just been dealing with hospital stuff.

194
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,940
You helped me resolve a huge burden.

195
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,420
I'll drink this whole glass.

196
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,300
Times have changed.

197
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,770
Now it's these young folks

198
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,770
who are dragging an old man like me along.

199
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,770
I often see your interviews, news features,

200
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,700
pop up on my phone.

201
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,460
It makes me so proud.

202
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,770
Every time I see one, I share it.

203
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,460
Every time I see one, it goes on my Moments.

204
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,460
Having such an outstanding student,

205
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,420
as a teacher,

206
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,220
how can I not show off a little?

207
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,770
That's just your information bubble talking.

208
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,730
You keep getting my updates

209
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,610
not because I'm so great,

210
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,770
but because you follow me,

211
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,530
so the algorithm keeps pushing my stuff to you.

212
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,010
Well, I have to follow you. Definitely!

213
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,850
Sir,

214
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,820
to be honest,

215
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,530
ever since I decided to invest in the hospital sector,

216
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,130
we've looked at, what, nearly a hundred hospitals?

217
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,890
More than that, actually.

218
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,580
Right?

219
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,940
These organizations,

220
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,610
on the surface,

221
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,010
they all look like fireworks and roses.

222
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,580
Beautiful numbers, flashy data.

223
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,010
But behind the scenes,

224
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,890
the lack of proper management is beyond imagination.

225
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,490
There was this one hospital we checked out in South China.

226
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:50,890
Right?

227
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,530
Yes.

228
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,610
Our talks were going well,

229
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,890
but when we reviewed the documentation,

230
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,420
we found a medical dispute on record.

231
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,060
They operated on a patient

232
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,820
without getting consent from the family.

233
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,850
So what happened?

234
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,700
The family just wouldn't let it go.

235
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,940
Didn't matter how successful the surgery was.

236
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,650
There was no peace after that.

237
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,580
What does that tell you?

238
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,010
Lack of standardized procedures.

239
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,010
Exactly.

240
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,220
Right?

241
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,100
Yeah.

242
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,610
That's right.

243
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,730
Did you end up signing with that hospital?

244
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,490
We did.

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,420
If I had signed back then, we wouldn't even be having this meeting now.

246
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,940
Exactly.

247
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,460
A single overlooked dispute

248
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,580
can be a symptom

249
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,340
of countless lapses in standard procedures.

250
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,980
Although performance is important,

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,420
what I value more is the philosophy behind the operation.

252
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,820
Yes.

253
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,580
If our values and mindset don't align,

254
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,490
then even if we're friends,

255
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,060
we shouldn't move forward together, am I right?

256
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,730
Absolutely.

257
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,650
I completely agree with your philosophy.

258
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,060
Standardized medical practice must come first.

259
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,340
Ensuring patients' safety,

260
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,370
and constantly improving the quality of our service

261
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,530
has always been Gemu's goal.

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,420
And now with Mr. Chu backing us,

263
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,340
you can truly rest easy.

264
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,250
Since you put it that way,

265
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,820
I'd better do a thorough evaluation of Gemu.

266
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,060
No problem at all.

267
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,010
You're welcome anytime!

268
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,100
Absolutely, you're always welcome!

269
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,340
Come on, everyone,

270
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,130
come.

271
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,850
Apologies,

272
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,370
everyone, sorry I'm late.

273
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,100
Sorry.

274
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,490
Mr. Tang, what took you so long? Let me introduce you.

275
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,650
This is Mr. Tang, our investor at Gemu.

276
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,010
Shi Jin.

277
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,650
Hello everyone!

278
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,940
Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Shi.

279
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,060
Take a seat.

280
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,940
Jingwen,

281
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,650
that location you sent me wasn't accurate.

282
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,130
Really? Sorry about that.

283
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,580
Ms. Shi, Gemu

284
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,700
was built from the ground up by me and Qin.

285
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,180
Seeing you here today,

286
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,220
I'm genuinely thrilled.

287
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,060
Since I'm late, let me offer you a toast first.

288
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,060
Pleasure to meet you!

289
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,490
Good.

290
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,580
I've already been briefed

291
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,220
on all the relationships here. Mr. Qin explained it to me.

292
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,850
Your father and I

293
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,250
have crossed paths several times at the Entrepreneurs' Association.

294
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,820
They brought me in to take over your position, didn't they?

295
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,460
Wow, you've moved this conversation along quickly.

296
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,820
Already talking about succession?

297
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,650
Since you're Jingwen's senior disciple,

298
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,220
I won't treat you as an outsider.

299
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,340
To be honest, I don't want to pull out.

300
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,370
After all, Qin and Jingwen

301
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,340
poured their hearts

302
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,130
into building Gemu to what it is today.

303
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,530
It's thriving, both in momentum and performance.

304
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,220
But ultimately, it's because of me.

305
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,460
Let's not get into personal matters at the dinner table.

306
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,340
If it weren't for the fact that

307
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,580
I've nearly finalized things with Jiao Ai,

308
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,370
just based on how well we hit it off,

309
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:29,980
I...

310
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,730
Mr. Tang,

311
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,850
since you hit it off so well,

312
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,490
why not have a good talk with Ms. Shi?

313
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,610
Work out a proposal together.

314
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,460
Ms. Shi, if you genuinely

315
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,850
have the intention to take over,

316
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,940
then I'd be happy about that.

317
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,370
It's just that right now, time is really...

318
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,610
We've got plenty of time.

319
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,610
Look, Ms. Shi even came all the way to Rongchuan.

320
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,530
Right, Ms. Shi?

321
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,580
Sir,

322
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,220
here, let me toast you again.

323
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,010
Mr. Qin,

324
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,850
you need to arrange our site visit as soon as possible.

325
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,820
Let's discuss everything else

326
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,890
after the inspection, alright?

327
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,130
No problem, leave it to me.

328
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,850
Here, sir, let me toast you again.

329
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,980
Come.

330
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,610
Come.

331
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:04,980
Cheers.

332
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,100
Mr. Tang didn't drink too much tonight, did he?

333
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,730
No, he can definitely hold his liquor.

334
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,220
Still, this could get tricky.

335
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,060
This student of mine,

336
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,010
once she makes up her mind, no one can change it.

337
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,850
Jingwen, do you still remember what I told you last time,

338
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,610
before you left,

339
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,890
another of my student left the school?

340
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,340
You remember that, right?

341
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,180
Yes.

342
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,370
That was Shi Jin.

343
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,420
She was once one of the institute's key protégés.

344
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,130
But when she left, she didn't even look back.

345
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,420
In my whole life,

346
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,130
the people I've had the hardest time handling are a few of my female students.

347
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,460
What can I do?

348
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,100
Tang,

349
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,180
Ms. Shi's offer

350
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,180
is much better than Li Qi's.

351
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,890
I hope you'll seriously consider it,

352
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,580
okay?

353
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,340
The problem is, I don't have time, Qin.

354
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,610
Just now at dinner,

355
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,100
if she had said even one straightforward word,

356
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,700
I wouldn't even need to consider.

357
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,100
Of course you wouldn't.

358
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,530
He and Li Qi already reached an agreement.

359
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,220
They're handling the equity transfer in a few days.

360
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,100
How do you know all this?

361
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,250
Who told you?

362
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,370
If I didn't bring it up, when were you planning to?

363
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,730
Mr. Tang, the way you're handling this

364
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,250
is not exactly honorable, is it?

365
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,180
Tang,

366
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,460
give me two more days,

367
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,980
okay? Just two.

368
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,650
I'll definitely get Shi Jin on board.

369
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,250
Please.

370
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,530
This is Gemu's last chance.

371
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,060
Thanks to everyone's tireless efforts,

372
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,820
Ms. Shi's investment team will be arriving for inspection tomorrow.

373
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,580
I don't need to explain

374
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,650
how important this is to us.

375
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,820
I just hope everyone takes it seriously.

376
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,220
Over the next two days, the operations and medical teams,

377
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,460
I know it'll be hard work,

378
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,940
but we're in the final stretch.

379
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,090
I hope everyone pulls themselves together.

380
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,090
Once we get through this,

381
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,050
the institute will make sure everyone is rewarded.

382
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,860
Alright?

383
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,940
Ms. Meng, please hurry up a bit.

384
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,980
How much faster can I go?

385
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,460
This is already as fast as I can go.

386
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,250
Dr. Jiang, are the case files ready?

387
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,490
I'll be right there.

388
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,490
Goodbye, Ms. Meng.

389
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,140
Let me double-check everything.

390
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,050
Also, the medical equipment,

391
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,460
make sure the usage records of supplies are updated.

392
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,250
Do a full inventory check before the end of the day.

393
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,620
Take out all the equipment and instruments from Bojin,

394
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,530
display them in the most visible area.

395
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,250
I'm just going to be blunt,

396
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,140
right now is a life-or-death moment for Gemu.

397
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,900
Before any treatment or surgery,

398
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,290
everyone should mentally run through the process.

399
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,010
Think about whether anything is missing,

400
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,980
and whether everything meets the standards and regulations.

401
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,530
Here's the surgery flowchart.

402
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,050
This is for the admission and pre-op basic check.

403
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,770
Patient must personally sign the informed consent.

404
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,250
These are the precautions. Please have a look.

405
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,380
No need.

406
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,010
Just arrange a face-to-face consultation for me.

407
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,330
You should still take a look.

408
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,050
We can't afford any mistakes.

409
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,730
The key is to nail the details.

410
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,660
On the surface, everything might seem fine.

411
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,940
Why are you rushing off? Got a date or something?

412
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,730
Are you gonna see Yan Dan and Yan Tong?

413
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,050
I'll go with you.

414
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,620
No need.

415
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,290
I've got important intel.

416
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,570
Really?

417
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,290
Really!

418
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,530
Boss,

419
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,090
Bojin has always done pharmaceuticals and medical devices.

420
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,490
This is their first time investing in a hospital.

421
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,530
Are they reliable?

422
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,810
Ms. Tang has already signed with Li Qi.

423
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,220
If Shi Jin can't be persuaded,

424
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,490
Gemu will have to shut down.

425
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,730
Alright, I'll go update the medical records.

426
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,900
Li Qi's training program,

427
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,530
all of the partner institutions are beauty salons.

428
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,380
This is the only one that's a real clinic.

429
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,140
The abscesses on Yan Dan and Yan Tong are shocking.

430
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,090
Any hospital would be alarmed if they saw them.

431
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,860
So they'll probably only deal with it here.

432
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,460
It should be just up ahead.

433
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,290
Didn't you say you had intel for me?

434
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,380
What intel?

435
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,490
Come on, what age do you think this is?

436
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,010
No intel.

437
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,900
Go, go have fun on your own.

438
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,980
Stop following me.

439
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,860
You're so annoying.

440
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,900
As your boyfriend,

441
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,660
I'm worried it's not safe for you to go alone.

442
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,220
I'm doing this for you.

443
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,420
What is it?

444
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,380
Yan Dan.

445
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,810
That one?

446
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,700
Are you sure?

447
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,050
Quick.

448
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,860
Yan Dan!

449
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,250
Who are you?

450
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,530
We're doctors from Gemu Hospital.

451
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,250
My name is Qiao Yang.

452
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,140
I'm Lu Ziyou.

453
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,530
Last time, when you fainted,

454
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,420
it was me and another doctor

455
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,490
who took you to the hospital.

456
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,290
Do you remember?

457
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,220
With your condition, if you don't go to the hospital,

458
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,090
you could die.

459
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,860
Do you understand?

460
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,490
Are you guys done yet?

461
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,530
I already made it clear to your people the other day.

462
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,860
This is our personal business.

463
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,180
It has nothing to do with you.

464
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,620
My sister's fever has already gone down.

465
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,810
And the clinic staff check on her every day.

466
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,570
Listen to me. In your condition,

467
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,860
you need to receive treatment at a proper hospital.

468
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,290
Otherwise, it's extremely dangerous.

469
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,180
I don't even know you.

470
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,220
Why should I trust you?

471
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,290
You can trust me.

472
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,420
Come any closer and I'll call the police.

473
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,770
I'll leave my number at the front desk.

474
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,940
If you need anything, just call me, okay?

475
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,700
I don't need it.

476
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,180
You will.

477
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,380
She's really stubborn.

478
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,660
Sis, who was that?

479
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,460
Tong.

480
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,050
Tong.

481
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,050
Tong, your wounds are healed!

482
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,420
That's great, Tong.

483
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,770
Sis...

484
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,620
Tong.

485
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,090
What's wrong, Tong?

486
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,460
I'm cold...

487
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,620
You're burning up.

488
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,810
Is anyone there?

489
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,490
Hello?

490
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,940
Anyone?

491
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,290
Doctor.

492
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,940
What happened here?

493
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,620
I... I can't handle this.

494
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,770
She needs to be taken to a big hospital.

495
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,810
Please, Doctor.

496
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,770
Please save her.

497
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,290
I'm begging you.

498
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,290
It's not that I don't want to help,

499
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,940
but with the conditions I have here,

500
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,420
you need to find a way to get her to a major hospital.

501
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,380
Hello? Who is this?

502
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,810
Did you call an ambulance?

503
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,940
I'm coming right now.

504
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,620
Mom,

505
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,900
I really don't wanna eat.

506
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,460
I just got off the night shift.

507
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,490
I'm exhausted.

508
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,810
Someone come!

509
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,770
What's wrong, Ms. Qiao?

510
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,570
Come, Shuyang!

511
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,530
We'll go to the treatment room first.

512
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,010
You go prep the meds and instruments.

513
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,380
Got it!

514
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,530
Be careful!

515
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,330
Shuyang,

516
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,730
change her clothes.

517
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,660
She's got other injuries too.

518
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,140
Take a look and treat her accordingly.

519
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,010
Let's go. I'll help you with it.

520
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,530
Come on, the doctors are with her.

521
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,250
Let's go.

522
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,090
Come.

523
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,140
Have some water.

524
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,490
Please help me.

525
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,250
Please help me.

526
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,460
You'll be fine.

527
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,290
I'm here. Don't be scared.

528
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,530
Mom,

529
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,050
another patient just came in.

530
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,220
I can't go back now.

531
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,330
Okay.

532
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,460
Don't say more. Got it.

533
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,220
Wait for me a second.

534
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,090
Why are you being like this?

535
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,050
No need to ask, Dr. Qiao.

536
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,660
Tong is doing much better now.

537
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,860
We'll only accept conservative treatment.

538
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,140
We don't agree to surgery.

539
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,940
Are you the doctor, or am I?

540
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,900
You need to follow my treatment plan.

541
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,330
Is she really your sister or not?

542
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,090
Is she?

543
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,770
I'm doing this for her own good.

544
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,290
I've told you a hundred times already.

545
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,660
Her persistent high feverIs

546
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,900
because the infection is too serious.

547
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,460
The ulcer on her leg,

548
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,980
if we don't operate today,

549
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,290
we won't be able to save the leg.

550
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,490
Do you really want to see your sister

551
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,090
spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair?

552
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,490
Sign it.

553
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,530
Fine.

554
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,330
If you call me in the middle of the night again,

555
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,050
it'll be no use.

556
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,980
There won't be a next time.

557
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,330
I know you're under pressure.

558
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,860
But who isn't?

559
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,330
There's always a way to solve things,

560
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,250
right, Tang?

561
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,730
Please pick up my call.

562
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,050
Call me back, okay?

563
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,180
Ms. Zhou,

564
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,940
just now, Ms. Shi's team called.

565
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,860
They're coming earlier than planned this afternoon.

566
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,330
They'll be here in about half an hour.

567
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,620
That's good, let's finalize the deal early.

568
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,900
Did you notify Mr. Dong and Mr. Qin?

569
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,660
Yes.

570
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,050
Mr. Dong arrived early this morning

571
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,900
and is preparing with Ji Jie and the others.

572
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,770
Alright then.

573
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,490
Also, Ms. Zhou,

574
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,980
there's another matter.

575
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,700
A bit tricky.

576
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,050
Ms. Qiao,

577
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,330
if the family won't sign,

578
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,940
can't Yan Tong sign the consent herself?

579
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,180
She's only seventeen.

580
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,810
Shuyang,

581
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,380
Shuyang, which operating room?

582
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,330
OR 9. Did she sign the consent?

583
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,380
She didn't.

584
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,180
Ms. Qiao,

585
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,530
we've been emphasizing

586
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,940
standardized surgical procedures lately.

587
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,940
This...

588
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,250
This is a matter of life and death.

589
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,420
We can't afford to follow all the protocols right now.

590
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,980
Ms. Zhou,

591
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,460
why can't you just talk outside?

592
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,900
Why all the secrecy?

593
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,900
Why are Yan Dan and Yan Tong here?

594
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,770
Yan Dan called me in the middle of the night asking for help.

595
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,940
I brought the patient in for emergency treatment.

596
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,730
What's the problem?

597
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,220
If there's no issue, then why won't she sign?

598
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,860
Didn't you say you'd stay out of it

599
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,770
because of Li Qi?

600
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,140
Why the sudden concern?

601
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,660
Because I trust you, that's why.

602
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,530
Qiao Yang,

603
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,050
things are different now.

604
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,050
Shi Jin will be here in two hours.

605
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,290
Just two hours.

606
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,250
They could decide the fate of Gemu.

607
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,140
Do you understand?

608
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,530
That girl needs surgery immediately.

609
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,220
She's already delirious from the fever.

610
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,420
She won't last much longer.

611
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,220
I know.

612
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,290
The infection is serious.

613
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,900
We need to start antibiotics first.

614
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,140
Once her white cell count drops, we'll operate.

615
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,620
Qiao Yang, it's just two hours.

616
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,180
Have you seen her leg?

617
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,940
Two more hours,

618
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,140
she'll lose the leg.

619
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,330
I've seen it.

620
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,420
Two hours won't make a difference.

621
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,420
How can you say that?

622
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,730
It's not your leg!

623
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,050
Seriously,

624
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,810
why are you so difficult to talk to?

625
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:33,860
Ms. Zhou,

626
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,810
Ms. Shi and her team have arrived. What do we do?

627
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,770
Give me a moment.

628
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,900
Zhou Jingwen!

629
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,330
Zhou Jingwen!

630
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,980
What's your problem?

631
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,140
Zhou Jingwen!

632
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,250
Open the door!

633
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,980
This is illegal detention!

634
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,220
I'll call the police on you!

635
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,620
Open the door!

636
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,380
Ms. Shi,

637
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,660
welcome!

638
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,980
White coats...

639
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,090
Nice.

640
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,570
It's been a long time since I've seen you all in white coats.

641
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,140
It feels like we're back in the old days.

642
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,380
Really brings back memories.

643
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,180
Didn't Mr. Chu say Qiao Yang is also at Gemu?

644
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,810
Why haven't we seen her?

645
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,700
Mr. Chu had a last-minute meeting.

646
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,090
He asked Qiao Yang to accompany him.

647
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:39,860
Zhou Jingwen.

648
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,570
Oh, right.

649
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,010
He said he'd be arriving a bit later.

650
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,380
Yeah.

651
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,330
Sorry, I have to take this call.

652
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,180
I'll let the "ladies" friend" keep you company.

653
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:51,980
Hello?

654
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,730
Me.

655
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,530
Friend of the ladies!

656
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,460
This way.

657
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,810
It's okay.

658
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,490
I know you're in Shenzhen.

659
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,380
No need.

660
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,730
Really, Mr. Jiang,

661
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,570
I'm here. I've got this.

662
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,980
Tang's just being childish.

663
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,090
Acts on impulse.

664
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,050
Okay, I understand.

665
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,730
Don't worry.

666
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,380
No matter what, we'll get this done today.

667
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,660
Acquiring Gemu won't change.

668
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,140
Alright.

669
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,980
Sure.

670
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,180
Mr. Wang, Mr. Jiang wants to talk to you.

671
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,900
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

672
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,290
Don't worry.

673
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,380
Where are you?

674
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,940
I'm already here, where are you?

675
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,050
You think I feel good

676
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,180
about how things turned out?

677
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,900
All this time, I've been juggling things at the company.

678
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,730
And for what?

679
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,940
To find someone better

680
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,250
suited to take over.

681
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,140
You told me to meet

682
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,250
that Shi person.

683
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,220
I did.

684
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,980
But I don't think she's straightforward enough,

685
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,940
or sincere enough.

686
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,420
Come on, this is a big deal.

687
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,940
She needs time.

688
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,700
I'm telling you,

689
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,050
She and her team are at Gemu right now, doing an inspection.

690
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,660
Tang Jun,

691
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,810
you absolutely cannot sell Gemu to Li Qi.

692
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,770
You know exactly what kind of person she is.

693
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,330
I don't care what kind of relationship you have with her.

694
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,090
I won't allow you to harm Gemu.

695
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,090
Zhou Jingwen, if that's how you're going to talk to me,

696
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,250
you're really pushing it now.

697
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,660
Yesterday,

698
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,570
right outside my dad's hospital room,

699
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,460
they gave me an ultimatum.

700
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,180
If I don't show them some real action,

701
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,050
the company's no longer going to be our family's.

702
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,380
Alright then.

703
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,290
Ms. Shi's still doing the inspection, right?

704
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,380
Ask her.

705
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,810
If she's sincere about taking over,

706
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,900
tell her to come find me.

707
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,810
If not,

708
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,010
then it'll be Li Qi.

709
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,980
It doesn't matter who it is,

710
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,180
I need to wrap this up today.

711
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,620
Wait, Tang Jun.

712
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,250
Hello?

713
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,420
Hello?

714
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,050
Hu,

715
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,290
once this is settled,

716
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,290
I'll be able to clear all those debts.

717
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,290
As for the follow-up,

718
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,380
I'll have to count on you.

719
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,090
No problem.

720
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,330
As long as you

721
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,980
handle this well,

722
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,770
we'll be on your side.

723
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,050
I've already warned you.

724
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,660
Don't lose the big for the small.

725
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,660
The vast ocean is all yours.

726
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,570
Who cares about a little stream?

727
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,940
Aren't you answering the other call?

728
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,330
My head hurts. I'm gonna get in the car and rest a bit.

729
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,330
I'm in the storage room on the fourth floor.

730
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,330
Someone locked me in.

731
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,290
Hurry up and come save me!

732
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,220
Open the door.

733
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,340
What do you mean by this?

734
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,820
Ms. Qiao, sorry,

735
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,530
Ms. Zhou has given a strict order.

736
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,530
No one can let you out

737
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,900
before the tour ends.

738
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,090
Please bear with it for now.

739
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,090
Traitor!

740
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,490
Alright.

741
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,210
This has a very noticeable effect

742
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,610
on tightening and firming the skin.

743
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,210
Would you like to try it?

744
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,210
This is a benefit from Mr. Qin and Mr. Dong.

745
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,740
Then I'll be next.

746
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,940
Sure, next.

747
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,170
I wanna try.

748
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,380
Together!

749
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,690
So eager!

750
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,780
But I have to tell everyone,

751
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,650
today we'll only do half, alright?

752
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,050
Next time, we'll have to come back for the rest.

753
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,010
One, two, three, go!

754
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,340
There's a traffic jam, wait a minute.

755
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,090
My dear young master, what are you waiting for?

756
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,420
When it's time to cut the meat,

757
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,740
there are no real opponents.

758
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,340
Anyone who can take over is a friend.

759
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,780
But what if the one controlling it

760
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,300
is my ex-girlfriend who betrayed me?

761
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,130
And the one I've never gotten over?

762
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,690
Hu, you've got life experience.

763
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,740
Help me out.

764
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,900
Tell me, am I just...

765
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,820
asking for it?

766
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,460
Back then, so many women,

767
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,340
they all adored me, chased me,

768
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,820
clung to me, smothered me.

769
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,090
But not her.

770
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,090
She was so independent.

771
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,780
She made me feel like...

772
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,780
like an older sister. No, that's not quite right.

773
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,690
Anyway, she knew when to be gentle with me,

774
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,740
and when to criticize me.

775
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,010
Everything about her just felt right.

776
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,650
Her?

777
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,300
Ms. Li.

778
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,530
See, I just got in touch with him.

779
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,090
He said the GPS led him into a dead end.

780
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,460
His brain,

781
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,460
ugh, he never remembers the way.

782
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,210
Let's wait a bit longer, maybe twenty minutes or so.

783
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,780
Alright then.

784
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,170
Pretty?

785
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,260
Pretty?

786
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,570
She's the most beautiful woman in the world.

787
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,570
At least, in my heart.

788
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,820
We've been apart for so many days.

789
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,050
Just thinking of her

790
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,460
makes me feel restless.

791
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,490
Back when she was at home, I didn't feel anything.

792
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,050
But now that she's gone,

793
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,010
it's like every corner of the house

794
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,420
still smells like her.

795
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,740
And somehow, that's become my favorite scent.

796
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,690
Even with all her flaws,

797
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,820
I just can't bring myself to hate her.

798
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:20,570
Hu,

799
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,980
in a situation like this,

800
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,530
what should I do?

801
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,210
When it comes to personal matters,

802
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,490
you have to solve them yourself.

803
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,900
Not gonna lie, Hu,

804
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,460
that eye mask of yours is kinda flashy.

805
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,690
It's alright, just average.

806
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,570
I'm gonna rest for a bit.

807
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,820
That was a lot to take in.

808
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:53,900
Not bad.

809
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,820
This is Lu Ziyou, Dr. Lu.

810
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,530
Dr. Lu,

811
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,380
Ms. Qiao's been calling you non-stop.

812
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,380
Card.

813
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,260
Why are you only getting here now?

814
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,210
What's wrong?

815
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,300
Don't mention it.

816
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,050
Come on,

817
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,300
you're coming with me to save someone.

818
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,900
Wait for me in the operating room.

819
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,900
Where's your sister?

820
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,340
She went to the restroom.

821
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,780
Ms. Qiao,

822
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,650
while my sister's not here, please treat me.

823
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,300
I can't live without my legs.

824
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,860
Please.

825
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,490
Don't worry.

826
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,530
Hello, how can I help you?

827
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,690
Hello.

828
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,900
Tong!

829
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,530
Sorry,

830
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,610
you're not allowed in here.

831
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,940
Is my sister inside?

832
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,650
I already said we're not doing the surgery.

833
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,780
We didn't sign anything.

834
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,740
Touch me again and see what happens.

835
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:47,820
Ms. Qiao,

836
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,530
there's someone making a scene at the entrance.

837
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,740
Ms. Shi,

838
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,300
feel free to come anytime.

839
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,610
Just ask for me directly.

840
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,460
Alright.

841
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,570
Also,

842
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,780
everyone can add Ji Jie on WeChat.

843
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,260
You'll get a discount if you go through her next time.

844
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,780
Great.

845
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,570
- Get your supervisor over here. - This way.

846
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,260
Let me in.

847
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,420
We're in the middle of an emergency procedure.

848
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,940
Is this how Gemu handles patients, pushing them around?

849
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,300
No, it's not.

850
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,050
Get your supervisor over here.

851
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,420
I said I didn't sign anything.

852
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,900
- You can't operate. - What's going on?

853
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,820
Tell me,

854
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,090
why did you perform surgery on my sister

855
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,050
without my consent?

856
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,090
I didn't sign anything.

857
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,530
It's okay, I'll handle this.

858
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,690
- Calm down. - Wait a second.

859
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,820
What's going on?

860
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,980
Can I ask,

861
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,420
why was the surgery performed without consent

862
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,260
from the patient's family?

863
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,050
Ask her.

864
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,740
What kind of surgery was it?

865
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,740
Who was the lead surgeon?

866
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,460
It was me.

867
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,340
It's her.

868
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,340
I didn't sign anything and she still insisted on operating on my sister.

869
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,050
Alright, wait a second.

870
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,050
Weren't you in a meeting?

871
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,610
I got called back for an emergency surgery.

872
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,210
Her sister

873
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,860
has over a hundred infected lesions.

874
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,210
Because the best window for treatment was missed earlier,

875
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,650
her condition is now critical.

876
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,340
If we don't operate immediately,

877
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,420
her life will be in danger.

878
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,650
Why didn't you want the surgery?

879
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,980
I don't trust her.

880
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,340
If that's your final decision,

881
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,010
I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint my mentor.

882
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,530
Do what you want then.

883
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,300
I know what you're thinking.

884
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,090
You think a few more hours won't make a difference.

885
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,530
But the patient really can't wait.

886
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,610
We shouldn't gamble with a patient's life,

887
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,380
right?

888
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,860
If this hospital ends up shutting down,

889
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,690
at least we'll have a clear conscience for the rest of our lives.

890
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,820
But if we lose the patient,

891
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,780
I guarantee neither of us will be able to live with it.

892
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,650
If I don't go in, your sister will die.

893
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,900
Are you sure that's what you want?

894
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,340
Ms. Shi,

895
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,170
situations like this

896
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,490
have never happened at our hospital before.

897
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,460
And I can promise you,

898
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,780
they absolutely will never happen again in the future.

899
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,380
Don't worry.

900
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,860
What's the situation outside?

901
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,490
A special situation.

902
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,980
Let me tell you something.

903
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,170
By participating in this surgery,

904
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,490
we could all lose our jobs.

905
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,130
In the worst case scenario,

906
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,860
this hospital might go under because of it.

907
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,820
So think it through carefully.

908
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,130
It's your choice.

909
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,340
Well, we're already here.

910
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,780
Let's just do it.

911
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,380
Bringing down the whole hospital?

912
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,900
What an honor.

913
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,490
Then let's do it.

914
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,980
I'll take care of the right leg.

915
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,380
You handle debridement on the left.
