1
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,930
Are they on good terms?

2
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,410
I remember when we were doing the show,

3
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,460
I never saw him.

4
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,260
Their relationship is just so-so.

5
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,460
I've been working with Xuan for five or six years now.

6
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,180
Whether it's recording shows or filming,

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,210
she never posts about him on her social media.

8
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,540
And he rarely comes to the set.

9
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,210
But that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,460
You don't post about Mr. Qin on your social media either.

11
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,620
Could you be divorced?

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,770
What?

13
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,340
What nonsense are you talking about?

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,980
I wasn't talking about you, I meant Guo Xuan.

15
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,450
Taozi,

16
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,570
do you think Guo Xuan and Fang Yu might be divorced?

17
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,100
I don't know.

18
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,980
When he went in just now,

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,220
he was holding a bouquet of flowers.

20
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,060
Tell me, if your wife gets injured,

21
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,660
would you have the time

22
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,170
to buy flowers on the way to the hospital?

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,220
It just doesn't feel like they're a married couple.

24
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,660
More like friends.

25
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,660
And the moment Guo Xuan got hurt,

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,890
the first person she told was Meng Haoran.

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,850
That's way too obvious.

28
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,060
She's not even worried about Fang Yu finding out?

29
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,060
Didn't expect you to be this observant.

30
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,340
I usually just don't bother with gossip,

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,100
but that doesn't mean I don't notice things.

32
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,850
You're right.

33
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,780
Xuan only wears her wedding ring

34
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,940
when she's working.

35
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,340
That's true.

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,380
She wasn't wearing it today either.

37
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,780
That explains everything.

38
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,100
So Guo Xuan's secret isn't cheating,

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,220
it's divorce.

40
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,500
That's probably why

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,260
she refuses to come forward as a witness.

42
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,820
Aren't you supposed to be keeping an eye on the ward?

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,380
Did you sneak out to buy food again?

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,170
I'm innocent!

45
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,940
This is from Meng Haoran, the lead actor from the crew

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,690
we treated.

47
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,570
He came to visit his injured colleagues

48
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,170
and even ordered food for the medical staff.

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,130
Eat while it's hot.

50
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,450
Out of the three of them,

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,010
who do you think wants their divorce to go public the most?

52
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,450
Who?

53
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,940
Me?

54
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,380
Meng.

55
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,220
Taozi?

56
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,170
What are you doing here?

57
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,290
Boyfriend?

58
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,780
I saw the news.

59
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,140
It's all baseless rumors.

60
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,730
Don't let it get to you.

61
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,660
The police will figure out the truth.

62
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,980
By then, it'll be too late.

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,700
Too late?

64
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,980
He desperately needs a blood donor right now.

65
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,660
But because of all the online gossip,

66
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,050
that person refuses to help him.

67
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,050
Meng.

68
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,100
Meng...

69
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,140
I really don't know what to do anymore.

70
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,410
Looks like it's not happening.

71
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,700
From his position,

72
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,900
there's nothing he can do to convince her.

73
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,370
It's already 6:30.

74
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,140
Still no response from the blood donor?

75
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,540
No, not yet.

76
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,660
How's it going?

77
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,490
He's still inside.

78
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,220
What's the situation?

79
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,730
Stable.

80
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,220
Stable.

81
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:01,900
Hello?

82
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,340
I need to ask you something.

83
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,660
What is it?

84
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,050
I have a patient here,

85
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,460
blast injury.

86
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,700
Your handling of it is correct.

87
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,140
Right now, the most critical thing is to prevent

88
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,410
shock caused by pneumothorax combined with hemothorax.

89
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,540
The main issue now is the blood supply.

90
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,540
I suggest you consider autologous blood transfusion.

91
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,170
But Gemu doesn't have that equipment.

92
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,170
And...

93
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,730
I don't know how to perform the procedure.

94
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,700
How about this?

95
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,700
I'll make arrangements

96
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,930
to send the equipment over as soon as possible.

97
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,370
I'll send a specialist too.

98
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,250
But based on my experience,

99
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,700
with a wound this large,

100
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,540
he'll need at least 20 units of blood.

101
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,780
Even with diluted blood

102
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,610
and intraoperative reinfusion,

103
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,930
it's likely not going to be enough.

104
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,020
So...

105
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,220
you still need to find a blood donor.

106
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,700
Got it.

107
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,170
Thanks.

108
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,100
Any update? Did the donor get on the plane?

109
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,540
The blood bank can't get in touch with him.

110
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,050
But there's some good news.

111
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,900
I couldn't convince Guo Xuan to testify.

112
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,700
She has her reasons.

113
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,100
We understand.

114
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,020
But I believe the fire was caused by something else.

115
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,170
It definitely wasn't Ding's fault.

116
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,170
He's a meticulous and responsible person.

117
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,140
Others check blood packs

118
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,220
and explosive devices once,

119
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,540
he checks them three times.

120
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,370
Do you think it would help if I posted a video

121
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,100
showing support as a fellow crew member?

122
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,660
Would that work?

123
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,980
Hello, everyone.

124
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,290
I'm Meng Haoran.

125
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,140
Today, a fire broke out on our film set,

126
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,050
injuring multiple crew members.

127
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,540
The most critically injured

128
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,730
is our special effects pyrotechnician, Ding Zhike.

129
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,980
Right now, his surgery is on hold

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,250
because we lack A-type Rh-negative blood.

131
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,540
Until now...

132
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,140
See,

133
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,580
I told you he was here.

134
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,340
You didn't believe me.

135
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,170
I've seen a lot of false rumors online,

136
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,460
accusing Ding Zhike of being responsible for the fire.

137
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,050
These claims are completely baseless.

138
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,850
Please stay rational,

139
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,460
don't believe or spread rumors,

140
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,660
and wait for the official investigation results.

141
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,850
Additionally,

142
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,290
if you have A-type Rh-negative blood,

143
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,700
please contact Gemu Hospital as soon as possible.

144
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,940
Hello.

145
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,890
The number you dialed is powered off.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,250
You didn't told me you were going to the hospital

147
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,370
and posting the video.

148
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,010
The investigation hasn't even concluded yet,

149
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,130
why are you taking sides blindly?

150
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,820
I'm telling you,

151
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,250
if this situation turns around,

152
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,940
your fans will drop you and turn against you instantly.

153
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,770
If you keep acting like this,

154
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,100
you'll ruin yourself sooner or later.

155
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,530
Shuyang, you're just in time.

156
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,060
Help me out.

157
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,820
Listen to me first.

158
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,420
Meng Haoran's video worked.

159
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,650
A donor was found in the neighboring city

160
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,730
and is already on the way.

161
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,370
That's great!

162
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,940
Alright,

163
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,940
help me keep an eye on him.

164
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,820
Let me go to the restroom.

165
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,300
Go.

166
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,890
I can't hold it anymore.

167
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,820
Where's Wei Xiaoxi?

168
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,460
She went to the restroom.

169
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,420
What's his temperature?

170
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,650
37.4°C.

171
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,820
That high?

172
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,980
His temperature started rising half an hour ago.

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,980
Why didn't you tell me?

174
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,100
It was still within the normal range earlier,

175
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,420
so we didn't want to disturb you.

176
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,610
How much drainage was there an hour ago?

177
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,770
Two milliliters.

178
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,700
Ms. Qiao.

179
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,180
I told you to monitor him

180
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,250
and record data every half hour, why?

181
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,650
To prevent delayed hemothorax.

182
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,770
Here, see for yourself.

183
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,820
It wasn't like this just now.

184
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,650
I only stepped away for two minutes.

185
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,580
Stop making excuses!

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,250
Is this your first day as a doctor?

187
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,850
How's the situation?

188
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,610
Can the surgery be delayed?

189
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,610
The blood donor should arrive by 11 at the earliest.

190
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,060
His blood pressure still hasn't stabilized.

191
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,420
I strongly suspect hemothorax.

192
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,700
His temperature is also rising,

193
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,980
which means a high risk of infection.

194
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,340
That's bad.

195
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,700
If your assessment is correct,

196
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,850
he needs a blood transfusion now.

197
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,340
But the problem is, there's no blood.

198
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,340
Ms. Qiao...

199
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,010
Get out.

200
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,850
Out.

201
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,130
Continue fluid resuscitation.

202
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,100
Prepare for surgery.

203
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,580
Did you find any other blood?

204
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,010
No.

205
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,300
Then have you come up with a solution?

206
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,940
No.

207
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,580
Qiao Yang, no matter how confident you are, you can't just force it.

208
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,890
Let's control it with medication first.

209
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,220
We still have some time, let's wait a little longer.

210
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,890
If we don't intervene now in his condition,

211
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,180
it'll be dangerous once his blood pressure starts dropping.

212
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,980
I have no choice but to take a gamble.

213
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,850
What are you gambling with?

214
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,820
Come with me.

215
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,460
Ms. Qiao,

216
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,940
this is Dr. Jiang, who will assist us

217
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,300
with autologous blood reinfusion.

218
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,890
Nice to meet you.

219
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,650
Thank you for making the trip.

220
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,460
It's nothing.

221
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,700
Alright, you can go in and get ready.

222
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,340
Okay.

223
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,220
Ms. Qiao,

224
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,580
Zhike's test results are in.

225
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,940
Look here,

226
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,060
there's still blood accumulation.

227
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,220
But his procalcitonin levels look okay.

228
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,100
Still, prepare extra medication,

229
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,850
just in case.

230
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:49,850
Ms. Qiao,

231
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,130
can I assist in this surgery?

232
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,580
I know I shouldn't have left the patient unattended,

233
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,770
but please give me another chance.

234
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,700
I really want to be part of Ding Zhike's operation.

235
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,820
Be part of what operation?

236
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,300
You can be part of the blood bank instead.

237
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,890
As soon as the blood arrives, bring it to me immediately.

238
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,890
Hurry up!

239
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,650
Ms. Qiao, bad news!

240
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,220
The patient is in shock!

241
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,820
Did you administer norepinephrine?

242
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,850
Just did.

243
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,580
Is the autologous blood reinfusion ready?

244
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,100
It's ready.

245
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,770
Hemostatic forceps.

246
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,130
You find the bleeding source.

247
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,980
I'll remove the necrotic tissue.

248
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,300
Until the donated blood arrives,

249
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,770
we need to keep the blood loss under 200ml.

250
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,890
Found it!

251
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,010
Forceps.

252
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,770
Heart rate is stabilizing.

253
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,850
Blood pressure is relatively stable.

254
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,010
The wound color doesn't look good.

255
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,730
We need to expand the excision.

256
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,180
Let's remove another layer.

257
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,940
I still think this color is too dark.

258
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,100
We need to go deeper and remove another layer.

259
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,580
Blood loss has exceeded 200ml.

260
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,370
Let's wait a bit.

261
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,010
We've already cut one centimeter deep.

262
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,530
Where's the blood?

263
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,850
Call Wei Xiaoxi.

264
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,460
Okay.

265
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,220
Line's busy.

266
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,650
Keep calling until she answers!

267
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,010
Don't hang up yet.

268
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,060
Give the phone to the driver.

269
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,130
I'll tell him how to get here.

270
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,650
Take the side road,

271
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,980
turn left after two intersections,

272
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,890
and then keep going straight.

273
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,730
Yes, I'm at the entrance.

274
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,370
Hello.

275
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,010
I'd like to ask

276
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,370
how Ding Zhike is doing.

277
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,100
Ding Zhike?

278
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,250
He's still in surgery.

279
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,580
We don't know the exact situation yet.

280
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,060
Have some water, don't worry.

281
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,980
Thank you.

282
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,180
The color looks better now.

283
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,530
Yes, it's fresher.

284
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,580
I think once we clean this part up,

285
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,580
it should be almost done.

286
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,850
We can't continue any further.

287
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,730
The blood pressure is unstable.

288
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,220
The heart rate has increased.

289
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,180
Where's the blood?

290
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,820
They said it would arrive at a certain time.

291
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,770
I'll check again.

292
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,100
The blood's here.

293
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,420
Two thousand milliliters.

294
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,010
Where have you been?

295
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,850
You should have climbed over here by now!

296
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,460
I'll handle the rest.

297
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,490
You hurry and get the skin flap.

298
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,770
Here, the scalpel.

299
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,460
What are you doing?

300
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,610
Where are you suctioning?

301
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,060
Ding Zhike's surgery is over?

302
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,220
That was quick.

303
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,850
Ms. Qiao didn't let me participate in the surgery.

304
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,980
Why not?

305
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,100
You took such good care of him

306
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,420
and endured so much.

307
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,980
It's no surprise.

308
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,220
Eh...

309
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,580
Doctor.

310
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,530
The wound infection exceeded expectations,

311
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,930
so we had to cut more.

312
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,010
There was also hemorrhagic shock during the surgery.

313
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,740
Don't scare her.

314
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,660
Everything that needed to be handled has been taken care of.

315
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,580
The surgery was a success.

316
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,660
He'll be out soon.

317
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,340
I was just about to say that.

318
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,180
Thank you,

319
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,700
thank you so much.

320
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,090
Don't worry, get some rest.

321
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,970
Don't cry, have a good sleep.

322
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,930
Let's go celebrate with some bullfrog tonight.

323
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,420
Sure.

324
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,930
Let's go.

325
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,130
Your treat.

326
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,650
I treated last week.

327
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,060
Why are you so stingy?

328
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,610
Who's stingy? You're the boss.

329
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,060
Alright, my treat.

330
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,980
Meng Haoran, someone with an ordinary appearance

331
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,650
and poor abilities, can still become popular.

332
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,850
Isn't it all because he knows how to flatter?

333
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,770
Isn't it wrong for him to speak up for his colleagues?

334
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,980
This just proves his character can withstand the test.

335
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,460
Those fans in the building,

336
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,900
don't keep attracting hate for your him.

337
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,530
Nowadays, there are very few people like Meng,

338
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,570
who have a positive image

339
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,900
and strong acting skills.

340
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,980
People who spread rumors know exactly what they're doing.

341
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,770
The police haven't even released any statements yet.

342
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,330
But he spoke up first.

343
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,570
Thank you, Dr. Qiao.

344
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,250
Thank you, Dr. Qiao.

345
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,180
No need to be so polite.

346
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,420
What's yours?

347
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,380
You should eat more.

348
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,090
Alright, you eat less.

349
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,530
Save some for Wei Xiaoxi.

350
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,330
Got it, French fries.

351
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,730
Thank you, sir.

352
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,700
Thank you.

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,730
Mr. Chu has arrived?

354
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,940
Yeah, just landed and called.

355
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,330
He praised your decisiveness.

356
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,660
Of course.

357
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,330
Here.

358
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,980
I don't eat junk food.

359
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,420
Why must you eat bullfrog?

360
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,250
It's so late,

361
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,700
I can't go out and catch them for you.

362
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,530
We'll have it another day.

363
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,660
I'll bring some pizza

364
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,700
to the ward.

365
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,180
I'll join you.

366
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,050
Save me some salad.

367
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,730
Don't finish it all.

368
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,220
Alright.

369
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,810
Alright.

370
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,140
Here.

371
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,940
Why didn't tell me there's food here?

372
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,730
Dr. Chen,

373
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,250
have you seen Dr. Wei?

374
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,730
No, I haven't seen her.

375
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,860
Alright.

376
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,330
I'm not eating this.

377
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,530
I'll gain weight eating at night.

378
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,140
Fine.

379
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,180
Have you seen the guests in the VIP ward?

380
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,940
No, why?

381
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,860
What's going on?

382
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,770
Who's in the VIP ward?

383
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,250
Have you seen the guests in the VIP ward?

384
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,490
I haven't seen them.

385
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,490
I've got two...

386
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,620
Ms. Qiao, Ms. Zhou,

387
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,490
I was just in Guo Xuan's ward taking her temperature.

388
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,220
But she wasn't there.

389
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,940
I've looked everywhere and couldn't find her.

390
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,570
Are her things still there?

391
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,700
Yes, her things are still there.

392
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,620
Alright, no problem. She's in the hospital.

393
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,940
Here, take this

394
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,860
and eat it while it's hot.

395
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,700
There's more downstairs.

396
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,010
I'll go back to work now, thank you.

397
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,730
Where can she go for a walk so late?

398
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,860
Maybe after seeing the video of Meng Haoran,

399
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,860
she's not feeling great.

400
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,570
I hope she doesn't do something reckless.

401
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,050
Still working on a proposal this late?

402
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,770
A confidential proposal?

403
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,700
Understood.

404
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,900
Today, your mentor snapped at you in the operating room.

405
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,810
It was because she was anxious.

406
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,700
Don't take it to heart.

407
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,660
Look, to apologize to you,

408
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,660
she specially got it for you.

409
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,010
I'm not hungry.

410
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,810
Well, I am.

411
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,810
I have to eat something.

412
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,770
I'm exhausted today.

413
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,050
But that's not important.

414
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,140
You have no idea how dangerous today was.

415
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,290
I have to say,

416
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,050
your mentor is incredible.

417
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,180
With just a small symptom,

418
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,250
she predicted it in advance.

419
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,180
And she was spot on with everything.

420
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,700
Most doctors wouldn't be able

421
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,250
to consider everything so thoroughly.

422
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,810
You didn't see it,

423
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,010
the wound was full of blood.

424
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,940
He went into hemorrhagic shock as soon as he were on the operating table.

425
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,140
If the blood had arrived any later,

426
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,620
we might not have been able to save them.

427
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,490
But on the other hand,

428
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,490
if you hadn't delivered the blood in time,

429
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,490
forget your mentor,

430
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,940
even if Hua Tuo himself were here,

431
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,250
he wouldn't have saved him.

432
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,490
Saying all this doesn't change anything.

433
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,570
Bye.

434
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,250
Why did I even bring up Hua Tuo?

435
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,250
If you catch a cold, your recovery will be even slower.

436
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,570
Ding Zhike's surgery was very successful.

437
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,660
He just got out of danger.

438
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,490
Do you wanna go see him?

439
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,980
No.

440
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,940
Taozi probably doesn't wanna see me.

441
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,620
Do you ever feel like,

442
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,730
you're living someone else's life?

443
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,050
Even though every step was your own choice,

444
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,530
the outcome is completely different

445
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,660
from what you imagined.

446
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,330
Yeah.

447
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,810
I don't even know how I ended up here.

448
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,570
Maybe when we look back in old age,

449
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,860
everything will make sense.

450
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,900
The life you have

451
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,620
is the result of the choices you make.

452
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,620
That's the only fair design of fate.

453
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,810
Maybe this is an opportunity.

454
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,570
To really think about what's most important.

455
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,380
Do you know why

456
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,770
Meng made that video?

457
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,380
Because he didn't wanna make things difficult for you.

458
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,220
You're the ones making things difficult for me.

459
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,180
When you couldn't get what you wanted from me, you pressured him instead.

460
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,180
I know you did it to save lives.

461
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,290
Let's just put this matter behind us.

462
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,090
In this whole situation,

463
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,250
he's actually the most innocent one.

464
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,460
He wasn't the third wheel.

465
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,420
I was enjoying my music.

466
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,180
Why did you have to turn it off?

467
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,860
I thought you were asleep.

468
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,770
Good intentions wasted.

469
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,090
I couldn't sleep at all.

470
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,700
It's past 2 AM. You're not tired?

471
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,730
Qin Gui.

472
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,420
You're not answering?

473
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,490
No, I assume it's nothing urgent.

474
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,330
You're not even answering.

475
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,900
How do you know it's not urgent?

476
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,660
Had a fight?

477
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,770
I asked him for a divorce.

478
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,140
Congratulations.

479
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,940
You're free now.

480
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,180
Why don't you seem surprised at all?

481
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,660
You two have been distant for a long time.

482
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,250
Divorce was just a matter of time.

483
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,460
Was it that obvious?

484
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,570
"Unhappy" is practically written on your forehead.

485
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,250
What's your reason for the divorce?

486
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,620
What's your reason?

487
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,330
He snores.

488
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,770
You're divorcing Ji Xuefeng

489
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,050
because he snores?

490
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,330
People spend

491
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,860
half their lives sleeping.

492
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,620
His snoring keeps me up at night.

493
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,180
The next day, when I have surgery,

494
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,660
I'm jittery, my hands shake, and I feel drowsy.

495
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,570
Is that not a good enough reason?

496
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,010
Figures.

497
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,770
That's your style.

498
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,900
What about you?

499
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,980
Me?

500
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,250
It's not something I can explain in a few sentences.

501
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,090
Then don't bother.

502
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,700
Not like I care.

503
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,460
Love... Sometimes,

504
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,380
it has no reason.

505
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,810
It's not always

506
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,660
a rational decision.

507
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,860
You just fall in love.

508
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,620
It's only when love fades that you start wondering,

509
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,700
why did I even choose this person in the first place?

510
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,460
Same goes for divorce.

511
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,420
No matter the reason,

512
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,140
loving someone takes courage.

513
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,940
So does falling out of love.

514
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,730
You don't need to be in pain over this.

515
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,860
You should feel proud of your honesty

516
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,050
and courage.

517
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,050
Good morning, Dr. Qiao.

518
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,050
Don't stop here.

519
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,180
Go tidy up the dressing room.

520
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,620
You're still here?

521
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,900
You're so tired you can barely keep your eyes open.

522
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,730
Go get some sleep.

523
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,250
I'm fine, I'm not tired.

524
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,660
Dr. Lu let me in to see him this morning.

525
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,660
Dr. Lu was here?

526
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,570
Yeah, he came early to cover for Dr. Chen.

527
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,250
Really? Look, there are

528
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,460
so many of us here.

529
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,460
Don't worry.

530
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,220
It's fine.

531
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,940
I'll just watch over him a little longer.

532
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,220
That way, I'll feel at ease.

533
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,490
Doctor,

534
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,900
will I have any aftereffects from this?

535
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,530
Don't worry.

536
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,620
Your hand's functionality won't be affected.

537
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,730
But the wound is quite large,

538
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,050
so be sure not to put pressure on it or get it wet.

539
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:11,980
Alright.

540
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,290
How's Ding doing?

541
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,660
Ding Zhike.

542
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,180
He's out of danger now.

543
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,700
What's wrong?

544
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,250
This morning,

545
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,220
I heard the police's official report.

546
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,700
They said the fire

547
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,730
was caused by aging electrical wiring in the cinema.

548
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,380
It had nothing to do with him.

549
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,220
I have

550
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,050
a bad temper,

551
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,250
and I speak without thinking.

552
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,180
Ding is a good person...

553
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,530
I understand.

554
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,730
But you should tell him that yourself.

555
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,050
Not bad.

556
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,050
If you can wave your hand, it means you're recovering well.

557
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,900
Here you go.

558
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,220
Normal temperature.

559
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,220
Drainage looks good.

560
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,420
Blood indicators are back to normal.

561
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,140
Blood supply is great too.

562
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,570
Whether your skin graft survives

563
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,860
depends on the next few days.

564
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,900
Listen to the nurses.

565
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,380
If your condition improves, you can move to a regular ward.

566
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,380
Then your girlfriend won't have to stand guard at your door anymore.

567
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,980
Alright.

568
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,220
Stop acting like a lucky cat.

569
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,050
Put it away already.

570
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,090
Your handwriting is pretty good.

571
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,330
I found a new place.

572
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,220
I'll move by the end of the month.

573
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,490
No need to rush, is there?

574
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,220
That place is too big for just me.

575
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,530
It's a waste.

576
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,330
We work together all day,

577
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,730
then come home and see each other again.

578
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,570
How is that any different from before?

579
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,420
At least once a week,

580
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,900
or twice, three times,

581
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,180
I'll come pick you up.

582
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,730
It's best if no one else at Gemu finds out.

583
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,420
Talk to Tang about it.

584
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,700
Mr. Fang.

585
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,420
Hello, everyone. I'm Guo Xuan.

586
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,460
Recently, many friends

587
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,090
have been asking about me.

588
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,330
I'd like to thank you all.

589
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,700
There was indeed a small accident recently.

590
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,250
I got a little injury on my face.

591
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,660
But don't worry,

592
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,900
I'll recover very soon.

593
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,420
Taking this opportunity,

594
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,770
I'd like to make a statement.

595
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,490
I want to thank all my friends

596
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,220
for your support and concern along the way.

597
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,220
Fang Yu and I

598
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,860
amicably separated last year.

599
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,620
We have completed the necessary procedures

600
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,700
and officially ended our marriage.

601
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,660
Haoran,

602
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,770
please come to the stage.

603
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,490
You really helped us out this time.

604
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,250
Thanks a lot.

605
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,460
I heard from Jiang,

606
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,050
that person ended up going into shock due to excessive blood loss.

607
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,940
It was really dangerous.

608
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,050
Such a critical patient,

609
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,570
why did they send them to your hospital?

610
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,860
You even had to borrow

611
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,700
a circulatory machine from outside.

612
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,900
Gemu has the capability.

613
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,660
Come.

614
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,700
We were also the only private hospital

615
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,530
involved in the rescue.

616
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,420
I saw on the news,

617
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,220
over ninety people were injured.

618
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,810
The nearby big hospitals alone

619
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,940
couldn't handle that many.

620
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,490
What happened to your show?

621
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,980
Did they take you off the program?

622
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,290
You watch variety shows?

623
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,010
Qi watches them.

624
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,860
I just glanced at it.

625
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,700
I was just curious about

626
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,090
how lively the plastic surgery industry has become.

627
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,810
I see.

628
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,770
You're getting more and more out of line.

629
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,570
You haven't been married long,

630
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,420
but you don't even go home after work.

631
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,290
Dou has been eating takeout for three days straight.

632
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,940
Why is he complaining to you about that?

633
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,180
He's crazy!

634
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,940
I ran into him yesterday.

635
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,530
Ran into?

636
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,860
Can you stop dropping by our house

637
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,010
unannounced?

638
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,770
You didn't mind when I helped with the renovations.

639
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,620
And your house?

640
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,810
Your dad paid for it.

641
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,010
So what are you saying?

642
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,090
- I should pay you back? - You don't wanna say anything?

643
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,250
Fine, I'll pay.

644
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,730
Clear the table.

645
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,570
Let's eat.

646
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,290
Qi, what do you do after work these days?

647
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,900
I've been learning to dance recently.

648
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,700
Really?

649
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,420
Qi,

650
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,810
you should do something more meaningful.

651
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,700
Study hard, work hard.

652
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,010
Ever since you got double eyelid surgery,

653
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,250
you're either learning to dance one day

654
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,730
or dining at trendy restaurants the next.

655
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,180
You're getting more and more out of hand.

656
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,570
What's wrong with double eyelids?

657
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,940
Even Qiao Yang said,

658
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,570
since I got them done,

659
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,140
I've become much more cheerful.

660
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,010
I'm doing well at work, too.

661
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,010
I even got promoted.

662
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,770
Really?

663
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:09,980
Qi,

664
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,770
you have indeed made progress at work.

665
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,460
But can you really credit that to your double eyelids?

666
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,620
Without them,

667
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,050
would you not be able to read reports?

668
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,090
You should seriously reflect on this,

669
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,330
why was your progress so slow before?

670
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,980
I have reflected.

671
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,730
I watched a movie the other day,

672
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,700
and one of its lines really struck me.

673
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,420
Life is like archery.

674
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,380
Chasing dreams is like finding a target.

675
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,980
If you can't find a target,

676
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,330
then what's the point of drawing the bow every day?

677
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,810
Before,

678
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,940
I was just pulling the bowstring every day,

679
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,140
but I had no idea where my target was.

680
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,010
Qiao Yang told me,

681
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,010
if I want a certain kind of life,

682
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,090
I need to figure it out for myself.

683
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,900
So now, I'm searching for my target.

684
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,290
What kind of ridiculous movie is that?

685
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,250
I've never even heard of it.

686
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,570
Qiao Yang,

687
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,090
don't bother, I'll do it.

688
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,860
Here, let me tie your apron.

689
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,980
So you don't get dirty.

690
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,620
These flowers are completely dead.

691
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,530
Why haven't you thrown them away?

692
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,090
Mom,

693
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,570
Mom,

694
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,730
I just bought these flowers last week.

695
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,050
Don't worry,

696
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,660
I already used the buds to make scrambled eggs.

697
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,660
Nothing went to waste.

698
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,140
I bought these flowers for you to enjoy,

699
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,570
not to eat.

700
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,900
Can you talk to Dad?

701
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,980
Tell him to stop throwing cigarette butts into the flowerpot.

702
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,330
Would he even listen to me?

703
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,530
He's always been like this.

704
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,380
My mom had orchids for two or three years.

705
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,460
They bloomed beautifully every year.

706
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,940
Then his cigarette butts ruined them all.

707
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,620
I don't care.

708
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,220
I'm buying more next week.

709
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,530
Alright, that's enough.

710
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,050
The wound is healing very well.

711
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,530
You can be discharged today.

712
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,900
A little redness is normal.

713
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,690
If you feel pain or develop a fever, contact me.

714
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,210
If there are no complications,

715
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,210
just come back for a follow-up in half a month.

716
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,740
What about itching? Is that normal?

717
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,900
As long as you don't eat spicy hotpot, it won't itch.

718
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,980
And you even asked for extra spice.

719
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,570
I've held back for over ten days.

720
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,570
Just this once!

721
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,170
If you wanna stay pretty, control your appetite.

722
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,980
Before you leave, we'll put a compression band on you.

723
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,170
You need to wear it for three months.

724
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,380
It helps prevent scar overgrowth.

725
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,490
Do not remove it.

726
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,050
Without chili peppers,

727
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,780
what's the point of life?

728
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:01,980
When you leave,

729
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,420
they'll give you some instructions.

730
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,340
I won't be seeing you off.

731
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,610
Okay, I've got things to do.

732
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,530
Ms. Zhou,

733
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,860
there's something I think you should know.

734
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,610
It concerns your hospital.

735
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,610
Xuan,

736
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,090
when I went to pay the bill just now,

737
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,530
they said it was already covered.

738
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,050
That was you, wasn't it?

739
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,650
Mr. Fang said you resigned.

740
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,490
Yes.

741
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,610
But don't misunderstand,

742
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,090
I just wanna focus on taking care of him for a while.

743
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,900
That's good.

744
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,980
If you ever need help,

745
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,530
you can always come to me.

746
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,940
Xuan,

747
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,490
thank you.

748
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,900
Alright,

749
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,980
go on upstairs.

750
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,010
Take good care of him.

751
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,490
Let's go, Dong.

752
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,740
Miss Guo, where would you like to go?

753
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,980
What are you doing here?

754
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,570
Relax, no one's taking pictures.

755
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,090
You've already gone public, what are you afraid of?

756
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,530
What am I afraid of?

757
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,210
I'm afraid you'll get exposed and lose fans.

758
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,380
Afraid your sponsor's daughter will get jealous.

759
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,650
Good point.

760
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,380
We should see each other less from now on.

761
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,740
Don't you dare!

762
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,340
You, Drive.

763
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,420
That's great!

764
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,380
Alright.

765
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,530
No.

766
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,650
I insist, let me treat you.

767
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,260
Don't worry, Wan.

768
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,650
You're one of our VIP clients.

769
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,260
Ms. Zhou arranged this.

770
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,090
Alright.

771
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,130
Okay, I'll pick you up tomorrow at 10 AM.

772
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,170
Okay.

773
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,260
Come in.

774
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,380
Ms. Li.

775
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,740
Guo Xuan has been discharged?

776
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,740
Yes.

777
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,490
There's no news online now, right?

778
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,740
No more discussions.

779
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,900
Alright, get back to work.

780
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,490
Okay.

781
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,210
Ms. Zhou.

782
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,690
I asked you to organize

783
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,340
Du Jun's client medical records last time.

784
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,090
Where are they?

785
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,740
Sorry, Ms. Zhou.

786
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,260
I've been busy in the ward lately,

787
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,940
focusing on the burn patients.

788
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,210
Then hurry up!

789
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,420
I need all the records,

790
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,530
from the start of the clinic until now, both current and former employees.

791
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,260
Why are you still standing there? Go!

792
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,010
Okay.

793
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,740
You're not off work yet?

794
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,650
Still stressing over the divorce?

795
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,420
You can tell?

796
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,610
I guessed.

797
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,260
You look distracted.

798
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,260
Got plans tonight?

799
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,570
Yeah.

800
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,570
Gonna beat someone up.

801
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,650
Wanna join?

802
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,690
Here.

803
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,740
Stretch forward.

804
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,420
Come on.

805
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,170
Alright.

806
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,210
Are you sure a beginner can do this?

807
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,260
Don't worry. There's a coach, right?

808
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,260
As long as you have all your limbs, you can train.

809
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,010
Come.

810
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,860
Stretch forward.

811
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,420
Great.

812
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,210
Haven't eaten, have you?

813
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,010
You're wobbling just wearing gloves.

814
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,010
Two.

815
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:01,900
One, two.

816
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,900
Yes.

817
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,460
One.

818
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,460
Two.

819
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,340
One, two.

820
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,460
Yes, again.

821
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,530
Hit the punching bag!

822
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,260
Very good.

823
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,260
Alternate your hands.

824
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,260
Use your back hand too.

825
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,050
Yes, good.

826
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,570
Imagine it's your enemy.

827
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,740
Hit harder!

828
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:14,940
Increase speed!

829
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,010
Great!

830
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,010
You can shout!

831
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,570
Go! Go! Go!

832
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,090
Go! Go! Go!

833
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,690
Alright.

834
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,940
What's wrong with your friend?

835
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:28,980
Shout it out!

836
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,820
Very good, keep going!

837
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,300
Come on, push through!

838
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,980
Good! Keep going!

839
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,650
Alright.

840
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,900
Okay, stop.

841
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,090
For a first time, that was really impressive.

842
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,460
Take a good rest.

843
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,610
Let's have some water, shall we?

844
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,170
Alright.

845
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,740
Does Mr. Qin often abuse you at home?

846
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,260
Screw you!

847
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,650
Then what did that punching bag ever do to you?

848
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,170
You're about to punch a hole through it!

849
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,740
Getting a divorce and looking completely shattered,

850
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,860
that's not like you.

851
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,010
You think that's all I'm upset about?

852
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,740
Then what else?

853
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,530
Ms. Zhou,

854
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,170
I found something else

855
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,690
in the footage I shot.

856
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,610
You're looking for me because of Qiao Yang, right?

857
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,940
You guys are quick with the news.

858
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,980
It's our duty.

859
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,260
We may be just a small program,

860
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,260
but plastic surgery loans are no small matter.

861
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,170
Since we filmed it,

862
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,380
we have a responsibility to tell the public the truth.

863
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,980
I hope you understand.

864
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,460
We're just doing our job.

865
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,900
Oh, you've misunderstood, Ms. Guo.

866
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,490
I'm a very straightforward person.

867
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,650
If it's our responsibility, we own up to it.

868
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,380
So, if you captured footage of Dr. Qiao's patient

869
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,210
getting a plastic surgery loan,

870
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,260
then go ahead and air it.

871
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,210
So what you're saying is...

872
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,460
I just hope that once it's aired, that'll be the end of it.

873
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,050
There's no need to keep spreading it further, right?

874
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,130
Please show some mercy.

875
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,170
Don't let one doctor's mistake

876
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,530
affect the entire hospital.

877
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,940
Just one mistake?

878
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,130
That's why I came to see you.

879
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,260
Quick on the news, huh?

880
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,260
I know you filmed a lot

881
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,010
at our hospital,

882
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,940
and interviewed many people.

883
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,900
But a lot of that wasn't with my approval.

884
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,740
Our contract with the hospital states very clearly,

885
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,740
our interviews don't require your approval.

886
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,380
Then can I at least know

887
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,260
exactly what interviews and footage you've recorded?

888
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,130
Back when Du Jun was the hospital director,

889
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,610
a similar case had already happened once.

890
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,900
And it was handled by Qing,

891
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,460
who works under you.

892
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,260
But that was so long ago.

893
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,940
Who said this?

894
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,260
All I can say is,

895
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,260
it was someone from your team,

896
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,690
they mentioned it during an interview.

897
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:58,380
Running a hospital is really not easy.

898
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,490
Can we not air this?

899
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,050
Are you joking with me?

900
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,090
Well then,

901
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,650
let me show you something too.

902
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,010
My colleague

903
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,740
happened to take a few pictures.

904
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,490
She said her favorite idol

905
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,490
is dating someone.

906
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,740
And when I looked at the photo,

907
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,210
isn't the other person you?

908
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:23,940
I thought to myself,

909
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,050
that's impossible.

910
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,690
You have a family,

911
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,690
how could you make such a mistake?

912
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:32,900
Is this you?

913
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,570
So it seems,

914
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,460
Li Qi is really concerned about the plastic surgery loans issue.

915
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,130
She's put in quite a lot of effort.

916
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,570
And she wants to suppress the story.

917
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,980
I'm telling you,

918
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,610
I won't allow that to happen.

919
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,570
Then let's keep digging.
