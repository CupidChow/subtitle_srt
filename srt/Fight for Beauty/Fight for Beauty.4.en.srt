1
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,100
Here, here.

2
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,770
Please take a seat.

3
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,100
Hi.

4
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,930
Come, this way please.

5
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,540
Tell Mr. Liu later that

6
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,130
we wanna have a meal with him.

7
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,540
They even got a countdown for us.

8
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,020
What a show.

9
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,740
People may think we are defusing bombs.

10
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,980
Yeah, the bomb is under the bed.

11
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,770
If we haven't finished it in 3 hours,

12
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,180
we are screwed.

13
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,690
Ready?

14
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,620
I'm always ready.

15
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,060
Just mind yourself.

16
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,060
Stay back.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,660
Let's do this.

18
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,780
Remove the suture.

19
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,260
She is good.

20
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,010
When Dr. Qiao tutored us,

21
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,940
she won our hearts with one surgery.

22
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,540
She was doing it very fast.

23
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,940
Fast like a flash.

24
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,100
Before you know it, it's already done.

25
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,060
So we got her a nickname.

26
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,290
Speed doctor.

27
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,220
You hear that? Speed doctor.

28
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,690
48 minutes.

29
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,340
That's the new record.

30
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,820
Nothing to brag about.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,820
Just the basics.

32
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,890
Keep it for 5 minutes.

33
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,500
Then we will continue.

34
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,410
All media members and experts.

35
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,540
The surgery becomes quite boring now.

36
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,890
Let's have Dr. Wei

37
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,260
to introduce

38
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,500
this surgery to us.

39
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,820
Well.

40
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,500
The W-plasty

41
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,410
which transforms a linear scar

42
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,610
into a zigzag shape

43
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,260
disperses and reduces the skin tension

44
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,850
on both sides of the scar,

45
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,980
making it less conspicuous.

46
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,730
Well done.

47
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,100
Just meet the deadline.

48
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,930
That's incredible.

49
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,780
Dr. Lu.

50
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,700
You see.

51
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,700
You are her student.

52
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,250
But it doesn't mean you are also good.

53
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,290
Why did you get so proud?

54
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,700
Proud of my teacher, of course.

55
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,170
You did well.

56
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,170
Basics. Like you said.

57
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,220
That spacing is a bit wide.

58
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,660
Is that your eye problem or something?

59
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,460
Dear experts.

60
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,700
There is a second-phase surgery.

61
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,810
What time is it?

62
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,410
It'll be finished by Zhou Jingwen alone.

63
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,170
Bud-shaped breast lift.

64
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,930
You are still here.

65
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,140
Is she awake?

66
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,020
Not yet.

67
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,170
Just let her sleep 20 more minutes.

68
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,850
She needs mental comfort now.

69
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,140
You are really considerate.

70
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,410
With so many scars on her,

71
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,170
you still opt for abdominoplasty.

72
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,050
Her body is already under great burden.

73
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,610
Even if you are going to perform breast augmentation,

74
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,540
you should at least finish it in two surgeries.

75
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,700
You are lucy that

76
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,220
she is still fine now.

77
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,370
Sure I'm lucky.

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,980
If you haven't finished yours so fast,

79
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,020
my job can't be finished

80
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,610
that successfully.

81
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,340
Thank you.

82
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,050
I just think today is the best chance.

83
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,810
If I have told you in advance,

84
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,780
you will surely reject my idea.

85
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,020
Of course I will.

86
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,980
And I think it's completely unnecessary.

87
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,810
Besides,

88
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,220
it's not the reason why you can mess with me.

89
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,290
How is it unnecessary.

90
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,780
Have you just noticed her breast?

91
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,170
Her breasts are both flat and saggy.

92
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,370
Her husband asked to feed children breast milk only.

93
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,370
No other artificial milk should be used.

94
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,250
So she just fed the two kids with breast milk

95
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,850
until they turned 5.

96
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,930
Do you think I could say no to her?

97
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,930
She thinks that breast augmentation can make her more confident.

98
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,220
She has the right to be beautiful.

99
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,100
So

100
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,020
nice boobs

101
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,660
can make her find herself

102
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,810
and start a new life, right?

103
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,730
I have to say that

104
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,290
you know your patients better than me.

105
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,100
But have you ever contemplated that

106
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,460
who has made

107
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,540
the standard of beauty you uphold.

108
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,980
What is Jiang Rong doing all these for?

109
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,410
We have worked with the orthopedics department

110
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,900
to perform an urgent surgery last night,

111
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,850
and successfully saved his arm.

112
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,100
Ms. Liu complimented Zhangyan especially

113
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,250
for his quick reaction

114
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,780
and perfect operation plans.

115
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,220
It's quite impressive for a fresh attending doctor.

116
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,340
Qin and Jiang.

117
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,460
You guys have to work harder.

118
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,530
Come on.

119
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,700
What has just happened?

120
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,770
Ms. Qiao offered the plan

121
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,420
for yesterday's surgery.

122
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,220
And he was also handling

123
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,340
the tricky cases recently.

124
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,770
There are too many criticisms.

125
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,730
How could a doctor perform a surgery like this?

126
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,490
The next comment is even worse.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,850
How could a mother

128
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,940
who has just lost her child do this?

129
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,100
Stop reading it. I will read it myself.

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,730
Director.

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,980
Why are these people

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,460
critisizing Gemu online?

133
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,650
Like they have agreed in advance.

134
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,300
The few comments on the surgery itself

135
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,220
are flooded by these critics.

136
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,370
What's going on?

137
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,650
What is Du Jun doing recently?

138
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,460
I don't know.

139
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,420
I will find out.

140
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,610
Is this anything to do with Mr. Du?

141
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,300
The surgery itself has gained compliments

142
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,100
from experts and media.

143
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,300
Though there are some disputes about Jiang Rong,

144
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,850
it's not like it's one - sided.

145
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,100
It's obvious that someone is behind it.

146
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,940
Contact the media ASAP.

147
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,850
Ok.

148
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,370
Will Jiang Rong attend it?

149
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,980
No.

150
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,820
I really feel bad

151
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,060
when you criticize me so hard.

152
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,100
I have already asked for your suggestion before.

153
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,610
Really?

154
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,180
It seems that

155
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,770
it's more of a notice.

156
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,650
You have performed too many surgeries in other hospitals

157
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,100
in just two weeks.

158
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,940
Why are you still staying here?

159
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,530
You can go work in other hospital.

160
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,580
Director.

161
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,340
I swear you have approved all my requests in person.

162
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,370
And I have made it quite clear.

163
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,850
Patient Jiang Rong.

164
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,580
Stop playing your petty tricks.

165
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,100
How could I know

166
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,340
you could gather so much attention.

167
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,300
I have made myself very clear that

168
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,370
surgeries like these

169
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,010
must ask for my advice first.

170
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,370
That's right.

171
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,370
It's my fault for not being specific.

172
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,010
Calm down.

173
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,490
I'm so sorry.

174
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,890
But you are also responsible for this.

175
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,460
Why?

176
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,010
If you haven't suspended my job,

177
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,700
I won't perform surgeries in other hospitals.

178
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,220
I just wanna do my job.

179
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,370
Then you deserve it.

180
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,890
You should know that

181
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,850
many people here are not pleased with you.

182
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,580
They said that I was favoring you.

183
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,610
Don't act willfully

184
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,100
just because you have a great major.

185
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,130
You will suffer a loss.

186
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,580
Have you seen the comments

187
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,700
left on the official account of our hospital?

188
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,850
They said that doctors in the Third Hospital have no bottom line.

189
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,730
They can do everything for money.

190
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,940
Is that you?

191
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,250
Of course not.

192
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,490
I'm performing formal surgeries.

193
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,130
I'll be responsible for any mistake in surgery.

194
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,890
But how can I control

195
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,940
that many people on the Internet.

196
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,850
Fine.

197
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,580
I have told you everything.

198
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,980
Don't do anything stupid again.

199
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,130
You should focus on being the director of the hair center.

200
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,300
I won't approve any of your proposals.

201
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,370
Director.

202
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,610
Director.

203
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,250
Director.

204
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,100
Well.

205
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,100
You are doing well.

206
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,610
You can remove the suture soon.

207
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,220
Don't touch it now.

208
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,610
Or the wound may be infected.

209
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,340
Will that be too tight?

210
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,490
Take her phone away.

211
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,530
I will keep your phone temporarily.

212
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,490
Just have more rest.

213
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,940
I'll take care of public opinions online.

214
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,650
Don't worry.

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,220
Just get more rest.

216
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,340
Hello.

217
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,300
I'm on my way.

218
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,460
I will check on you later.

219
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,420
Thank you Ms. Zhou.

220
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,730
Fine. I'm on my way.

221
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,460
Kids with a mom are so happy.

222
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,980
I saw Xin yesterday.

223
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,420
She is so thoughtful.

224
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,820
She knows everything,

225
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,180
but she still pretends to be strong,

226
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,010
acting like an adult.

227
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,650
She asked me

228
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,890
why people online criticized you.

229
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,820
I had a kid before.

230
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,130
But she came at the wrong time.

231
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,940
When I knew that I was pregnant,

232
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,890
that man has abandoned us.

233
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,010
I hated this kid at that time,

234
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,940
and have thought many times that

235
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,460
I should have the abortion.

236
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,940
But

237
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,460
I decided to keep her anyway.

238
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,130
Doctor asked me to take folic acid.

239
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,060
So I took it everyday.

240
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,420
It only costs several dollars each in the hospital.

241
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,610
But I went to buy the most expensive one somewhere else.

242
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,770
It costs 86 yuan each.

243
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,730
I can still remember that now.

244
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,820
86 yuan each.

245
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,890
That was the total cost of my meal for a whole week.

246
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,650
But I lost her anyway.

247
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,460
In my 7th month of pregnancy, my doctor told me that

248
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,770
the baby was growing bad, and we may need induce you.

249
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,250
It was then I came to know that

250
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,490
induced labor is just like giving birth to a baby.

251
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,980
There were contractions

252
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,890
and labor pains,

253
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,580
and I had to lie on the delivery bed,

254
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,300
crying and shouting, to give birth to the baby.

255
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,340
It was a baby girl.

256
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,460
I have thought many times later that

257
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,100
is that because

258
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,650
I wanted to give up on her before.

259
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,940
She just knew it,

260
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,420
so she left me.

261
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,340
I'm so regretful now.

262
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,250
Why should I be so weak that

263
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,940
I could even give up on myself

264
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,250
and my kid

265
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,980
for others' leaving.

266
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,940
From that moment on, I told myself that

267
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,340
I have to be strong.

268
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,420
I won't change myself for anyone else now.

269
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,620
Moms are all the same.

270
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,220
No matter how hard the situation is,

271
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,250
how weak we are,

272
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,490
or how much pressure we have,

273
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,770
we will try our best to protect our kids.

274
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,420
You can talk to me anytime you want.

275
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,490
Have a good rest.

276
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:40,940
Ms. Li.

277
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,700
You are so impressive.

278
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,140
I have never heard these before.

279
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,660
That's how to do consultation.

280
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,660
You always ask me

281
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,530
how to take down clients.

282
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,220
That's sympathy.

283
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,770
You have to know that

284
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,250
we are all the same in nature.

285
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,090
I don't understand.

286
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,570
How could we be the same?

287
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,660
There are good people, and bad people.

288
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,980
People are just different.

289
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,730
Human nature is like a cup of cocktail.

290
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,420
Kindness, evil,

291
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,770
optimisim and negativism

292
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,290
are all components of a person.

293
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,290
Everyone owns these four parts.

294
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,980
What's different is

295
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,810
the percentage of each part

296
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,660
in different people.

297
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,980
All you need to know is

298
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,380
which part is she short of.

299
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,860
Of what?

300
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,660
Of love, you silly.

301
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,220
You have to find the softest place in her heart,

302
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,730
and give it a gentle touch.

303
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,330
Next time when you see each other,

304
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,090
you will be best friends.

305
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,770
I didn't find her.

306
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,010
Then let's wait a little longer.

307
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,810
She must know I'll be discharged today.

308
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,250
Ting, Let's go.

309
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,810
She has helped us with medical insurance,

310
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,050
saving us a lot of money.

311
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,090
That's quite enough.

312
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,810
She doesn't have to be here today.

313
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,180
We will come back for second examination.

314
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,330
Dr. Qiao works here.

315
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,330
We are sure to meet her someday.

316
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,220
Sir.

317
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,420
We are coming.

318
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,570
Where is your car?

319
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,660
The front gate?

320
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,010
Ok, I'm on my way.

321
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,010
Thank you.

322
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,490
Ting.

323
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,490
Ting.

324
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,570
Stop looking around. Just go.

325
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,290
The car is ready.

326
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,860
The driver is waiting.

327
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,490
That's the general process.

328
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,770
Hello, Ms.

329
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,730
Let me help you pin this microphone.

330
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,530
Ok.

331
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,770
Thank you.

332
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,980
Why do you bring her here?

333
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,810
Ms. Zhou.

334
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,220
I asked to be here.

335
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,290
I wanna clarify it myself. Is that ok?

336
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,050
Ms. Li.

337
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,660
She has never done this before.

338
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,420
What she said may be used by others against her,

339
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,860
causing more abuses online.

340
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,140
We have talked about it before we get here.

341
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,570
I have asked her some questions.

342
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,770
She answered quite well.

343
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,010
She will be fine.

344
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,570
In terms of work, I can follow your order

345
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,250
even if we share different opinions,

346
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,530
but for my patients.

347
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,250
I don't wanna hide anymore.

348
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,250
I wanna stand out

349
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,090
to protect Xin.

350
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,860
It's ok.

351
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,980
If you don't answer the question,

352
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,490
just leave it to me.

353
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:55,860
No.

354
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,660
Say anything you want.

355
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,530
Every audience and friend on the spot,

356
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,980
and every friend in front of the screen,

357
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,860
it's great to see you.

358
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,050
Here is Medical 1+1.

359
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,250
Jiang Rong, the victim

360
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,250
of the domestic violence homicide case

361
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,010
was caught in media storm

362
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,490
for accepting plastic surgery.

363
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,980
Today, we are fortunate enough to have

364
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,290
Ms. Jiang Rong and

365
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,220
her attending doctor Zhou Jingwen here.

366
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,420
Now, let's welcome them

367
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,460
with our applause.

368
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,530
Actually, from where I'm sitting,

369
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,420
I could see clearly that

370
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,330
the scars on the forehead

371
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,330
are gone.

372
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,860
But after reading the files,

373
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,010
we can know that scars on other parts

374
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,700
are still quite obvious.

375
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,290
Yes.

376
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,330
As a plastic surgeon,

377
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,860
I hope after each surgery,

378
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,860
the patients can have a perfect look.

379
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,180
But it's a pity that

380
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,570
on this regard,

381
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,660
we can't make it with current medical techniques.

382
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,660
But you can make it

383
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,730
with your beauty camera.

384
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,980
Actually, scar marks the beginning of a new life,

385
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,290
which may need some time.

386
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,530
Moving forward. We will use laser

387
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,460
to help her get rid of these scars.

388
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,090
You can follow up our surgery process

389
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,140
through our official website

390
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,860
and official account.

391
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,460
You are all welcome to witness the miracle.

392
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,330
Thank you for your sharing.

393
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,980
Thank you.

394
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,620
Now, let's ask Ms. Jiang Rong some questions.

395
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,660
Don't worry.

396
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,490
Take it easy.

397
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,290
I heard that you are here today

398
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,330
because you have something

399
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,250
to tell all the audiences.

400
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,050
Now, you own the stage.

401
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,620
Please.

402
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,380
It's ok. Take your time.

403
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,770
It's ok.

404
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,290
For the plastic surgery you have done,

405
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,290
we have already discussed about it

406
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,730
on the Internet.

407
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,140
Though most of them

408
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,420
are negative comments.

409
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,010
I'm sorry.

410
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,380
I wanna ask you a question.

411
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,290
Since you are all concerned about this news,

412
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,940
then do you know

413
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,620
the name of her husband,

414
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,620
the same man who has hurt her?

415
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,730
You don't even know his name.

416
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,140
But you know very well of

417
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,330
his character, job

418
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,900
and the real relation between him and the kid.

419
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,330
Nowadays,

420
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,420
few people care about truth.

421
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,860
And these photos here

422
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,420
are the truth I have seen with my own eyes.

423
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,570
I have no idea

424
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,140
how would the so-called Sherlock Holmes on the Internet

425
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,380
will perceive this fact.

426
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,050
But I do know that

427
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,940
these photos represent tragedy.

428
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,250
I know many people are sending bullet screens now,

429
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,660
saying words like "stop claiming to be the victim".

430
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,700
"We want truth"

431
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,050
and "Let Jiang Rong do the talking".

432
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,860
Please rest assured.

433
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,980
Now Jiang Rong will tell you the truth.

434
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,140
All right. All people here

435
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,770
please give her some applause.

436
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,250
Come on, Jiang Rong.

437
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,980
Come on.

438
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,770
I wanna say,

439
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,980
I'm so sorry.

440
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,250
Though Ms. Zhou asked me not to say that,

441
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,940
I still wanna say it today.

442
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,940
I wanna say sorry

443
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,730
to my daughter, Xin,

444
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,380
and my son, Fei.

445
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,380
I'm so sorry.

446
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,410
If your mom was not that weak,

447
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,740
if your mom has never trusted

448
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,540
that bastard,

449
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,620
my dear boy will just be alive now.

450
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,490
Now,

451
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,490
I believe

452
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,380
all people can see through the act.

453
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,620
We need to know the truth.

454
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,700
So let's give Jiang Rong

455
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,770
more encouragement.

456
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,460
Well, I.

457
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,220
I'll, from this day on,

458
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,380
say sorry no more

459
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,290
for the mistake of others.

460
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,220
I wanna

461
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,180
live happily

462
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,900
for the people I love.

463
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,420
I wanna live happily

464
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,860
for myself.

465
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,420
Dr. Qiao.

466
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,050
(I know you have helped me with hospitalization expenses.)

467
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,460
(I wanna thank you in person.)

468
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,290
(But I couldn't find you.)

469
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,050
(My brother told me that.)

470
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,530
(you are transferred to the hair department.)

471
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,220
(You won't perform surgeries in the plastic surgery department.)

472
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,330
(I was timid in nature.)

473
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,090
(But thanks to you,)

474
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,090
(I couldn't never imagine that)

475
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,810
(I could be so bold.)

476
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,700
(What I wanna say is that)

477
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,530
(even if the surgery failed,)

478
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,660
(I will never regret it.)

479
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,810
(Were it not for that surgery,)

480
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,730
(nothing will change.)

481
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,460
(That tumor will haunt me)

482
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,900
(for the rest of my life.)

483
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,700
(But I have got rid of it now.)

484
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,330
(I'm really grateful to you.)

485
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,980
(For you,)

486
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,980
(it may just be a risky surgery.)

487
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,980
(But for me,)

488
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,860
(it's like a rebirth,)

489
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,770
For me,

490
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,700
it's not just a surgery, either.

491
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,730
Our future

492
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,810
will both change because of it.

493
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,420
Thank you.

494
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,140
Bye.

495
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,090
Ok.

496
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,290
I didn't hear anything.

497
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,050
Take this back.

498
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,940
Don't be upset because I'm strict with you,

499
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,660
and criticize you all the time.

500
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,490
You have wonderful talent.

501
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,900
I don't wanna see your talent ruined.

502
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,180
Everyone has to go through this.

503
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,940
When I was young, I was just like you,

504
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,290
despising everyone

505
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,980
because I have the best major.

506
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,330
After all these troubles

507
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,940
and countless obstacles,

508
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,530
I have finally made it to today's position.

509
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,770
We are just discussing about the excellent staff today.

510
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,250
I mentioned you.

511
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,140
When I recruited you,

512
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,980
I have received countless oppositions.

513
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,290
You are the first one in our department

514
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,980
to be the senior chief physician at such a young age.

515
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,290
I appreciate the justice and fairness of you.

516
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,660
I'm the best here.

517
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,380
I know.

518
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,700
You are the only girl in our department.

519
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,220
I really hope you can be something,

520
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,090
and bring honor to us female doctors.

521
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,090
In my heart,

522
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,570
I have always treated as my own daughter.

523
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,980
To be honest,

524
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,490
if you were my daughter,

525
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,250
I will be scolded already.

526
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,050
You can still do that now.

527
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,050
Do you have any idea

528
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,620
how many graduates there are this year,

529
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,180
and how many people wanna work here?

530
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,900
They are pulling wires and doing everything they can,

531
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,250
but they don't stand a chance.

532
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,810
Look at you now.

533
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,140
You should be satisfied.

534
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,050
I have just suspended your work.

535
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,490
That's not a big deal.

536
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,860
How couldn't you just stand that?

537
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,090
What I am doing to you

538
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,860
is just temporary.

539
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,860
You just need to put up with it a little longer.

540
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,460
I promise I will get you back to your position.

541
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,570
You do understand that, right?

542
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,770
Ms. Li.

543
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,660
Have you ever noticed the trees downstairs?

544
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,660
What trees?

545
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,220
The trees downstairs

546
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,010
were planted when this building was constructed.

547
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,620
When we just got here,

548
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,090
they were just the height of a person.

549
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,490
But look at them now,

550
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,860
they are almost as tall as this building.

551
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,180
Even trees are changing everyday,

552
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,010
but I'm still staying in this office,

553
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,620
standing here and looking at them.

554
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,090
Let me tell you something.

555
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,700
Take a long-term perspective to view the world.

556
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,420
How much longer do you think I can stay in this position?

557
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,050
Put up with it.

558
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,140
We have got life to live.

559
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,050
Even in your position,

560
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,780
you can only see these trees as well.

561
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,860
If I'm content with the status quo,

562
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,330
then for all my life,

563
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,330
I could just sit there, watching the trees and sipping tea.

564
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,010
I can even picture

565
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,010
what my retirement life is like.

566
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,810
Isn't that good?

567
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,570
Yeah.

568
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,180
That's good.

569
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,490
But it's not what I want.

570
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,700
What you have just said

571
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,250
I have experienced these years.

572
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,530
To be honest,

573
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,530
I want a different life.

574
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,010
You only know that I like performing surgery.

575
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,980
But the reason why I choose to be a plastic surgeon

576
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,220
is that I like challenge and change.

577
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,140
If not so,

578
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,900
I will just follow my dad's will

579
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,460
to work in general surgery department.

580
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,330
All I need to do is do my work right.

581
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,570
Patients won't care.

582
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,090
Safety comes first.

583
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,940
What are you talking about?

584
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,180
You have a bright future.

585
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,140
What happened to you?

586
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,700
Can't this hospital satisfy you?

587
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,730
What do you really want?

588
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,180
Maybe I'm insane.

589
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,660
Anyway.

590
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,010
I wil never forget

591
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,420
the time I have spent here.

592
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,180
Thank you.

593
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,890
Ms. Zhou.

594
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,620
Ms. Li, what's the matter?

595
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,970
Have you seen the news?

596
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,290
The interview of Jiang Rong was a great success.

597
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,460
You and Jiang Rong

598
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,650
should get some time for our fellow program.

599
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,180
Many people wanna see it.

600
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,970
Forget about Jiang Rong.

601
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,810
I have promised her that no disturbance after the interview.

602
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,740
Don't. Come on.

603
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,260
Dear, you told me that

604
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,420
we need more publicity.

605
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,900
And it's the perfect time for that.

606
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,170
Who asks you to put this on the wall?

607
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,170
Well.

608
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,660
What's going on?

609
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,340
You see.

610
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,860
Though the surgery of Jiang Rong was a great success,

611
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,260
you promised me that

612
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,380
you will join us.

613
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,780
Dear, don't worry.

614
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,740
I have already discussed with Tang that

615
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,610
the new department will be centered on you.

616
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,490
Jinsong will work for you.

617
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,050
Will that do?

618
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,420
Ms. Li.

619
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,570
You are too hasty.

620
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,380
If I haven't made it wrong that

621
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,170
isn' t there still 5 days left?

622
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,090
If there is nothing achieved in these 5 days,

623
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,900
I will handle that myself.

624
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,530
Ms. Li.

625
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,650
Shall we continue?

626
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,050
Put it back.

627
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,170
Ok.

628
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,610
What's that?

629
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,610
It's already 8:40 now.

630
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,940
I'm late for work.

631
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,460
When you asked me out yesterday,

632
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,610
you just told me you have resigned.

633
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,570
Come on. Sleep a little longer.

634
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,650
I have resigned.

635
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,210
Tea or coffee?

636
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,820
Whatever.

637
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,650
Why do you get up that early?

638
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,610
I woke up at 6:30.

639
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,490
And I have worked out and done some running

640
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,460
and also had some buffet.

641
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,610
How could you get up that early

642
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,740
after drinking a lot last night?

643
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,090
You even went for a run and worked out.

644
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,460
Wouldn't you be too energetic

645
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,300
to be a doctor?

646
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,780
You see, that's our difference.

647
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,610
You devote yourself to work

648
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,820
while I to my life.

649
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,090
You are really proud of it, right.

650
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,860
It was not me

651
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,980
who fell asleep right away

652
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,570
after saying he is drowsy.

653
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,690
Did I snore?

654
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,820
You look so pretty when you are sleeping.

655
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,170
And you didn't snore.

656
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,690
You look pretty, too.

657
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,740
It's my Wechat.

658
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,940
Let me check it.

659
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,090
Just one minute.

660
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,050
Fine, I will fall for that.

661
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,460
It's not like that.

662
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:26,740
Ten.

663
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,380
Nine.

664
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,130
-Eight. -Oh, no.

665
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,740
What?

666
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,210
My dad's daughter is getting married today.

667
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,650
Your dad's daughter?

668
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,740
Well, that's too fast.

669
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,050
It's so bold of you.

670
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,690
There is something bolder.

671
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,210
What is that?

672
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,740
Attend the wedding ceremony with me.

673
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,210
Twenty-eight.

674
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,820
Come on.

675
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,530
Twenty-nine.

676
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,090
Come on. We have finished it.

677
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,980
He can't even do one push-up

678
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,530
even in the gym.

679
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,530
Right, just open the door.

680
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,820
Groom.

681
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,740
Groom.

682
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,860
You have to stop it.

683
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,940
The guests have arrived.

684
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,860
Please hurry up.

685
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,490
Hurry up.

686
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,490
There is nothing I can do about it.

687
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,340
Come on.

688
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,130
Let's go harder.

689
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,420
Let's get it done in 10 minutes.

690
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,050
Come on.

691
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,490
How about now?

692
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,380
We don't have time now.

693
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,210
They are trying to break in.

694
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,420
Let me see.

695
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,130
Wait.

696
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,260
We don't have time now.

697
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,860
Calm down.

698
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,010
How could it be even worse?

699
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,380
You live here?

700
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,460
Or what? Should I live in the street?

701
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,900
Why do you always answer with another question?

702
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,090
Can't you just answer me?

703
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,650
Qiao Yang.

704
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,340
Lu Ziyou.

705
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,210
Director.

706
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,210
What brings you here?

707
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,090
You are her boyfriend?

708
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,210
Not, we are just friend.

709
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,900
We are here to attend the wedding.

710
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,170
Why are you here?

711
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,380
There is something I need to tell her.

712
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,380
You have known each other a long time?

713
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,980
It depends on your definition of long.

714
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,210
Zhou Jingwen.

715
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,690
Come on in.

716
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,740
Wait here.

717
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,380
Don't go anywhere.

718
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,690
You have a nice house.

719
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,690
I give you 2 minutes.

720
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,900
What do you want?

721
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,010
I'm here to apologize.

722
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,610
You will leave the Third Hospital.

723
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,210
I think I'm to be blame.

724
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,650
It's my own decision.

725
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,740
It has nothing to do with the hospital.

726
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,860
That will be great.

727
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,940
Congratulations. You are free now.

728
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,940
Have you ever thought of

729
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,860
working in Gemu.

730
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,690
No.

731
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,690
Chunsheng loves it.

732
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,980
Yang loves it.

733
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,090
I know the Maikun medical institution

734
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,300
and the plastic surgery association hospital

735
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,210
are all recruiting you.

736
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,050
You wanna go abroad

737
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,690
to learn new techniques

738
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,740
and to challenge yourself.

739
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,570
Indeed, the foreign technology is ahead of ours by a few years.

740
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,570
But in light of the potential of Chinese market,

741
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,740
we will catch up very soon,

742
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,610
Then it will be hard for you to come back.

743
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:36,940
I'm sorry.

744
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,300
I have never thought of working

745
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,530
in a private hospital.

746
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,170
And you are not the best one

747
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,050
in all private hospitals.

748
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,420
Sure, Gemu is not the best one

749
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,650
in all private hospitals.

750
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,170
But we are the only hospital that was granted a Level IV license.

751
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,050
Except the Third Hospital,

752
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,420
we

753
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,090
performed most of the surgeries,

754
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,740
accouting for 20% of the market.

755
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,210
You mean before.

756
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,340
How many doctors are left now in surgery department?

757
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,570
I don't deny it.

758
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,820
Sure, Du Jun left

759
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,210
with another 3 top doctors.

760
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,420
We are in a bad condition now.

761
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,130
So that's why

762
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,980
I don't wanna work there.

763
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,610
You guys are too calculating.

764
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,650
Qiao Yang.

765
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,740
If you can join us,

766
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,650
we will fulfill whatever condition you give.

767
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,010
Please consider it.

768
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,050
Are you done?

769
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,570
Wearing black is not suitable for the wedding.

770
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,090
Hello.

771
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,610
Dr. Zhou.

772
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,490
Please help me.

773
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,010
I am so regretful for not listening to your advice.

774
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,210
Calm down.

775
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,460
Turn on the camera, so I can see you.

776
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,340
How could this happen?

777
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,380
Did you get Botox or hyaluronic acid injections?

778
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,380
Botox.

779
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,010
Specially designed for bride.

780
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,900
I took the last shot yesterday.

781
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,570
Oh you.

782
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,740
How could you do this before wedding?

783
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,570
Why don't you just ask me first?

784
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,420
You have to go to the hospital now.

785
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:09,740
No, I can't.

786
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,740
Lin is outside now.

787
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,530
I can't let him see me like this.

788
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,130
Where are you now?

789
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,570
Send me the address.

790
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,530
I will find you.

791
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,940
Kapping ski.

792
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,740
Wait me there.

793
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,210
Is this patient named Wang Qi?

794
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,460
Tong Jiaxu.

795
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,900
Is the wedding ceremony you are to attend

796
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,210
held in Kapping ski?

797
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,570
Sorry, I can't give a ride.

798
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,170
Jiaxu.

799
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,170
Tong Jiaxu, open the door.

800
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,170
If you don't open it, I will break in.

801
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,900
Don't do that.

802
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,860
There must be it.

803
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,090
Jiaxu.

804
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,210
Dr. Zhou.

805
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,610
Here.

806
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,940
If you feel wronged, you can tell me.

807
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,900
Open the door first.

808
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,260
Open the door now.

809
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,860
Come on.

810
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,650
Tong Jiaxu.

811
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,420
Open the door.

812
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,380
Dr. Zhou.
