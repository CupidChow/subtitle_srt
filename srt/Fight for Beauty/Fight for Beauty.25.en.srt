1
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,770
Back to the hospital?

2
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,460
Yeah.

3
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,540
New doctors have joined recently.

4
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,290
I have to go check on them.

5
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,690
Li Qi's livestream yesterday really made waves.

6
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,740
I checked Douyin this morning,

7
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,740
so many people were talking about it.

8
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,490
Look, thirteen discussions so far.

9
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,330
Even though no one besides Li Qi

10
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,980
called out names directly,

11
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,820
everyone knows they're talking about Gemu.

12
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,740
They're spreading nonsense, saying Qiao Yang was arrested,

13
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,610
Gemu was shut down,

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,690
even claiming that a patient died on the operating table.

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,100
Ridiculous.

16
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,500
These marketing accounts

17
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,940
will say anything for traffic.

18
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,450
If you can recognize their tricks,

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,290
most people can too.

20
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,730
Stop worrying about this.

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,010
No,

22
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,850
I need to do a livestream too.

23
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,170
You? A livestream?

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,890
What's wrong with that?

25
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,290
Actually, not a bad idea.

26
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,730
A direct response,

27
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,450
right?

28
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,260
If you're going live, I'll join you.

29
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,940
You'll join me?

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,890
Do you even know how?

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,890
Nope.

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,340
But I've got an excellent teacher—you.

33
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,820
Alright then.

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,220
May holiday is coming up in a few days,

35
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,850
there'll be a Golden Week event.

36
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,540
We can use that to address everything.

37
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,610
How about we invite Xu Yuan

38
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,820
to join us on the livestream?

39
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,170
How's her eye recovery going?

40
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,010
Pretty well.

41
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,260
Her vision is at 0.2 now,

42
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,780
she has no issues with daily life.

43
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,660
But full recovery

44
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,060
will take some time.

45
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,060
Is Qiao Yang going back to the hospital today?

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,220
How's she doing?

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,820
Is it Qiao Yang?

48
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,220
I'm the chief editor of the Oxygen Aesthetics public account.

49
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,170
I'd like to interview you

50
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,890
about the recent liposuction case.

51
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,380
Do you have time?

52
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,410
Ms. Qiao,

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,220
they're serving poached fish in the cafeteria today!

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,380
I don't like fish.

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,340
Instant noodles again?

56
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,610
Come on, here,

57
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,380
let's get some side dishes.

58
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,170
Wait.

59
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,260
That's not how you prepare instant noodles.

60
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,730
You have to let the noodle block soften first

61
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,610
so it absorbs the flavor.

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,500
Let me teach you.

63
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,500
This year, Smile Train has started recruiting doctors.

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,410
Do you wanna join?

65
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,410
No time.

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,540
They're heading to

67
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,380
the mountainous areas of Sichuan and Guizhou this year.

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,170
And also Qianqiao.

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,170
Let's go see Qi Dacheng.

70
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,900
Thanks for your kindness,

71
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,340
but I'm not planning to run away from this.

72
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,340
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,700
Take a break,

74
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,410
go out for a bit,

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,610
relax.

76
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,730
Everyone keeps telling me

77
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,730
this was just an accident,

78
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,020
that it wasn't my fault.

79
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,170
But to me,

80
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,980
this whole situation is like this bowl of instant noodles.

81
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,140
No matter how you soak it,

82
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,540
the result is always the same.

83
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,580
I don't think so.

84
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,170
Perfect.

85
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,460
Sorry, Ms. Li.

86
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,660
Did you use to run a nightclub or something?

87
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,340
I never even touched the lighting setup.

88
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,140
Still making excuses?

89
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,140
You're lucky to even have this job.

90
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,540
Don't panic, Ms. Li.

91
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,340
Almost done!

92
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,140
Ms. Li, you called for me?

93
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,730
Redo her hairstyle.

94
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,610
Make it more mature,

95
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,140
something that gives people a sense of security.

96
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,930
Come here, dear.

97
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,050
Alright, everyone,

98
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,490
yesterday we talked about the liposuction incident at Gemu.

99
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,460
Today, we've prepared a special session on liposuction.

100
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,020
We have Wei Xiaoxi,a senior fat sculpting specialist

101
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,730
from Jiao Ai,

102
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,730
joining our livestream today

103
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,410
to discuss

104
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,100
how to safely and quickly achieve a "girl group" waistline.

105
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,370
Dr. Wei, over to you.

106
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,660
Hello, everyone.

107
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,900
I'm your abs magician, Wei Xiaoxi.

108
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,730
Not bad.

109
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,900
You've grown a lot while I was away.

110
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,050
Looks like you don't even need me to come back.

111
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,540
Don't say that!

112
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,460
I wasn't really eager to grow so fast,

113
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,460
it's much better with you guiding me.

114
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,410
Good to know.

115
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:25,980
Ms. Zhou,

116
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,780
we've confirmed the livestream schedule

117
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,580
for May Day evening with Xu Yuan.

118
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,250
I'm just a bit worried

119
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,850
that people will flood the chat with messages about Zhong Shunhua.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,580
A few comments are fine,

121
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,700
just keep an eye on the backend.

122
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,050
If it gets too out of hand, mute them.

123
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,290
Is anyone at Gemu talking about this?

124
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,780
It's okay, I guess.

125
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,660
The customers are discussing it more.

126
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,050
I heard from Mengyuan

127
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,810
that lately, a lot of customers are asking to switch doctors.

128
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,730
All of them are Ms. Qiao's patients.

129
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,370
I'm downstairs.

130
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,050
Wait for me.

131
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,660
I'll be right there.

132
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,540
Okay.

133
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,220
You're still keeping watch alone?

134
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,140
Where's the other guy?

135
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,930
He's been on the phone a lot, though.

136
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,050
Well,

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,170
that's his specialty.

138
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,170
That's how he managed to win over my mom.

139
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,220
Eat something.

140
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,900
I already ate.

141
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,220
I'll come in at six tomorrow morning.

142
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,220
You're actually a nice person,

143
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,980
but your skills aren't great.

144
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,050
Honestly, I don't know

145
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,700
where all that previous reputation came from.

146
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,020
Make sure you respond

147
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,980
to all the new contacts from today's livestream.

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,810
Sort out all the information.

149
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,700
No matter how late it gets,

150
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,370
send me a copy.

151
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,250
Got it, Ms. Li.

152
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,780
Wait a sec.

153
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,180
Fire that light guy.

154
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:33,850
Okay.

155
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,010
Ms. Li.,

156
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,460
if there's nothing else, I'll head out.

157
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,180
In a hurry?

158
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,890
Stay for a bit.

159
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,010
Alright.

160
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,730
Has your mentor contacted you?

161
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,580
No, we haven't talked recently.

162
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,530
I don't think she's in the mood either.

163
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,940
Honestly,

164
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,130
I'm really worried about Qiao Yang.

165
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,010
She's such a good doctor,

166
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,250
I'm afraid she won't be able to handle such a huge setback.

167
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,770
Plastic surgeons fear this kind of thing the most.

168
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,940
The impact on the industry is massive.

169
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,010
Yeah.

170
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,580
A few of my clients

171
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,890
already know about this

172
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,180
and have been asking me about it.

173
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,820
I admire her just as much as I admire you.

174
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,420
I've told you that before, haven't I?

175
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,700
Yes, you've said it many times.

176
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,060
And Ms. Li, you've always supported me.

177
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,060
I really appreciate it.

178
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,010
Young people

179
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,100
should create multiple paths

180
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,940
for themselves.

181
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,300
That's understandable.

182
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,980
But remember one thing,

183
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,340
there's only one path that truly leads somewhere.

184
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,220
The rest are dead ends.

185
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,130
Got it?

186
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,580
Thank you for the advice, Ms. Li.

187
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,460
I understand.

188
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,300
Advice?

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,420
The longer I stay in this field,

190
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,770
the more I realize

191
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,180
this industry belongs to young people like you.

192
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,370
Someday, I'll have to rely on you.

193
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,580
I don't know why, but I just believe in us.

194
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,940
I think this is the strongest team

195
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,300
I've ever had in my career.

196
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,460
Let's work hard together.

197
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,610
Alright, I got it, Ms. Li.

198
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,730
Then I'll head out now.

199
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:07,890
Here,

200
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,060
take this.

201
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,370
Thank you, Ms. Li.

202
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,700
Every time I come here,

203
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,980
I end up eating and taking stuff with me.

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,850
It's too spicy for me.

205
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,530
Just take it.

206
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,130
Thanks.

207
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,180
Alright, I'm leaving now.

208
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,420
Qing,

209
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,340
schedule another livestream

210
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,770
for me on May 1st.

211
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,220
Have you noticed?

212
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,420
Our clinic has been having a lot of issues lately.

213
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,850
Could it be bad feng shui?

214
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,820
Don't say nonsense.

215
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,370
Ms. Qiao has still been

216
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,700
seeing patients and doing treatments

217
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,770
as usual these days,

218
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,420
but she's completely

219
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,010
different from before.

220
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,300
Ms. Qiao

221
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,980
really took the fall for Ms. Meng this time.

222
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,370
Zhong Shunhua was originally her patient.

223
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,130
That's a massive burden to bear.

224
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,180
If it were me,

225
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,370
I'd be having nightmares.

226
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,980
Hello, Ms. Meng.

227
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,530
Ms. Meng.

228
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,420
Ms. Meng.

229
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,300
Dr. Lu,

230
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,420
have you seen Qiao Yang?

231
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,820
I just went to her office, but she wasn't there.

232
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,980
She had something to do and took the afternoon off.

233
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,060
Is she okay?

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,130
She doesn't look okay.

235
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,820
I've never seen her like this before.

236
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,370
Someone with so much pride,

237
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,420
how could she accept something like this so easily?

238
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,490
Honestly, this isn't entirely her fault.

239
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,370
I bear some responsibility too.

240
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,220
If I hadn't taken leave, things might have been different.

241
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,530
She already had her own full schedule,

242
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,010
but she still took on all of mine.

243
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,460
That's way beyond her limit.

244
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,490
Situations like this

245
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,980
are the sword of Damocles hanging over every doctor.

246
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,850
This time, it just happened to fall on Qiao Yang.

247
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,220
There's nothing she can do.

248
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,940
It smells so good.

249
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,300
The roses are blooming.

250
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,730
Even in a moment like this,

251
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,770
I can still smell the flowers.

252
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,300
I feel so sorry for my mom.

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,130
If I had known it would turn out like this,

254
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,100
I would have stopped her no matter what.

255
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,370
I never would have let her get liposuction.

256
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,370
Everyone wants to stay young and beautiful forever.

257
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,890
That's understandable.

258
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,940
On the surface,

259
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,980
my mom got liposuction so she could wear a beautiful qipao

260
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,300
at my wedding

261
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,100
and look more compatible standing next to her younger husband.

262
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,580
But in reality...

263
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,650
She was trying to save her marriage.

264
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,370
It was because of Ze, right?

265
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,250
From an outsider's perspective,

266
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,530
our family owns mines,

267
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,010
so people assume my mom is wealthy.

268
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,530
They think she should have

269
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,220
all the control in her relationship.

270
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,460
At the beginning of their marriage,

271
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,530
that was true.

272
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,460
But over time, things changed.

273
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,100
Ze is still young, after all.

274
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,460
He's only a few years older than me.

275
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,180
He spends all his time out having fun and barely comes home.

276
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,650
My mom has been left begging for his attention.

277
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,420
Did you try to talk to her about it?

278
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,370
I did.

279
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,770
But she wouldn't listen.

280
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,220
She believed that everything happened

281
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,700
because she aged too quickly over the past few years.

282
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,420
So she thought surgery

283
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,820
could win Ze's heart back.

284
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,700
And in the end?

285
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,890
When she collapsed,

286
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,250
he didn't even want to be by her side.

287
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,010
She really didn't deserve this.

288
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,770
Are you still gonna have your wedding?

289
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,940
Luo said we should put it on hold for now.

290
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,130
We'll see how my mom's condition is first.

291
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,250
Anyway, no matter what happens,

292
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,420
it all depends on my mood.

293
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,100
He'll go along with whatever I decide.

294
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,530
At least your marriage is still worth it.

295
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,130
People only realize

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,530
who truly cares

297
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,060
about them

298
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,980
when they end up in the ICU.

299
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,460
You love your mother so much.

300
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,460
That means her life was worth it.

301
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,820
Actually,

302
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,010
when I was young, my mom and I didn't have a good relationship.

303
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,010
Back then, I was a teenager,

304
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,700
and she was busy building her business.

305
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,530
She worked day and night,

306
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,980
struggling to make a living.

307
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,530
Maybe that's why she was always so short-tempered.

308
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,060
So we were never really close.

309
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,650
It wasn't until I started working these past two years

310
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,850
that things finally got better between us.

311
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,220
A lot of mother-daughter relationships are like that.

312
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,300
Even if they spend a lifetime together,

313
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,340
they may never truly understand each other.

314
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,250
Is it the same for you?

315
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,650
How should I put it...

316
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,220
As kids,

317
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,610
we don't really care that much about our parents' stories.

318
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,820
My mom has been gone for thirteen years now.

319
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,580
Before she passed away,

320
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,420
one day, she suddenly told me

321
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,530
that she wanted to travel the world alone by boat.

322
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,370
Unfortunately, she never got the chance.

323
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,820
Yang,

324
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,220
do you really wanna get married,

325
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,340
or are you just doing it to make your mom me happy?

326
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,530
Why are we talking about this now?

327
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,530
You know...

328
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,130
I talked to your dad

329
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,220
about divorce many times.

330
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,530
When was this?

331
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,730
Back when

332
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,530
you were just a little kid.

333
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,650
We just couldn't communicate.

334
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,730
I loved watching movies,

335
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,100
but he would always fall asleep.

336
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,820
I'd be sitting there, tearing up,

337
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,130
and he'd be snoring away.

338
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,340
After a few times...

339
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,130
Typical dad.

340
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,730
He refused to go.

341
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,180
And those flowers...

342
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,660
Do you remember that butterfly orchid we had?

343
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,570
Yeah, I remember.

344
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,180
I've never seen that color again.

345
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,620
But it was too delicate.

346
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,010
After three or four years, it died.

347
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,180
Of course it died.

348
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:19,050
Your dad used the flowerpot as an ashtray.

349
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,860
He kept flicking cigarette ash into it every day.

350
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,330
Burned it to death.

351
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,900
Unbelievable.

352
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,730
I always wondered what happened to it.

353
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,620
Then he started flicking ash into the crabapple tree.

354
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,090
I caught him.

355
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,220
And guess what? He had a reason for it.

356
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,490
He said it kept shedding petals,

357
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,900
attracting bugs.

358
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,180
Didn't understand what was so nice about it.

359
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,770
He never liked flowers or plants.

360
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,010
Imagine living with someone like that for most of your life.

361
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,860
Must've been tough.

362
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,010
Back then, our family was struggling the most.

363
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,700
Your grandpa was being publicly humiliated every day.

364
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,810
So many of his students

365
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,660
cut ties with him.

366
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,940
They beat him until he was covered in blood.

367
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,140
Every time they attacked him,

368
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,620
your dad would stand in front of him, trying to shield him.

369
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,660
He got beaten up too.

370
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,810
Whenever I think about that,

371
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,570
I just can't bring myself to hate him.

372
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,530
That was the first time

373
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,490
I truly understood my mother.

374
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,530
And from that moment on,

375
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,700
our relationship changed.

376
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,980
Before that,

377
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,090
I was just a daughter who depended on her for everything.

378
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,660
After that,

379
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,140
I became a friend she could confide in.

380
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,660
Someone who truly understood her.

381
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,180
Have you ever dreamed about her?

382
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,530
No.

383
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,250
Not even once.

384
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,380
Maybe she's finally gone off

385
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,180
to all the places she wanted to visit.

386
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,460
All these years, I've often thought...

387
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,660
If heaven could give me another chance

388
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,140
to be her daughter,

389
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,180
I would make sure to help her fulfill her wishes

390
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,490
while she was still alive.

391
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,290
About skin booster injections,

392
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,220
we'll give you all

393
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,490
a detailed explanation in a bit.

394
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,660
But just a quick reminder,

395
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,700
for any beauty treatment,

396
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,290
don't just look at the price.

397
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,860
If you go for the cheapest option,

398
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,860
you might end up in trouble.

399
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,420
Also,

400
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,330
any medical procedure

401
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,050
must be done in a certified hospital

402
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,860
by a qualified doctor.

403
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,810
If you have any questions, ask now!

404
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,860
This is a rare opportunity.

405
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,810
Ms. Zhou will answer all your questions.

406
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,570
That's right!

407
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,770
Let me take a look...

408
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,570
A lot of people are asking about Zhong Shunhua.

409
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,860
I already

410
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,220
answered that earlier.

411
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,570
If you just joined, you can check the replay.

412
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,940
Oh, I see a comment saying,

413
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,180
"Dr. Zhou is so beautiful."

414
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,090
Well, what a coincidence.

415
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,090
I think so too!

416
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,010
Great minds

417
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,140
think alike!

418
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,250
Thank you.

419
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,090
Oh wow,

420
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,290
what's happening?

421
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,940
I was just checking comments,

422
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,140
and suddenly this turned into a PDA showcase!

423
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,010
Mr. Qin,

424
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,530
you can't just flaunt your love like this.

425
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,010
Aren't you gonna give her a kiss?

426
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,860
I didn't say that, by the way,

427
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,220
the comments are flooding in!

428
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,980
Kiss!

429
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,860
Kiss!

430
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,050
Kiss!

431
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,770
You got yourself into this.

432
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,660
You figure it out.

433
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,290
Mr. Qin,

434
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,570
Dr. Zhou agreed!

435
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,090
We're second on the beauty ranking now.

436
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,660
A kiss will push us to number one!

437
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,180
Come on, just one kiss!

438
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,380
Kiss!

439
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,660
Kiss!

440
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,810
Kiss!

441
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,420
Uh...

442
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,980
How about...

443
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,290
How about we do a giveaway instead?

444
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:48,940
Sound good?

445
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,530
We've prepared Gemu face masks

446
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,530
and vouchers for our treatments.

447
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,490
Now

448
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,330
type "Dr. Zhou is so beautiful" in the chat,

449
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,980
and we'll take a screenshot and pick a winner!

450
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,460
Did you hear that?

451
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,770
Mr. Qin is serious now.

452
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,980
Hurry up!

453
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,980
5,

454
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,900
4,

455
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,660
3,

456
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,490
2,

457
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,220
1!

458
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,900
Check and see if you're in!

459
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,860
I knew it.

460
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,180
Guess who's number one in beauty today?

461
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,730
Look.

462
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,860
Li Qi?

463
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,010
No wonder.

464
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,250
She's been targeting us in her live streams lately.

465
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,620
I bet she was the one who talked about

466
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,090
our divorce in her live stream.

467
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,860
Divorce?

468
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,980
You knew about it?

469
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,180
Yeah.

470
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,980
Wait, when did they get divorced?

471
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,010
How come I didn't know?

472
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,810
Around the time you broke up.

473
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,570
Back then...

474
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,220
No wonder.

475
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,010
Wait, how do you know I broke up?

476
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,380
Dr. Chen,

477
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,220
you seem pretty sharp,

478
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,330
yet you're the only one at Gemu

479
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,570
who didn't know about the divorce.

480
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,180
Where do you all hear this gossip from?

481
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,290
Not long after we started the live stream,

482
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,490
Jiao Ai showed up,

483
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,980
sticking to us like glue.

484
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,730
So many institutions are streaming at the same time,

485
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,090
yet she only has eyes for us.

486
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,770
They're so petty.

487
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,700
Did we lose followers?

488
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,860
No, actually.

489
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,700
The results exceeded expectations.

490
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,010
Then I don't get it.

491
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,770
What are they after?

492
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,810
Good thing people love shipping couples these days.

493
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,940
The BE aesthetic makes it even more appealing.

494
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,570
People are already starting to ship

495
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,380
the "divorced couple."

496
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,380
What's the BE aesthetic?

497
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,570
A bad ending.

498
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,180
But that doesn't apply to us.

499
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,730
At least we didn't have a bad ending, right?

500
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,490
I'm heading to the Third Hospital.

501
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,810
Thanks for today.

502
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,250
I'll send you red envelopes in the group later.

503
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,180
I'll give you a ride.

504
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,140
I'll go with you.

505
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,900
Alright.

506
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,180
I'll go upstairs and grab my bag.

507
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,980
Thank you.

508
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,700
Where do you all usually gossip?

509
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,940
Can you include me next time?

510
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:12,980
Sure.

511
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,180
But first, you need to buy a membership card.

512
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,660
Pack everything up.

513
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,570
What are you thinking about?

514
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,730
I still feel like something's off.

515
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,940
About the live stream.

516
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,420
You mean...

517
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,770
Li Qi?

518
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,530
She revealed our divorce.

519
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,530
That just gave Gemu free traffic.

520
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,250
That doesn't seem like something Li Qi would do.

521
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,180
Has Tang contacted you?

522
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,810
Now that you mention it...

523
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,620
I sent him a WeChat message two days ago,

524
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,770
but he never replied.

525
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,620
Do you think this has something to do

526
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,660
with Tang?

527
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,810
I don't know.

528
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,250
I just feel like something's not right.

529
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,810
Mr. Huang!

530
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,330
Why is he in such a rush?

531
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,090
Can I go in and take a quick look?

532
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,380
Family members aren't allowed inside. Please wait outside.

533
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,620
When can I see her?

534
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,940
There are doctors and nurses inside.

535
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,330
Just wait here.

536
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,220
What's going on?

537
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,250
My mom woke up,

538
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,660
but they won't let me in.

539
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,860
Don't worry.

540
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,330
Let Mr. Huang check on her.

541
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,940
He'll come out and explain the situation to you,

542
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,660
okay?

543
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,460
Stay calm.

544
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,810
Mr. Huang,

545
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,140
how's my mom?

546
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,860
Don't worry.

547
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,620
She's out of danger now.

548
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,220
That's great!

549
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,220
When can I go in

550
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,380
and see her?

551
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:57,980
Wait a bit.

552
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,330
She's still under anesthesia.

553
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,090
Okay.

554
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,940
Qiao Yang,

555
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,700
good news.

556
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,860
Mom.

557
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,250
Mom, it's okay now.

558
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,530
Water...

559
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,810
You want some water?

560
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:47,770
Okay.

561
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,290
She can't drink yet.

562
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,220
We can't drink water just yet.

563
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,700
Hold on a little longer, okay?

564
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,730
You might choke.

565
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,330
I'll get a nurse for a cotton swab.

566
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,620
Wedding...

567
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,900
Wedding...

568
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,900
It won't be delayed.

569
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,900
Don't worry.

570
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,050
Luo said

571
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,380
that once you're fully recovered,

572
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,290
we can hold it anytime.

573
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,380
Don't worry about it.

574
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,180
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

575
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,530
Thank you...

576
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,010
What did you say?

577
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,700
Thank you for saving me.

578
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,140
Thank you.

579
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,290
Ms. Qiao,

580
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,700
have you thought about taking a few days off after this busy period?

581
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,730
Maybe go on a vacation and relax a bit?

582
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,460
What would you like to eat?

583
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,700
Dr. Qiao,

584
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,180
long time no see.

585
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,660
I heard you resigned.

586
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,730
We came back to check on you.

587
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,940
Alright.

588
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,620
Come.

589
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,770
Thank you.

590
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,770
We're friends.

591
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,180
I'll give you two extra side dishes, on the house.

592
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,940
Wait a moment.

593
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,220
Here she is.

594
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,290
Boss,

595
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,700
pack a lamb soup for me.

596
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,380
Alright.

597
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,570
Sit down.

598
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,940
Here.

599
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,490
Enjoy.

600
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,730
Let's get down to business.

601
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,530
I did the calculations,

602
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,900
the emergency treatment costs,

603
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,460
medical expenses, nutrition fees,

604
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,290
wedding losses,

605
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,380
lost wages,

606
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,140
and my mom's emotional distress compensation.

607
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,620
Actually,

608
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,490
you've always been responsible and dedicated.

609
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,420
It feels a bit unreasonable for me to do this.

610
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,460
You know

611
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,810
our family isn't short on money.

612
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,940
But this isn't about money.

613
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,010
I just feel that

614
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,490
if my mother's accident

615
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,290
was caused by you,

616
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,380
then you must bear the consequences.

617
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,940
I need an explanation.

618
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,940
I understand.

619
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,940
I take responsibility for this.

620
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,010
Give me your account number,

621
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,180
I'll transfer the money to you.

622
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,900
No.

623
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,770
This money should come from Gemu.

624
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,380
Yes, it should be...

625
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,010
Wait.

626
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,380
I haven't finished yet.

627
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,420
That was my initial calculation.

628
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,570
But now, I've changed my mind.

629
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,460
Whatever additional requests you have, just say them.

630
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,010
Do you remember

631
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,940
what my mom said to you when she woke up?

632
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,460
Thank you for saving me...

633
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,380
Thank you...

634
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,380
My mom said you saved her.

635
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,140
So you shouldn't be the one paying this compensation.

636
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,810
Actually, my mom has had stomach issues for a long time.

637
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,860
Maybe because she was too busy at the mine,

638
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,420
her meals were irregular.

639
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,050
But in the past one or two years, it rarely acted up.

640
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,900
Didn't expect a surgery to trigger it.

641
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,700
Of course, I told her

642
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,090
everything that happened

643
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,180
while she was unconscious.

644
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,570
Once she recovers,

645
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,570
my wedding will proceed as planned,

646
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,860
and she'll attend as usual.

647
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,330
But she has decided

648
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,660
she'll come alone.

649
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,490
What do you mean?

650
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,490
Here's your lamb soup.

651
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,010
My mom has decided to get a divorce.

652
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,460
I don't need the compensation anymore.

653
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,220
Let's not stay in touch from now on.

654
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,700
How much is it?

655
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,940
I'll pay for it.

656
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,860
Then we're even.

657
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:49,980
Should we

658
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,290
at least figure out a number

659
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,420
and cover

660
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,730
the medical expenses for them?

661
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,090
Why is Tang in such a hurry?

662
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,490
Did he tell you anything?

663
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,460
No, he didn't.

664
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:10,940
Mr. Tang,

665
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,940
what's the rush?

666
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,330
Have a seat, let's talk.

667
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,420
Alright.

668
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,140
Why so serious?

669
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,290
I came here today

670
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,010
because I need to tell you something.

671
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,770
I have to

672
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,940
sell my shares.

673
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,700
From now on, whatever direction Gemu takes,

674
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,050
I won't be able to be part of it anymore.

675
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,220
I'm sorry.

676
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,250
Wait,

677
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,330
what do you mean?

678
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,490
So suddenly?

679
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,140
Wait, Mr. Tang,

680
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,940
what's going on?

681
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,810
My father

682
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,860
had a stroke.

683
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,220
Now that he's down,

684
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,700
the whole corporation is in chaos.

685
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,700
Even though I'm his only son,

686
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,330
it's a massive corporation.

687
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,730
There are plenty of

688
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,770
capable people

689
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,330
who want to take over.

690
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,860
Everyone is trying to find dirt on me.

691
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,730
The first thing they did was investigate my accounts.

692
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,570
All those investments I made over the years,

693
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,220
Qin knows most of them.

694
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,700
Some failed, some collapsed.

695
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,810
The only profitable one is our hospital.

696
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,180
I have no other choice.

697
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,860
I need to fill in the gaps

698
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,250
as quickly as possible.

699
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,090
What do you mean by "quickly"?

700
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,810
Are you planning to sell off your shares?

701
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,010
Let's not get into specifics.

702
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,980
I have a meeting arranged.

703
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,220
They should be here soon.

704
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,860
Let's meet them together, alright?

705
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,460
Lingnan Medical Group's General Manager of Market Expansion,

706
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,570
Vice General Manager of Strategic Investment.

707
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,050
Just recently appointed.

708
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,250
In a few months,

709
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,460
once Jiao Ai is on track,

710
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,980
I'll be working at the headquarters.

711
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,380
From now on, I'll be shuttling between Shenzhen and Rongchuan.

712
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,570
No choice,

713
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,490
that's just my life, always on the move.

714
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,570
Why is it you?

715
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,290
I made an appointment with Jiang.

716
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,220
Where's he?

717
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,860
Until he arrives,

718
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,220
there's nothing to talk about between us.

719
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,940
Yes.

720
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,490
Mr. Jiang asked for my opinion.

721
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,490
I told him we must take this deal.

722
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,460
In the medical aesthetics sector,

723
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,220
assets as high-quality as Gemu

724
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,180
are extremely rare.

725
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,490
It would be a waste if it fell into the hands

726
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,090
of someone inexperienced.

727
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,940
And I insisted on offering a good price.

728
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,900
After all, we've been through

729
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,140
this together.

730
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,730
So, by your logic,

731
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,380
Gemu should be thanking you, huh?

732
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:01,730
We're all on the same team,

733
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,700
no need for that.

734
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,730
Before Mr. Jiang left for Chicago, he specifically asked me

735
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,660
to make sure this deal went through.

736
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,490
Wait a minute.

737
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,490
Let's not act like this is already settled.

738
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,650
Tang,

739
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,420
how far have your talks with them gone?

740
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,130
Just...

741
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,980
just the general direction.

742
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,780
We haven't discussed the details yet.

743
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,380
A general direction is enough.

744
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,570
To me, Gemu

745
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,260
is completely transparent.

746
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,420
Are you done?

747
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,490
Li Qi,

748
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,690
are you just going to keep pushing?

749
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,740
Yes,

750
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,980
I plan to sell Gemu.

751
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,900
But now that

752
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,380
you're here,

753
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,490
trying to take advantage of the situation,

754
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,570
let me make it clear,

755
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,260
I'll sell

756
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,530
to anyone but you.

757
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:40,900
Tang,

758
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,010
I know you care about your pride,

759
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,530
but timing matters.

760
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,820
How's your father doing?

761
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,900
I won't say much in front of outsiders.

762
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,780
But the pressure you're under,

763
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,490
the weight you're carrying,

764
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,900
no one else would dare take it on.

765
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,980
You've misunderstood me.

766
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,490
You think I'm here today

767
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,940
just to settle an old score with you?

768
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,610
Then all these years between us have meant nothing.

769
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,570
I simply believe

770
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,050
this is the best time to buy Gemu at a low price.

771
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,820
So...

772
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,170
So you've been spreading rumors out there?

773
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,210
Saying Gemu's shares are problematic,

774
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,530
that the founder is going through a messy divorce,

775
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,860
that the company is in chaos?

776
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,300
That's just to drive the price down, isn't it?

777
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,900
Haven't you also been asking around?

778
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,420
Those who were initially interested in taking over

779
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,690
are hesitant now.

780
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,860
I'm just doing business.

781
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,010
Business is business,

782
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,260
do you understand, Tang Jun?

783
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,820
People, really...

784
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,740
You can't be too considerate of others.

785
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,460
I simply came to help you,

786
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,170
and now we're stuck in all this pointless back-and-forth.

787
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,260
Fine.

788
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,980
Think it over.

789
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,010
If it were me, I would've signed already.

790
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,090
I can afford to wait.

791
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,380
Can you?

792
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,260
It's all business.

793
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,380
Don't get worked up.

794
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,260
Take care of yourself.

795
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,050
Remember to take your medicine on time.

796
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,210
I'm heading out!

797
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,610
For the next two days,

798
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,170
you can only play games for one hour a day.

799
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,740
I have everything recorded.

800
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,420
If you're free,

801
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,820
you can go visit Grandpa Qiao.

802
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,900
Alright.

803
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,420
Dr. Qiao.

804
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,610
Cool!

805
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,530
Doesn't my way of making this taste great?

806
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,490
Anything tastes good when you're hungry.

807
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,820
Didn't you say you weren't coming?

808
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,490
I just signed up this morning.

809
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,780
Zhou Jingwen insisted I take a break.

810
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,940
I figured she was right.

811
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,210
I haven't had a proper break in years.

812
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,420
Might as well take this chance to get out for a bit.

813
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,940
Then you'd better be ready.

814
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,170
Isn't it just enduring hardship?

815
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,380
No big deal.

816
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,860
Hardship is a given,

817
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,300
but there are unexpected rewards too.

818
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,380
Oh?

819
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,900
Here, a Vajra knot for you.

820
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,530
So cute!

821
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,940
Last year, when we were

822
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,260
on the Smile Train mission in Tibet,

823
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,490
there was a little patient named Tashi.

824
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,460
His family

825
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,130
herds livestock at elevations of 4,000–5,000 meters.

826
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,490
He's the youngest in his family.

827
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,780
His sister gave me this.

828
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,090
She must've had a crush on you.

829
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,490
She was fifteen.

830
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,780
This time,

831
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,860
we won't just be treating children with cleft lips and palates.

832
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,530
We'll also be training their local doctors.

833
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,260
The conditions will be extremely tough, so be prepared.

834
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,170
Got it.

835
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,170
Extremely tough.

836
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,690
Mr. Wu.

837
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,650
Hello.

838
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,090
Hello.

839
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,010
Welcome, Mr. Chen!

840
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,690
Dr. Cheng!

841
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,260
This is Dr. Lu,

842
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,900
you're familiar with him.

843
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,300
Yes, we know each other.

844
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,380
And this is Dr. Qiao.

845
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,130
Smile.

846
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,900
There are two major challenges in cleft lip and palate surgery.

847
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,820
Anesthesia and suturing.

848
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,980
No need for me to explain further.

849
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,650
Anesthesia is just about dosage control.

850
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,260
As for suturing,

851
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,260
it directly affects

852
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,460
the child's post-surgery skeletal development.

853
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,300
But if you ask me, there's another major challenge,

854
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,530
post-operative care.

855
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,050
Because kids,

856
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,300
they just can't resist touching the wound.

857
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,090
We can't exactly handcuff them,

858
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,820
right?

859
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,820
This part is healing well.

860
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,900
The underlying bone structure is also recovering nicely.

861
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,050
Looking good.

862
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,650
Did you sneak your little dirty hands to touch the wound again?

863
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,610
It's getting chilly.

864
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,860
Don't stay up too late.

865
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,780
Go to bed early.

866
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,610
I've prepared some hot water for you, soak your feet later,

867
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:58,940
okay?

868
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,980
Alright, stop nagging.

869
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,260
I just got my thoughts sorted out,

870
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,260
and now you've messed them up again.

871
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,610
Fine, I'll leave now.

872
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,210
Come on, push a little harder!

873
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,900
Once we cross this mountain, we'll be there.

874
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:31,650
Can you make it?

875
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,780
Give me the medical kit.

876
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,460
No need.

877
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:34,460
It's okay.

878
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,090
Don't force yourself.

879
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,260
Just a bit bigger.

880
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,900
They walked over twenty miles from home.

881
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,210
And no transportation.

882
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,900
They should be here soon.

883
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,210
There they are!

884
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,980
Why is everyone waiting outside?

885
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,260
Sorry,

886
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,570
I had a lot of work this morning,

887
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,690
so I left home late.

888
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,050
Come inside and have some tea.

889
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,940
I can't.

890
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,420
I have to go back and harvest the peppers.

891
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,980
I'll come pick her up later.

892
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,610
No worries, leave her with us.

893
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,090
Alright, I'll leave it to you.

894
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:37,690
No problem.

895
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,420
Alright.

896
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,260
Uh...

897
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,780
She left the kid just like that?

898
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,490
She has to work, what else can she do?

899
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:44,940
Let's go.

900
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,860
It's trust in you.

901
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,260
Hua,

902
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,940
look at my head. What's this?

903
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,740
An owl.

904
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,690
How do owls sleep?

905
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,130
How do owls sleep?

906
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,740
Like this.

907
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,820
That was fast!

908
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,820
Am I better at coaxing kids now?

909
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,010
Praise me.

910
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,090
Motherly saint.

911
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,210
Get lost.

912
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,690
Surgery begins.

913
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,820
Did the power go out?

914
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,490
No way.

915
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,460
It's okay.

916
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,210
Bring a light over.

917
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,340
This is ridiculous.

918
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,780
I told you, the conditions here are basic.

919
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,900
You should've been prepared.

920
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,210
Dr. Qiao,

921
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,170
look.

922
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,090
This is

923
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,610
a manually positioned shadowless lamp.

924
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,740
Wherever you need light, I'll shine it there.

925
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,980
Say the word.

926
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,860
Alright, let's keep going, Dr. Qiao.

927
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,650
Automatic.

928
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,650
Manually automatic.

929
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,570
Move forward a bit.

930
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:55,650
Lower it slightly.

931
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,940
A little more down, thanks.

932
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,010
Why is there a shadow?

933
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,980
Can you still see?

934
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,610
Move forward a little more.

935
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,780
Got it.

936
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:14,860
Look,

937
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,570
the photos Qiao Yang sent are gorgeous.

938
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,610
Looks a lot like Montreux, Switzerland.

939
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,460
We went there together.

940
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,690
Do you remember?

941
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,900
Back then, you even said

942
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,490
we'd have our wedding there someday.

943
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,820
Weren't we busy building the hospital?

944
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,690
Are you meeting with Mr. Mao?

945
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,380
I'm seeing him now.

946
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,420
Yeah, but I don't have high hopes.

947
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,690
Plans never keep up with changes.

948
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:44,980
I'm heading out.

949
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,050
Hello?

950
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,380
Is this Zhou Jingwen?

951
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,050
Yes.

952
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,210
This is the Guihu Police Station.

953
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,090
The police station?
