1
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,210
Sir, can we speed up a bit?

2
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,850
Okay.

3
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,460
Hello, the number you've dialed is currently unavailable.

4
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,540
I checked Qi Dacheng's wife's WeChat Moments.

5
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,980
She left a message last night saying she misses home and the kid.

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,660
I think they've gone back home.

7
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,690
I'm on my way to the train station now.

8
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,540
There's still one last train tonight.

9
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,380
Let's move a bit faster.

10
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,540
Sure.

11
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,900
When one is determined to leave the home,

12
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,020
leave the parents,

13
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,170
he must had hardened his heart.

14
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,420
It's definitely not something done on impulse.

15
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,650
Qi Dacheng...

16
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,500
Qi Dacheng...

17
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,090
Why aren't you answering the phone?

18
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,220
Where are you going?

19
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,090
Qi Dacheng,

20
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,530
the surgery doesn't end when it's done.

21
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,620
There are still follow-up treatments that need to be done.

22
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,780
If there's any rejection,

23
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,810
it could be really serious.

24
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,020
Can you come back with me?

25
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,890
Qi Dacheng,

26
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,500
can you listen for once?

27
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,250
Talk some sense into him.

28
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,180
In the past five years,

29
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,980
how many times have you been turned down?

30
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,770
How many times have we failed?

31
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,130
Even if all our efforts have gone to waste,

32
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,620
if anything happens to your husband, who's to blame?

33
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,180
Qi Dacheng,

34
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,370
think about the donor

35
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,770
and their son...

36
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,130
They selflessly helped you.

37
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,540
Can you really face them?

38
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,300
Dr. Qiao,

39
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,130
it's not that we don't understand.

40
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,370
It's just that something major happened at home.

41
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,860
Dr. Qiao,

42
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,570
we know you're a good person.

43
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,500
A great doctor.

44
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,980
But please, look at this.

45
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,060
My child, he might lose

46
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,180
one of his eyes.

47
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,330
It's like God is blind,

48
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,330
only choosing who suffers.

49
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,010
We really have no other option.

50
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,060
Don't say anything anymore.

51
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,330
It's because

52
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,570
we've been working away from home.

53
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,940
We didn't have time to be with him.

54
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,300
If I'd known,

55
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,010
I wouldn't have treated this illness.

56
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,540
Dr. Qiao,

57
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,690
thank you.

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,770
Qi Dacheng!

59
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,490
Dr. Qiao,

60
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,740
I'm really sorry.

61
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,980
Our collaboration has to end here.

62
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,900
I just got the news.

63
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,810
I've told you,

64
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,410
there's a lot of internal pressure in the company.

65
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,730
Many people are envious.

66
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,410
I had no choice.

67
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,940
The boss gave me direct orders.

68
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,940
They're in a hurry,

69
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,130
and it needs to be handed over today.

70
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,980
I'm taking the equipment away now.

71
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,500
I'm really sorry.

72
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,580
Thank you lately.

73
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,860
I'll see you later.

74
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,130
What do you mean?

75
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,940
Is this something you should be asking me?

76
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,810
What do you think should be done?

77
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,740
Where are you going? Who are you giving that look to?

78
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,250
Ms. Qiao,

79
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:06,770
come back.

80
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,370
Ms. Qiao, don't take this to heart.

81
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,890
He's just like that, he has this temper.

82
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,130
He talks to everyone like this.

83
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,250
The boss has a bad temper, that's normal.

84
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,860
Yes.

85
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,620
I caused losses to Gemu,

86
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,570
and I'll take responsibility for that.

87
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,420
You all go ahead.

88
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,570
We talk inside.

89
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,620
We've wasted so much time,

90
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,250
spent so much money for nothing.

91
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,250
She insisted on going for this 5G remote surgery,

92
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,940
and now it's all gone down the drain.

93
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,450
All I did was complain a little,

94
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,940
and look at Qiao Yang's attitude.

95
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,250
Did you see her before she left?

96
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,810
She gave me the biggest eye-roll.

97
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,620
Wasn't it you who said,

98
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,250
"Just spend the money"?

99
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,810
Yes.

100
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,300
Well, spending money isn't the same as throwing it away.

101
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,940
If I threw it in water,

102
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,180
at least I'd hear a splash, right?

103
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,250
"How to spend it is for the professionals to decide."

104
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,210
Wasn't that what you said?

105
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,690
Did you take your medication today?

106
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,980
Yes.

107
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,940
I just can't accept it.

108
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,180
Calm down.

109
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,060
Jiao Ai took our project,

110
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,450
why can't we take it back?

111
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,570
Recently, all our clients have gone to others.

112
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,740
All surgeries have been postponed.

113
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,500
All the time

114
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,060
went into this 5G project.

115
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,740
The overtime I've worked these last two weeks

116
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,060
is more than the last three years combined.

117
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,330
I know.

118
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,370
What can she do about it?

119
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,250
Isn't she just as anxious as you?

120
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,690
If there were a solution,

121
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,250
the project wouldn't have been canceled.

122
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,810
From my perspective, you might as well stop making things worse.

123
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,620
To be honest, Ms. Qiao is really foolish.

124
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,890
She's too focused on perfecting the technique.

125
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,890
Such a great project,

126
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,330
don't you think every hospital would want it?

127
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,810
Yes.

128
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,620
Why did she insist on making it so perfect?

129
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,500
By the time we get it right,

130
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,940
it'll be too late.

131
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,250
A project like this should be grabbed immediately,

132
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,370
and the surgery should start right away.

133
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,060
Right, I'm gonna get it now.

134
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,900
What are you gonna get?

135
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,660
Gemu worked on

136
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,260
the 5G project for so long.

137
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,900
Finally, the technique was sorted out.

138
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,850
And now it's been snatched by Jiao Ai.

139
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,300
Now Ms. Qiao is done for.

140
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,810
That's right.

141
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,020
What Ms. Zhou did about the plastic surgery child search

142
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,490
was so popular.

143
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,180
And then what happened? Someone ruined it.

144
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,450
What a pity.

145
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,140
Yeah.

146
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,330
It's really not worth it.

147
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,690
So, looking at it this way,

148
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,970
Mr. Dong is really impressive.

149
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,540
He made money quietly and watched the fight from afar.

150
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,210
Exactly.

151
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,450
What are you doing?

152
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,180
Director.

153
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,730
What about the injection I wanted?

154
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,090
I'll bring it to you now.

155
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,140
And you two,

156
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,450
focus on your work.

157
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,140
Stop gossiping.

158
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,420
My jawline isn't clear,

159
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,610
even the photos lack charm.

160
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,180
It's made me look so kind.

161
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,020
Everyone's getting Botox.

162
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,450
Give me a whole smile curve lift.

163
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,330
Come here, love, let me take a look at your face.

164
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,380
It looks good.

165
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,180
Look at this.

166
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,690
The facial muscles are still very elastic.

167
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,300
There's no sign of sagging.

168
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,780
It's probably more in your head.

169
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,780
If you really wanna work on your jawline,

170
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,140
I can help you with that.

171
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,810
Sure.

172
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,060
So we can do it today?

173
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,180
With your situation,

174
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,570
it's probably a year away.

175
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,610
A year?

176
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,450
It depends on how hard you work.

177
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,730
It could take three to five years.

178
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,180
It's so troublesome to get an injection?

179
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,210
For you,

180
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,180
the most economical and effective way to improve your jawline

181
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,210
is to lose weight.

182
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,570
If I could lose weight,

183
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,850
why would I still come to you?

184
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,660
Next!

185
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,330
Okay.

186
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,850
Qiao Yang,

187
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,210
I'm next.

188
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,020
I thought it's somebody else with the same name.

189
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,060
You can go out.

190
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,660
Sure.

191
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,540
Sit.

192
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,570
What's wrong?

193
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,940
I wanna ask about double eyelid surgery.

194
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,060
Did you come alone?

195
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,570
Actually, every time I see you, I've been meaning to ask,

196
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,140
but it's always inconvenient at home.

197
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,900
Then I thought I should just come here and ask you.

198
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,090
Since I was little,

199
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,450
I've always thought my eyes were too small.

200
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,210
Your eyes aren't small at all.

201
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,450
Look at yourself.

202
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,090
Yeah.

203
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,090
Dad always tells me not to focus too much on appearance,

204
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,140
that character and virtue are the most important things.

205
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,490
Alright.

206
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,660
Qiao Yang, you may not know,

207
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,570
but all this time,

208
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,060
I've felt like I have no real strengths.

209
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,380
I'm ordinary-looking,

210
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,850
not particularly smart.

211
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,900
Everyone praises my good character,

212
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,780
and that's the highest compliment I get.

213
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,970
I never thought about changing.

214
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,090
But after you gave me the wedding dress,

215
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,940
I was so grateful.

216
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,660
Don't worry about it.

217
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,690
Qiao Chunsheng already scolded me.

218
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,730
He said I corrupted his daughter.

219
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,900
No,

220
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,850
no, Qiao Yang.

221
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,300
I was also thinking,

222
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,730
the wedding was just a formality,

223
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,090
but that day,

224
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,850
when I wore the wedding dress you gave me,

225
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,140
and stood in front of the mirror,

226
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,970
I felt so beautiful.

227
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,060
I walked over,

228
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,610
and the way everyone looked at me

229
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,570
was completely different from before.

230
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,850
That day was truly my highlight moment.

231
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,850
At that time, I thought,

232
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,610
if only my eyes could be a little bigger,

233
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,380
how great would that be?

234
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,850
Qiao Yang, you'll help me,

235
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,570
right?

236
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,180
Does Qiao Chunsheng know

237
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,490
you came to me.

238
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,380
- Yes. - I know.

239
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,850
But, Aunt,

240
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,260
I really can't manage your clinic.

241
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,450
Why not let my sister take over? Isn't that good?

242
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,660
Alright, I gotta go.

243
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,570
I'm busy here.

244
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:19,940
Wait,

245
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,090
- if you wanna see Dr. Zhou... - Mengyuan,

246
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,610
the director's VIP will be here in ten minutes,

247
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,850
but she's in surgery right now.

248
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,690
When they arrives,

249
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,730
just have them wait for a bit.

250
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,140
If it's really urgent, call me.

251
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,810
Okay.

252
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,610
Yu, come over here.

253
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,540
What happened?

254
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,970
It's another person looking for their child.

255
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,850
Since the Liu Xinfang incident went viral,

256
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,490
Ms. Zhou has become the "child-seeking lucky charm.

257
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,730
Yu,

258
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,330
hurry!

259
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,490
She's older, so speak nicely.

260
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,810
Okay, Dr. Chen.

261
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,540
I wanna...

262
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,810
see my daughter.

263
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,610
Wow, Ms. Liu really has great teeth.

264
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,690
She bites so deep.

265
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,540
Let me help you.

266
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,180
No.

267
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,940
You won't come for no reason.

268
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,570
What's up?

269
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,380
The competition is next month.

270
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,730
Are you participating?

271
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,420
Your Third Hospital has all the top specialists.

272
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,260
We're just there to tag along.

273
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,850
I'll just let those young doctors

274
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,730
go and feel the atmosphere.

275
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,380
What do you mean "your Third Hospital"?

276
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,060
Am I not a part of Gemu now?

277
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,180
Seriously...

278
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,850
But speaking of which,

279
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,610
back when I was at the Third Hospital,

280
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,020
Ms. Li always paid the most attention to this competition.

281
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,780
She forced me to participate every year.

282
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,610
Well,

283
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,730
every time I participated,

284
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,380
I gained a lot from it.

285
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,180
Yeah.

286
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,610
Every year, you always had to take first place.

287
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,850
You were the reigning champion.

288
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,540
Stop with the modesty.

289
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,850
This isn't important.

290
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,810
I mainly want you to challenge yourself too.

291
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,330
Plus, this year it's sponsored by Planck.

292
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,450
Are you trying to talk to Mr. Qian

293
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,180
about the 5G surgery again,

294
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,210
that's why you're coming to me?

295
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,180
Don't think about it.

296
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,570
I haven't finished talking yet.

297
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,020
This time, they'll pick a few participants

298
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,060
from the competition

299
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,140
to record three episodes of an industry science program.

300
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,090
You, always

301
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,140
dreaming big,

302
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,060
always wanting to make Gemu this or that,

303
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,420
don't miss out

304
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,380
on this great publicity opportunity.

305
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,540
I've done plenty of science outreach,

306
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,210
but the problem is, the views aren't good.

307
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,900
Who says there's views?

308
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,610
The producer this time

309
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,900
is her.

310
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,090
Guo Xuan?

311
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,380
We, the frontline medical practitioners,

312
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,090
actually have the obligation

313
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,970
and responsibility to promote and popularize

314
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,140
the advanced technology

315
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,900
like Planck robot.

316
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,660
Let's all work together on this.

317
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,060
Come.

318
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,180
Cheers!

319
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,420
Mr. Qin,

320
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,180
I understand what you're saying,

321
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,020
but I'm sorry.

322
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,380
Because I've signed an exclusive contract with Jiao Ai,

323
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,570
I can't allow a third party to be involved.

324
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,660
Mr. Qian, I...

325
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,900
Your technical department came to find me

326
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,210
for this project

327
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,260
For the past three years,

328
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,570
I've been providing technical support to you.

329
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,490
And we've been experimenting with it at Gemu for so long.

330
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,690
The processes and parameters are all set.

331
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,940
You can't just switch people like this.

332
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,940
It's not appropriate.

333
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,570
Dr. Qiao, you can't say that.

334
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,180
I did give you time, didn't I?

335
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,260
I did, right?

336
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,900
Yes.

337
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,300
The personnel, the technology, the equipment,

338
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,730
I've had several teams

339
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,850
working for you at Gemu.

340
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,940
We agreed the surgery would be ready in half a month,

341
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,330
but when half a month passed,

342
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,210
the animal trials weren't even finished.

343
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,730
I told you clearly

344
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,210
clinical trials must be up to standard

345
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,850
before performing surgery on human patients.

346
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,060
Otherwise, it'd be a disaster.

347
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,330
You know this, don't you?

348
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,060
Besides, we've known each other for so long.

349
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,900
You can't just burn bridges, can you?

350
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,810
When did I...

351
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,660
How could I be burning bridges?

352
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,180
No, not at all.

353
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,330
This... this can't be blamed on Mr. Qian.

354
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,020
In fact, the Planck technology

355
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,610
is world-changing technology.

356
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,660
I think within ten years,

357
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,420
the medical field

358
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,260
will undergo a revolutionary change.

359
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,420
If Gemu can participate

360
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,450
and contribute,

361
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,330
that'd be truly an honor.

362
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,060
Mr. Qian,

363
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,330
let me toast to you.

364
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,020
Mr. Qian,

365
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,810
don't be mad.

366
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,060
Gemu is just a small group,

367
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,060
very simple.

368
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,300
We're holding onto Planck's coattails,

369
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,300
and we're not concerned with other institutions.

370
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,900
Cheers.

371
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,330
Come on, I'll drink one with you.

372
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,300
Me too.

373
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,540
Mr. Li is so cool.

374
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,690
Come on, I'll toast to you all.

375
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,210
Mr. Qian,

376
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,020
I've heard you've got something big going on recently.

377
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,690
The plastic and reconstructive surgery competition

378
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,090
is the top competition in the country.

379
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,300
You've got it in the bag.

380
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,300
This news really travels fast,

381
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,420
you know everything.

382
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,330
We're just curious,

383
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,420
tell us more!

384
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,060
I don't really have much to say.

385
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,450
This year, we're just doing a little sponsorship.

386
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,210
The competition is still the same as before,

387
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,690
we'll just focus on providing our services.

388
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,140
And we'll buy something.

389
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,810
My vision is

390
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,540
to let more people know

391
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,450
about the direction

392
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,780
of modern medicine.

393
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,860
It's a good thing, right?

394
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,340
Yeah.

395
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,250
Really?

396
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,580
You even invited Guo Xuan, didn't you?

397
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,450
You're really paying attention.

398
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,050
Ms. Zhou, you're interested, aren't you?

399
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,100
I'll say it again.

400
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,690
It's

401
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,380
a bit late.

402
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,860
If you'd told me about this two days ago,

403
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,210
we could have had a proper discussion.

404
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,620
But now, I've already reached a cooperation agreement

405
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,420
with Qiao Ai.

406
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,010
And everything with Du Jun has been settled too.

407
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,620
Well,

408
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,290
if you're willing,

409
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,490
you can cooperate with Du Jun.

410
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,250
As long as you're not embarrassed,

411
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,940
I have no issue with it.

412
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,820
Of course, no embarrassment!

413
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,340
We're all familiar with him,

414
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,250
how could there be any awkwardness?

415
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,490
Alright then.

416
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,010
I think this is a great opportunity.

417
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,900
You know why?

418
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,050
Because your image

419
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,580
is a perfect fit for it.

420
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,050
Yeah.

421
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,690
Thank you!

422
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,450
Then

423
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,210
I'll give Xuan a call.

424
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,620
As long as she agrees,I think

425
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,620
she will.

426
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,290
Mr. Qian,

427
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,820
how many groups are you sending for this program?

428
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,860
Have you selected other participants?

429
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,820
Any recommendations, Ms. Zhou?

430
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,490
Yes.

431
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,050
Her. She's just a contrarian.

432
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,250
Thank you so much.

433
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,140
Everyone loves watching

434
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,050
sharp-tongued queen roast people.

435
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,010
With her around, the show comes with built-in entertainment value.

436
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,050
You planned this before coming, didn't you?

437
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,180
You deliberately dragged me into this.

438
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,250
Just a few words, and now we're a team.

439
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,690
You heard everything inside, didn't you?

440
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,900
The grouping has nothing to do with me.

441
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,450
It was Mr. Qian's decision.

442
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,100
He just walked right into your trap.

443
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,620
Either way, I'm not going.

444
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,860
I came for 5G.

445
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,770
Wait.

446
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,050
I'm helping you here.

447
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,180
Helping me? How?

448
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,490
Mr. Qian said,

449
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,530
as long as you go,he'll consider the 5G deal.

450
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,010
I'm begging you.

451
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,250
I have zero interest

452
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,180
in challenges and competitions.

453
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,250
Even if you're not interested, you still have to go.

454
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,580
You need to make up for your mistake, you know that?

455
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,450
What mistake, Zhou Jingwen?

456
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,530
What did I do?

457
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,580
Did you forget?

458
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,860
You messed up that 5G remote surgery.

459
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,250
Gemu suffered losses, and I had to take responsibility.

460
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,660
Oh, how generous of you.

461
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,420
And now,

462
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,100
Jiao Ai has officially opened,

463
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,380
which means direct competition with us.

464
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,100
Gemu needs new exposure.

465
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,450
I get it now.

466
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,010
You're afraid of losing, aren't you?

467
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,340
Don't try reverse psychology on me.

468
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,530
This is just a routine documentary shoot,

469
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,820
so there's no need to feel too much pressure.

470
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,380
Our main task

471
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,010
is simply to record your real cases

472
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,290
during the surgical competition.

473
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,380
Aside from the three competition rounds,

474
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,140
there will also be

475
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,450
some additional segments,

476
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,340
like interviews and such.

477
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,660
After all, it's still a show.

478
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,620
We'll be selecting the cases,

479
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,970
so you just go about your work as usual.

480
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,210
The most important thing

481
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,100
is to authentically complete the competition and treatments.

482
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,050
Try to ignore the cameras as much as possible.

483
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,490
I noticed that aside from the expert panel judging the surgeries,

484
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,250
you've also added an audience voting segment.

485
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,730
So after each of the three surgical rounds,

486
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,100
the audience votes once?

487
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,970
And if a doctor wins first place twice,

488
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,450
they'll be crowned the audience's Best Doctor.

489
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,580
Dr. Qiao,

490
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,860
do you have any concerns?

491
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,140
No.

492
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,730
I just found your proposal... amusing.

493
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,940
Your first-round competition topic

494
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,580
is called "The Aesthetics of Transplantation."

495
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,250
Putting aside whether transplantation

496
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,690
is even the best option for this case.

497
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:26,730
Go down.

498
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,940
Look at this,

499
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,730
it says here I need to scold her harshly,

500
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,730
wake her up with my words,

501
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,250
preferably make her cry.

502
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,050
That's way beyond my skill set.

503
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,620
I'm not an actor.

504
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,660
If I have to act like that,

505
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,450
I'll break character in no time.

506
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,690
I get it,

507
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,730
this is for so-called entertainment value.

508
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,250
I mean,

509
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,860
if we just keep throwing out medical jargon,

510
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,860
the audience won't understand.

511
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,210
I read through the show's proposal,

512
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,100
and I think it's well thought out.

513
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,180
It promotes good values,

514
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,180
has a positive message.

515
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,140
I believe this could be a great program

516
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,730
- to change public perception of medical aesthetics. - Zoom in.

517
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,690
Then all the more reason not to sacrifice professionalism

518
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,820
for entertainment.

519
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,210
The public already has biases

520
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,340
against this industry.

521
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,660
If we handle it like this,

522
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,210
won't that just make them even more skeptical?

523
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,250
Qiao Yang, we already agreed, didn't we?

524
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,420
You get to pick your own cases here.

525
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,860
Can you stop being so stubborn?

526
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,970
We each get what we want, we cooperate,

527
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,140
isn't that a win-win?

528
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,490
The only reason I agreed to be on this show

529
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,010
was to use real, solid surgeries

530
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,250
to educate people properly.

531
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,820
I want those who don't understand

532
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,580
to realize that medical aesthetics has high standards,

533
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,250
very high standards.

534
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,450
But if it's just lecturing, who's going to watch?

535
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,660
All that educational content you're talking about,

536
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,940
there's already a ton of it online.

537
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,250
But does it get views?

538
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,970
The whole point is to mix education with entertainment.

539
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,460
I just wanna create a show

540
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,260
that actually draws in an audience.

541
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,650
My perspective is simple,

542
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,500
authenticity carries its own power.

543
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,610
If we don't even respect our own profession,

544
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,740
how can we expect the audience to respect us?

545
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,370
I have a surgery this afternoon.

546
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,250
Ms. Li,

547
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,730
are these two directors

548
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,940
always like this?

549
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,210
You can expect even more.

550
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,690
Does it hurt?

551
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,490
Not too bad.

552
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,340
Ms. Li, you really are impressive.

553
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,970
This morning, I gave a young woman an injection,

554
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,490
and she was wailing

555
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,530
in pain.

556
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,620
Young women have thinner skin.

557
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,250
This is nothing.

558
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,660
The contours are looking great.

559
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,820
Take a look, Ms. Li.

560
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,450
Here.

561
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,820
One session per year is enough.

562
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,010
Hold on,

563
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,900
let me switch the head, and we'll work on the neck next.

564
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,180
These two directors in plastic surgery are involved in everything.

565
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,970
Face transplants,

566
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,860
looking for kids,

567
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,820
turning 60-year-olds into 45-year-olds,

568
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,420
and now something with 5G, right?

569
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,820
Now

570
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,820
they're both

571
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,380
on the same show together.

572
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,140
Don't be jealous.

573
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,940
Honestly, I hope this show becomes a hit.

574
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,620
Why?

575
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,250
Right now, with external competition on the rise,

576
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,580
Gemu is under a lot of pressure.

577
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,450
As for us,

578
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,140
we can't get too caught up in our small calculations.

579
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,340
There are so many shows out there,

580
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,380
small niche programs

581
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,690
is not easy to become popular.

582
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,690
That's true,

583
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,490
but even if it doesn't become a hit,

584
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,940
it's still huge exposure.

585
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,900
The biggest losers here

586
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,900
are people like me—tongue-tied,

587
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,420
simple, honest,

588
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,820
only focusing

589
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,100
on neck surgeries,

590
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,730
and not caring for fame or profit.

591
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,660
You're not tongue-tied at all.

592
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,010
You just used four or five idioms in one sentence!

593
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,140
Let me ask you,

594
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,530
have the results from the dermatology department dropped recently?

595
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,490
No.

596
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,010
Then, what's your prediction?

597
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,450
The two directors

598
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,100
who are so busy shining on this show,

599
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,660
what kind of results will they be handing in next month?

600
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,100
What's there to predict?

601
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,010
It's definitely gonna drop.

602
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,100
Ms. Li,

603
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,290
I know what you mean.

604
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,340
I feel like

605
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,140
you guys are just

606
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,690
going for surface-level excitement,

607
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,450
not caring about performance.

608
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,050
So,

609
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,290
no matter how well I do, I'm still not appreciated.

610
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,450
You think the investors don't care if they're losing money?

611
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,730
The 5G thing didn't go through earlier.

612
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,530
You don't know Tang got angry at Ms. Qiao for it?

613
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,340
Tang was mad at Ms. Qiao?

614
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:24,940
Yeah,

615
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,420
for the first time ever.

616
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,010
Then he went back and apologized to me,

617
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,340
saying he regretted

618
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,250
not listening to my advice.

619
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,730
He said he'd give her one more month.

620
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,940
So, that means...

621
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,250
I didn't say anything.

622
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,420
I still believe what I've always said,

623
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,900
everyone should

624
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,290
do their own job.

625
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,250
Do good deeds, don't ask about the future.

626
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,420
As for the aesthetics of transplantation,

627
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,290
it'll still be focused on transplantation.

628
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,180
Ive gone over it again,

629
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,340
'picked out some surgeries involving free skin flap transplantation.

630
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,290
My idea is

631
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,770
we can incorporate some

632
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,900
innovative technology or tech elements,

633
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,290
but without a background story,

634
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,340
there‘s no topic to talk about.

635
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,770
In the end, it'll still get rejected.

636
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,970
There was a screenwriter

637
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,420
who got double eyelid surgery from me before.

638
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,180
Maybe we can ask her to write a story.

639
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,100
Write a story?

640
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,380
What, are we making a TV drama now?

641
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,660
Don't you wanna win?

642
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,530
Of course, I have to win.

643
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,820
So, putting effort into making our cases more compelling

644
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,620
isn't wrong.

645
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,620
I'll win because I have confidence in myself.

646
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,620
In surgery,

647
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,770
I won't lose to any of those competitors.

648
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,050
As for trophies and medals,

649
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,050
You can buy those cheap things

650
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,660
for five bucks a pound at the Yiwu wholesale market.

651
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,450
What about this?

652
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,690
"Club Night Disaster: Disfigured Young Beauty".

653
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,420
Search it up.

654
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,050
Go to hell!

655
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,340
"Young woman disfigured in nightclub attack—

656
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,250
who's to blame?"

657
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,770
"The girl should reflect on her own actions.

658
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,580
There's no smoke without fire."

659
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,210
She's the victim.

660
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,970
What does she need to reflect on?

661
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,210
What's wrong with people these days?

662
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,290
"I'm a good girl,

663
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,620
but I go to nightclubs all the time."

664
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,180
"I'm not defending the criminal,

665
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,290
but the only one who can protect you is yourself."

666
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,660
Even her own father said in an interview that she deserved it.

667
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,530
And you all are still worrying about her?

668
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,420
Got too much time on your hands?

669
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,380
What kind of father says that about his daughter?

670
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,660
What kind of parent is he?

671
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,100
This surgery has topic value.

672
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,580
Her facial injuries cover a large area.

673
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,820
It's not an easy operation.

674
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,530
The extent of damage makes it challenging,

675
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,690
but this will be a good surgery.

676
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,730
Then why didn't the show pick her?

677
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,140
Who cares about the show?

678
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,140
She's the one.

679
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,290
Hello.

680
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,180
Hello.

681
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,690
We'd like to inquire about children's ballet classes.

682
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,620
How old is your child?

683
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,290
Eight, in second grade this year.

684
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,250
Has she had any prior ballet experience?

685
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,100
No.

686
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,490
We're just working-class folks,

687
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,660
never been involved in the arts.

688
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,900
- We just wanted to get... - In that case,

689
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,660
take a look at our brochure.

690
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,420
Alright.

691
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,530
Is it this way?

692
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,580
It's just parents.

693
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,490
They're all parents.

694
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,860
Changing room...

695
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,140
Take a look inside.

696
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,250
- There's no teacher here. - No.

697
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,250
Not here.

698
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,730
This seems like...

699
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,290
Hello, are you Hao Xin?

700
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,180
Yes.

701
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,050
Can we come in with our shoes on?

702
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,770
Yes.

703
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,340
Okay.

704
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,620
And you are...?

705
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,050
Hello, we're from Gemu Plastic Surgery Hospital.

706
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,210
Here's our business card.

707
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,010
Wrong person.

708
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,620
We're here on behalf of our director,

709
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,660
Qiao Yang.

710
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,770
The program team should have contacted you before.

711
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,290
Oh, this special program again.

712
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,450
You've come to me three times now.

713
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,450
I've made myself very clear,

714
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,580
I don't wanna be an internet celebrity.

715
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,210
You could actually look up our director online.

716
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,100
She's one of the best

717
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,860
plastic surgeons in the country.

718
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,010
She's performed numerous renowned surgeries.

719
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,380
And she's very confident about your surgery.

720
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,970
After the procedure, no one will be able to tell.

721
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,100
You can start a new life.

722
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,450
- Yes. - This is my new life.

723
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,900
I have work, I make money.

724
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,050
No one knows me.

725
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,050
No one cares about me.

726
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,730
Why should I help promote you?

727
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,660
You misunderstood.

728
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,340
What we mean is...

729
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:15,820
What you mean is,

730
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,100
you just want people to consume me.

731
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,420
To point fingers at me.

732
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,970
If there's nothing else, please leave.

733
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,210
- Hello, Ms. Hao. - You...

734
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,970
Tangyuan is here.

735
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,530
Hello, Ms. Hao!

736
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,180
Hi!

737
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,420
Go stretch first.

738
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:34,820
Okay!

739
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,010
Hello, Ms. Hao!

740
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,010
I have a class now.

741
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,690
Becoming this year's top science student,

742
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,100
you must have a lot of exam strategies, right?

743
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,380
Can you share some?

744
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,340
Actually, not really.

745
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,290
Mindset is the most important thing.

746
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,290
I think taking an exam

747
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,340
is just like playing a video game.

748
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,620
As long as you focus, that's enough.

749
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,730
No need to overthink.

750
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,180
Well, I can't do

751
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,490
multitasks like you.

752
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,050
I heard that in elementary school,

753
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,660
your grades weren't particularly outstanding.

754
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,180
But from middle to high school, your grade kept rising steadily.

755
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,140
How did you become a top student?

756
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,210
Don't call me a top student.

757
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,730
It sounds weird.

758
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,380
I don't have many other hobbies.

759
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,940
I just like studying.

760
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:23,140
Life feels too complicated,

761
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,580
but studying is simple.

762
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,690
That sounds a bit like humble bragging.

763
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,970
Not at all.

764
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,340
Ms. Zhou, this case is really good.

765
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,340
It's highly engaging.

766
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,690
Hope you don't mind,

767
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,730
but for the program,

768
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,290
we'd like to ask,

769
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,660
has your face always been like this since childhood?

770
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,250
It started around elementary school.

771
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,660
I've seen many doctors over the years.

772
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,660
They all just prescribed medicine for control.

773
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,290
Until recently, when I met Dr. Zhou's team,

774
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,860
I finally got this great opportunity.

775
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,660
But honestly, the surgical technique

776
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,690
isn't that complex.

777
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,770
A couple of granular fat grafting sessions would do.

778
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,530
Who told you there's only one solution?

779
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,140
Liu Miao,

780
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,450
thank you for your trust.

781
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,340
This summer break

782
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,250
will be a relaxing one for you.

783
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,690
Do you have any plans?

784
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,380
Whatever my plans are,

785
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,900
it depends on you, Dr. Zhou.

786
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,490
Then let's discuss the treatment plan directly.

787
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,210
I've reviewed your medical records.

788
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,100
You have hemifacial atrophy.

789
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,770
It started in elementary school,

790
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,820
and you've been taking medication ever since.

791
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,940
Now, the condition has entered a stable phase.

792
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,340
My recommendation is to use free fascial-fat grafts

793
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,490
for transplantation,

794
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,620
along with 3D bone reconstruction.

795
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,010
Even the name of this procedure sounds complicated.

796
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,730
The recovery must take a long time, right?

797
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,420
About two months of recovery.

798
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,660
But with your laser treatments

799
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,050
and subsequent fillers,

800
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,660
by the end of summer break,

801
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,340
the surgical marks will be barely noticeable.

802
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,940
Then put the recovery period in the contract.

803
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,100
I've said before,

804
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,900
I want to be discharged before school starts.

805
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,100
I completely understand, sweetheart.

806
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,730
University is a whole new chapter in life.

807
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,340
Who wouldn't want to start it

808
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,340
in the best way possible?

809
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,140
How about this,

810
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,730
I'll show you some cases

811
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,450
I've worked on before.

812
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,250
They had similar procedures to yours.

813
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,010
Dr. Zhou.

814
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,530
Including...

815
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,250
You really don't need to rush this.

816
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,770
There's a small issue with my agreement

817
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,770
with the program team.

818
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,900
I just drafted a new one,

819
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,340
and they haven't responded yet.

820
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,730
Alright.

821
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,860
If you have any issues, just let me know.

822
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,380
I can help you communicate with them.

823
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,140
My condition is doubling the appearance fee.

824
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,940
Do you wanna win?

825
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,770
If you do, then convince them.

826
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,210
I really can't sign this contract.

827
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,530
With so many guests,

828
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,100
if I agree to this for her, what about the others?

829
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,820
If it really doesn't work,

830
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,010
you might as well find someone else.

831
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,250
So Liu Miao wants more money,

832
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,380
and the schedule is tight too.

833
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,770
Guo Xuan basically means she's washing her hands of it,

834
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,970
leaving everything for us to deal with.

835
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,530
These show producers are really unreliable.

836
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,210
If it doesn't work, just replace her.

837
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,690
She's already making things difficult now.

838
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,530
It could get even worse later.

839
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,530
Replace her with whom?

840
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,340
Look at Qiao Yang's patient, Hao Xin.

841
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,580
She's already refused the show three times,

842
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,820
but they're still pushing.

843
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:13,900
Even Qiao Yang,

844
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,900
she hates getting involved in patients' personal affairs,

845
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,340
she personally stepped in.

846
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,420
And we're hesitating here?

847
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,290
Let's just get it done.

848
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,770
Here we are.

849
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,290
Come with me.

850
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,010
Seriously, Ms. Qiao.

851
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,580
No matter what we do, it's not working.

852
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,530
You have to step in.

853
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,450
Stay out of my business.

854
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,250
Let's go.

855
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:26,660
That's Hao Xin.

856
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,250
Stay out of it?

857
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,900
The letter was already sent home.

858
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,730
Can't you see she's talking?

859
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,940
Have some decency, will you?

860
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,050
Are you crazy?

861
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,380
Trying to fight me now?

862
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,340
What, I didn't beat you enough

863
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,340
as a kid?

864
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,100
I'll beat you to death!

865
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,010
Hit me, go ahead.

866
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,860
Who the hell are you two?

867
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,340
Get lost!

868
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,420
You think you can hit me?Try it!

869
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,420
You think I don't dare?

870
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,940
Sir!

871
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,010
I'm warning you, don't cause trouble.

872
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,380
Don't record this! None of your business!

873
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,290
I'm calling the police!

874
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,620
- Stop hitting! - Put the phone down!

875
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,290
Keep filming and you'll regret it.

876
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:50,970
Sir!

877
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,940
Let's talk this out.

878
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,210
There's no need to make things hard for a young girl.

879
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,180
Talk it out.

880
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,530
What young girl?

881
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,620
She's my daughter!

882
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,770
What's wrong with disciplining my own daughter?

883
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,210
You already cut ties with her, didn't you?

884
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,140
But now, you suddenly remember she's your daughter?

885
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,100
None of your damn business.

886
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,730
Keep filming, and I'll make you pay for it.

887
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,290
What the hell are you doing? Not done yet?

888
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,010
You,

889
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,090
call the security.

890
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,380
This guy is drunk and causing trouble here.

891
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,300
So what?

892
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,380
It's none of your business.

893
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,970
Don't talk to me, your breath stinks.

894
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,420
Is this how a father acts?

895
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,860
You're meddling, huh?

896
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,420
Where were you when your daughter was being cyberbullied?

897
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,610
All meddling, huh?

898
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,780
Just wait and see.

899
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,010
Hao Xin,

900
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,010
you too.

901
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,900
Leave. We'll be waiting right here.

902
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,740
This kid has it rough.

903
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,780
Let's go.

904
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,490
And you, seriously?

905
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,260
Why did you run off like that?

906
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,940
I took my eyes off you for one second,

907
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,090
and you ran straight here.

908
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,220
Are you hurt?

909
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,090
I'm fine.

910
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,530
You're really something.

911
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,650
Who are you?

912
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,610
This is the one I introduced you to before.

913
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,820
Our director, Qiao Yang.

914
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,130
I'll do the show.

915
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,220
That's great!

916
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,900
Our director has designed

917
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,940
a fantastic treatment plan for you.

918
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,170
If your recovery goes well,

919
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,450
you can regain about 90%

920
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,380
of your original appearance.

921
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,860
I don't care about the recovery.

922
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,220
Whatever he doesn't want me to do,

923
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,090
I'll do it.

924
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,650
We'll use a dermatome

925
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,530
to take skin grafts from the back

926
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,130
of your thigh

927
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,050
and transplant them onto your face,

928
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,300
just like what's shown in this video.

929
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,300
What about the skin on my thigh?

930
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,610
The human body is amazing.

931
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,450
The skin on the back of your thigh

932
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,940
will regenerate on its own.

933
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,300
Could you stop filming

934
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,130
the patient's scars like that?

935
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,050
It's really rude.

936
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,170
Yeah, focus on Dr. Qiao.

937
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,490
She's full of clever remarks.

938
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,530
I don't have clever remarks.

939
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,490
I only have medical terms.

940
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,300
Stop filming me.

941
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,220
You have a lot.

942
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,340
Look, didn't you just say,

943
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,490
"Isn't that obvious?

944
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,450
You ask a surgeon to remove an appendix,

945
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,780
and he can carve it into a flower."

946
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,380
Witty as ever.

947
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,610
Make sure you don't include that in the show's final cut.

948
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,260
I don't want my surgeon colleagues

949
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,340
to blacklist me.

950
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,340
Let's move on.

951
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,740
When the dermatome removes the skin grafts,

952
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,570
these skin...

953
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,380
No matter what,

954
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,340
your surgery is the most important thing.

955
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,530
Everything else is secondary.

956
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,420
If anything about the filming

957
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,260
makes you uncomfortable,

958
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,570
speak up right away.

959
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,450
Don't just put up with it.

960
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,860
No, it's all fine.

961
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,970
Honestly, I stopped caring about all this a long time ago.

962
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,450
I only met you by accident.

963
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,570
Don't worry.

964
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,340
I'll cooperate fully.

965
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,490
Please, young lady,

966
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,530
you're a good kid.

967
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,130
Go.

968
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,820
I just wanna see Jingwen.

969
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,050
She's my daughter.

970
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,610
How many times have I told you?

971
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,300
Dr. Qiao.

972
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,610
Stop here, please. No need to walk me out.

973
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,650
Go ahead, I'll be off.

974
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,860
See, I even left my number with you.

975
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,220
She's your boss.

976
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,530
If she finds out you're stopping me from going in,

977
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,170
she'll scold you badly, okay?

978
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,780
She might even fire you.

979
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,740
What's going on, Xiaomeng?

980
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,130
Hello, doctor.

981
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:34,610
Hello.

982
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,010
I'm a family member of someone at this hospital.

983
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,570
I just wanna see my daughter, Jingwen.

984
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,860
But she won't let me in.

985
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,420
Jingwen?

986
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,260
Ms. Zhou.

987
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,900
You mean Zhou Jingwen?

988
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,530
Yes.

989
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,340
That heartless girl.

990
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,900
She's a doctor now.

991
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,130
Always on TV. Haven't you seen her?

992
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,300
Wait here a moment.

993
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,090
Yeah, I know,

994
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,090
I'll be back soon.

995
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,170
Why are you rushing me like that?

996
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,740
Ma'am,

997
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,450
does Zhou Jingwen know you're here?

998
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,300
She's really harsh now.

999
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,970
Now that she's a doctor,

1000
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,090
appearing on TV,

1001
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,530
and making money.

1002
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,780
Here's the thing, ma'am.

1003
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,450
I'm quite close with Jingwen,

1004
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,780
but I've never heard

1005
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,260
that she has any living family.

1006
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,450
Are you sure you're looking

1007
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,130
for Zhou Jingwen from our hospital?

1008
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,610
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

1009
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,420
Are you out of your mind?

1010
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,050
She won't let me in,

1011
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,420
and now you're just making it more confusing.

1012
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,650
I have to get home and cook dinner.

1013
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,220
You're wasting my time.

1014
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,900
Wasting time!

1015
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,900
Just take your medicine properly.

1016
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,700
Unbelievable.

1017
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,050
What kind of people are these?

1018
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,450
Where's the door?

1019
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,490
Here.

1020
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,650
This one is my favorite.

1021
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,300
It's in such a prime location.

1022
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,420
Surrounded by high-end office buildings.

1023
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,530
If we move in,

1024
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,010
we can introduce lunchtime beauty treatments.

1025
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,780
The business will take off instantly.

1026
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,570
The only downside

1027
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,300
is that the space is a little small.

1028
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,570
But after streamlining our services, it'll be enough.

1029
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,490
The best part is, the landlord is offering it

1030
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,570
at an unbelievably good price.

1031
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,050
Ms. Li,

1032
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,260
don't you think it's a bit too early

1033
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,300
to be discussing this?

1034
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,220
The merger of cosmetic surgery and dermatology

1035
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,650
hasn't even been decided yet.

1036
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,700
Don't you think it's inevitable?

1037
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,490
I know that in the past few months,

1038
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,780
cosmetic surgery has been a bit unstable.

1039
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,970
But ever since Qiao Yang and Mr. Chu joined,

1040
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,570
along with all these major surgeries,

1041
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,130
our reputation has been rebuilt.

1042
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,490
Patient flow has recovered,

1043
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,490
and client loyalty is growing.

1044
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,450
Merging now

1045
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,090
would mean losing customers.

1046
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,820
See, that's a misunderstanding.

1047
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,130
Merging doesn't mean eliminating cosmetic surgery.

1048
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,380
We're just streamlining and optimizing,

1049
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,900
cutting out procedures with low cost-effectiveness.

1050
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,380
Comprehensive rhinoplasty and eyelid surgery

1051
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,610
will still be our main focus.

1052
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,570
This way, doctors

1053
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,490
can focus more on high-value clients.

1054
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,650
Our per-customer revenue will shoot up.

1055
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:52,740
Ms. Li,

1056
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,860
this is where you and I disagree.

1057
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,050
What you consider low-value procedures,

1058
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,650
I see as the key to Gemu's long-term profitability.

1059
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,050
I believe the market's final choice

1060
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,420
will be craftsmanship and long-termism.

1061
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,090
Once you bring up those values,

1062
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,570
I honestly can't keep up with them.

1063
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,300
You're talking about long-termism and craftsmanship now.

1064
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:22,090
So, I guess I'm short-sighted and narrow-minded, right?

1065
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,050
Ms. Li,

1066
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,300
I know you've discussed

1067
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,420
some market data with Qin Gui.

1068
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,530
I don't know how he answered you,

1069
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,010
but he doesn't represent me.

1070
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,780
My answer is very simple.

1071
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,010
As the director of the plastic surgery department,

1072
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,780
I firmly disagree.

1073
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,050
I've been at Gemu for five years.

1074
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,570
Between us, it's nothing but work.

1075
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,700
I think it's great,

1076
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:51,940
very comfortable.

1077
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,740
The first time I met you here,

1078
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,860
I was actually quite nervous.

1079
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,570
After all, considering everything that happened before,

1080
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,010
I didn't know how you'd treat me.

1081
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,650
Qin,

1082
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,780
let me introduce you.

1083
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,610
This is Li Qi,

1084
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,380
our future operations director at Gemu.

1085
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,650
- Nice to meet you. - You too.

1086
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,300
This is my girlfriend, please take care of her in the future.

1087
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,300
I don't want this toolbox.

1088
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,010
Is there a...

1089
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,170
Mr. Tang.

1090
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,650
This is Li Qi, our future operations director.

1091
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,650
She's also my girlfriend.

1092
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,570
This is Jingwen, Qin's girlfriend,

1093
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,450
and the director of the plastic surgery department.

1094
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,780
She's also responsible for some medical work.

1095
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,010
Hello, nice to meet you.

1096
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,050
I've heard a lot about you.

1097
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,450
So fate has brought us together again.

1098
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,530
There must be a purpose behind it.

1099
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,170
Reconsider it.

1100
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,300
Qiao Yang,

1101
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,570
my parents don't know about this.

1102
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,570
It's the most rebellious thing I've ever done.

1103
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,450
Getting double eyelid surgery is rebellious?

1104
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,860
Well, you're a bit late to the rebellious phase, huh?

1105
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,940
Next time I go home, I'll probably get scolded.

1106
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,900
Then blame it on me,

1107
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,300
let them scold me.

1108
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,130
Well, they wouldn't dare.

1109
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,780
They'll just criticize me.

1110
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,170
I overheard dad muttering last time,

1111
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,260
saying you've grown up and spread your wings.

1112
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,740
He can't do anything about you.

1113
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,740
I fought for that on my own.

1114
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,570
When I was young, he didn't hesitate to hit me.

1115
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,130
Until one time, I fought back,

1116
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,700
and he never dared to hit me again.

1117
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,780
So, you see,

1118
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,220
if you let things happen without resistance,

1119
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,610
you're just asking for trouble.

1120
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,170
I understand that.

1121
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,610
But...

1122
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,740
Don't think too much about it.

1123
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,300
Anyway,

1124
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,700
you won't be living with him in the future.

1125
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,490
Whether he's happy or not, it doesn't matter.

1126
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,300
My husband probably won't support me either.

1127
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,420
But he might not even notice.

1128
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,420
If he can't even notice you getting double eyelid surgery,

1129
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,940
can you still keep him?

1130
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,420
I've gotten used to it.X

1131
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,900
I don't have much of a presence to begin with.

1132
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,300
Like yesterday, during our department's dinner,

1133
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,300
several people didn't even know my name.

1134
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,260
We've been working together for three years.

1135
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,130
Qiao Yang,

1136
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,260
you won't mind me telling you all this, will you?

1137
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,090
There are a lot of things

1138
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,300
I've never told anyone.

1139
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,780
It's fine.

1140
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,610
Chatting helps ease the nerves.

1141
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,010
Who's this?

1142
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,780
Your family. You don't recognize her?

1143
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,420
No.

1144
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,300
I remember when we were in school,

1145
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,570
you mentioned that there was no one left in your family.

1146
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,260
Yeah, my dad ran away,

1147
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,530
and my mom passed away.

1148
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,450
What about your siblings?

1149
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,780
I don't have any.
