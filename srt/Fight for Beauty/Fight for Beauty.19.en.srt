1
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,260
Ms. Qiao.

2
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,690
Sweetheart,

3
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,850
I'll get you a new place.

4
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,740
Just right.

5
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,820
Don't stress.

6
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,260
Li Qi has gone.

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,130
Yeah, she left for Jiao Ai.

8
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,260
Next time before you discuss things with Mr. Tang,

9
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,290
can you talk to me first?

10
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,490
These are major decisions.

11
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,980
I should at least be informed.

12
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,820
Speed is key in business.

13
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,060
If we loop you in

14
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,610
and end up missing another opportunity like Dabao,

15
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,980
what then?

16
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,980
The fact that Li Qi could jump straight

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,940
from Gemu to Jiao Ai

18
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,010
means she's fully prepared.

19
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,100
You think

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,980
you caught her off guard?

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,850
We're the ones scrambling here.

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,100
I can't even imagine

23
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,130
what's coming

24
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,380
for Gemu.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,820
The stress is killing me.

26
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,570
My stomach's in knots.

27
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,820
I feel like throwing up.

28
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,660
Can you calm down?

29
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,170
Don't panic over hypotheticals.

30
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,850
We only lost Li Qi.

31
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,060
Is it a big deal?

32
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,850
We'll handle problems together.

33
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,570
Guo.

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,500
Where you off to?

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,850
What's up?

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,540
Xia.

37
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,260
Ms. Zhang!

38
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,290
We're not busy today.

39
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,170
We can get you in right away if you want.

40
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,170
Not going to work?

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,940
No need.

42
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,780
I only trust Ms. Li.

43
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,610
Ms. Zhang!

44
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,850
Everything's a mess.

45
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,220
Total chaos. Look.

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,410
Look at this.

47
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,100
I also have a lot of things to do.

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,260
Don't be so fussy.

49
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,820
Please calm down.

50
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,500
One by one please.

51
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,980
Eighteen missed calls,

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,940
all from VIPs!

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,450
I can't answer a single one!

54
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,660
No clue what to even say to them!

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,220
See? Another call coming in!

56
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,260
I can't answer it!

57
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,170
And look at this.

58
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,340
The operating room's in total disarray!

59
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,820
All appointments are canceled!

60
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,540
The surgery schedule's completely messed up!

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,570
All the consultants quit!

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,980
If we reschedule the surgeries,

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,890
who's gonna handle it?

64
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,340
Where do we even find people?

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,610
Maybe we should just take a break?

66
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,540
Two days off,

67
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,100
and everything'll magically fix itself!

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,690
A break?

69
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,170
Seriously?

70
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,060
Will a break solve the clients' problems?

71
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,170
But it can solve my problem.

72
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,980
Sis.

73
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,570
Everyone, listen up!

74
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,010
Today's walk-ins

75
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,410
go to Mengyuan.

76
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,130
Med assistants

77
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,690
and nurses handle triage.

78
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,610
Everyone else, drop your tasks

79
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,450
and sort client files and start making calls.

80
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,060
We'll reschedule everyone.

81
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,730
Chen Mingjie.

82
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,340
You're in charge.

83
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,890
OK.

84
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,980
Alright. Chen. Hurry up.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,730
Take over the coordination!

86
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,690
Why are you just standing there?

87
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,460
Move, move, move!

88
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,700
I'll be waiting in my office!

89
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,050
Got it.

90
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,370
Call every single one. No exceptions!

91
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,730
How's the setup working for you?

92
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,140
This desk is not large enough.

93
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,250
I'll swap it out.

94
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,610
Oh, and my office is right next door.

95
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,250
Tell me if you need anything.

96
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,730
Perhaps you don't need it.

97
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,580
You can solve all problems,

98
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,460
right?

99
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,810
Qing.

100
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,930
Book the biggest VIP room at Mingtang tonight.

101
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,540
We're throwing Ms. Li a welcome bash.

102
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,140
Okay.

103
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,930
Why's everyone loafing here?

104
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,660
No work downstairs?

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,410
Qing.

106
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,490
Take them to work.

107
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,340
OK.

108
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,020
Yes. Ms. Li.

109
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,410
OK.

110
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,140
Let's go.

111
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,170
I have no time.

112
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,850
The place is swamped,

113
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,220
and next month's booked solid!

114
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,290
That is so you.

115
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,900
No-nonsense efficiency.

116
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,140
But aren't we pushing too hard?

117
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,020
Qin and I've been tight for over ten years!

118
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,370
You are testing me?

119
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,100
My feelings for Gemu are deeper than yours.

120
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,540
But work's work.

121
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,850
Customers have their own ideas.

122
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,250
The market

123
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,290
sniffs out changes

124
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,290
faster than we blink.

125
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,290
If they're lining up at our door,

126
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,290
we don't say no.

127
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,850
Are double eyelid surgeries done under local or general anesthesia?

128
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,370
We usually go with local.

129
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,050
But how do I know

130
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,490
you'll be the one operating?

131
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,340
Local means you're awake

132
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,610
the whole time.

133
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,490
Why does this ‘lion dog' tattoo

134
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,460
look more like a tiger?

135
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,340
Because I wanted a tiger!

136
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,930
Now my friends ask me to hit the pool,

137
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,980
but I'm too embarrassed to go!

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,020
I can do the procedure

139
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,410
while we chat.

140
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,460
Chat?

141
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,810
That's creepy! Can you do it well?

142
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,170
I don't want to do now.

143
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,610
Just do the laser!

144
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,170
It might sting a bit.

145
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,290
How bad?

146
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,370
Worse than your tattoo sessions.

147
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,370
Rest up first.

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,730
Okay. Bye!

149
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,340
Bad news.

150
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,050
Cash flow's tight.

151
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,490
Three outstanding payments are due in two weeks,

152
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,050
and

153
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,050
doctor bonuses need to be paid by month-end.

154
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,140
What about you?

155
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,170
Today's client volume dropped 50%,

156
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,410
mostly first-time consultations.

157
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,050
Conversion rate's at zero.

158
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,930
Li Qi

159
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,780
took all our top clients.

160
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,460
The rest are still on the fence.

161
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,340
I could delay

162
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,810
those three payments.

163
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,930
No.

164
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,490
Pay them on time.

165
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,220
The rumor mill's already saying Gemu's sinking.

166
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,410
If we delay, it'll just fuel the fire.

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,580
All that matters is clients.

168
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,020
If we stabilize the traffic,

169
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,540
we survive. Understood?

170
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,100
Ms. Zhou. Mr. Qin.

171
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:16,900
Ms. Li.

172
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,340
This is a headache.

173
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,730
Ms. Zhou,

174
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,020
I was just about to find you.

175
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,020
I'm planning to move back home.

176
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,290
Stay.

177
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,050
I need you to temporarily lead the consulting department.

178
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,050
Three-month probation.

179
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,340
Pass it,

180
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,540
and you'll be Gemu's Operations Director.

181
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,340
Think it over.

182
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,410
These are all clients who've consulted online once or twice

183
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,170
but never visited.

184
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,370
Ms. Li is focused on existing clients,

185
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,140
so they didn't take this data.

186
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,220
The volume here

187
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,140
is massive,

188
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,020
and their willingness to visit is high.

189
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,410
Based on past data,

190
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,410
the conversion rates

191
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,780
crush new clients.

192
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,220
We should prioritize this.

193
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,460
Good.

194
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,130
What's this?

195
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,250
Ms. Qiao's been sending basic info packets

196
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,700
to first-time visitors.

197
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,890
Each QR code targets a specific service.

198
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,250
The feedback's been strong.

199
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,530
Impressive. Where is she now?

200
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,220
Her?

201
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,730
She's in Mr. Chu's office right now,

202
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,010
trying to talk him into doing a livestream.

203
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,820
She's really got some guts, huh?

204
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,530
You go ahead.

205
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,100
OK.

206
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,820
Your earlier ideas were solid.

207
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,370
You said some clients are price-sensitive,

208
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,940
while others prioritize safety.

209
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,890
Tailor your plans once you figure out their needs.

210
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,890
Spring Festival is around the corner.

211
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,700
Promote hyaluronic acid, botox…

212
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,820
Put them all in the featured slots.

213
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,060
Same with laser treatments,

214
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,530
short recovery time and quick results.

215
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,340
For surgeries, push double eyelid procedures.

216
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,980
Got it?

217
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,060
Go on.

218
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,370
By the way,

219
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,340
Earlier, you mentioned…

220
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,340
What exactly did Li Qi tell the regular clients?

221
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,940
She said Gemu is in trouble,

222
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,300
and might shut down any day.

223
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,220
Claims we can't even do one surgery a day now.

224
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,730
So even if they haven't switched to Jiao Ai,

225
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,130
the old clients are still hesitating.

226
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,850
Well.

227
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,850
Try to emphasize

228
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,250
Gemu's current strengths.

229
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,220
Strengths?

230
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,010
Our doctors are the same as before.

231
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,460
But now, clients can get treated the moment they walk in,

232
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,300
no waiting lists.

233
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,300
Their faces will recover after the Spring Festival.

234
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,650
I understand.

235
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,770
Hey babies!

236
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,100
Hit follow

237
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,340
and join my fan club!

238
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,340
Drop your questions in the chat.

239
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,180
I'll answer every one!

240
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,100
Move aside.

241
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,300
Hi babies!

242
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,300
Can he manage that?

243
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,220
Can he keep up with the trends of the young people?

244
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,850
I had intended to call Chen Mingjie to help him.

245
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,130
But he has already connected the mic.

246
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,650
He's spouting livestream catchphrases like a pro!

247
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,060
Hi babies!

248
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,650
Here to share some tips!

249
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,300
Ugh, he even added a filter! Look.

250
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,130
Now his face looks as sharp as Daniel Wu's!

251
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,650
Qiao Yang.

252
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,530
Mute the sound.

253
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,890
The echo's wrecking the livestream!

254
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,650
Fine, fine…

255
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,460
For frown lines,

256
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,890
check out Ms. Gao's results!

257
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,980
She looks more vibrant,

258
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,250
and her face is smoother now!

259
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,610
He is so funny!

260
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,100
I checked his phone.

261
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,370
12 hours of screen time daily.

262
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,130
Packages pile up at his door,

263
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,420
maybe all live-shopping hauls.

264
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,010
Who'd think

265
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,770
the "Med School Tyrant"

266
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,730
would turn into a livestream addict?

267
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,460
Hi babies!

268
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,530
Right.

269
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,250
The contrast is insane.

270
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,610
Back in school,

271
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,770
whenever I went to his office,

272
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,980
he was quite serious.

273
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,730
I'd only dare to stare at the floor tiles.

274
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,010
What impressed me most was

275
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,220
the patterns on those tiles!

276
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,370
The scariest part was joining him on rounds.

277
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,770
He'd ambush us with pop quizzes.

278
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,980
We'd stay up all night cramming,

279
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,890
guessing what he'd ask…

280
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,610
But...

281
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,300
We never guessed right.

282
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,010
Later, when we reached our third year of grad school

283
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,340
during department rotations...

284
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,850
Well.

285
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,010
I did rotations in Munich Uni

286
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,650
for years.

287
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,650
Honestly,

288
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,700
teachers back home were way nicer.

289
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,530
Really?

290
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,130
How'd you even get to Germany back then?

291
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,890
What kind of question is that? By plane, obviously!

292
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,010
Duh!

293
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,530
What, were you gonna walk there?

294
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,180
I meant how'd you afford to study abroad?

295
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,250
Why so curious?

296
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,060
Try to flip questions back at me

297
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,370
to dodge my questions?

298
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,650
Learned from you. You do the same thing!

299
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,890
Ugh. Talking to you

300
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,980
is so damn boring.

301
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,490
Double eyelid surgery doesn't require any hospital stay.

302
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,650
From the numbing shots to finishing up,

303
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,980
it's just over an hour.

304
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,890
You can go home right after the procedure.

305
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,420
Come back once midway to clean the incisions,

306
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,890
and practice gently opening and closing your eyes.

307
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,850
In five to seven days, we remove the stitches,

308
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,340
then the whole process is done.

309
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,890
OK.

310
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,010
Dr. Wei!

311
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,010
What are you busy with?

312
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,370
Explaining the difference

313
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,490
between hydra facials and photo rejuvenation.

314
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,250
What jawline slimming injections even are?

315
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,220
What's all this?

316
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,010
Ms. Qiao assigned us homework.

317
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,980
Everyone has to film ten educational videos.

318
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,100
I talk nonstop to clients

319
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,980
all day.

320
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,980
Now I have to rant into my phone at night.

321
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,530
Might as well switch careers and become a livestreamer.

322
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,370
Well, we've had a lot of

323
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,460
new clients lately.

324
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,370
Gotta communicate more.

325
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,340
It'll calm down once foot traffic stabilizes.

326
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,700
I heard Mr. Dong treated a patient

327
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,010
with a tiger tattoo.

328
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,370
Right now, I'm the tiger.

329
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,580
Watch out, I might bite!

330
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,130
Tigress.

331
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,730
Piss off.

332
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,340
Hey, wanna catch a movie?

333
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,180
Lu's client

334
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,180
gave several premiere tickets.

335
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,100
That Song Yuanyuan's new film.

336
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,820
She's gonna

337
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,770
blow up.

338
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,700
I should've asked for an autograph.

339
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,940
How? Let's go.

340
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,340
No.

341
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,010
I still have so many videos to film!

342
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,650
Well.

343
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,490
Such a waste.

344
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,700
Shuyang might

345
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,850
want to go.

346
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,420
Dream on.

347
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,730
What's the difference

348
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,180
between hydra facials and photo rejuvenation?

349
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,060
We haven't clocked out together

350
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,340
for a long time.

351
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,610
The other day when I was free, I thought

352
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,650
why don't we take a day off

353
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,980
and just hit the hot springs?

354
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,850
But now it's gotten

355
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,890
busy again.

356
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,300
Busy?

357
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,460
Doesn't feel that crowded to me.

358
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,890
Stay positive.

359
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,820
The trend's okay lately.

360
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,220
These things

361
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,060
take time.

362
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,130
What about you? What did you do today?

363
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,850
Consultations.

364
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,820
Another day of patient education.

365
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,650
All newbies now.

366
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,100
They can't even tell dermatology from surgery apart.

367
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,980
Ms. Qiao is obsessed with

368
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,300
filming those educational videos.

369
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,130
What?

370
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,420
Is she trying to rebuild from scratch?

371
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,460
Ms. Qiao's interesting, huh?

372
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,460
When she first arrived,

373
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,060
everyone thought

374
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,010
she'd quit soon.

375
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,180
Never expected her to care this much about the hospital now.

376
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,100
Ever thought about leaving?

377
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,460
Where to?

378
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,060
Home?

379
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,220
I don't wanna go home.

380
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,980
But my aunt keeps calling.

381
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,650
I've told her a million times.

382
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,250
I'm a surgeon.

383
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,820
She runs a beauty salon...

384
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,250
New message

385
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,650
from Jiao Ai HR.

386
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,850
Let it finish talking!

387
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,610
You try to pick a fight?

388
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,890
Just drive.

389
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,940
Jiao Ai's

390
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,890
stealing clients

391
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,980
and now poaching doctors?

392
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,490
Are you actually considering joining them?

393
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,700
Impossible.

394
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,100
You're not that type.

395
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,060
You'd miss me.

396
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,530
Even if you want to go,

397
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,700
you won't leave now.

398
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,940
What about me?

399
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,980
Will you ditch me?

400
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,650
When did you join Gemu?

401
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,820
When did Gemu start turning a profit?

402
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,770
Who knows better than me?

403
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,940
We fought side by side for years.

404
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,460
We ate every kind of dirt there is.

405
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,340
Jinsong,

406
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,770
you and I have a clear conscience about Gemu.

407
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,340
Ms. Li.

408
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,730
When it comes to

409
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,220
relationships, I've always been…

410
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,530
a butterfly flitting through flowers

411
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,300
without a single petal sticking.

412
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,010
But my work ethic?

413
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,370
You know I'm meticulous.

414
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,700
That you've seen firsthand.

415
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,250
You don't need to tell me.

416
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,980
Even a blind man could see it.

417
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,460
But look where it's gotten you now.

418
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,420
Watch everything you built

419
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,580
get torn apart,

420
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,820
It's disheartening.

421
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,340
Fancy hospitals,

422
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,340
lofty ideals,

423
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,060
they're just zeros.

424
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,300
Clients are the "1" in front.

425
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,850
Without that "1,"

426
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,100
all your zeros stay zeros.

427
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,340
Agreed.

428
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,220
A plastic surgeon's rule is simple.

429
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,980
Go

430
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,610
where the clients are.

431
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,420
The only person I'd regret leaving at Gemu is you.

432
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,530
Don't. Let's not dwell.

433
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,460
Back then, I pushed to put you in charge,

434
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,570
but too many jealous small minds

435
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,180
schemed behind the scenes.

436
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,490
Dirty details I won't air.

437
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,090
We're doctors,

438
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,330
not

439
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,980
politicians.

440
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,980
True.

441
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,090
But now I'm out.

442
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,140
Join Jiao Ai.

443
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,770
In three years, financial freedom.

444
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,090
Live in a garden forever.

445
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,570
Ms. Li.

446
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,010
That's one hell of a sales pitch,

447
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,220
Ms. Li.

448
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,900
Can I still trust you?

449
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,490
Head of Dermatology and co-director.

450
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,900
Salary double your Gemu pay.

451
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,140
If you're not scared of getting burned again,

452
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,180
trust me.

453
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,570
About your earlier concern,

454
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,900
there's nothing to worry about.

455
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,010
Our current liposuction program

456
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,860
uses ultrasound-assisted technology.

457
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,220
The targeted plans we've implemented

458
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,330
are showing solid results.

459
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,250
Foot traffic has rebounded to 60% of previous levels,

460
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,420
Mr. Chu's livestreams are driving.

461
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,050
There are lots of new clients.

462
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,980
But new client conversion rates

463
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,180
are still inconsistent.

464
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,980
New clients tend to be cautious.

465
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,570
But traffic itself is stabilizing.

466
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,290
Growth takes time.

467
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,620
You've already done excellent work.

468
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,420
Thanks for the effort.

469
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,290
Anything else needing my input?

470
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,570
Honestly, I'm stretched

471
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,730
too thin handling this alone.

472
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,140
I understand,

473
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,490
but the hospital's in a tight spot financially,

474
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,490
no budget for new hires.

475
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,290
I'll put you in charge of

476
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,330
all medical assistants.

477
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,620
We'll manage for now.

478
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,730
Alright. I'll and do my own things now.

479
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,380
Thank you!

480
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,730
When was the last radiation therapy session?

481
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,660
July last year.

482
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,700
Over a year ago.

483
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,940
Keep that on properly.

484
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,050
Any history of inflammation or infection?

485
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,770
No.

486
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,810
That's what scares me.

487
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,980
She keeps sneaking off to swim

488
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,050
and won't listen.

489
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,730
Swimming's actually beneficial.

490
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,730
It promotes lymphatic fluid circulation

491
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,980
in the upper limbs

492
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,530
and boosts physical fitness.

493
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,140
As long as it's done safely,

494
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,050
it's fine.

495
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,730
You hear that?

496
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,420
Only if it's safe!

497
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,770
You can swim, just not too often.

498
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,290
Look at you.

499
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,940
Why even bother swimming?

500
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,460
Alright, let's not lecture her here.

501
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,380
Let's discuss this in the office.

502
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,140
Okay.

503
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,140
Let's go.

504
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,010
Go!

505
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,180
The patient, Ding Manheng,

506
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,330
underwent a left mastectomy for breast cancer

507
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,250
a year and a half ago

508
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,050
and is now seeking breast reconstruction.

509
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:00,860
Her medical records.

510
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,570
They are clear.

511
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,140
The purpose of this meeting

512
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,940
is to gather

513
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,730
your opinions.

514
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,180
Dr. Meng.

515
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,380
Dr. Meng.

516
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,290
You're an expert in this field. Please share your opinion first.

517
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,730
Breast reconstruction after mastectomy typically involves two options.

518
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,420
Autologous tissue flap reconstruction

519
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,050
and implant-based reconstruction.

520
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,900
In some cases,

521
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,010
a hybrid approach is possible.

522
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,090
For this patient,

523
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,420
since her remaining soft tissue

524
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,530
is adequate,

525
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,290
either method could work.

526
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,730
Answer your phone.

527
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,660
Sorry,

528
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,180
I need to take this call.

529
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,180
OK. No problem.

530
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,660
Dr. Meng picked a convenient time to step out.

531
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,330
Although this is a major operation,

532
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,530
this be a breeze for Mr. Chu.

533
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,620
Why bother

534
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,900
gathering everyone?

535
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,180
Probably trying to

536
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,980
“boost team cohesion”

537
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,420
since we've been idle.

538
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,330
The patient is only 25 years old.

539
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,090
We should prioritize

540
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,140
aesthetic symmetry.

541
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,940
My suggestion is to use

542
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,730
a tissue expander combined with implant placement

543
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,420
for better shape control.

544
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,940
I disagree!

545
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,330
Precisely because she's young,

546
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,180
long-term outcomes matter more.

547
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,940
Autologous flaps

548
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,700
like the DIEP flap

549
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,660
offer far superior durability over implants.

550
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,940
I've also considered tissue flap reconstruction,

551
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,380
but which donor site to choose?

552
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,620
The latest DIEP flap

553
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,730
requires removing

554
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,380
the entire lower abdominal tissue.

555
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,010
She's young,

556
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,330
so we must consider her future fertility.

557
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,050
Why 优酷剧集英语 to the abdomen?

558
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,730
Her chest condition

559
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,570
might not fully accommodate a latissimus dorsi flap

560
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,860
without an implant anyway.

561
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,940
I haven't finished talking yet.

562
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,940
I propose the gluteal muscle flap instead.

563
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,180
Must you always go for

564
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,730
the most complex option?

565
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,700
The gluteal flap carries higher risks

566
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,900
and microsurgical precision.

567
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,420
If it fails,

568
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,530
she'll suffer twice.

569
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,420
Implants require expanders too!

570
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,660
Wear it for one to two months.

571
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,530
Plus weekly hospital visits

572
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,660
for saline injections.

573
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,380
Is that convenient?

574
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:17,940
Wait.

575
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,940
An autologous flap leaves a new scar.

576
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,180
Why add that

577
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,940
for a young woman?

578
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,730
What if

579
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,290
the scar's placement

580
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,180
is suboptimal?

581
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,050
I just think

582
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,420
we shouldn't

583
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,290
keep harping on

584
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,770
"young women needing to

585
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,810
avoid extra scars,"

586
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,220
"future fertility,"

587
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,730
or "ideal breast shape" every time we discuss this.

588
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,460
Fertility and breast shape

589
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,810
aren't universal priorities.

590
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,220
As doctors, we shouldn't keep forcing our assumptions

591
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,090
about what patients "should" want.

592
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,700
Right.

593
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,460
We should pay attention to the patient's needs

594
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,570
and communicate thoroughly.

595
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,180
But patients aren't experts,

596
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,090
we are.

597
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,010
We're doctors.

598
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,570
It's our duty to screen options

599
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,420
and provide the best possible medical plan for her.

600
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,770
Why do those two always clash?

601
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,900
Who's side are you even on?

602
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:56,980
Me?

603
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,980
Honestly, I don't see the harm.

604
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,980
At least the patient benefits either way.

605
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,050
Alright, alright. Arguing gets us nowhere.

606
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,330
Let's just follow Mr. Chu's call.

607
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,330
Well. Well.

608
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,010
Controversy is normal.

609
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,180
Both your proposals have merits.

610
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,420
Let's

611
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,810
refine them further,

612
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,250
listen to the patient's priorities

613
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,770
during her next consult,

614
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,180
then decide.

615
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,250
So,

616
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,330
which approach do you lean toward?

617
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,900
Luckily, I snag

618
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,980
these two chicken drumsticks.

619
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,140
You try to play the peacemakers?

620
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,460
No.

621
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,380
But your dynamic with Ms. Zhou

622
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,330
is complicated.

623
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,900
We don't wanna pick sides.

624
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,700
Complicated?

625
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,330
Every time something happens,

626
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,290
you two argue like cats and dogs,

627
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,460
then magically make up.

628
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,010
We end up looking like fools for intervening!

629
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,330
And when it really matters,

630
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,660
they always team up anyway.

631
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,330
Exactly!

632
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,010
Look,

633
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,900
Everyone thinks so.

634
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,620
Let me list examples.

635
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,330
Jiang Rong,

636
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,050
Lin Qiang,

637
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,570
Qi Dacheng

638
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,090
and Ding...

639
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,900
Ding Zhike!

640
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,220
Right, Ding Zhike!

641
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,900
I heard you and Ms. Zhou

642
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,810
even had a shouting match outside the bathroom!

643
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,290
Did you grow mouths

644
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,860
just to gossip?

645
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,050
Never this chatty during meetings!

646
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,940
Was that "shouting"?

647
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,980
We were having academic debates.

648
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,660
Academically, we're all on your side!

649
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,140
Right?

650
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,940
Absolutely!

651
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,420
I'm always on your side!

652
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,010
For the surgery, prep the flap reconstruction framework.

653
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,380
Draft a plan.

654
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,860
I'll do one too.

655
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,980
Let's discuss tomorrow afternoon.

656
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,180
Will Mr. Chu even let us operate?

657
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,090
He won't operate.

658
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,730
He's handing it out

659
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,380
to give everyone

660
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,730
a fair shot.

661
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,530
He wants to train all of us.

662
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,570
If our plans are solid

663
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,140
and the patient and her family agree,

664
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,730
the surgery is ours.

665
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,530
Nail the proposal,

666
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,010
and I'll let you lead.

667
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,460
M-me?

668
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,420
Good move.

669
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,010
Great. Go for it!

670
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,730
300 double eyelids were not in vain.

671
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,770
Of course.

672
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,860
Laymen think it's simple,

673
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,290
but it demands precision and aesthetic sense.

674
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,180
The eye's contours are complex.

675
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,090
Static and dynamic balance.

676
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,380
Those 300 cases

677
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,330
prove you're capable.

678
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,860
Thank you, Ms. Qiao

679
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,010
Prepare well.

680
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,980
Tomorrow's scar surgery,

681
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,730
you'll co-lead with me.

682
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,290
I've already informed the patient.

683
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,860
Don't worry, Ms. Qiao.

684
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,530
I won't let you down.

685
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,180
Ms. Qiao.

686
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,180
What about me?

687
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,290
Keep assisting in rounds.

688
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,180
Why's there never any chicken drumsticks?

689
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,860
What the hell?

690
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,380
We heard that Dong's joining Jiao Ai.

691
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,530
Honestly, it's no surprise.

692
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,140
He's always been tight with Ms. Li

693
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,530
Back when the others left,

694
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,290
everyone was shocked he stayed behind.

695
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,620
Hold on, don't swing yet!

696
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,940
Let me snap a photo.

697
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,900
Pose properly!

698
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,290
No, no. Don't look at me!

699
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,940
Okay. One, two, three!

700
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,530
Okay.

701
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,570
Dong.

702
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,050
See?

703
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,250
Almost! Almost!

704
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,330
You have influenced me.

705
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,220
Never mind if the ball went in.

706
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,770
Your stance earlier

707
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,730
was nice!

708
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,660
This turf's nice.

709
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,460
How much did it cost?

710
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,290
A pretty penny.

711
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,090
Hey,

712
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,420
come to my place sometime.

713
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,860
I'll give you this set.

714
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,420
I've got a 3D immersive simulator setup

715
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,900
at home.

716
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,810
That's very good.

717
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:38,940
Not bad.

718
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,770
Let me try.

719
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,330
Here you are.

720
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,570
Let me try.

721
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,700
The stance you said earlier...

722
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,010
How to play it?

723
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,980
Bend your knees a bit.

724
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,530
Bend your knees a bit.

725
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,530
Yeah, lean forward.

726
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,490
One, two, three!

727
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,380
Pretty good.

728
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,180
Almost!

729
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,010
Want some tea?

730
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,090
Nah,

731
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,420
I'll keep practicing.

732
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,700
Dong.

733
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,980
I'll say it straight.

734
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,010
Jiao Ai isn't the right fit for you.

735
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,490
I had dinner with them on Sunday

736
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,140
but you only came to me now.

737
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,140
That's not exactly sincere.

738
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,050
Wait.

739
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,180
You haven't left yet.

740
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,660
That means you're still hesitant.

741
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,290
Am I?

742
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,570
I didn't even realize.

743
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,620
You two know Gemu's situation

744
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,860
better than I do.

745
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,700
Jiao Ai has money and clients.

746
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,180
Of course it's a safer

747
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,620
and more stable choice.

748
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,220
Plus, my relationship with Ms. Li

749
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,380
is rock-solid.

750
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,620
I've known Li Qi longer than you.

751
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,900
Trust me.

752
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,940
If you go there, you'll be on your own.

753
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,180
At Jiao Ai,

754
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,010
you'll have to obey her every word.

755
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,900
But at Gemu?

756
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,420
You'd run the entire dermatology department.

757
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,050
Come, drink.

758
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,730
We've known each other for years.

759
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,330
If you have concerns,

760
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,620
just say it.

761
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,090
These are

762
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,490
Jiao Ai's terms.

763
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,900
Let me have a look.

764
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,570
I can discuss this with Tang.

765
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,810
Nothing's off the table.

766
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,730
Qin.

767
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,980
After working together this long,

768
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,290
do you really think I care only about money?

769
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,770
I'll practice some more.

770
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,140
Dong's skills are solid, patient complaints are low.

771
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,660
I've got no issue with him becoming the director.

772
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,220
If double the signing bonus,

773
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,290
we'd have to tough it out.

774
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,460
But 50-50 profit split?

775
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,860
Is he out of his mind?

776
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,250
Lower your voice.

777
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,180
The problem is if we refuse,

778
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,940
he leaves.

779
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,050
Weren't you the “master mediator”?

780
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,570
You agreed so fast.

781
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,700
What will other doctors think?

782
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,940
How do we run the hospital?

783
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,620
Dong's performance carries this hospital.

784
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,810
This is the truth.

785
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,290
Last month alone,

786
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,530
his revenue

787
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,980
made up a third of dermatology.

788
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,900
Losing any doctor now

789
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,220
is a blow,

790
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,980
let alone him.

791
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,330
But you folded too quickly.

792
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,140
You said you'd discuss it with Tang.

793
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,010
You agreed almost instantly!

794
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,940
Now we're backed into a corner!

795
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,290
Aren't we already cornered?

796
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,730
Jingwen.

797
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,860
Wake up.

798
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,660
This isn't the time for pride.

799
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,250
Now I remember that movie,

800
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,530
Click.

801
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,380
I wish I had that remote,

802
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,490
fast-forward a year

803
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,940
to see if we're dead or alive.

804
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,460
At least it'd end the agony.

805
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,250
Fine. I'll talk to Dong.

806
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,730
Wait.

807
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,770
Have you seen the agreement?

808
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,090
The lawyer advises

809
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,940
not to touch equity shares given the hospital's state.

810
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,570
So Dong becomes the director,

811
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,730
you keep the shares.

812
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,570
What about me?

813
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,490
Tired? Take a break.

814
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,290
No.

815
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,250
I haven't finished the surgical plan yet.

816
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,460
What about you? How far have you gotten?

817
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,180
I'm on the pathology analysis.

818
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,380
You're still on pathology analysis?

819
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,050
For implants, the hurdles are limited,

820
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,180
unlike your flap reconstruction.

821
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,050
The procedure itself is already challenging enough,

822
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,900
plus you have to worry about postoperative blood supply.

823
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,330
And Ms. Qiao insists on using the gluteal muscle!

824
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,530
Watch out.

825
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,770
Just the nerve mapping alone will drive you up the wall.

826
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,700
Seriously, my brain's

827
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,090
about to explode.

828
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,050
Let me see Sun Xiao's old plan

829
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,860
you worked on.

830
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,730
With you grinding this hard,

831
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,290
you're not planning to leave anymore, huh?

832
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,140
Never said I had to leave.

833
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,220
I knew it.

834
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,180
Where'd you get stuck? I'll help.

835
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,220
Don't touch it.

836
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,530
I've got my own approach.

837
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,570
Go do your thing.

838
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,530
God, I love how stubbornly focused you are.

839
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,530
My plan's done.

840
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,290
Yours?

841
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,490
Weren't we competing?

842
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,330
Let's just go with yours.

843
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,860
It's good.

844
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,010
You were so adamant this morning.

845
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,050
I haven't changed,

846
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,010
respecting your expertise.

847
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,250
Thank you!

848
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,380
Wait.

849
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,380
Did the hospital hit another crisis?

850
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,220
Did Li Qi poach more staff?

851
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,090
Stop hiding it.

852
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,770
Everyone knows.

853
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,490
Dong?

854
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,380
Yes.

855
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,980
He's becoming Gemu's director.

856
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,330
Announcement tomorrow.

857
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,660
Director?

858
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,620
Him?

859
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,730
That guy's all smoke and mirrors,

860
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,290
but maybe he's perfect for it.

861
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,290
Didn't expect you

862
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,730
to give up so fast.

863
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,620
I can do nothing.

864
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,730
That's not like you.

865
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,570
Here.

866
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,810
Use this truth-telling mirror to really see yourself.

867
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,570
You really are a monster.

868
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,090
At our age,

869
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,700
shouldn't we

870
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,570
be freer?

871
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,220
We've got money, health

872
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,660
and could live anywhere.

873
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,900
But life

874
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,250
never goes as planned.

875
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,090
Back in med school,

876
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,650
I thought

877
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,780
being a doctor

878
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,130
meant controlling my fate.

879
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,490
How naive.

880
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,900
You never know

881
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,780
where fate shoves you.

882
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,860
Know what modern people can't live without?

883
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,940
Phones.

884
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,090
No. Instruction manuals.

885
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,340
Machines have guides,

886
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,170
recipes for cooking,

887
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,260
game walkthroughs,

888
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,130
even chairs

889
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,420
come with “how to sit” directions.

890
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,900
But the things that matter

891
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,980
have no manuals.

892
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,300
Life's the same.

893
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,130
What's the fun in controlling fate?

894
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:46,380
Unboxing life's mystery is the thrill.

895
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,650
Instruction manuals?

896
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,130
Didn't I say it all along?

897
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,210
Our surgery department can never outshine others.

898
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,210
In the end, the director still went with Mr. Dong.

899
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,690
After all this hustling,

900
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,740
new tech, TV appearances,

901
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,980
it still comes down to performance numbers.

902
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,740
I heard Mr. Dong was about to leave anyway.

903
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,460
To keep him, he was made the director.

904
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,460
But

905
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,740
I still prefer Ms. Qiao.

906
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,260
Whoever becomes the director,

907
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,530
as long as they handle payroll,

908
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,860
they're a good director in my book.

909
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,210
Ms. Zhou,

910
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,740
You two keep talking then.

911
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,010
Well.

912
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,170
You wanted me?

913
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,860
Got the new contract printed.

914
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,860
Need your signature.

915
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,260
Sure thing. Anytime.

916
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,900
Mr. Dong,

917
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,980
have you considered moving to Li Qi's old office?

918
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,380
Better sunlight there.

919
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,420
No need.

920
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,860
My current space works.

921
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,260
Ms. Zhou,

922
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,900
There's something you and

923
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,420
Mr. Qin should know.

924
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,010
What's that?

925
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,260
That dinner with Li Qi... it wasn't me.

926
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,860
Someone from your surgery department was there.

927
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,090
Mr. Dong.

928
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,010
Ms. Li.

929
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:49,860
What a coincidence.

930
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,260
You're an interesting one.

931
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,530
Turned down our formal invitation, yet here you are.

932
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,650
I thought you were loyal to Germu.

933
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,210
What's Bai paying you?

934
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,690
Payment?

935
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,090
He's joking!

936
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,090
Just friends catching up.

937
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,170
Seriously.

938
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,570
You really won't consider my offer?

939
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,260
Look at Du,

940
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,260
living his best life at Jiao Ai.

941
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,900
Yeah,

942
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,010
he's thriving alright.

943
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,490
Fishing daily,

944
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,170
face tanned

945
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,980
two shades darker.

946
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,690
If you...

947
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,940
Ms. Li.

948
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,260
Jiao Ai is

949
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,650
perfect for you.

950
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,940
Strong cash flow, marketing-driven.

951
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,570
You'd shine there!

952
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,820
What can I do there?

953
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,650
Consultants bring clients

954
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,010
and design plans.

955
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,940
What about me?

956
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,900
I'd just be a cog in the machine handling injections and lasers.

957
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,780
Sure,

958
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,170
I'm good at being a tool.

959
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,610
I'll get tired of it

960
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,340
after a while.

961
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,130
Look at you, Dong!

962
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,940
Getting more idealistic

963
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,420
with age?

964
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,690
Idealistic?

965
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,170
Ms. Li.

966
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,820
Who were you dining with earlier?

967
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,300
You still placed small fish here.

968
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,650
From Germu?

969
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,050
Relax,

970
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,900
not from your dermatology department.

971
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,740
Didn't you ask her?

972
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,820
Would she even tell?

973
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,010
But honestly,

974
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,650
why lie?

975
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,940
If not dermatology,

976
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,340
must be from surgery.

977
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,260
Ms. Zhou,

978
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,860
heard any rumors?

979
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,340
The fruits haven't arrived yet?

980
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,570
Let me call.

981
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,420
No need!

982
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,050
This is an emergency to save money.

983
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,530
I canceled deliveries.

984
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,420
What?

985
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,130
What do you mean?

986
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,980
I just took office!

987
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,130
By doing this,

988
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,010
people'll think I'm penny-pinching!

989
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,260
It's all my fualt. All fight?

990
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:01,980
Wait.

991
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,130
This is all because you took

992
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,740
that huge signing bonus!

993
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,130
Why not take less?

994
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,740
No no, I...

995
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,170
Wait, this feels like

996
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,740
a setup!

997
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,260
You've seen the reports.

998
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,340
Unpaid

999
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,530
supplier balances,

1000
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,130
doctors' year-end bonuses,

1001
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,170
and unstable client flow.

1002
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,090
What other options do we have?

1003
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,940
Ugh...

1004
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,530
You should've told me about this situation earlier!

1005
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,650
The hospital's performance

1006
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,050
is under pressure this year.

1007
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,490
For operational sustainability,

1008
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,090
we've had to cut costs

1009
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,940
after careful board review.

1010
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,130
Is that all?

1011
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,130
Yeah.

1012
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,460
I'm getting these for Ms. Zhou.

1013
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,260
These won't be enough!

1014
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,860
We used to get two packs of printer paper monthly,

1015
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,530
and get pens

1016
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,300
whenever we ran out.

1017
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,780
How's this supposed to last a whole month?

1018
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,780
Sign here.

1019
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,010
Ms. Wang.

1020
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,490
Is the coffee machine broken?

1021
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,300
Read the notice.

1022
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,610
On the coffee machine.

1023
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,820
Where are the snacks and candies

1024
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,740
that used to be here?

1025
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,650
Water for now.

1026
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,650
I'll restock later.

1027
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,210
No bottled water?

1028
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,490
In our assessment,

1029
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,010
we've prepared two surgical plans.

1030
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,300
Personally,

1031
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,340
I advocate for autologous tissue flap transplantation.

1032
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,780
Excuse me,

1033
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,130
I've reviewed your video.

1034
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,490
Ms. Qiao,

1035
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,650
you trained under Mr. Chu, correct?

1036
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,690
Ms. Qiao

1037
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,490
is indeed an expert in this field.

1038
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,780
I'd like to

1039
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,980
let Ms. Qiao lead this procedure.

1040
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,130
I know.

1041
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,490
Ms. Qiao stands as

1042
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,010
a leading figure among mid-career experts.

1043
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,300
I've also read Third Hospital Fang Ting's paper.

1044
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,260
Later you guided her through the face replacement surgery.

1045
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,170
Impressive research skills.

1046
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,260
I am in charge of human resources at my workplace.

1047
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,610
I've no objections to your operating,

1048
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,860
provided Mr. Chu oversees the entire process.

1049
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,650
Absolutely.

1050
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,490
Don't worry.

1051
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,010
You mentioned another option?

1052
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,380
Can I have a look?

1053
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,010
Certainly.

1054
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:28,820
Here.

1055
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,980
The alternative

1056
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,170
proposes prosthetic implantation.

1057
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,130
Its advantages include...

1058
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,650
Sorry. Wait.

1059
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,340
Is the doctor who drafted this second plan available?

1060
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,690
Today's consultation focuses on

1061
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,010
comparing both approaches.

1062
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,170
If you

1063
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,130
prefer prosthetics later,

1064
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,490
we'll arrange specialist consultations.

1065
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,690
Unnecessary. We've researched.

1066
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,090
Flap transplantation

1067
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,460
suits our needs better.

1068
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,980
We're here

1069
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,340
to understand your workflow.

1070
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,940
Mom, let the doctors finish.

1071
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,490
Isn't communication supposed to be two-way?

1072
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,490
Don't they want patients

1073
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,940
who come prepared?

1074
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,010
I don't mean it that way.

1075
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:06,610
The doctors...

1076
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,610
Your way of thinking is fundamentally flawed.

1077
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,010
You never plan ahead for anything,

1078
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,740
only trying to solve problems when they arise.

1079
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,010
And your lifestyle habits...

1080
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,380
I've told you countless times.

1081
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,780
You must sleep by 11 PM every night,

1082
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,420
so your body organs can detoxify.

1083
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,860
Now you're stunned by this illness, aren't you?

1084
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,210
If not for this kind of thinking,

1085
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,740
how could you get this disease at this age?

1086
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,420
Ms. Tian,

1087
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,490
let's focus on solving the problem at hand.

1088
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,570
After all, contracting this illness

1089
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,490
is something no one could have anticipated.

1090
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,490
But she was different.

1091
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,420
My daughter's always been

1092
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,010
a perfect child.

1093
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,170
Never skipped school, no boyfriends in her teens,

1094
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,340
never stepped into gaming arcades.

1095
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,490
And she wouldn't even go near internet bar.

1096
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,420
She's always had good character since she was little,

1097
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,780
smoothly got into university,

1098
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,130
and never gave me a day's worry.

1099
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,490
I thought my job was done

1100
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,980
after her graduation

1101
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,490
and marriage.

1102
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,130
But now? She hasn't even graduated yet.

1103
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,010
Everything I planned is crumbling.

1104
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,610
Ms. Tian,

1105
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,860
shall we continue?

1106
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:58,650
My apologies.

1107
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,460
Please, you take the lead.
