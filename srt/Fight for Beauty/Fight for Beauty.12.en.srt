1
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,290
I remember when we were in school,

2
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,620
you mentioned that there was no one left in your family.

3
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,570
Yeah, my dad ran away, and my mom passed away.

4
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,490
What about your siblings?

5
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,820
I don't have any.

6
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,050
That's really strange.

7
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,930
This old lady

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,930
insists that she's your mom.

9
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,980
She says now that you're famous and rich,

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,820
you won't recognize her.

11
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,330
She's tried to meet you several times, but you wouldn't see her.

12
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,620
Is she crazy?

13
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,210
But she left her phone number with the front desk.

14
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,770
You could call and ask her about it.

15
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,570
Why?

16
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,450
I have so many cases to handle, I can't finish them all.

17
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,780
Besides, it's just some crazy old lady.

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,340
I feel she looks...

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,060
Mr. Kang,

20
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,170
did you receive the documents?

21
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,290
Yes.

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,690
that producer, Guo Xuan.

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,690
Have you seen it?

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,730
Exactly.

25
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,410
Stop being so polite.

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,410
If you have any problems in the next couple of days,

27
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,540
feel free to ask me.

28
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,500
Don't be afraid to go home.

29
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,450
You haven't done anything wrong.

30
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,890
You haven't hurt anyone.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,130
Chin up,

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,690
be confident.

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,660
You're back, Ms. Qiao.

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,290
What's up?

35
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,540
There's something.

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,570
We have a charity clinic for small ear deformities every year.

37
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,410
You know about it, right?

38
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,060
Yes.

39
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,170
Originally, Li was supposed to go,

40
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,980
but his wife is giving birth.

41
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,340
He asked me to step in last minute.

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,290
I'm flying out tonight.

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,890
A charity clinic, that's a good thing.

44
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,100
What's that got to do with me?

45
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,450
My son, Dadan,

46
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,410
he's afraid he'd get scared and can't sleep after I leave.

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,660
Then find a Nanny.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,730
You don't want me to go, do you?

49
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,540
Your son is already afraid. If I go,

50
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,850
he'll be even more scared.

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,500
Well, you see,

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,220
professionally, you're the director,

53
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,060
and I'm an employee.

54
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,890
Shouldn't you help me with my personal matters?

55
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,130
Personally,

56
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,450
last time, that 5G issue

57
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,610
really delayed my time

58
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,260
with my son.

59
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,260
In reality,

60
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,010
Dadan is very mischievous.

61
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,220
Most people can't handle him.

62
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,290
Only someone fierce like you can.

63
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,820
Sorry.

64
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,220
I don't get involved in colleagues' personal matters.

65
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,850
Really?

66
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,010
But you asked me to attend

67
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,340
your sister's wedding last time.

68
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,890
That was an exception.

69
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,730
Anyway, I can't look after kids.

70
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,850
I'm only helping you out

71
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,500
for the sake of those children

72
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,890
with microtia in Kangdan Grassland.

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,940
Did you hear that?

74
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,610
I heard it.

75
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,540
This is the last time.

76
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,220
Sure.

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,890
Next time,

78
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,130
I'll write an article praising you

79
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,340
and post it on our hospital's website.

80
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,260
The title will be:

81
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,890
"Kind-Hearted Director—

82
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,890
Going Above and Beyond to Support Employees' Families."

83
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,660
How does that sound?

84
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,010
What do you mean "going above and beyond"?

85
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,100
Didn't you say

86
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,890
this trip would only take a day and a half?

87
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,260
How long is it exactly?

88
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,130
My house has a fingerprint lock.

89
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,610
Dadan will show you how to use it.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,780
Is it out of battery?

91
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,050
Dadan!

92
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,220
Dadan, open the door.

93
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,900
Password?

94
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,700
To protect the world from devastation!

95
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,220
To unite all peoples within our nation!

96
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,220
To denounce the evils of truth and love!

97
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,250
The lovable and charming villains!

98
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,900
Musashi!

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,730
Have you eaten, Kojiro?

100
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,580
I have.

101
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,930
You two are seriously something else...

102
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,490
from another dimension.

103
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,290
Dadan, come say hi.

104
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,460
Dad, you brought your girlfriend home?

105
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,780
Isn't this the same woman from last time?

106
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,170
Stop talking nonsense. This is my boss,

107
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,700
the director.

108
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,580
Wow, what?

109
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,170
I'm on a business trip these two days, and she'll be staying with you.

110
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,850
What?

111
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,410
Dad, she's of the opposite sex!

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,780
We're on the same page.

113
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,140
I'm off now, bye!

114
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:01,930
Bye!

115
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,250
Wait!

116
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,050
Don't go!

117
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,810
Listen,

118
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,900
you have no say in this.

119
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,020
For the next two days, listen to Auntie.

120
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,850
Boss,

121
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,020
if everything goes smoothly,

122
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,100
I'll be back in two days.

123
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,100
Two days?

124
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,370
I'll kill you!

125
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,580
Didn't you say a day and a half?

126
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,930
Boss Auntie,

127
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,580
Go take two packs of butterfly noodles from the fridge.

128
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,370
Two packs?

129
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,930
Got it.

130
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,100
The fridge is so organized.

131
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,850
There are no butterfly noodles.

132
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,250
You can't even handle such a small thing.

133
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,780
I'll do it.

134
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,100
Aren't they right here?

135
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,220
Boss Auntie.

136
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,220
What's the use of having such big eyes?

137
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,930
Can we discuss something?

138
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,660
Can you stop calling me "Auntie" all the time?

139
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,020
Can't you just call me by my name instead?

140
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,810
Aren't you older than my dad?

141
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,460
You're too young

142
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,410
to be stressing about age like that.

143
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,460
Even your dad calls me "baby."

144
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,700
So what are you gonna call me?

145
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,140
"Baby Auntie."

146
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,980
Alright, you win.

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,980
Let me introduce ourselves. My name's Qiao Yang.

148
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,980
What's your name?

149
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,900
Lu Dayi.

150
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,810
Lu Dayi?

151
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,140
"Da" as in big,

152
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,140
and "Yi" as in one?

153
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,980
Did your dad have you when he was

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,140
a college freshman?

155
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,460
The phrase "The greatest encompasses everything—that's "Dayi".

156
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,250
Dadan means zero.

157
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,980
"Before heaven and earth were separated,

158
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,290
there was the primordial chaos."

159
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,580
It's from The Book of Rites.

160
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,660
You're the boss, you should know this,

161
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,540
right, Qiao Yang?

162
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,100
Got it.

163
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,580
So you're "Zero", huh?

164
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,340
Didn't I tell you to let it cool before eating?

165
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,050
What's wrong?

166
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,610
What's wrong?

167
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,020
Why are you crying?

168
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,370
Mom, what are you doing?

169
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,220
What's the point of a girl studying?

170
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,050
I know, don't worry.

171
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,220
Jingwen is back.

172
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,140
I tried calling you, but you didn't answer.

173
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,700
I dropped my phone, and it broke.

174
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,900
Here.

175
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,340
Say hi to mom.

176
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:57,660
Mom.

177
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,410
Jingwen,

178
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,290
why are you back so late?

179
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,250
What did you have for dinner?

180
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,610
You can't keep eating takeout every day.

181
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,250
Your health isn't great to begin with.

182
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,540
If this keeps up, it'll be a problem.

183
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,410
You haven't been home in a long time, have you?

184
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,490
You didn't even come back when your cousin got married last time.

185
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,700
Everyone was asking about you.

186
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,490
Mom,

187
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,850
let's not talk about this.

188
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,780
Jingwen has been really busy lately.

189
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,930
Mom,

190
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,050
did you finish the fish oil I bought for you?

191
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,900
I can't even finish all the stuff you send me.

192
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,340
I just miss you both.

193
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,410
Next time you have a break, you must come back.

194
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,650
Alright, you two take your time chatting.

195
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,130
Son,

196
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,460
Jingwen doesn't look very happy.

197
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,420
Did something happen between you two?

198
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,180
It's nothing.

199
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,700
She's just been really tired lately.

200
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,130
Sleep already?

201
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,340
I was thinking... maybe we should go home

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,370
for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

203
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,610
It's been a year since you last visited my family.

204
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,580
Has it really been that long?

205
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,250
I didn't even feel it.

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,890
What's wrong?

207
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,980
My mom didn't say anything just now, did she?

208
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,130
She knows you don't like hearing it.

209
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,300
She doesn't even dare to bring up kids around you anymore.

210
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,700
What's wrong?

211
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,250
Nothing.

212
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,420
Didn't you just say?

213
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,300
I'm just tired.

214
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,130
Top students always claim they don't study hard.

215
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,820
Free flap surgery for hemifacial atrophy repair.

216
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,850
You're a true top student.

217
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,940
Even before surgery, you have to study first.

218
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,130
Want me to highlight the key points for you?

219
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,730
No need.

220
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,300
I like having control over everything myself.

221
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,890
This is a company specializing in

222
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,420
3D-printed medical devices.

223
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,340
It's one of the top companies in the country.

224
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,980
As long as you agree

225
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,460
to use their products in surgery,

226
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,220
they'll provide free technical support.

227
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,250
They'll even pay you an extra fee.

228
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,060
Dr. Zhou,

229
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,220
why are you so enthusiastic about this?

230
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,340
Because I also wanna have control

231
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,460
over what I do.

232
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,060
Liu Miao,

233
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,580
I understand you.

234
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,940
I get why you're full of hostility toward the world.

235
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,940
I used to be just like you.

236
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,250
Always on guard.

237
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,370
Always speaking in a way that came off aggressive.

238
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,980
Because we don't trust people.

239
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,940
We'd rather hurt others first

240
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,300
than be the ones getting hurt.

241
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,580
Self-disclosure.

242
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,580
Using personal revelations

243
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,770
to build rapport with the listener.

244
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,700
It's basic psychology.

245
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,130
But you got it wrong.

246
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,940
I'm not like you.

247
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,850
You know the phrase, "If you're ugly, you need to study harder"?

248
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,850
Do you know what's even crueler?

249
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,420
"Strong will despite physical disability."

250
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,060
But that phrase is actually very accurate.

251
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,580
Ever since my face became like this,

252
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,340
I've become much stronger than before.

253
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,580
I get it now.

254
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,250
It's not that you don't trust people.

255
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,250
You just don't want their pity.

256
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,820
You'd rather have people dislike you, fear you.

257
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,850
That's why you threaten me

258
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,700
and impose strict conditions on me.

259
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,460
Because you don't wanna owe me anything.

260
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,300
The heaviest burden in this world is favor.

261
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,370
Once you accept someone's kindness,

262
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,730
you have to live the way they expect you to.

263
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,730
If you don't wanna owe me, then help me.

264
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,700
Make me owe you instead.

265
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,300
This competition is very important to me.

266
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,340
I want you to help me win.

267
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,940
Hello, everyone!

268
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,250
Welcome to the special broadcast

269
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,580
of the 7th Xinyi Lige Cup

270
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,490
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery

271
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,940
Young Doctors Competition,

272
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,130
sponsored by Xinyi Lige and Planck.

273
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,580
I'm your host, Guo Xuan.

274
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,580
This competition

275
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,130
is like the ultimate showdown

276
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,980
in the plastic surgery industry.

277
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,060
Every year, it gathers the top experts in the field.

278
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,730
Today, we have

279
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,220
our first group of contestants.

280
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,220
Two doctors from Gemu Plastic Surgery Hospital.

281
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,060
Let's welcome them with a round of applause!

282
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,300
Hello, everyone.

283
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,300
I'm Zhou Jingwen, director of Plastic Surgeon

284
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,180
at Gemu.

285
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,890
Hello, everyone.

286
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,650
I'm Qiao Yang, a plastic surgeon at Gemu.

287
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,370
The theme of this round is "The Transplantation of Beauty."

288
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,010
How do we transplant beauty?

289
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,700
Interestingly,

290
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,650
these two cases is called "Two Lives, One Bloom."

291
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,580
One is a party girl whose life

292
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,820
took a tragic turn.

293
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,180
The other is a genius student admitted to a top university,

294
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,180
seeking to make up for regrets.

295
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,610
Before the competition,

296
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,490
we received many questions

297
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,340
from online viewers.

298
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,180
A question for Hao Xin:

299
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,300
If you hadn't gone to that nightclub that night,

300
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,100
wouldn't it have reduced your chances

301
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,420
of being harmed?

302
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,370
Maybe right now,

303
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,850
she'd still be in school,

304
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,770
living a completely different life.

305
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,060
This is a question worth reflecting on

306
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,650
for every young girl.

307
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,220
Hao Xin, I wanna ask you,

308
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,100
do you regret

309
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,420
wearing revealing clothes?

310
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,220
Do you regret going to the bar that night?

311
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,460
Come over here, shoot over there.

312
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,770
I don't regret it.

313
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,530
Why should I regret it?

314
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,700
Isn't your question

315
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,980
a little inappropriate?

316
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,940
Let me answer that.

317
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,100
Sorry.

318
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,490
I'm Qiao Yang, Hao Xin's attending physician.

319
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,980
The question the host just asked

320
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,940
is a common online narrative.

321
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,770
When a girl experiences sexual harassment

322
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,460
or even assault,

323
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,980
people always assume it's because she was too pretty

324
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,580
or dressed too provocatively.

325
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,730
But to me,

326
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,250
that is absolute nonsense.

327
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,610
Especially when such words

328
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,980
come from the mouth

329
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,220
of another woman,

330
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,940
it's incredibly disappointing.

331
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,730
No one questions the perpetrator.

332
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,460
Yet our victim

333
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,770
is still sitting here,

334
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,330
facing doubt from others,

335
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,860
being repeatedly judged by public opinion.

336
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,220
This is extremely unfair.

337
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,290
If it were me,

338
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,490
I'd wanna

339
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,090
burn this whole studio down.

340
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,810
But no matter how strong my empathy is,

341
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,730
I still can't imagine

342
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,180
the despair she felt

343
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,900
at the very moment of the incident.

344
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,330
I can't even imagine,

345
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,810
if it had been me,

346
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,530
what would I have done?

347
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,810
I interact with all kinds of people every day.

348
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,490
And in my experience,

349
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,490
most of them look perfectly normal,

350
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,460
nothing wrong with them.

351
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,660
But usually,

352
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,860
they are deeply dissatisfied with themselves,

353
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,250
even to the point of self-loathing.

354
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,700
That's why I always say, plastic surgeons

355
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,380
don't just reshape faces; we heal hearts.

356
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,940
"Appearance comes from the heart, and circumstances change with the mind."

357
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,090
In fact, in my eyes,

358
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,250
there are no patients in this world,

359
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,250
only people.

360
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,380
Every single person is unique,

361
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,940
irreplaceable.

362
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,380
I don't know much about the show.

363
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,090
But as a plastic surgeon,

364
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,730
I wanna give Hao Xin

365
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,180
a piece of professional advice today.

366
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,290
Always remember, you are precious.

367
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,460
Even if the whole world stops believing in you,

368
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,660
there is still one person you can trust.

369
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,140
That person is yourself.

370
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,700
Your doctor fell right into the show's trap.

371
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,180
Creating public controversy

372
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,490
is exactly what they wanted.

373
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,900
But then again, maybe not.

374
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,570
Maybe they had a script all along,

375
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,620
and they were just acting it out.

376
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,810
The effect turned out pretty good, too.

377
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,010
You remind me of my childhood best friend.

378
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,010
We played together from elementary school to high school.

379
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,490
But later, I dropped out.

380
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,010
We lost touch after that.

381
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,420
She was just like you, she knew everything.

382
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,530
I don't know everything.

383
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,380
These kinds of things,

384
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,180
I don't understand any of them.

385
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,180
You don't know how to do makeup?

386
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,530
Makeup is easy! Come on.

387
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,140
I'll teach you.

388
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,620
I'll show you what all these things are.

389
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,250
This is concealer.

390
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,530
It covers up any blemishes

391
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,730
on your face.

392
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,980
And this is blush.

393
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,290
You can apply it

394
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,010
anywhere you want.

395
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,460
If you want red around your eyes,

396
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,530
just put it on your eyelids.

397
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,620
It's adjustable,

398
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,900
very flexible

399
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,900
and professional.

400
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,290
Professionals

401
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,530
usually use a big palette like this.

402
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,730
But for everyday use,

403
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,530
it's enough.

404
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,620
We just use a small one,

405
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,010
These are all blush shades, you can...

406
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,140
Finally made it back in time!

407
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,250
Thank heavens, and thank you.

408
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,490
These past few nights

409
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,730
have been absolute chaos.Must've been tough.

410
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,050
Thanks for the effort.

411
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,810
Having a woman in the house really makes a difference.

412
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,940
My home hasn't been this clean in ages.

413
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,860
No other women have ever been here before?

414
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,530
Only nanny.

415
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,460
What about your ex-wife? Dadan's mom?

416
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,420
Never.

417
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,490
We only exchange a few words

418
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,980
when she sends gifts to Dadan.

419
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,770
Dadan video calls his mom every night.

420
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,290
Didn't you notice these past two days?

421
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,700
Yeah, last night he was on a video call,

422
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,420
and he even closed the door so I couldn't see.

423
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,090
I've noticed that he

424
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,010
seems more sensitive than most kids.

425
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,700
His mom hasn't been around since he was little.

426
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,770
He lacks a sense of security.

427
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,010
Yeah.

428
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,700
We're both escapees from marriage.

429
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,570
But we're also survivors of life.

430
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,980
But I never understood,

431
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,050
you love having fun so much,

432
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,900
why did you even get married in the first place?

433
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,180
Does loving fun conflict with marriage?

434
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,940
Why does everyone think of marriage

435
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,050
as something so terrifying?

436
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,770
I think the most important thing

437
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,940
about being together is enjoying the journey.

438
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,330
Not compromising just

439
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,220
for some unknown future.

440
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,380
There's really no need to punish yourself today

441
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,770
for worries about tomorrow.

442
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,380
But today's self

443
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,250
will eventually have to pay for past impulses.

444
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,250
Then let's pay for them.

445
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,050
Isn't life all about

446
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,660
those moments of impulse?

447
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,090
Impulses are important.

448
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,010
Then, Dr. Lu,

449
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,290
next time you act on impulse,

450
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,860
could you at least consider the consequences?

451
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,490
Right now, I feel very impulsive.

452
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,530
I just wanna offend my boss.

453
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,530
Are there consequences for that?

454
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,050
Very serious ones.

455
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,220
Dad!

456
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,700
Sleep with me.

457
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,250
Sleep by yourself.

458
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,900
Go on.

459
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,980
Go ahead.

460
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,940
He needs to learn independence.

461
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,900
Why does it have to be today?

462
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,220
Now he's gonna hate me.

463
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,530
You're such a bad auntie.

464
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,050
Get out of here.

465
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,940
Hurry up.

466
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,530
Coming.

467
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,900
I'll put him to sleep first, then I'll come over.

468
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,730
What are you doing?

469
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,220
Didn't you say you'd sleep by yourself?

470
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,700
I'm busy. Can't you see?

471
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,290
Alright, stop.

472
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,530
Oh my god.

473
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,810
Ms. Zhou came out too late.

474
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,050
We'll have to redo the scene.

475
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,980
Young man,

476
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,420
I'm cooperating with you guys

477
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,330
out of respect,

478
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,770
but this endless walking back and forth,

479
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,620
what's the point of filming that?

480
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,330
We can't redo a surgery, can we?

481
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,420
Alright, how about this,

482
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,050
just let whoever walks better do it.

483
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,050
I have work to do.

484
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,980
Wei Xiaoxi,

485
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,250
are you addicted to walking?

486
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,900
Even Ms. Qiao quit.

487
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,010
Should we stop filming?

488
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,460
Want me to act as Ms. Qiao for you?

489
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,460
Get lost.

490
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,220
Unbelievable.

491
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,010
So many doctors competing,

492
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,420
yet they put both of our department directors

493
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,700
in one group.

494
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,980
Of course.

495
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,980
That's exactly the drama the show producers want.

496
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,770
Internal rivalry, don't you get it?

497
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,380
Internal rivalry?

498
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,810
Who do you think will have

499
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,090
the last laugh in this competition?

500
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,940
A brunch bet,

501
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,330
I'm all in on Ms. Zhou.

502
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,700
I'll add two bubble teas to that.

503
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,050
I'm betting on Dr. Qiao.

504
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,290
Mr. Dong,

505
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,290
what brings you here?

506
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,050
Oh, I'm just... taking a look around.

507
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,250
Mr. Dong,

508
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,730
you're here for the drama, right?

509
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,770
Why aren't they filming you?

510
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,420
Me?

511
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,660
I don't have time for that, seriously.

512
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,730
Look at my schedule, back-to-back treatments.

513
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,900
No time for this.

514
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,140
Then, Mr. Dong,

515
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,460
who do you think will win?

516
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,090
Well, who do you all think will win?

517
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,180
I bet on Ms. Zhou.

518
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,860
I'm going with Dr. Qiao.

519
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,770
Me too. Dr. Qiao.

520
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,810
Full sugar?

521
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,010
Girls

522
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,900
shouldn't drink things that are too sweet.

523
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,140
You're definitely gonna lose.

524
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,220
Mr. Dong, you took my bubble tea again!

525
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,050
Remember to get me a project tomorrow.

526
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,250
No problem.

527
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,490
Come find me anytime, Director.

528
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,010
Mr. Gao,

529
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,140
remember to do...

530
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,980
But I might not be around.

531
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,290
Prepare the Mantoux test.

532
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,090
The bone damage is severe.

533
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,220
The CT scan

534
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,660
didn't capture everything.

535
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,660
What do we do, Ms. Zhou?

536
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,420
Should we suture it for now?

537
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,810
Can you see what's happening?

538
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:42,940
Ms. Qiao,

539
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,860
the report is out.

540
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,220
Digital vascular imaging.

541
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,180
Look at this.

542
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,140
The vascular endothelium has thickened, and the lumen is very narrow.

543
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,620
High likelihood of blockage.

544
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,730
Arteriosclerosis and vasculitis.

545
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,530
How could she have this at such a young age?

546
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,940
These colors work for everyday wear.

547
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,770
What, are they all blush shades?

548
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,090
She might have hidden a smoking history.

549
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,940
What do we do now?

550
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,900
Cancel the surgery.

551
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,140
Go inform Hao Xin.

552
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:10,660
Ms. Qiao,

553
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,620
we prepared so long

554
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,490
for this surgery.

555
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,490
I'm not willing to give up.

556
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,490
We have to.

557
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,700
A silly competition

558
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,010
isn't more important than the patient's life.

559
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,420
Sorry, you two.

560
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,090
Have some coffee and take a break.

561
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,490
Is something going on inside?

562
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,810
No, we...

563
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,140
We're just discussing something.

564
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,010
Thanks.

565
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,700
Why?

566
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,180
Why was the surgery canceled?

567
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,420
Can someone explain this to me?

568
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,420
You're asking me?

569
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,220
Ms. Li, explain it.

570
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,090
Well,

571
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,180
maybe we shouldn't film this part.

572
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,050
Doesn't this

573
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,140
look bad for our hospital's image?

574
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,290
Are you messing with me?

575
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,460
How about we remove the damaged bone,

576
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,810
then attach the 3D-printed bone?

577
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,380
The 3D bone doesn't fit.

578
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,290
It doesn't match

579
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,810
the original facial structure.

580
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,220
It won't look good once it's done.

581
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,330
What are you doing here?

582
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,380
We had a little accident, and the surgery got canceled.

583
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,570
How are you doing?

584
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,380
The situation with the facial bone damage

585
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,730
is worse than we expected.

586
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,900
The 3D bone doesn't match at all.

587
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,290
We can cut off the damaged bone for now,

588
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,050
and use the seventh rib

589
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,570
to match the 3D bone.

590
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,530
Can we do that?

591
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,220
But the recovery time will be longer,

592
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,900
and she probably won't make it back in time for school.

593
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,980
But we signed the surgery agreement,

594
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,620
and she has to be discharged before school starts.

595
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,490
Have the family sign again.

596
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,010
Also, bring the titanium screws, titanium mesh,

597
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,330
and rib osteotomy pack.

598
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:32,940
Okay.

599
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,250
Schedule the anesthesia time.

600
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,290
Qiao Yang,

601
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,420
you take the bone, and I'll handle the adjustments.

602
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,010
The incision inside needs to be smaller.

603
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,730
The position isn't enough.

604
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,220
It's fine.

605
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,330
I'll handle it.

606
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,380
Pass me the smallest tissue scissors.

607
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,700
The stitching is up to you.

608
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,900
Why was my surgery canceled?

609
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,700
Why did you lie to us?

610
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,770
What did I lie about?

611
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,220
When you filled out the forms,

612
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,940
didn't we confirm

613
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,490
again and again

614
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,620
that you don't smoke or drink?

615
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,420
Now the report shows

616
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,380
that your vascular endothelium is thickened and the lumen is very narrow,

617
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,420
which is caused by smoking.

618
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,090
That's why we can't proceed with the surgery.

619
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,860
This is impossible.

620
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,980
I've never smoked.

621
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,180
But I saw a cigarette pack

622
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,620
on your makeup table.

623
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,660
You mean this cigarette pack?

624
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,220
Close-up.

625
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,530
Film me.

626
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,250
Film me!

627
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,660
I've had migraines since I was little.

628
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,660
They often occur when I'm stressed.

629
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,730
So, I carry aspirin with me.

630
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,860
I'm sorry, Ms. Qiao.

631
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,730
I made you misunderstand.

632
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,860
You all go out for a bit.

633
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,980
I need to talk to Hao Xin.

634
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,490
Dr. Qiao, this is our job.

635
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,250
Out.

636
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,460
This is my hospital room.

637
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:00,900
Let's go out and rest for a bit.

638
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,180
Sorry, would you like something to drink?

639
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,220
Let's stop filming for now.

640
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,140
Let's take a break.

641
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,140
Don't film this anymore.

642
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,380
You're only filming close-ups of me.

643
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,290
Quickly, come on.

644
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,730
Let's stop filming.

645
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,010
It was indeed my mistake.

646
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,860
You're not wrong.

647
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,490
I'm a problematic girl,

648
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,490
so it's normal for you to think this way.

649
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,220
Most doctors

650
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,330
have the bad habit of being overly confident.

651
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,250
I'm no exception.

652
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,050
Maybe it's a professional habit,

653
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,940
but usually, I don't like to overlook any details,

654
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,660
so I tend to trust my own judgment.

655
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,330
Only in this way

656
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,620
can I be responsible for my patients.

657
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,490
This was a good quality,

658
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,900
but it also becomes a problem.

659
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,220
So I tend to be overly subjective,

660
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,570
just like in today's situation.

661
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,940
It was a misjudgment on my part,

662
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,810
and I sincerely apologize to you.

663
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,420
I'm sorry.

664
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,530
Excuse me,

665
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,980
I just wanna ask how much longer you're gonna be talking here.

666
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,730
The surgery can still be done, right?

667
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,290
She's been taking aspirin for a long time.

668
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,700
We've already administered fibrinolytic therapy before surgery.

669
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,900
The key now is to control bleeding during the surgery.

670
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,010
How's the blood pressure?

671
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,620
Currently, the blood pressure is normal.

672
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,220
After skin flap transplantation,

673
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,900
the primary concern is complications.

674
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,380
The care during the first night

675
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,570
is especially important.

676
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,180
We need to check every hour or two

677
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,730
to confirm

678
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,090
the survival status of the flap.

679
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,770
If we see signs of whitening,

680
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,530
blackening, or redness and swelling,

681
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,900
we need to be extra cautious.

682
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,570
The flap's white color

683
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,140
clearly indicates inadequate blood supply.

684
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,810
Could it be an issue

685
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,620
with the vascular pedicle handling?

686
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,490
That's not possible.

687
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,900
You're awake.

688
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,090
How come you're all here?

689
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,810
Something big happened?

690
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,420
Is it failed?

691
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,980
No.

692
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,620
Do you usually

693
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,140
sleep on one side?

694
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,090
On the right side.

695
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,220
No wonder.

696
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,420
It's like when we sleep on our hands

697
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,420
and they get numb.

698
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,810
This happens because of poor blood supply.

699
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,730
You see how worried Dr. Wei was.

700
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,140
In order to recover better,

701
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,980
you are not allowed to sleep on your side starting today.

702
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,730
Your task is to lie flat.

703
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,900
I can't sleep on my back.

704
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,530
Really?

705
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,770
Get her the

706
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,700
"Introduction to Clinical Medicine" book.

707
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,140
It's a good book,

708
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,140
anyone who reads it will fall asleep.

709
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,090
"Medical Ethics" will have an even better effect.

710
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,620
Really?

711
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,700
Then bring that over too.

712
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,140
She fell asleep instantly.

713
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,530
She fell asleep instantly.

714
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,050
She's already snoring.

715
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,570
Let's go.

716
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,380
I still think pharmacology is better.

717
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,460
Ethics,

718
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,220
just looking at thIS words makes me sleepy.

719
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,420
Ethics, just hearing it makes me fall asleep in half a second.

720
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,330
Not even a second.

721
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,010
I went to find you this afternoon.

722
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,140
Why didn't you say anything when you got back?

723
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,700
I've been busy.

724
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,660
Look, I brought a new one for you.

725
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,660
You've already changed it.

726
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,980
I asked a friend to buy fish oil for Mom from Germany.

727
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,460
I calculated the time,

728
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,860
and she's almost done with it.

729
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,090
That day,

730
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,220
Mom didn't mean to bring it up with you.

731
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,490
It just happened to come up when we were talking.

732
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,900
Since we've been married,

733
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,180
you've only gone back home

734
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,380
three times during the New Year.

735
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,060
She and Dad later specifically told me

736
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,620
not to bring it up with you anymore

737
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,740
because they didn't want to put pressure on you.

738
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,170
When we got married,

739
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,140
you said your family members passed away,

740
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,610
and you're the only one left in your family.

741
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,770
At that time, Mom said,

742
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,690
"From now on, our family is Jingwen's family.

743
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,780
Whatever she wants to do,

744
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,170
we'll support her."

745
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,340
I've been falling short in this regard recently.

746
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,860
Hope you don't mind.

747
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,860
How about this,

748
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,970
for Mid-Autumn Festival, we'll go back two days earlier

749
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,340
to spend time with them.

750
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,900
Then, we can go on vacation afterward.

751
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,380
We'll discuss this later.

752
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,010
What's wrong?

753
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,610
I actually wanna know

754
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,130
what you're thinking.

755
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:51,090
I feel like there are things you're hiding from me,

756
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,740
just like the time when you dropped out of school.

757
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,380
Honestly, I don't really care.

758
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,010
But Jingwen,

759
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,450
I'm your husband.

760
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,970
We should be honest with each other.

761
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,090
I don't want you to hide anything from me.

762
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,700
Okay.

763
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,050
I'll tell you everything from now on.

764
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,860
Do you wanna see my phone?

765
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,450
Uh...

766
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,860
This is too insincere.

767
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,740
Why?

768
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,130
What is there to see? There's nothing in the new phone.

769
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,420
I need to use this opportunity wisely.

770
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,090
It's up to you.

771
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,900
That old lady insisted she was your mom.

772
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,050
But she left her phone number with the front desk.

773
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,570
You could call and ask her about it.

774
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,970
2, 2, 3.

775
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,300
Wait,

776
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,860
when did you guys come back to Rongchuan?

777
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,780
Where's Zhou Kai?

778
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,940
Why isn't he with you?

779
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,650
Who are you?

780
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,570
You went to so much trouble to find me,

781
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,570
but you don't recognize me?

782
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,300
Jingwen!

783
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,420
You look really beautiful.

784
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,260
I recognize you.

785
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,010
I saw you on TV.

786
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,820
How much did Zhou Kai ask for?

787
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,220
Right.

788
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,970
You took all the money from home.

789
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,700
You left for over ten years, right?

790
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,820
There's 100,000 in this card.

791
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,300
The password is on the back.

792
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,300
When I left home, I only took 500 yuan.

793
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,090
Now I'm returning it with interest.

794
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,380
Tell Zhou Kai

795
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,340
not to come looking for me again.

796
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,970
I don't owe you anything.

797
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,130
Jingwen!

798
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,610
Mom,

799
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,900
I told you not to come. Wasn't it pointless?

800
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,300
You've really recovered well.

801
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,420
You're so gorgeous, sweetheart.

802
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,130
Dr. Qiao,

803
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,740
am I beautiful?

804
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,820
So beautiful.

805
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,900
Someone like you, wearing a face-kini,

806
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,420
managing to look this graceful and elegant...

807
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,170
you're a rare breed.

808
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,170
Wow, really.

809
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,220
You're famous now.

810
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,170
Dr. Qiao's words are a liar's words.

811
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,090
Just spouting nonsense.

812
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,700
What's wrong with you?

813
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,170
Why aren't you happy?

814
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,860
Your facial nerves have recovered,

815
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,700
so you can smile now.

816
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,300
How can she even smile?

817
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,380
The ballet school called.

818
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,700
They fired her.

819
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,700
What's going on?

820
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,570
That's how society is now.

821
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,820
People only show sympathy

822
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,010
for things that don't affect them.

823
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,220
Once it involves them,

824
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,900
it's a completely different attitude.

825
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,530
It's fine. I understand.

826
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,820
It's normal

827
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,740
for parents to be worried

828
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,170
when their kids are at school.

829
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,780
Once I'm out of the hospital,

830
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,130
I'll just find another job.

831
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,570
That's easy to say.

832
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,970
It's not that easy to find a job.

833
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,530
The show's really popular now.

834
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,650
Everyone knows you.

835
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,570
Don't you think anyone who wants to hire you will think twice?

836
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,420
Right now, I'm injecting hyaluronic acid into your cheeks

837
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,170
to make them more symmetrical.

838
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,380
This is just the first stage.

839
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,340
In about half a year or a year, when it's mostly recovered,

840
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,940
I'll do fat injections.

841
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,700
That'll be your official graduation.

842
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,490
Will everything be free until graduation?

843
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,650
It's like a scholarship I'm giving you.

844
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,340
But I won't be able to attend the opening ceremony.

845
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,170
I'm sorry.

846
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,340
I admit I breached the contract.

847
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,740
There's something else I haven't told you.

848
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,700
Your surgery

849
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,300
was done by Dr. Qiao and me together.

850
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,860
Looks like you won't be able to win.

851
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,450
Good morning.

852
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,780
Xiaoxi.

853
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,700
Xuan.

854
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,050
Americano or latte?

855
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,900
Latte will be fine, thanks.

856
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,490
Are you looking for Ms. Qiao or Ms. Zhou?

857
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,340
I'm looking for you.

858
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,170
Can we talk for a bit?

859
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,610
Sure.

860
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,300
It's fine. Ms. Li hasn't come yet.

861
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,940
Liu Miao's surgery was initially paused.

862
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,530
After our team withdrew, it was completed.

863
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,090
That's amazing.

864
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,740
How was it completed?

865
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,940
Tell me about it.

866
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,490
Xuan,

867
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,860
Liu Miao is Ms. Zhou's patient.

868
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,940
I'm not very clear on the details.

869
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,490
Xiaoxi, don't overthink it.

870
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,610
I just heard them say

871
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,490
the surgery had a surprise.

872
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,170
I wanted to hear the story from your perspective.

873
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,170
Xuan, look,

874
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,050
this situation has two main characters.

875
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,220
One is my mentor,

876
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,340
the other is my boss.

877
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,530
Please don't make it difficult for me.

878
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,220
I can't say anything inappropriate behind their backs.

879
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,420
I understand.

880
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,860
After all, this is a competition.

881
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,300
You must have your own stance, right?

882
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,450
My stance is that I hope my mentor wins.

883
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,130
The medical field is really interesting.

884
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,530
We're planning to make a series

885
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,650
about this kind of show.

886
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,010
We wanna find some young doctors.

887
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,340
Are you interested?

888
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,090
Yes.

889
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,650
Then let's add each other on WeChat.

890
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:12,650
Alright.

891
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,090
Okay.

892
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,300
Dr. Zhou's surgery

893
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,740
was amazing.

894
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,340
I really regret missing it.

895
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,820
Xiaoxi, just tell me about it.

896
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,900
My mentor's skills

897
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,700
are hard for most people to understand.

898
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,340
So,

899
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,300
does that mean Dr. Qiao was also involved in this surgery?

900
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,900
She seems pretty cold.

901
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,970
She's actually just a sharp-tongued person with a soft heart.

902
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,370
Really?

903
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,660
She's straightforward and doesn't have a hidden agenda.

904
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,810
What do you mean by straightforward?

905
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,020
Xiaoxi,

906
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,210
you're gonna be late, why haven't you gone up yet?

907
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,890
You go first.

908
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:47,500
Alright.

909
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,690
In that case, you go to work.

910
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,170
We'll talk after work.

911
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,380
I'll message you on WeChat. Bye!

912
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,170
Okay.
