1
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,690
Ms. Li.,

2
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,540
Mr. Jiang just called again asking for an update.

3
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,020
I know.

4
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,620
Haven't I been pushing for it this whole time?

5
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,690
Tang Jun, I don't know

6
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,770
where you're hiding right now,

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,900
but I don't even have to guess,

8
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,980
you're hesitating again, aren't you?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,740
You know what I hate most about you?

10
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,020
You're always dragging things out.

11
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,290
Didn't you set this up?

12
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,490
Didn't you say we'd meet today to transfer the title?

13
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,770
If you're coming, come. If not, forget it.

14
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,620
It's not that big of a deal.

15
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,730
Stop beating around the bush with me.

16
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,500
You hear that, Hu?

17
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,660
That attitude of her,

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,290
it drives me crazy the second I hear it.

19
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,570
Now I kinda get

20
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,610
why you're so obsessed with this one.

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,260
It suits you.

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,940
Let me say one more thing.

23
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,730
A goal only counts

24
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,610
when it's something you actually get your hands on.

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,890
Then what are you waiting for,

26
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,060
young master?

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,170
Let's go.

28
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,060
Ms. Shi,

29
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,570
Mr. Chu just told me

30
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,450
he'll be here very soon.

31
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,500
Would you like

32
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,220
to wait a little longer?

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,220
Come in.

34
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,010
Shi Jin has left?

35
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,220
Go.

36
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,100
Everyone can go.

37
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,100
Ovarian forceps.

38
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,730
Blood pressure's dropping.

39
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,810
Can we stabilize it?

40
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,140
For now, yes.

41
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,810
There are too many wounds.

42
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,730
Should we consider splitting this into two surgeries?

43
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,610
Speed up.

44
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,660
If we can't finish the cleaning in one go

45
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,340
and she goes into shock later, it'll be trouble.

46
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,170
Has he arrived yet?

47
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,340
I'm about to clock out.

48
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,850
Almost here, he's stuck in traffic.

49
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,460
Hold on a bit.

50
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,460
Try to hurry, please.

51
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,220
Mr. Tang, you're finally here.

52
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,250
We've been waiting for you.

53
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,410
Mr. Jiang couldn't come from Shenzhen,

54
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,460
so I'm representing him with full authority.

55
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,340
And your name?

56
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,220
My surname is Wang.

57
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,810
What are you trying to pull this time?

58
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,850
It's been a while since we broke up.

59
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,410
And you haven't been home once.

60
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,220
There's still a bunch of your stuff at home.

61
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,730
I don't even know what to do with it.

62
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,610
I don't know whether to throw it out or mail it to you.

63
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,780
Just your clothes and things like that.

64
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,410
Throw.

65
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,810
And also

66
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,780
those plans you made for Gemu back then,

67
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,170
- the project endorsements... - Just toss them all.

68
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,170
What about this?

69
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,810
Your sleeping gadget.

70
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,540
You had insomnia and couldn't rest properly.

71
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,700
Just like Harry Potter,

72
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,460
you could only fall asleep at night by riding it.

73
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,540
One time, a new housekeeper came

74
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,170
and washed it.

75
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,540
For those two days, you could only fall asleep riding me.

76
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,290
Look at those dark circles under your eyes.

77
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,220
You haven't been sleeping well again lately, have you?

78
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,290
If you don't mind it that much,

79
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,540
or if you're not disgusted by it,

80
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,660
why not just take it with you?

81
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,370
Maybe when you see it,

82
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,460
you'll even think of me.

83
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,930
Even if you don't think of me,

84
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,410
at least

85
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,170
it'll help you get a good night's sleep.

86
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:34,900
Hey,

87
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,170
he's arrived, right?

88
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,460
Thank you.

89
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,170
Let's do the transfer.

90
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,540
Didn't you go talk to Yan Dan?

91
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,930
She signed.

92
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,410
Just a little too late.

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,780
By now,

94
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,460
Tang should've finished the paperwork.

95
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,020
Anyway, we've done everything we could.

96
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,780
Now we leave it to fate.

97
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,490
Before, we were always thinking,

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,580
should we go public in New York or Hong Kong?

99
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,050
Where would we ring the bell?

100
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,340
Well,

101
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,140
now it's settled. No more stress.

102
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,250
Funny how

103
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,370
once the shoe that's been hanging over my head finally drops,

104
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,490
I feel relieved.

105
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,810
Hold on.

106
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,370
Can't you calm her down first?

107
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,930
Tell her

108
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,730
this is just a normal post-op reaction.

109
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,850
If that doesn't work, show her the contract.

110
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,850
Let her see she signed it voluntarily.

111
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,850
I've taught you this a hundred times, how do you still not get it?

112
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,650
I'm handling serious business here.

113
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,980
Don't call me unless it's important.

114
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,610
I said I'm busy, stop calling me!

115
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,060
What?

116
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,650
Okay, I got it.

117
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,370
I'll come back as soon as I finish here.

118
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,700
Something wrong?

119
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,060
Nothing.

120
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,130
Just sign.

121
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,610
So you're really giving up on Gemu?

122
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,060
Guess that's fate.

123
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,610
All the emotional debts owed to all those girls in the past,

124
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,340
the hearts I broke,

125
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,890
meeting you,I paid it all back in one go.

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,980
How is that considered paying it back?

127
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,180
You always used to say I didn't understand you.

128
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,580
And yeah,

129
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,250
even now, I still don't understand you.

130
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,220
Why do you always have to push yourself to the extreme?

131
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,730
It's okay if I don't understand.

132
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,820
After signing today,

133
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,940
we're even.

134
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,130
You've taken down Gemu,

135
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,980
that should give you some sense of security, right?

136
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,060
From now on,

137
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,610
let's do the things we want to do,

138
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,530
and can do.

139
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,130
And if we don't want to do it, or can't,

140
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,220
then we won't.

141
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,060
Stop thinking

142
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,010
you're the smartest one in the world.

143
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,530
If anything really happens,

144
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,890
the big players always walk away fine.

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,370
It's us who get burned in the end,

146
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,130
understand?

147
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,730
I don't know why,

148
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,530
but all these years,

149
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,100
we never thought about having a kid.

150
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,340
But thinking about it now,

151
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,130
Gemu might as well be our child.

152
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,300
Here,

153
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,980
the kid's yours now. Take good care of it.

154
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,300
Reinforcements are here!

155
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,220
We're not late, are we?

156
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,100
Perfect timing. Let's get to work.

157
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,820
Let's work!

158
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,460
You've got quite the network, huh?

159
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,820
I just found out myself.

160
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,530
Perfect.

161
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,580
I'm back to my Starlight Project.

162
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,650
Still so many things left unfinished.

163
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,420
What about you?

164
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,530
I need to sit down seriously

165
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,420
and plan myself a long vacation.

166
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,340
Tang recommended a few golf courses before,

167
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,580
never got the chance to go.

168
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,850
Hello?

169
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,490
I'm giving up my shares.

170
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,850
Gemu cannot be sold to Jiao Ai.

171
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,460
She's Li Qi.

172
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,850
I'm Li Qi.

173
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,460
We're from the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

174
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,300
I'll fully cooperate with the investigation.

175
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,530
Qing,

176
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,010
help me keep this safe.

177
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,420
No, according to regulations, that's not allowed.

178
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,490
We have to take it with us.

179
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,250
Can I carry it myself?

180
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:27,940
Yes.

181
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,250
Take her away.

182
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,490
Alright, got it.

183
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,580
Have Yan Tong stay in the observation room

184
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,100
a bit longer before going back.

185
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,180
What's wrong?

186
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,610
Du Jun and Li Qi got arrested.

187
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,370
What happened?

188
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,890
A while back,

189
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,980
I reported that cosmetic medical training class

190
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,180
to the Health Commission.

191
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,420
Turns out they had already been watching Li Qi.

192
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,730
The leadership took it seriously

193
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,460
and coordinated with other departments to investigate.

194
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,580
It wasn't just illegal training,

195
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,610
all those institutions and clinics

196
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,370
connected to them

197
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,940
had serious financial problems.

198
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,700
The evidence is solid now.

199
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,010
Li Qi's not getting out of this.

200
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,220
Did they sign the equity transfer agreement?

201
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,980
No, they didn't.

202
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,300
Tang's being pretty heroic this time.

203
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,340
It wasn't Tang. It was Li Qi.

204
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,980
Then it looks like fate's

205
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,460
finally on our side.

206
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,820
What about Shi Jin?

207
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,010
Does she still have a chance?

208
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,850
Shi Jin,

209
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,890
what a coincidence, fancy running into you again.

210
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,180
You finished your surgery?

211
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,700
The family signed off on it.

212
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,010
All procedures are complete.

213
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,220
Please think it over again.

214
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,250
Ladies.

215
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,220
Actually,

216
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,340
you don't even need to explain it to me.

217
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,420
You were thinking for the patient,

218
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,700
and the family turned around and bit you.

219
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,940
I've seen that happen too many times.

220
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,820
It's exactly because of things like this

221
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,890
that I decided to leave medicine for business.

222
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,010
I totally understand.

223
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,580
Bojin is a leader in this industry,

224
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,650
so of course it has to be cautious,

225
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,850
follow rules, follow procedures.

226
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,420
But isn't the whole point of "Bojin"

227
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,340
that we fight to make progress?

228
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,460
I've seen your interviews.

229
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,980
Before Bojin,

230
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,980
you ran a small company importing medical devices,

231
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,220
and it was pretty profitable.

232
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,340
But just when it was thriving,

233
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,850
you made an unbelievable decision,

234
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,420
you invested everything you had

235
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,850
into building a production line

236
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,490
just to make aesthetic medical equipment.

237
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,100
Even today, that's still a risky choice.

238
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,980
Back then, aesthetic medicine was just starting out.

239
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,820
People only trusted international big brands.

240
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,610
To build a domestic brand,

241
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,180
that really sounded like a fantasy.

242
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,700
You sure watched that interview early on.

243
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,460
But

244
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,980
what does that have to do with today?

245
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,420
Yes, I admit

246
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,700
there were some flaws in today's process.

247
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,580
But, Shi Jin,

248
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,850
with your vision and perspective,

249
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,460
surely you wouldn't let something so minor

250
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,770
cloud your judgment?

251
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,060
You're quite the talker.

252
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,180
Honestly,

253
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,940
among all the institutions we assessed this time,

254
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,100
your procedures

255
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,770
are probably

256
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,610
the most standardized.

257
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,220
By far the most advanced,

258
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,220
no competition.

259
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,580
Then why didn't you choose us?

260
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,180
Because of performance.

261
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,010
So all that earlier talk was just a smokescreen?

262
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,700
I knew it.

263
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,370
Shi Jin I remember

264
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,010
was never that rigid.

265
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,730
If I didn't throw up a smokescreen,

266
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,610
how would I be able to see

267
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,340
what I really wanted to see,

268
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,060
right?

269
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,700
Your performance is also decent.

270
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,890
But a profit margin of close to 15%

271
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,770
still falls short of expectations.

272
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,010
You said earlier you left medicine for business.

273
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,340
I don't think that's entirely true.

274
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,250
Our entire year's revenue at Gemu

275
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,300
isn't even equal to Bojin's profit in a single month.

276
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,890
If it were purely about profits,

277
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,100
you'd just invest in a bathhouse.

278
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,530
Why bother with a hospital?

279
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,130
And isn't Bojin's slogan all about

280
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,220
professionalism in aesthetic medicine,

281
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,300
and returning to real medicine?

282
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,980
If you ask me,

283
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,580
you've still got a doctor's heart that you just can't let go of,

284
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,610
am I right?

285
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,490
Yeah, Shi Jin,

286
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,850
for us doctors,

287
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,370
what matters most is the patient.

288
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,610
Let me share a couple of quick stats:

289
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,340
this year, Gemu's repurchase rate

290
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,940
reached 92%,

291
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,980
and our customer base

292
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,650
has doubled compared to last year.

293
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,940
These are real choices made by patients.

294
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,650
It's all shown in the documents

295
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,650
I sent you earlier.

296
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,250
So, Shi Jin...

297
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,250
Ms. Shi, it's time to board.

298
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,850
Sorry about that.

299
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,820
You're both welcome in Shanghai anytime.

300
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,820
When you come,

301
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,530
I'll treat you to hairy crabs.

302
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,700
That sounds amazing!

303
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,180
Wait,

304
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,050
what are "hairy crabs"?

305
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,460
So... did she say yes or not?

306
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,660
You're pretty good at making stuff up.

307
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,570
92%?

308
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,420
- We can't even pay salaries right now. - That's a fact.

309
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,660
I didn't make it up.

310
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,980
Manman said every time she changed your bandages,

311
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,570
you screamed like a pig being slaughtered.

312
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,700
But today, you didn't scream.

313
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,330
You cried instead.

314
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,290
My sister hasn't shed tears

315
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,980
in a long time.

316
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,050
Really?

317
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,570
Once the wound scabs over, you'll be discharged.

318
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,730
Save those tears for two more days, okay?

319
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,460
I was so stupid,

320
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,770
like I was under some kind of spell.

321
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,660
Looking back now, it terrifies me.

322
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,660
If it weren't for you both,

323
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,330
Tong and I would've lost our lives.

324
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,770
Thank you,

325
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,290
Sometimes hope is like a gamble.

326
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,180
When a chance comes that might change your fate,

327
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,730
anyone would wanna bet on it.

328
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,980
It's perfectly normal.

329
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,530
Don't blame yourself.

330
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,660
Good news!

331
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,860
Ms. Shi decided to invest in Gemu.

332
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,290
That's amazing!

333
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,250
See, what did I say?

334
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,700
You two working together is unstoppable.

335
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,050
She really agrees with our business philosophy.

336
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,250
Doctor-led, medicine first.

337
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,570
I hope you both keep doing your best.

338
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,250
I'm gonna go call Tang.

339
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,660
Sure.

340
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,530
Come on, cheers!

341
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,220
Cheers!

342
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,250
Cheers!

343
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,180
Qiao Yang,

344
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,810
Shi Jin had some praise for you.

345
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,660
What did she say about me?

346
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,530
She said your skills have improved,

347
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,700
but you're still as stubborn as ever.

348
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,490
- True. - That's honest praise.

349
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,090
No more praise in the future, please.

350
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,220
Jingwen, she mentioned you too.

351
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,050
She said she really admires you.

352
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,010
One of the main reasons she's investing in Gemu

353
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,620
is because you're in Gemu.

354
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,810
She's too kind.

355
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,570
It's all because of your influence.

356
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,180
No.

357
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,330
You're being way too modest.

358
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,010
That's the truth.

359
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,050
Jingwen, lately with everything,

360
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,250
like Duan Mengmeng, and Shi Jin's situation,

361
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,810
I've actually been really worried.

362
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,620
But you handled them all.

363
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,290
I was honestly surprised.

364
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,140
And because of that surprise,

365
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,140
I realized something,

366
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,770
I've been underestimating how brilliant you are.

367
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,140
Back when you two were competing to be my graduate student,

368
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,620
I said it was a tie.

369
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,570
But there's something I've kept to myself,

370
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,180
never told anyone.

371
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,570
On that test,

372
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,090
your score was actually higher than hers.

373
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,460
No way.

374
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,570
Why not? It's the truth.

375
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,010
Since undergrad, Qiao Yang's grades

376
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,570
were way ahead of the pack.

377
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,050
She always ranked near the top in exams,

378
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,530
won so many subject scholarships she probably lost count.

379
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,420
Jingwen,

380
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,730
facing such a strong competitor,

381
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,140
I had you enter the selection process

382
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,770
just to send you a clear message,

383
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,530
to make you back off.

384
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,050
But after reviewing your test paper,

385
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,810
I fell into deep thought.

386
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,700
First, I worried your results weren't genuine.

387
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,330
Second,

388
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,250
I was afraid of hurting Qiao Yang's pride.

389
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,700
So I called it a tie between you two.

390
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,730
I'm sorry, Jingwen.

391
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,940
Mr. Chu, thank you for telling me.

392
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,730
Honestly, even back then,

393
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,290
I was already pretty unhappy with the "tie."

394
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,330
And after you were expelled,

395
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,460
I really thought your results were suspicious.

396
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,380
Until one day I went to the library

397
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,980
and borrowed a super obscure English book.

398
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,660
I noticed the first name

399
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,980
on the checkout card was hers.

400
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,810
And that was a year ago.

401
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,900
I was shocked.

402
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,290
Then I looked through

403
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,420
a bunch of other untouched original books,

404
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,180
and guess what?Her name was on all of them.

405
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,460
And several of them I hadn't even read.

406
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,810
There's truth in the old saying:

407
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,140
"Hard work can make up for lack of talent."

408
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,460
Hard not to believe it.

409
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,290
Mr. Chu's being honest, and you're still not convinced?x

410
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,290
Well, let me tell you,

411
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,900
one of the biggest reasons I agreed to join Gemu

412
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,490
was exactly because I wasn't convinced.

413
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,010
I like seeing you disapprove of me

414
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,250
but not being able to beat me.

415
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,900
Turns out, winning against her face-to-face

416
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,220
is actually kind of addictive.

417
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,490
Same here.

418
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,290
You're doomed then.

419
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,700
Come on.

420
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,460
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

421
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,380
Thank you, Sir.

422
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,980
What?

423
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,330
Wei Xiaoxi, the queen returns!

424
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,180
Dr. Wei!

425
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,620
You've lost so much weight!

426
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,860
Don't I look even better now?

427
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,330
Of course.

428
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,180
Hello, Xiaoxi!

429
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,940
Perfect timing, let me introduce,

430
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,620
Yuan Siman,

431
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,770
our new resident doctor.

432
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,490
I've heard a lot about you from Ms. Qiao.

433
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,090
Great to finally meet you in person!

434
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,460
Whoa, don't rush to get close to me just yet.

435
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,050
Tell me what surgeries you've assisted with here so far.

436
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,530
Send me your resume and list of projects

437
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,700
you've worked on first.

438
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,730
Someone's got that boss energy now.

439
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,010
That line sounds so familiar...

440
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,770
Just kidding!

441
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,700
Come on,

442
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,050
let's add each other on WeChat.

443
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,810
From now on, if you need anything, go to me.

444
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,250
Okay.

445
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,980
Alright, hurry up,

446
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,220
your mentor's waiting for you in the cafeteria.

447
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,700
If you're late, there'll be nothing left to eat.

448
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,570
I'm off then!

449
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,460
Bye, Xiaoxi!

450
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,220
Feels like...

451
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,010
Dr. Wei seems a little different now.

452
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,620
Isn't she exactly how Dr. Chen described her?

453
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,860
What did he say?

454
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,620
Cold and aloof,

455
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,330
bad temper,

456
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,770
but incredibly good at her job.

457
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,730
And most importantly, super pretty.

458
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,860
Poor Dr. Chen.

459
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,810
This is my employment contract.

460
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,250
Please have a look at it, Ms. Qiao.

461
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,530
Wow, you're really asking for a lot here.

462
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,090
You're right.

463
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,770
I'm a doctor who wants both fame

464
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,180
and fortune.

465
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,980
You've gotten a bit too full of yourself.

466
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,250
I'm being serious.

467
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,490
I came to Gemu right after graduation,

468
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,940
and I immediately got to follow Mr. Du.

469
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,530
Back then, I was so proud.

470
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,490
Felt like I was the best in the entire hospital.

471
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,330
But after three years,

472
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,180
when he left,

473
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,900
he didn't even say a word to me.

474
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,180
That's when I realized

475
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,330
he probably didn't even

476
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,380
know my full name.

477
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,050
Then you came.

478
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,730
Qiao Yang.

479
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,570
A female doctor,

480
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,570
who could be so cool, so incredible.

481
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,140
Suddenly, I had a role model.

482
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,180
I wanted to become a doctor like Qiao Yang.

483
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,380
So I did everything I could

484
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,250
to prove myself in front of you.

485
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,050
I wanted to show you how capable I was.

486
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,380
I wanted you to notice me.

487
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,860
Maybe I tried too hard

488
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,490
and ended up looking like a clown.

489
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,180
But now I've figured it out.

490
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,770
I don't need to become Qiao Yang.

491
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,460
I'm Wei Xiaoxi.

492
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,180
A bit vain,

493
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,530
wants fame and money,

494
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,140
but still a doctor with principles.

495
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,220
And I think that's perfectly fine.

496
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,140
But the terms you're asking for now

497
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,460
might be crossing a few lines.

498
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,700
But a good doctor

499
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,090
has to be bold enough to ask,

500
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,660
and brave enough to act, to get opportunities.

501
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,620
You really are suited to be a plastic surgeon.

502
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,420
Your skills and experience

503
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,980
are far beyond your peers.

504
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,420
But let me be clear:

505
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,900
my standards will be even higher from now on.

506
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,250
If you make even one mistake,

507
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,660
you'll be packing up and leaving.

508
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,380
No problem, Ms. Qiao.

509
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,770
Welcome back.

510
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,940
Ms. Qiao,

511
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,050
I got you a meal.

512
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,290
Let's eat and chat.

513
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,090
I've already eaten.

514
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,330
You've eaten?

515
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,860
Then I'll eat it.

516
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,730
Mingjie, come sit here.

517
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,250
Are you full?

518
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,460
Not yet.

519
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,770
Then get back to work.

520
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,330
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

521
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,940
Have a bite.

522
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,250
This is what you're treating me to?

523
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,010
It doesn't really count as treating.

524
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,010
It's just from our cafeteria, free food.

525
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,250
You really haven't changed a bit.

526
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,140
Then how about I treat you to some Japanese food tonight?

527
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,700
I want to go to that one place.

528
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,220
Which one?

529
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,620
Which one?

530
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,250
You're

531
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,220
doing this on purpose, aren't you?

532
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,090
First time drinking in the office.

533
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,490
A couple of drinks after work,

534
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,770
that's a tradition Ms. Zhou started at Gemu.

535
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,140
Doesn't matter if you can handle it or not,

536
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,180
you have to drink.

537
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,660
Right, Ms. Zhou?

538
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,940
Yes, that's right.

539
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,330
Let me tell you a secret,

540
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,460
this wine was stolen from Mr. Qin's office.

541
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,940
Then let's thank Mr. Qin for the drinks.

542
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,860
Cheers to Mr. Qin!

543
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,250
Cheers to Mr. Qin!

544
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,570
Jiao Ai has now completely shut down.

545
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,010
My former colleagues

546
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,900
have already started job hunting.

547
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,330
Mr. Jiang from Lingnan Group

548
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,010
is currently under investigation in Shenzhen.

549
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,090
Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.

550
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,090
They had everything needed to build a great hospital,

551
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,180
but insisted on going the wrong way.

552
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,420
And I have one more piece of news to share.

553
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,570
After Li Qi got arrested,

554
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,490
I went to assist with the investigation.

555
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,980
The issue with that clinic from 2008

556
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,490
is finally getting resolved.

557
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,860
Besides the fine,

558
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,770
there will also be criminal charges.

559
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,180
Thinking about it now, it really scares me.

560
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,810
Back then, I was this close,

561
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,090
just this close,

562
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,700
to staying behind as a teacher at that training center.

563
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,860
Everyone makes mistakes.

564
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,250
You were already really brave.

565
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,220
You're just trying to comfort me.

566
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,570
No, really.

567
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,090
I'm not just comforting you.

568
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,940
I remember when I got expelled from school,

569
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,250
the first thing I did was run to Li Qi's clinic,

570
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,010
wanting to drag her to the police to turn herself in.

571
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,380
Guess what she did?

572
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,220
She pulled out

573
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,290
100,000 yuan.

574
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,980
Back then, that was a lot of money.

575
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,460
Have you ever wondered

576
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,090
how Zhou Jingwen made a comeback

577
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,490
after dropping out?

578
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,010
I just took that money

579
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,290
and went straight to Germany.

580
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,730
You used Li Qi's money to go to Germany?

581
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,490
No wonder

582
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,420
every time I talked to you about Germany,

583
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,330
you acted so strangely.

584
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,490
This is

585
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,940
the hardest secret for me to share.

586
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,090
The image of that rainy day

587
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,660
keeps appearing in front of me.

588
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,180
I've wondered countless times.

589
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,090
If I could go back to that day,

590
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,660
would I have the courage to refuse?

591
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,050
Perhaps to you all, the successful woman I am today

592
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,770
was bought with that day's decision.

593
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,770
So much has happened this year.

594
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,980
I've finally figured it out.

595
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,770
There's no single moment that defines life.

596
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,330
If I hadn't taken that 100,000 yuan,

597
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,460
I might not have taken so many detours,

598
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,530
stumbling along the way.

599
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,380
But in the end,

600
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,940
I would still become the person I want to be.

601
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,220
Do you believe in fate?

602
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,570
I didn't used to.

603
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,140
But now, do you believe?

604
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,290
No matter

605
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,980
which path we take,

606
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,010
you and I will eventually become doctors.

607
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,140
But being a doctor,

608
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,770
we are those who believe in fate but refuse to accept it.

609
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,290
Have you ever heard this saying?

610
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,290
In ancient times,

611
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,730
doctors and shamans were considered the same profession.

612
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,900
They both fought against fate, battling for people's lives.

613
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,700
Even when they couldn't win, they still fought.

614
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,330
Even when they couldn't do it, they still tried.

615
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,660
But after so many years of being a doctor,

616
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,860
I've become increasingly clear about one thing:

617
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,220
No matter which medical discipline we're in,

618
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,980
we can't change fate.

619
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,660
The only thing we can do

620
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,140
is use our skills

621
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,660
to give people a bit more luck.

622
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,620
Since none of us

623
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,490
can control fate,

624
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,530
the only thing we can do is believe.

625
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,090
Believe in fate.

626
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,330
Believe in the truth.

627
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,660
Believe in love.

628
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,250
Believe in beauty.

629
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,660
Believe in miracles.

630
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,900
Just believe.

631
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,180
Merry Christmas! Here's a small gift for you.

632
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,090
You can go to the front desk for consultation.

633
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,330
Merry Christmas!

634
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,380
I'll take one.

635
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,810
Hello, ma'am.

636
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,700
Here's a small gift for you. Merry Christmas!

637
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,330
I've told everyone before,

638
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,620
you shouldn't mess around

639
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,010
with your facial features,

640
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,900
you know that, right?

641
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,660
It's not just about looking good or not.

642
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,490
See,

643
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,980
our long-time follower is telling you,

644
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,330
it affects your luck.

645
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,620
Come on, bite down hard.

646
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,180
Yes, look here,

647
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,290
this side of your jaw is much bigger than the other side.

648
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,010
So I'll inject a little more on this side, okay?

649
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,620
Okay.

650
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,900
Dr. Chen,

651
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,140
why are you so distracted during the treatment?

652
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,810
Not distracted, I'm completely focused.

653
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,620
Let me take a look.

654
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,180
Any plans for New Year's, Ms. Meng?

655
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,330
Plan?

656
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,380
Holiday is no longer part of my vocabulary.

657
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,460
My daughter said

658
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,730
she'll be studying at home during the holidays.

659
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,010
I need to handle logistics for her.

660
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,460
The monthly exam is right after the break,

661
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,940
she's in fierce competition with her classmates.

662
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,980
Three, two, one,

663
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,730
Peace sign!

664
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,140
Peace sign! Do a heart!

665
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,490
Alright!

666
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,220
Here, congratulations, you won first prize!

667
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,290
And your participation prize.

668
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,250
I'll give you three more shots!

669
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,140
Shameful, isn't it?

670
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,250
Look at this, don't you think it's embarrassing?

671
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,490
You don't get it, this gun's no good.

672
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,140
Back in the army, I was a sharpshooter!

673
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,380
Don't worry.

674
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,900
I'll take you to shoot a real gun sometime.

675
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,180
I don't want a real gun, I want a prize!

676
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,770
If you shoot the real gun, you'll get a prize.

677
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,010
Which one of you won?

678
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,660
Neither of us.

679
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,980
Then neither of you are good.

680
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,220
Come on, let me try!

681
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,050
Hold this for me.

682
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,490
You think you're good? Go ahead and try!

683
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,050
Back in school military training,

684
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,860
I was a real sharpshooter, you know?

685
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,010
Ugh, it's the gun, not me.

686
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,770
See?

687
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,140
Were you in the same unit as Grandpa?

688
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,530
This is boring, come on, let's go!

689
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,380
Come.

690
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,530
Hold on tight.

691
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,980
Mom, be careful!

692
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,290
Sit down.

693
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,420
Sit down.

694
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,300
Come on, make a heart sign.

695
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,300
Look at you,

696
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,780
look how happy you're smiling.

697
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,980
So cute!

698
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,570
When are you two getting married?

699
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,820
Did you take your meds today?

700
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,340
I'm hungry.

701
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,090
Come on, everyone gets a bun!

702
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,900
Don't fight over it!

703
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,860
Here!

704
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,650
It's okay, I'll share one with him.

705
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,420
Here you go.

706
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,130
Here.

707
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,530
Okay.

708
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,300
I've just got something to talk to you about.

709
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,380
Lately,

710
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,570
something's been kind of bothering me.

711
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,610
What is it?

712
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,900
There's a female entrepreneur

713
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,650
who's been showing a lot of interest in me.

714
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,740
Don't laugh, seriously!

715
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,940
What do you think I should do about a situation like this?

716
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,490
Sounds great to me.

717
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,610
A female entrepreneur? Who is she?

718
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,740
Don't tell me it's our major shareholder.

719
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,260
No, not Shi Jin.

720
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,940
You don't know her.

721
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,530
Just wanted to ask,

722
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,170
how should I handle this?

723
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,380
Handle it?

724
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,980
Give her a chance! Sounds great!

725
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,570
What do you want to play next?

726
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,380
There's a climbing gym up ahead, wanna try it?

727
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,420
Look at that.

728
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,570
That climbing wall is only two meters high.

729
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,650
Totally boring.

730
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,980
How do you know it's only two meters?

731
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,650
We went there last time!

732
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,820
When?

733
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,380
I'm not getting on that thing.

734
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,610
You've been love-struck all day, only thinking about her.

735
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,420
Other than her,

736
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,530
can you even remember anyone else?

737
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,050
What do you mean love-struck?

738
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,940
Where'd you learn that? You go ride the drop tower!

739
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,420
No.

740
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,380
He's just a kid, how can he ride that?

741
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,530
Come on, come with me.

742
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,210
Come.

743
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,490
My dad's turning into a total big kid.

744
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,050
Why does he love playing with kids so much?

745
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,050
He totally spoils them.

746
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,300
Look at you.

747
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,420
Here, let me fix it for you.

748
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,490
I've thought it through.

749
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,460
From now on, whether you want me

750
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,300
to call you my girlfriend,

751
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,340
or just my friend,

752
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,420
anything is fine.

753
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,610
Can we just go back to how we used to be?

754
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,380
Why?

755
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,210
Be serious, I'm being serious here.

756
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,090
Then let's sit down and talk.

757
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,260
Okay?

758
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,650
Why are you smiling?

759
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,690
To be honest with you,

760
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,420
I've been thinking a lot about one thing lately:

761
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,260
Why am I so resistant

762
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,820
to putting a label on our relationship?

763
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,090
And then I realized,

764
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,820
maybe it's because

765
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,610
after my first marriage ended,

766
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,050
I've gotten used to living on my own.

767
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,050
I can do whatever I want every day,

768
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,740
I don't have to accommodate anyone else anymore.

769
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,980
I'm honestly terrified of being tied down again.

770
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,210
You mean...

771
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,940
During the time we were together,

772
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,050
did I make you feel restricted?

773
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,490
It's not your fault.

774
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,740
And of course, it's not mine either.

775
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,570
We're just at different stages in life.

776
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,530
We think about different things,

777
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,490
right?

778
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,610
Right now, I'm just a little afraid of

779
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,820
this kind of complicated relationship.

780
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,530
Then let's make this complicated relationship

781
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,570
simpler.

782
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,820
From now on, I'll just call you "Boss."

783
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,460
Sure.

784
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,690
Say it again.

785
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,860
Boss.

786
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,090
Again.

787
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,170
Boss.

788
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,010
Once more.

789
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,820
Boss.

790
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,420
This tree is so beautiful.

791
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,570
Not as beautiful as you.

792
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,980
You're getting really good at sweet-talking.

793
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,490
Come on, time for some meat.

794
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,610
Alright.

795
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,090
Here.

796
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,210
Do you want this sausage or the squid?

797
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,210
Looks so much like you.

798
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:13,820
Like me?

799
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,340
Yeah.

800
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,490
Have something warm to drink.

801
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,570
- Sure. -  Thanks.

802
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,210
Thanks, Mr. Warmheart.

803
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,460
He really is quite warm.

804
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,380
This year went by just like that.

805
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,900
Yeah, it really did.

806
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,940
Looks like with the year gone by,

807
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,940
you've added two more crow's feet.

808
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,570
Come see me tomorrow.

809
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,780
I'll give you a shot, free of charge.

810
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,780
How generous of you.

811
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,940
Someday I'll give you a Kardashian butt.

812
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:43,900
Deal.

813
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,570
But that won't be free.

814
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,820
A discount will do.

815
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,340
Stingy.

816
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,340
You're not stingy?

817
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,010
Then give me a raise.

818
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,570
How could the operating room lose power?

819
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,130
Bring the emergency light!

820
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,650
Liu, shine some light here.

821
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,570
What's going on?

822
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,780
Told you already,

823
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,980
coming to a place like this for surgery,

824
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,260
you've got to be mentally prepared.

825
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,050
Lower it a bit.

826
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,380
A bit lower.

827
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,490
No, move it forward a little.

828
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,340
There we go.

829
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,490
Can you see now?

830
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,570
Yeah.

831
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,860
Fate is quite interesting, isn't it?

832
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,420
A year ago,

833
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,820
if you told me I'd never have imagined

834
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,610
I'd be doing surgery in a place like this,

835
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,300
and with you, no less.

836
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,980
You might not believe it,

837
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,490
but I've dreamt of this scene so many times,

838
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,530
being with you in this kind of setting.

839
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,740
For real? Sixth sense?

840
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,260
It's true. Believe it or not,

841
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,900
I even knew you'd leave the Third Hospital

842
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,210
to come work with me.

843
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,690
I didn't even know it myself. How did you?

844
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,260
Maybe I just know you better than you know yourself.

845
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,380
Maybe I care about you more.

846
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,130
How's your health?

847
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,860
I'm still alive, aren't I?

848
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,690
Can't be that bad.

849
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,010
I mean the cancer.

850
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,130
When did you find out?

851
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,940
I heard about it pretty early on.

852
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,340
But since we were working together,

853
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,010
you never brought it up, and I didn't want to pry.

854
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,690
At first, I was really worried.

855
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,650
But seeing you so full of energy

856
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,260
and enthusiasm every day.

857
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,900
I felt relieved.

858
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,820
I knew you were doing okay.

859
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,780
Are you afraid of dying?

860
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,460
No.

861
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,610
When I first found out I had cancer,

862
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,460
I actually started caring more about how I looked.

863
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,090
Every day I'd carefully

864
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,210
do my makeup,

865
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,530
coordinate my outfits before going out.

866
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,530
I even dyed my hair

867
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,860
and did my nails

868
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,740
right before the surgery.

869
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,210
That's great.

870
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,740
You know,

871
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,690
these illnesses bring us so much pain,

872
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,210
but caring about our appearance gives us hope.

873
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,420
You're absolutely right.

874
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:51,010
In life, the two most unforgettable things are:

875
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,170
Pain,

876
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,090
and hope.

877
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,860
But sometimes,

878
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,900
pain and hope are really just two sides of the same coin.

879
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,380
You know, as doctors,

880
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,820
we face life and death every day.

881
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,050
But it's always someone else's life and death.

882
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,530
We're flesh and blood too.

883
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,940
One day it's going to be our turn.

884
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,170
Life is unpredictable.

885
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,690
What matters most

886
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,820
is living beautifully, right?

887
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,300
Finally.

888
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,940
Alright then, let's be forever pretty old ladies.

889
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,940
Pretty ladies it is!

890
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,260
Why'd you have to add "old"?

891
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,340
Afraid of aging?

892
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,820
Everyone ages, okay?

893
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,530
Look, my crow's feet have gotten two more lines.

894
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,420
I'll give you two injections for free.

895
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,980
I don't need that.

896
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,380
I love my wrinkles!

897
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,570
Alright then,

898
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,860
let's keep them.
