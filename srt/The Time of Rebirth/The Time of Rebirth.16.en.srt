1
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,319
Do you know the symbolism of sunflowers?

2
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,480
Even if

3
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,200
Even if you know your fate,

4
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,359
you should still burn brightly.

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,480
Yiyi,

6
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,959
I just don't want you to be like this.

7
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,000
You're too sensible.

8
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,480
So sensible it breaks my heart.

9
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,200
I was born a spiritual being.

10
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:36,159
The sect chose me as the Young Saintess since I was little.

11
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,920
But I don't hate anyone.

12
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,799
Because everyone in Wangxian Sect

13
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
has always treated me kindly.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,040
We all have our own destinies.

15
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,560
Whether you accept it or not,

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,959
Why does everyone just naturally accept

17
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,840
the idea of sacrifice?

18
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,280
Once I get the Brahman Fruit,

19
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
I can change my fate.

20
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,680
Lin Yue,

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,799
I accept my fate.

22
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,560
And I'm grateful

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,439
that fate let me meet you.

24
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,280
Shouldn't you be spending your time now

25
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,280
on the Primordial Battle and the Brahman Fruit?

26
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,319
Don't worry about me.

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,879
I just came to tell you

28
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,360
the Supreme Clear Pool can be upgraded again.

29
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,879
Here's how.

30
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,080
With this upgrade,

31
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,599
we won't have to fear Chixiao Pavilion or Demon Sea anymore.

32
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,159
You never ask me for help.

33
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,520
I know you're the sect leader.

34
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,000
So for the Primordial Battle,

35
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,400
I'll go alone.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,439
Going alone is suicide.

37
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,159
Honestly, I envy Yiyi.

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
She has someone who loves her so much.

39
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,840
Don't you want to protect her too?

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,120
It's just that you

41
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,560
don't dare to face it.

42
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,240
Have a drink!

43
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,599
Young Saint King,

44
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,879
that Brahman Fruit—

45
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,080
can it really raise two realms at once?

46
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,759
If I'm not in Wangxian Sect in the future,

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,800
Demon Sea and Chixiao Pavilion—

48
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,159
you must keep a close watch on them.

49
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,199
Even if you reach the Transcendent Realm,

50
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,080
you still can't defeat the Demon Emperor.

51
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,399
Young Saint King,

52
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,319
I'm really curious—

53
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,879
where does your courage come from?

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,560
I've fought the Demon Emperor tens of thousands of times.

55
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,680
Did you win?

56
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,279
Then why keep fighting?

57
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,720
Some things,

58
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,160
even if you know there's no outcome,

59
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,000
you still have to do them.

60
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,680
Not practicing swordsmanship tonight?

61
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,120
Do you know why I

62
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,279
keep training so hard?

63
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,199
Ever since I learned Yiyi is the Young Saintess,

64
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,920
and would be sacrificed one day,

65
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,319
I swore

66
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,439
to become the strongest,

67
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,040
and take her away.

68
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,279
To somewhere the Seven Tribulations Demon Emperor can't find us.

69
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,040
But the more I train, the more I realize

70
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,800
it's impossible.

71
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
No one can escape the Demon Emperor.

72
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,279
I've made up my mind.

73
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,680
I'll join Yiyi in the sacrifice.

74
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,519
Don't talk nonsense.

75
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,000
Once I find the Brahman Fruit,

76
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,560
no one will have to die.

77
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,720
Just as I thought.

78
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,319
Or maybe just forget it.

79
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,839
No matter what the people of Wangxian Sect think,

80
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,800
the Primordial Battle is too interesting to miss.

81
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,199
I definitely won't let it pass me by.

82
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,759
I've already had a drink.

83
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,120
You have to count me in.

84
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,879
Let's make it clear first.

85
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,839
I'm only joining the Primordial Battle.

86
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,839
I'll help you get the Brahman Fruit.

87
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,279
As for anything else,

88
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,959
let's not talk about it for now.

89
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,360
Thank you all, then.

90
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,439
Wait, I'm coming too!

91
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,839
Foolish child.

92
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,360
I thought we could have a peaceful journey.

93
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,079
But along the way,

94
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,800
it'll be noisy and lively again.

95
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,480
Something's wrong!

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Something's wrong!

97
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,759
Something's wrong! Something's really wrong!

98
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
The spy has sent word.

99
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,959
People from Chixiao Pavilion and Demon Sea

100
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,800
have already reached the Primordial Secret Realm.

101
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,759
There's still half a month to go.

102
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,079
They're in such a hurry.

103
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,920
The report says

104
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,879
the two factions have formed an alliance.

105
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,439
They've set up a trap.

106
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,959
They're just waiting for us to walk right into it.

107
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,040
I was still unsure before

108
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,920
if we could win the Primordial Battle.

109
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,480
But now it's clear.

110
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
They've given me inspiration.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,439
Young Saint King, what do you mean by that?

112
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,720
Chixiao Pavilion and Demon Sea have allied.

113
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,839
This is a huge disadvantage

114
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,399
for our Wangxian Sect.

115
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,040
Elder Xuanyou.

116
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,759
Let's go together.

117
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,639
Forget it, forget it.

118
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,839
Everyone, be careful on the journey.

119
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll stay behind

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,279
to guard Wangxian Sect.

121
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,800
I'll fulfill my duty to protect our home.

122
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,839
Elder Xuanyou, just enjoy your retirement at home.

123
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,800
Thank you for your understanding, Elder Longlin.

124
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,160
Alright.

125
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,680
Now everyone will go with you.

126
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,759
That puts my mind at ease.

127
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,199
I'll wait for you at home.

128
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,439
Wait for me peacefully.

129
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,560
I'm leaving now.

130
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,079
Let's set out.
