2
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,920
We hope everyone bids enthusiastically.

3
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,760
Thank you for your support.

4
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,879
The auction officially begins now.

5
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,040
The first item up for auction

6
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,719
is this piece of Glow Pearl Stone.

7
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,879
Starting bid is 100,000 Glow Pearls.

8
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,280
500,000.

9
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,120
I'll bid to support Xiao Yue.

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,159
Raise the bid.

11
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,480
1,500,000.

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,239
2,000,000.

13
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,560
5,000,000.

14
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,120
Lin Yue.

15
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,359
Are you out of your mind?

16
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,480
5,000,000, going once.

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,519
5,000,000, going twice.

18
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
5,000,000, going three times.

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,359
Sold!

20
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,400
Five million for a useless rock?

21
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,680
Let's see how you explain this to the Sect.

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,480
Let me show you something impressive.

23
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,719
This stone is made of Mystic Silver.

24
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,439
It's worth five million on its own.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,879
Not to mention,

26
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,520
Look closely!

27
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:19,800
A talisman!

28
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,639
Besides,

29
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,000
Inside this Mystic Silver,

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,960
there's a top-tier talisman.

31
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,400
It's one of a kind in the entire Hongmeng Continent.

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,319
This talisman

33
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,360
can be used for the Instant Universe Array.

34
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,919
It allows instant teleportation anywhere.

35
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,719
Looks like Brother Lin is determined to get this talisman.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
It's good to have it for emergencies.

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,360
The second auction item

38
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,080
is an Ancient Divine Sword.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,520
A master craftsman spent thirty years

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,120
forging it from Starmetal.

41
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,520
Its power is incredible.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,319
Starting bid is one million Glow Pearls.

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,360
Six million.

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,120
Seven million.

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,280
Eight million.

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,479
Ten million.

47
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,599
You again?

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,879
Twenty million.

49
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,479
Young Master, calm down.

50
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,199
Fine.

51
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,159
We'll buy this sword another time.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,879
With your skills,

53
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,639
stop pretending to be rich.

54
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:16,960
Wait.

55
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,039
Brother Lin,

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,680
just keep bidding.

57
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,639
I'll cover the money.

58
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,879
I'll pay for it.

59
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,199
I appreciate your kindness, Brother Qin.

60
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,520
But

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,000
there's no need

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,479
to argue with that idiot.

63
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,800
The auction has just started.

64
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
We should save our strength.

65
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,319
You're the idiot.

66
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,520
Twenty million, going once.

67
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,479
Twenty million, going twice.

68
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,919
Twenty million, going three times.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,560
Sold!

70
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,439
Alright, alright!

71
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,879
Young Master Lei is so cool!

72
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,240
Xiao Yue,

73
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
do you see my strength now?

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,759
This Fairy Sword requires weapon bonding.

75
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Someone like you

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,680
probably can't even draw it.

77
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,919
Fairy Sword.

78
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,439
Young Master Lei, you don't know?

79
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,719
I bought this sword

80
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,159
to give to our Sect Leader Qin Ji.

81
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,159
It's a gift.

82
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,960
Why did you buy this sword?

83
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
I'm so handsome,

84
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,199
how dare you mess with me!

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,000
You were the one who bid.

86
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,560
How can you blame Young Master Lin?

87
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,439
Young Master,

88
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,439
let him go.

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,079
You can't beat him anyway.

90
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,000
Let go of me!

91
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,160
The third auction item

92
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,439
is the treasured artifact of Night King City.

93
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,839
The Ancient Secret Key.

94
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,879
That's it.

95
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,759
Starting bid: twenty million Glow Pearls.

96
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,360
This is Night King City's heirloom.

97
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
There's a way to keep it from leaving the family.

98
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,879
Whoever wins the treasure

99
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,120
will marry Ye Mingyue.

100
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,639
If the treasure goes to the son-in-law,

101
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,319
it's not considered passing it to outsiders.

102
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,519
Brother Lin,

103
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,839
do you know the origin of this key?

104
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,040
Of course I do.

105
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,160
And

106
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,000
I also know how to use it.

107
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,360
Luo Yixue,

108
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,759
place a bid.

109
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,439
How much?

110
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,040
Twenty-five million.

111
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,399
We don't have that much money, do we?

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,079
Just bid as I say.

113
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,560
Twenty-five million.

114
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,480
I may not know how to use it,

115
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,079
but Night King City's treasure

116
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,639
can't end up in the hands of a country bumpkin.

117
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,839
Thirty million.

118
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,079
Forty million.

119
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,399
Fifty million.

120
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,319
Sixty million.

121
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,079
Sev—

122
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,240
Sixty-one million.

123
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,800
Eighty million.

124
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,079
Show us your eighty million first.

125
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,639
If you can't,

126
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,240
that's fraud.

127
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,240
I'll pay for him.

128
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,000
Sect Leader.

129
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,639
So,

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,480
you really know how to use this key, huh?

131
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,160
Thank you, Sect Leader.

132
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,480
Of course I do.

133
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,680
There are too many people and eyes here.

134
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,680
How about

135
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,399
we find a quiet place to talk?

136
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,519
I'll follow your arrangements.

137
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,839
Discussing such an important secret,

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,720
how could you leave out the Young Sect Leader?

139
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,079
Let's go.

140
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,160
Lin Yue,

141
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,360
you stole my woman and cheated me out of money.

142
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,720
Now you're stealing my spotlight.

143
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,879
I'm settling all scores with you.

144
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,879
Lei Zong,

145
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,639
don't be so arrogant.

146
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,160
Your sect's swapping of the Saintess

147
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,759
can't be hidden from me.

148
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,800
Jun Wushang,

149
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,279
you sold the city's treasure to an outsider.

150
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,480
What right do you have to lecture me?

151
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,399
Today, I insist on killing him.

152
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,800
Young Sect Leader!

153
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,160
Young Sect Leader!

154
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,759
The Sect Leader of Lei Yun Sect is as strong as Jun Wushang.

155
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,000
If his son is killed,

156
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,040
this kid won't live much longer.

157
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,000
He's gotten himself into big trouble.

158
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,959
Father, you saw it all.

159
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,600
Young Master Lin was forced to fight back.

160
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,800
I saw everything.

161
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,399
But

162
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,040
Sect Leader Lei definitely won't let this go.

163
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,000
Even without this incident,

164
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,759
Lei Yun Sect Leader Lei Long

165
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,279
would come for us anyway.

166
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,120
Young Master Lin,

167
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,759
you should leave Night King City quickly.

168
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,959
You've already got what you wanted.

169
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:30,839
No rush.

170
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,720
There's something I truly want

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,839
still to come.

172
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,040
You're pretty calm, aren't you?

173
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,639
Aren't you afraid Lei Long will come for you?

174
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,360
I'm not someone who fears trouble.

175
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,639
You really don't know your limits.

176
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,600
Do you know Lei Yun Sect Leader Lei Long's level?

177
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,800
Ninth Rotation Realm.

178
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,000
And you're only at the Salvation Realm.

179
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,319
He could kill you easily.

180
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,839
I'm no match for him.

181
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,759
But

182
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,000
I have help.

183
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,680
What help?

184
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,759
Heaven's secrets must not be revealed.

185
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,319
Sect Leader Ye,

186
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,879
you came

187
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,560
for the Annihilation Cosmic Staff, right?

188
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,439
Except for this kid,

189
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,319
everyone else, step back.

190
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,519
Step back.

191
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,079
Yes.

192
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,120
You're still so young,

193
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,600
how do you know about the Annihilation Cosmic Staff?

194
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
The Annihilation Cosmic Staff

195
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,080
was left by one of the Three Emperors of the Upper Realm,

196
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,399
Qi Tian Emperor.

197
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,039
It has the power to sweep through armies.

198
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,240
Rumor has it

199
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,720
the Annihilation Cosmic Staff is hidden somewhere in Night King City,

200
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,399
protected by a mysterious magic array.

201
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,200
And your family

202
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,360
has held the key to the array for generations.

203
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,240
But even you

204
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,200
don't know the exact location of the array.

205
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,320
So you used the auction

206
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,600
to lure those in the know.

207
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
My daughter was right about you.

208
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,600
Son-in-law, let's head to the array now.

209
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,159
Alright.

210
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,200
But

211
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,279
I hope City Lord Ye will agree to one thing.

212
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,000
What is it?

213
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,080
After we get the Annihilation Cosmic Staff,

214
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,639
I want to borrow it for a while.

215
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,320
To accomplish something important.

216
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,559
Once it's done,

217
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,600
I will definitely return it.

218
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,080
Who did this

219
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,480
with such cruelty?

220
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,480
It was Lin Yue.

221
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,639
If I don't avenge this grudge,

222
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,679
I swear I won't rest until I get revenge.
