1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,920
Why are you here?

2
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,719
I'm admiring the moon.

3
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,439
I've been studying a new sword manual lately.

4
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,319
It's called Drunken Sword.

5
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,519
It says you must get drunk before practicing.

6
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:24,840
Yiyi.

7
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,799
Let's have a drink.

8
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,760
Then I'll gladly accept.

9
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,000
Protector of the Sword, please.

10
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,640
Lady Qin, please.

11
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,120
Yiyi.

12
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,599
Tonight,

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,719
let's drink today's wine today.

14
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,799
You hold your liquor well.

15
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,319
Cheers.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,599
Lin Yue.

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,760
Lin Yue isn't here.

18
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,040
I was mistaken.

19
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,359
Really.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,599
Come on.

21
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,800
Sect Leader.

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,840
Sect Leader.

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,439
Yiyi.

24
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,719
You're teasing me.

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,319
Who teased whom first?

26
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,479
I don't care.

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,039
You must drink as punishment.

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,479
Then you must too.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,439
Alright.

30
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,159
Cheers.

31
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,439
Yiyi.

32
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,360
Please forgive me.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,639
Chier.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,599
Yiyi.

35
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,879
Since childhood,

36
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,840
I've never seen Chier lie like this before.

37
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,919
It must be hard for her.

38
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,800
I can't just watch you die.

39
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,280
But even more so,

40
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,960
I can't watch all the sect disciples

41
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,000
be destroyed because of me.

42
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,000
But they've always wanted to sacrifice you.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,840
They want your life.

44
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,319
It was the Sect that saved me.

45
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,919
My life belongs to them.

46
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,439
What's wrong with giving it back?

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,840
I'll take you away.

48
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,360
Let me go.

49
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,879
Even if you take me away today,

50
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,520
when the Sect falls someday,

51
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,560
I'll still go to my death.

52
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,439
Lin Yue.

53
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,479
This is my fate.

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,120
I can't escape it.

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,879
I must go.

56
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,080
Promise me one last thing.

57
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,599
Don't seek revenge on the Demon Emperor of Seven Tribulations.

58
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,479
Forget me.

59
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,079
Has the Saintess come to plead for herself?

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,199
I wish to depart immediately.

61
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,879
To the Demon Emperor's palace.

62
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,120
Why?

63
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,879
Since we know we'll part,

64
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,319
it's better to part sooner.

65
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,879
Let me ask you once more.

66
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,160
Are you here to plead for yourself?

67
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,519
You may go.

68
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,240
Thank you, Sect Leader.

69
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,480
To the Sect,

70
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,160
for years of nurturing and care.

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,600
Yiyi is leaving.

72
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,519
Sect Leader.

73
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,639
Take care.

74
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,000
Beyond the cycle,

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,680
lies Transcendence.

76
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,439
It seems you have refined the Brahma Fruit.

77
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,920
You have entered the Transcendent Realm.

78
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,600
How could this happen?

79
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,160
You broke through too quickly.

80
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,600
Your foundation is unstable.

81
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,920
What do you plan to do?

82
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,800
Biluoshangqing Palace

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,360
is my last hope.

84
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,199
Biluoshangqing Palace

85
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,959
is the legacy of the Molong Emperor.

86
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,800
Back then, the Molong Emperor's power

87
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,759
far surpassed the Seven Tribulations Demon Emperor.

88
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,519
But he was secretly harmed by the Demon Emperor.

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,079
Fortunately, the Molong Emperor left a backup plan.

90
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,680
That preserved the Biluoshangqing Palace lineage.

91
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,560
What backup plan?

92
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,079
The Molong Formation.

93
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,959
It contains all the Molong Emperor's cultivation.

94
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,000
Because of this,

95
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
the Demon Emperor doesn't dare

96
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,759
to openly challenge Biluoshangqing Palace.

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,360
If I reach the core of the formation,

98
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,560
and obtain the Molong Emperor's power,

99
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,959
maybe I can

100
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,240
fight the Demon Emperor.

101
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,439
How confident are you?

102
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,120
Nine.

103
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,879
A slim chance of survival.

104
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,600
The spell to break the Molong Formation—

105
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,279
have you developed it?

106
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,800
Not yet.

107
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,040
Please, Your Majesty, grant me more time.

108
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,360
Please, Your Majesty, calm your anger.

109
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,279
Please, Your Majesty, calm your anger.

110
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,920
The formation is so powerful

111
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,920
even I fear it.

112
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,399
To break the spell

113
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,079
is not something easily done.

114
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,360
I do not blame you.

115
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,120
But there is no reason

116
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,600
to keep you here any longer.

117
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,399
No one comes without reason.

118
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,959
Brother Lin, what brings you here?

119
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,759
I want to enter the Molong Formation.

120
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,759
Brother Qin, you may not know—

121
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,319
the Demon Emperor

122
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,639
has already obtained half of the Brahma Fruit.

123
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,879
His power has greatly increased.

124
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,800
I'm afraid the Molong Formation is now—

125
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,439
The Molong Formation is full of traps.

126
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,959
Anyone who enters will surely die.

127
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,680
You'd better not try.

128
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,480
Come, have a drink.

129
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,800
Palace Master, several elders wish to see you.

130
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,879
What’s going on?

131
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,639
Why did he call us all here?

132
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,560
I’m not sure either.

133
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,960
Fellow disciples,

134
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,960
Everyone,

135
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,799
Today is an important day.

136
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,279
Grief.

137
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,519
Saintess Qin Yiyi

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,080
To prevent our sect from falling into chaos,

139
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,600
she went alone

140
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,360
to the Palace of the Seven Demonic Emperors.

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,519
How tragic.

142
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,919
So lamentable.

143
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,399
The Saintess has shown kindness to our sect.

144
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,480
How can we, disciples of the sect, be ungrateful?

145
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,639
So Elder Longlin and I have thought it over.

146
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,480
We’ve decided to lead everyone

147
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,759
to erect a statue for the Saintess.

148
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,679
Erect a statue for the Saintess!

149
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,039
No, what I mean is—

150
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,600
Erect a statue for the Saintess!

151
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,879
Erect a statue for the Saintess!

152
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,120
Erect a statue for the Saintess!

153
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,559
Erect a statue for the Saintess!

154
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,480
Just the two of us can go.

155
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,440
Everyone here is just pretending, afraid of death.

156
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,159
Stop right there!

157
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,559
Go back.

158
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,039
No.

159
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,440
Try me.

160
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,080
Sect Leader.

161
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
We just want to fight the Seven Demonic Emperor ourselves.

162
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,200
Is that not allowed?

163
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,000
Who are you?

164
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,000
I am—

165
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,120
Longlin.

166
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,919
Chier.

167
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,120
And a friend of Lin Yue and Qin Yiyi.

168
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,120
You’re Chier, Guardian of the sect.

169
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,320
You’re Elder Longlin of the Sixth Hall.

170
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,440
Then I’ll leave the sect.

171
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,480
You want to leave?

172
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,759
Your techniques were taught by the sect.

173
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,440
All your status and honor

174
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,080
were given by the sect.

175
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,159
If you want to leave,

176
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,080
return everything to the sect.

177
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,559
For the next few days,

178
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,799
go to the Cave of Clarity

179
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,240
and meditate in seclusion as punishment.

180
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,480
I refuse.
