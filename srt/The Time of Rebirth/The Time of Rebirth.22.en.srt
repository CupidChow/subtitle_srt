1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,640
Brother Lin has been inside the formation array for a while.

2
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,200
I wonder how he's progressing.

3
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,319
Palace Master.

4
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,280
The Demon Emperor of Seven Tribulations has returned.

5
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,400
He has announced to the world

6
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,159
that in three days, he will wipe out the Sect of Forgotten Immortals.

7
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,640
Sis, something's wrong!

8
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,640
Many sect disciples have defected.

9
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,560
I already know.

10
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,680
Those cowards who fear death,

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,480
have wasted all the kindness our sect gave them.

12
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,680
Sect Leader.

13
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,239
Lin Yue, he...

14
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:36,840
Be patient.

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,439
Let fate decide.

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,959
where our sect will end up.

17
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,000
Big.

18
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,519
You lost again.

19
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,159
Ribs.

20
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,959
Only a third of your bones are broken.

21
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,840
Your soul is already very weak.

22
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,400
If you give up now,

23
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,439
you might still have a chance to survive.

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,439
Continue.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,599
Let me handle this round.

26
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,319
Bet big or small?

27
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,240
Since you always bet big,

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,360
I'll bet small.

29
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,439
Leopard wins all.

30
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:29,840
How do we count that?

31
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,879
If it's a win-all,

32
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,000
it's up to you.

33
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,719
Then everything that's left

34
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:37,960
all of it.

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,439
As you wish.

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,439
After all these years, I finally

37
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,840
got my hands on such a talented fool.

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,520
You are the perfect vessel for my power.

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,919
How could I not possess your body?

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,719
I will use your body

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,439
to live another lifetime.

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
Sect of Forgotten Immortals.

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,439
Yiyi.

44
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,759
They're here.

45
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,800
Mountain Protection Array.

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,080
Empowered by generations of Sect Leaders.

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,759
Even the Demon Emperor of Seven Tribulations

48
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,000
can't break through so easily.

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,280
How could this happen?

50
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,599
Our sect's thousand-year foundation

51
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,479
is so fragile before the Demon Emperor.

52
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,159
Is it really this weak?

53
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,199
Everyone,

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,319
today we live or die with our sect.

55
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,639
Submit to me

56
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,879
and you may live.

57
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,759
Keep dreaming.

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,759
We stayed here today

59
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,040
knowing we wouldn't survive.

60
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,079
Qinji, as Sect Leader,

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,079
will you ignore your people's lives?

62
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,040
What a joke.

63
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,439
We of the Sect of Forgotten Immortals

64
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,199
are not cowards who fear death.

65
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,240
When the Immortal Founder established our sect,

66
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,600
he created the Sect of Forgotten Immortals.

67
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,920
He taught us to cultivate fate and pursue the eternal Dao.

68
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,720
But even he couldn't see through the Dao.

69
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,600
How could he know if his path was right?

70
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,720
Isn't that a joke?

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,480
Your Majesty, Demon Emperor.

72
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,079
I, your old servant Xuanyou,

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,240
wish to follow you,

74
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,959
and seek the true Dao.

75
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,199
Futile.

76
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,439
Sect Leader.

77
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,439
Now's the time!

78
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,560
Ten Thousand Curses Binding Array!

79
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,279
Sword Maniac, Longlin!

80
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,040
Destroy everything!

81
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,680
Heavenly Sword Array of Demon-Slaying!

82
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,959
It actually worked!

83
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,800
Sect Leader.

84
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,920
What are you doing?

85
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,959
Why is everyone fighting each other?

86
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,040
Illusions and deceptions.

87
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,000
Lost in appearances.

88
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,759
Can't even see through such simple illusions.

89
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,000
Your cultivation is far too weak.

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,319
Sect Leader.

91
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,560
Admit your fear.

92
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,240
Submit and serve me.

93
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,319
I'm not afraid of you.

94
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,000
Even if I vanish in the next moment,

95
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,199
I'm still not afraid of you.

96
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,920
Then disappear now.

97
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,839
Who is it?

98
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,240
My woman

99
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,439
Is she someone you can boss around?

100
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,600
You came to break through the array

101
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,839
to kill the Seven Evils Demon Emperor

102
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,680
What else would it be?

103
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,079
Why do you have to kill him?

104
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,480
Why does it have to be you?

105
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,439
You, you, you—

106
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,839
You’re really messing with my head!

107
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,480
You’re dead set on killing Seven Evils, aren’t you?

108
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,759
I’m almost gone myself

109
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,959
Why would I lie to you now?

110
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,160
Forget it, I won’t dwell on it

111
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,439
I’ll return your body to you

112
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,920
And give you my legacy

113
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,040
Senior

114
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,480
What are you up to now?

115
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,399
Why do you care what I’m up to?

116
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,079
Just do one thing for me

117
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,319
Kill that old bastard Seven Evils

118
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,839
You’re really lucky, you know that?

119
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,360
There’s one more thing

120
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,519
You want to ask me

121
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,360
why I don’t finish the soul possession

122
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,800
and take revenge myself, right?

123
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,360
After soul possession

124
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,319
I’d be left with barely a tenth of my power

125
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,040
Even if I made it back to reality

126
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,319
I’d only be able to scrape by

127
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,879
But if I give you my legacy

128
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,240
you can kill him for me

129
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,600
that old bastard Seven Evils

130
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,879
Karma’s a bitch

131
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,519
Senior

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,959
Any last words?

133
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
When you see Seven Evils

134
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,959
Beat him to death for me

135
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,120
Beat him to a pulp

136
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,920
Utter annihilation

137
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,439
Got it?

138
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:31,800
Lin Yue

139
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,399
Sorry, I’m late

140
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,039
I told you

141
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,240
I’d come back

142
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,720
I know

143
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,200
Interesting

144
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,279
You’re worthy of my attention

145
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,480
You all take a break

146
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,519
I’ll go beat him up again

147
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,200
Lin Yue

148
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,919
Don’t hold back

149
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,200
Beat him to death

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,639
Alright

151
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,399
Mo Dragon Emperor

152
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,200
Brahma Fruit

153
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,960
Looks like you’ve gathered everything I wanted

154
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:19,879
Of course

155
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,440
Or how else would I kill you?

156
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,440
You’re lucky to have made it this far

157
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,759
If you’re willing to serve me

158
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,360
I can give you a chance

159
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
For a hundred millennia

160
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,679
You’ve killed me countless times

161
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,440
This time, it’s your turn to die
