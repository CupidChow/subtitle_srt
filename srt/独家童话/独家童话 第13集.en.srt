I have a good news, Zhu.

179
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,940
I'm getting a girlfriend.

It's true this time.

Let me tell you.

don't blame me for not thinking of you every time.

191

Tonight,

192
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,900
I invited them

193
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,940

But there's another problem.

206

Just the two of us

207

The three of them are my high school juniors.

351
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,360
We knew each other.

352
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,980
It's fate.

353
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,260
We must celebrate it.

354
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,620
Come on.

355
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,460
Everyone, come in.

356
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,420
Please come in.

357
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,140
Please come in.

358
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,700
Please come in.

359
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,580
Let's go. He's so enthusiastic.

360
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,980
Hello. How many of you?

361
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,820
Eight.

362
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,740
Sit here.

363
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,340
Come here.

364
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,940
This place is nice.

365
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,300
Sha.

366
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,900
Are you

367
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,800
going on a pilgrimage for Buddhist scriptures?

368
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,650
This

369
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,060
starts from

370
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,460
the freshman year.

371
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,300
When I first entered the school,

372
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,140
master,

373
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,510
also your senior Ling Chao,

374
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,100
became the target of all the girls

375
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,980
in a blink of an eye.

376
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,340
Even the goddess senior who is one year older than us

377
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,340
was pursuing master.

378
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,100
Guess what?

379
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,820
What?

380
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,540
Master firmly declined

381
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,220
her pursuit.

382
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,780
Also, he didn't even bat an eyelash

383
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,180
at other girls' pursuit.

384
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,980
Almost

385
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,460
was thought to be...

386
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,220
Wukong!

387
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,680
That's enough.

388
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,460
Yes, master.

389
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,820
I'll make it short.

390
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,420
So my master was called

391
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,020
the Tang Monk.

392
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,420
My surname is Sun and his surname is Zhu.

393
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,140
We're a group of master and his disciples.

394
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,860
But this story

395
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,980
has nothing to do with Guan Jiu.

396
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,180
It doesn't matter.

397
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,220
Anyway, Sha thinks

398
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,940
other than reading,

399
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,860
everything else has nothing to do with him.

400
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,650
Right, Sha?

401
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,220
Read, Sha.

402
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,260
Are you ready to order?

403
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,220
I want a pan-fried steak

404
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,100
and a braised beef brisket.

405
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:06,660
Okay.

406
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,860
No cilantro, please.

407
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,660
And a bottle of coconut juice.

408
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,140
Okay, what would you like?

409
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,620
Junior,

410
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,780
it's such a happy day.

411
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,980
How can you drink coconut juice?

412
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,660
Waiter, a dozen of beer, please.

413
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,250
Okay.

414
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,830
Give her coconut juice.

415
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,590
If you want to drink,

416
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,870
I'll drink with you.

417
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,740
Master,

418
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,930
you care so much about her.

419
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,260
If madam knew,

420
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,020
won't she get jealous?

421
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,930
Ling Chao, do you have a girlfriend?

422
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,740
No, no.

423
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,420
He is kidding.

424
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,580
I'm not joking.

425
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,520
What are you doing?

426
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,500
Why are you touching me like this?

427
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,380
I'm not joking.

428
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,580
I'm telling the truth.

429
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,580
You don't know.

430
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,180
Master actually has a child bride.

431
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,420
I didn't expect that after such a long time,

432
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,860
the gossip about the child bride

433
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,500
has spread to Yunhai.

434
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,580
Big brother,

435
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,700
do you know

436
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,220
who is the legendary

437
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,060
child bride?

438
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,660
I really don't know.

439
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,100
But I heard them talking on the phone.

440
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,380
That woman

441
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,370
was so fierce.

442
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,650
Oh, no.

443
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,660
So fierce?

444
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,300
This woman

445
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:13,900
is fierce.

446
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,100
Amazing. That's something.

447
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,980
Amazing.

448
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,980
[Welcome]

449
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,660
Let me repeat the rules.

450
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,140
Each of us count in turn.

451
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,580
When the number is 7 and multiples of 7,

452
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,620
you need to tap the table and shout "pass."

453
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,420
The loser will perform a talent.

454
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,340
Let's change the punishment.

455
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:32,820
Okay.

456
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,980
Let's do dare.

457
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,400
Okay? This is good.

458
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,540
Sure.

459
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,070
Starting from me this time.

460
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,780
219.

461
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,860
220.

462
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,740
Pass.

463
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,460
I tapped the table.

464
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,700
What does 221 have to do with 7?

465
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,020
Right?

466
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,140
Let me show you taekwondo.

467
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,140
No.

468
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,060
Forget it.

469
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,460
Don't ruin the shop.

470
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,660
Sit down.

471
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,380
Okay, go ahead.

472
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,710
What do you want me to do?

473
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,300
I suggest...

474
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,100
I agree.

475
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,540
I haven't said it yet.

476
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,540
What do you think?

477
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,220
Find a man

478
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,500
and get his contact information.

479
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,420
Good idea.

480
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,819
Well, besides our table.

481
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,140
I think it's okay.

482
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,700
It might even develop into something more.

483
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,420
After all, our top priority in university

484
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,099
-is to have a...
-To study...

485
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,619
A campus love!

486
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,140
A campus love.

487
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,980
It's inappropriate... we don't know each other.

488
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,020
Does it help if you know each other?

489
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,420
If you don't know him, you can try to know him.

490
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,140
Right?

491
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,290
Yes, yes, yes.

492
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,460
Okay?

493
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,340
Fine.

494
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,340
Pick one.

495
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,490
That one. That one.

496
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,620
I think that's good.

497
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,180
Okay?

498
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,100
That one is really good.

499
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,820
Go!

500
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,860
Hurry up.

501
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,660
Go.

502
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,380
Xiao Tu. Xiao Tu. Xiao Tu.

503
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,740
Hello.

504
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,940
Can I add you on WeChat?

505
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,140
He is very popular.

506
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,780
Wait.

507
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,310
You can go after she's done.

508
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,980
Sorry, it's not convenient.

509
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,780
Okay.

510
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,380
Hurry up.

511
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,500
Your turn.

512
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,380
Go away.

513
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,030
This is social suicide.

514
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,820
Did you lose a game?

515
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,460
It's okay.

516
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,540
Tell me.

517
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,350
What do you want me to do?

518
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,260
Master,

519
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,860
this is vinegar.

520
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,920
Is there a problem?

521
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,480
This is what I'm drinking.

522
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,780
Phone.

523
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,100
Here.

524
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,420
It's out of battery.

525
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,900
It's okay.

526
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,140
Here.

527
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,060
Oh my god.

528
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,140
Master, are you alright?

529
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,460
Master.

530
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,220
Are you okay? What's wrong?

531
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,180
He was fine just now.

532
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,940
I don't know. I think he's drunk.

533
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,980
He needs some rest.

534
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,460
What are you waiting for? Send him back.

535
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,060
Go back.

536
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,940
Sha, let me do it.

537
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,540
Let's go.

538
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,380
[We are open]

539
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,860
Slow down.

540
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,610
Let's go.

541
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:19,240
[Welcome]

542
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,220
What happened?

543
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,760
What's wrong, Sha?

544
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,670
I think I ate something bad.

545
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,660
You...

546
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,560
Come with me to the infirmary.

547
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,170
Let's go. Wait.

548
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,660
Xiao Tu.

549
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,740
I'll leave master to you.

550
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,980
What are you talking about?

551
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,780
How could you leave master

552
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,060
to a weak girl?

553
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,700
Don't worry.

554
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,580
Leave master to me. Hurry up.

555
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,420
Big brother,

556
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,570
you have to send the other juniors back to the dorm.

557
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,380
Okay.

558
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,780
Juniors,

559
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,060
I'll send you back.

560
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,140
It's getting late.

561
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,940
It's not safe on the way.

562
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,060
Let me see you off.

563
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,460
Let's go.

564
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,590
How dangerous is it?

565
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,700
Are there any ghosts?

566
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,860
Can you tell us?

567
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,180
This, this, this.

568
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,770
Don't drink if you can't.

569
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,020
Don't throw me into the lake.

570
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,180
Again?

571
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,810
You can't leave me alone.

572
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,580
Okay.

573
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,260
I won't.

574
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,330
I won't.

575
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,020

Why did’t you go upstairs?

620
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,700
Xu Linglong and I didn't bring the key.

621

We don't know where the dormitory supervisor is.

You are the hope of the whole dorm now.

625
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,900
I might let you down.

626
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,300
I thought you would bring the key,

627
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,050
so I didn't bring mine.

628
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,500
I told you we can't count on her.

629

This is great.

630
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,150
We are going to sleep on the street.

631
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,780
Not really.

632
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,220
Xia Mo,

633
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,700
do you remember where you went today?

634
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,300
After I went out today,

635
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,360
I went to the lab building to explore.

636
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,100
Maybe I dropped it there.

637
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,700
It's not far.

638
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,540
Why don't we look for it?

639
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,670
Maybe we can find it.

640
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,330
How can you find the key

641
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,790
in the middle of the night?

642
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,380
Do you have a better idea?

643
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,980
That's the only way.

644
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,260
Let's go. Let's go.

645
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,980
Let's go.

646
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,360
[Waste sorting starts with me]

647
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,300
Is this place haunted?

648
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,690
Really?

649
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,100
I came to Yunhai to see ghosts.

650
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,780
What ghost?

651
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,540
Anything kinds of ghosts.

652
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,060
As long as I can take a look.

653
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,790
Why do I feel that this teaching building is a bit creepy?

654
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,500
Because this building has been abandoned.

655
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,830
Why did you come to an abandoned building?

656
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,740
To check it out!

657
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,940
I heard that

658
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,460
a human skeleton model was lost at school.

659
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,860
Lost?

660
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,420
Yes, lost.

661
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,220
Let's go.

662
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,050
When the students were taking a lesson,

663
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,700
they thought they needed it the next day.

664
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,340
So,

665
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,100
they didn't put it back to the storage room.

666
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,740
But the next day,

667
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,420
this model

668
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,620
went back to its original place.

669
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,860
This model is a Virgo.

670
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,380
It's okay.

671
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,360
Where are they?

672
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,340
It doesn't open.

673
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,220
Let's go.

674
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,820
Let's go back to where we were.

675
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,540
Why are you here?

676
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,780
You're in the way.

677
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,860
Let's go. I'll take you home.

678
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,060
What should we do now?

679
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,700
Wenhui...

680
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,460
It's okay.

681
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,460
I'll protect you.

682
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,540
Where is Xia Mo?

683
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,100
Is she...

684
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,380
She must be in danger.

685
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,620
I'll go get her.

686
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,820
Wait.

687
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,220
Listen.

688
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,160
What are you doing?

689
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,780
Xiao Tu, you...

690
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,900
you aren't afraid, are you?

691
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,700
Why are you walking so fast?

692
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,980
I-I'm afraid.

693
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,310
I am afraid because of all your screaming.

694
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,460
Your hands are sweating,

695
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,900
and you still refuse to admit it.

696
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,230
Then don't hold my hand.

697
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,220
No.

I think it's quite interesting.

00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,980
And we haven't found the key yet.

Forget it.

Let's think of another way.

I told you

703
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,590
finding the key at night is not a good idea.

It's a little hot.

705
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,220
Can you

What time is it now?

It's twelve o'clock,

the peak time of paranormal events.

712

You think too much.

It's curfew time.
