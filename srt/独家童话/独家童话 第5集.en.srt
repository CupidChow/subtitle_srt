Especially the head teachers of both Grade 1 and 2.

You should reflect on yourselves.

Male and female students can't dine on the same table.

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,980
That only means he's tired of studying,

347
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,980
so he wants to go to you beginners to show his presence.

348
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,420
What if

349
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,740
when a girl passed by the basketball court,

350
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,820
in order not to hurt her,

351
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,900
the boy gave up shooting a a three-pointer,

352
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,540
doesn't that mean he cares about her?

353
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,660
From what you said,

354
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,100
this guy is unprofessional

355
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,500
when playing basketball.

356
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,580
Besides,

357
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,460
you'd better not cross the basketball court.

358
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,120
You will disturb the players.

359
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,610
What if

360
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,500
a boy who only cares about himself

361
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,340
suddenly

362
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,300
worries if the girl

363
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,100
would feel cold when sleeping during class,

364
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,780
and if her friend has time to guide her

365
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,500
after class.

366
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,300
Doesn't that mean he cares about her?

367
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,700
You slept during class again?

368
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,900
Aren't you afraid that I'll tell your mom...

369
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,820
Ling Chao,

370
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,260
do you not want to see someone caring about me?

371
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,100
Fine.

372
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,340
If what you said

373
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,860
happened to someone else,

374
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,900
it'd be possible.

375
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,780
But if this girl is you,

376
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,980
I think he might have other intentions.

377
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,260
It's the first day of winter vacation.

378
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,620
The happiest time in the world.

379
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,620
Don't force me to hit you.

380
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,650
Hey!

381
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,300
That's my bike.

382
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,100
Chao, eat more.

383
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,160
What are you doing?

384
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,060
Having dinner.

385
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,900
It looks good.

386
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,740
Do you want to come out tomorrow?

387
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,500
Sure.

388
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,330
Where are we going and doing?

389
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,800
Don't use your phone when eating.

390
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,140
Go to Time Square

391
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,760
and do homework together.

392
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,859
Who is it?

393
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,579
Why has to talk to you during dinner?

394
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,579
My deskmate.

395
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,180
He asked me to do homework tomorrow.

396
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,660
That's a good thing.

397
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,020
You should study

398
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,300
with your classmates.

399
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,940
You'll have the learning atmosphere.

400
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,619
It's good.

401
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,380
It's good.

402
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,580
She always stayed up all night

403
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,640
in the last three days of the holiday to do her homework.

404
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,620
Once,

405
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,060
she couldn't finish it.

406
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,770
She even changed the name

407
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,340
on Chao's homework

408
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,820
into her own name.

409
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,050
Really?

410
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,300
What should Ling Chao do?

411
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,620
I told the teacher

412
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,020
my homework was eaten by the rabbit at home.

413
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,340
Let bygones be bygones.

414
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,380
It's serious this time.

415
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,380
My deskmate, Yin Zihan.

416
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,660
the top student of the grade.

417
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,620
A straight A student.

418
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,020
You can ask Ling Chao.

419
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,100
I'm a sophomore,

420
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,310
how would I know about your first year?

421
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,730
I trust you.

422
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,500

423
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,100

425
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,620
Eat.

426
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,180
Let's eat.

427
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,020
What did you say?

428
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,140
I haven't replied yet.

429
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,380
Why are you so reserved?

430
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,300
Say yes.

431
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,820
Well, I will do homework at the beginning of the holiday?

432
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,580
I want to rest for a few days.

433
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,420
You're hopeless.

434
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,700
Is asking you to do homework

435
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,420
just to study?

436
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,090
That's just an excuse

437
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,570
to ask you out.

438
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,260
Look at that male lead.

439
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,100
He just wants to confess to the female lead.

440
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,540
He's shy

441
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,340
and not straightforward at all.

442
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,900
Xiao Tu's mom and I

443
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,100
were straightforward.

444
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,420
I confessed directly.

445
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,420
Bang. Take her down.

446
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,380
He doesn't know if the female lead likes himself.

447
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,850
So he needs to test her.

448
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,740
But Godfather,

449
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
it's been so many episodes.

450
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,020
Didn't you notice

451
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,800
he's the second male lead?

452
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,620
Really?

453
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,660
That makes sense.

454
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,340
Yin Zihan must be testing me.

455
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,140
After all, we're deskmates.

456
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,220
It's the most natural way to do homework together.

457
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,300
It's really hard work.

458
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,620
But what if he confesses to me?

459
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm so worried.

460
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,180
Have you made up your mind?

461
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,500
There's a new dessert shop in Time Square.

462
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,100
The environment is nice and quiet.

463
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,380
It's suitable for doing homework there.

464
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,380
And their tiramisu is very delicious.

465
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,460

to have desserts at Time Square tomorrow.

Okay.

This is all I have.

00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,580
It suits you well.

692
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,400
Just take this one.

693
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,500
Bill, please.

694
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,260
You have a Gold membership.

695
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,220
You can get 12% off.

696
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,220
The original price is 500 yuan.

697
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,080
It's 440 yuan after the discount.

698
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,700
Okay.

699
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,260
My dad's Black Gold Supreme membership card can get 25% off.

700
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,050
Pay with my card.

701
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,100
Okay, Sir.

702
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,280
Yin Zihan, what are you doing?

703
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,540
I'm saving money for you.

704
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,340
Don't bother.

705
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,830
I'll pay her clothes

706
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,900
with my card.

707
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,820
Get changed.

708
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,310
Please hurry up.

709
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,740
We need to go home for dinner.

710
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,540
Okay.

711
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,900
What's their relationship?

712
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,330
They

713
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,620
grew up

714
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,570
together.

715
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,300
Thank you.

716
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,300
Let's go.

717
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,790
We're leaving. See you next semester.

718
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:21,780
Bye.

719
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,730
12% off and 25% off

720
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,470
are very different.

721
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,540
The gap is...

722
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,340
65.

723
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,810
Yes, 65.

724
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,460
65.

725
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,660
Your deskmate sent you home after school.

726
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,540
He even wants to buy you clothes during holidays.

727
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,140
You have to pay back someday.

728
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,380
If you owe him today,

729
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,780
how will you pay him back?

730
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,990
Is it that exaggerated?

731
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,940
What are you doing?

732
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,180
Give me the money.

733
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,980
What money?

734
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,100
You buy clothes for free?

735
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,460
I don't have much money now.

736
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,850
Give me as much as you can.

737
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,340
Do you think I'm a beggar?

738
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,700
Where is the money Godfather gave you yesterday?

739
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,900
It's spent on food.

740
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,770
Forget it.

741
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,860
Take it as your New Year gift.

742
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,540
Really?

743
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,770
Yes.

744
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,820
Dad, Mom.

745
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,980
Whatâ€™s wrong?

746
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,100
Rabbit, you're back.

747
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,820
Come here.

748
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,330
Here.

749
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,590
These are clothes.

750
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,940
Come, sit down.

751
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,820
Xiao Tu.

752
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,020
Sit down.

753
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,310
We have something serious to tell you.

754
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,740
Look.

755
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,900
These are all from Ling.

756
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,180
Your godfather is back.

757
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,380
Do you know?

758
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,460
I know a little.

759
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,500
Ling Chao didn't tell me.

760
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
I didn't ask much.

761
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,070
Here's the thing, Rabbit.

762
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,460
Before, you were young.

763
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,780
You wouldn't understand.

764
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,180
Now that you've grown up,

765
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
We should tell you

766
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,700
these things.

767
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,300
Your godfather

768
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,660
is stubborn.

769
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,860
Back then,

770
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,420
your godmother didn't agree

771
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,820
that he quit his job and started a business.

772
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,900
Your godfather

773
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,060
swore

774
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,500
to return home in glory.

775
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,060
In the first few years,

776
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,660
he was too ashamed to come back when he didn't do well.

777
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,140
His company has been

778
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,340
on track these years.

779
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,380
He can finally give them an explanation.

780
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,700
But...

781
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,420
Look at Chao's

782
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,230
attitude towards his father.

783
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,850
Your godfather

784
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,640
is very regretful now.

785
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,300
He did succeed in his career,

786
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,790
but his child refused to acknowledge him.

787
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,490
Do you

788
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,260
want me to persuade Ling Chao

789
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,700
to forgive my godfather?

790
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,860
After all, he's his biological father.

791
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,700
Yes.

792
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,100
It must be hard for Godfather

793
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,530
to work hard these years.

794
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,580
But Ling Chao waited at the stairs for a month.

795
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,270
In the end, he could only be regarded as a child without a father.

796
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,300
He was sad too.

797
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,620
We've never experienced it.

798
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,500
How can we forgive on behalf of him?

799
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,660
Both of them

800
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,470
have their own standpoint

801
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,900
and grievances.

802
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,890
How about this?

803
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:57,820
Rabbit.

804
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,620
You bring these things

805
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,290
to Chao's house first.

806
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,260
It's not appropriate

807
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,300
to put them here.

808
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,100
Right?

809
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,690
I went to your house to deliver New Year's goods.

810
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,500
But you weren't there.

811
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,010
I knew you'd be here.

812
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,980
My godfather bought it.

813
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,659
Try it.

814
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:44,420
Traitor!

815
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,219
Chocolate is innocent.

816
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,820
Don't go against chocolate.

817
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,750
I want to sit alone for a while.

818
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,659
Go back first.

819
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,340
By the way,

820
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,580
take away those goods

821
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,380
from my house.

822
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,380
I'll do a bit more.

823
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,860
I'll take away the family photo by your bed

824
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,060
and the old computer

825
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,220
as well. Okay?

826
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,140
I'm leaving.

827
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,260
I...

828
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,820
I'm really leaving.

829
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,900
You were fine during the day.

830
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,740
Why do you look like you've seen a ghost

831
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,380
when you saw your dad?

832
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,860
What's the difference between seeing someone who suddenly comes back

833
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,790
after ten years and seeing a ghost?

834
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,620
Are you afraid of ghosts?

835
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,260
Why did you come out if you weren't afraid of ghosts?

836
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,900
You came out in the winter

837
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,360
to show you're resistant?

838
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,660
So cold.

839
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,020
I know

840
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,100
you don't really hate your dad.

841
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,420
You just need some time to digest.

842
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,020
Right?

843
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,590
I'm afraid I have indigestion.

844
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,190
I have experience of curing indigestion.

845
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,460
This should be the only disease

846
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,580
that can be cured by time.

847
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,270
I really admire you.

848
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,700
Being optimistic is also a gift.

849
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,340
I admire you for eating so much.

850
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,660
So what?

851
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,860
I ate your rice?

852
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,620
You have eaten a lot.

853
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,180
It's really cold here.

854
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,510
When are you going back?

855
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,370
You go back first.

856
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,270
I want to stay a little longer.

857
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,300
Let's go together.

858
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,020
It's cold.

859
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,350
What if you catch a cold?

860
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,020
Let's go.

861
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,580
Let's go.

862
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,660
Let's go.

863
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,500
Let's go.

864
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:26,780
Hey.

865
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,220
Let's go.

866
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,380
Let's go.

867
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,580
Let's go home.

868
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,220
I can walk by myself.

869
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,020
It's so heavy.

870
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,500
Let's go.

871
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,540
Stay away from me.

872
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,660
Let go.

873
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,940
Try the chocolate.

874
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,900
Have some chocolate.

875
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,940
Have some chocolate.

876
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,580
Let's go.

877
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:51,220
[Exclusive Epilogue]

878
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,820
Just because you looked at me one more time in the crowd,

879
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,980
you can never forget my face.
