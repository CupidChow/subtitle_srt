Why are you so hesitant?

4
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,150
Ridiculous.

5
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,650
Good night.

6
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,150
What do you mean?

7
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,990
Zhu.

8
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,750
I have something to tell you too.

9
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,630
Do you want to hear it now

10
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,710
or after the college entrance exam?

11
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,460
I want to hear it now too.

12
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,030
Can you

13
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,870
wash the stinky socks

Breaking news.

18
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,270
On the first day of school,

19
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,229
four girls

20
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,020
met such a thing.

21
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,470
In the middle of a dark night,

22
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,470
four female freshmen

23
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,310
were taken as scammers

24
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,550
and refused to enter the dorm by the doorkeeper.

25
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,829
She claimed that there was no room 404.

26
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,350
While they were scared to shake,

27
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,070
the four girls

28
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,310
finally found out

29
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,910
it was because Yunhai University enrolled too many students

30
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,990
so that it had run out of female dormitories.

31
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,300
It changed a storage room to a dorm temporarily

32
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,750
and had to use the number 404

33
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,550
that was abandoned

34
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,230
because of its meaning of bad luck.

35
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,350
The doorkeeper didn't realize at that time

36
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,410
and made a mistake.

37
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,230
Should the school's negligence be blamed

38
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,470
or is it a feudal superstition?

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,070
Where should the four girls do

40
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,430
and what should they do?

41
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,870
Good.

42
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,950
You showed the students

43
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,829
a typical wrong example.

44
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,190
Put aside your writing problems

45
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,590
and the five elements of news writing.

46
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,110
The essence of news is truth.

47
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,510
You can even say

48
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,750
truth is the life of news.

49
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,230
The most serious problem

50
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,550
of your news

51
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,310
is a lack of reality.

52
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,390
If you like making up stories,

53
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,280
please go to the next class.

54
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,910
But what I said is true.

55
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,590
What happened next?

56
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,850
I'll tell you after class.

57
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,160

58
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,070
Have a bite.

59

No.

00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,270
In order to better protect Xia Mo,

61
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,110
I need to strengthen my muscles.

62
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,230
Forget it.

63
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,590
According to her unique taste,

64
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,190
it'll be more effective to protect her

65
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,230
by buying some crosses

66
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,510
or amulets.

67
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,970
Besides, no one only practices upper limbs.

68
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,000
What are you talking about?

69
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,270
My abs are showing.

70
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:53,990
Look.

71
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,630
No, no, no.

72
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,550
I don't deserve it.

73
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,610
I don't deserve it.

74
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,710
Look.

75
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,470
-Don’t. -Look. Look.

76
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,990
Senior, don't be shy.

77
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,070
I want you to see this post on the school forum.

I'm Jianghu from the Student Union.

81
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,950
I need your help.

82
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,000
Everybody, wait a minute.

83
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,899
The Psychology Department of the Student Union

84
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,150
is going to hold…

85
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,870
There's a Psychology Department in our school?

86
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,590
Look.

87
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,070
Does he look like the senior

88
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,400
you talked to last time?

89
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,910
Who wants to volunteer?

90
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,430
I’ve asked around for you.

91
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,560
His name is Jianghu.

92
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,470
He's a sophomore from the Computer Department.

93
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,500
-Anyone? -He's good at academic and has a good personality.

94
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,430
Many people want to date him.

95
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,860
There are too many of them so that it's like drawing a lottery to become his girlfriend.

96
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,430
Since you've already got his number,

97
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,670
you're ahead of others.

98
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,670
Paper, paper.

99
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,870
It's dripping.

100
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,400
The one who raised her hand.

101
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,240
The one who's holding a bun.

102
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,350
Please stay here for a moment.

103
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,590
I'll tell you

104
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,190
the details of this seminar.

105
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,690
This is your chance. Seize it.

106
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,310
Why didn't you call me?

107
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,020
I lost the game.

108
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,630
It was for fun.

109
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,630
I was afraid you might forget me,

110
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,110
so it was a friendly reminder.

111
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,190
How can I forget?

112
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,990
I should thank you for helping me.

113
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,550
It's okay.

114
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,680
I'm here to ask for your help again.

115
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,500
There are too many events

116
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,030
at school recently.

117
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,590
Journalists at the Student Union

118
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,500
are busy,

119
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,510
so please

120
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,630
take care of the news and photos

121
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,870
for this psychological health seminar.

122
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,630
No problem.

123
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,950
It's just I'm only a freshman.

124
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,190
I'm not good at

125
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,990
taking photos and writing news.

126
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,870
It's okay.

127
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,750
There's still some time before the meeting.

128
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,830
You'll also be taught

129
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,430
some basics in class.

130
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,950
I'll recommend you some books.

131
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,730
You can read when you're free.

132
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,590
Okay.

133
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,830
Thank you, Senior.

134
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,909
I'm asking you for help.

135
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,710
Why are you thanking me instead?

136
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,070
I feel embarrassed.

137
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,180
How about this?

138
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,510
I'll treat you to a meal.

139
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,830
Thanks. I'm good.

140
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,750
Anyway, it's time to eat.

141
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,390
Let's go.

142
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,120
Let's go eat at the canteen.

143
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,520
Consider it as my gratitude for your help.

144
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,830
Okay, thank you.

145
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,560
Jiang Juanjuan.

146
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,710
Listen.

147
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,510
Ling Chao has become the target.

148
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,190
How's he doing? Has he been sent to the hospital?

149
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,510
No. Check this out.

150
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,030
The public image of the Prince Charming from the Computer Department

151
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,390
has been ruined.

152
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,270
I've already sent it to you.

153
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,990
It's said in the post

154
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,750
that there is a handsome boy from the Computer Department

155
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,110
who's good at academic.

156
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,700
He's actually a cheater

157
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,750
in private.

158
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,880
Which one of the two words you said,

159
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,510
cheater and Prince Charming,

160
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,370
has anything to do with Ling Chao?

161
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,350
Take a closer look.

162
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,300
At first,

163
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,180
according to the details in this post,

164
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,909
it's said the person is Ling Chao.

165
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,230
Then more and more people

166
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,180
spilled the tea on Ling Chao.

167
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,030
There was even conclusive evidence

168
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,150
pointing to him.

169
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,990
Look at this.

170
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,740
This jerk called another girl's name

171
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,470
when he was dating someone else.

172
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,550
This is indeed what Ling Chao can do.

173
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,480
He can't remember people's names.

174
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,940
But didn't Wukong say

175
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,070
Ling Chao is a modern monk

176
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,790
and not interested in women?

177
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,670
That's why

178
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,550
it's called the collapse of his public image.

179
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,180
On the one hand, he's attracting fans in the name of being single;

180
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,909
but actually, there are so many beauties around him.

181
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,150
If he's in the entertainment industry,

182
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,680
it would be a capital crime.

183
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,940
This post is so fake.

184
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,830
If Ling Chao really is a playboy

185
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,310
like they said,

186
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,670
how can he not be interested in me?

187
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,150
They said Ling Chao has a bad personality,

188
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,870
not a bad eyesight.

189
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,990
The comments

190
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,100
are getting crazier.

191
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,150
There are at least 50

192
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,710
out of more than 1,500 comments

193
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,750
are from the so-called insiders.

194
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,990
They claimed to be Ling Chao's primary school classmates

195
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,030
and even kindergarten classmates.

196
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,350
They even exposed Ling Chao's home address.

197
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,670
What about the other 1,000 comments?

198
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,920
At least there are more normal people.

199
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,870
The other 1,000 comments

200
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,480
are criticizing Ling Chao.

201
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,190
There are already 1,734 comments.

202
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,150
Someone even exposed his phone number

203
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,410
and incited others to call and scold him.

204
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,990
Just wait.

205
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,820
I’ll scold back at whomever

206
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,390
scolding my Ling Chao.

207
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,230
It doesn't help much

208
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,190
if you keep replying to them one by one.

209
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,320
It's a waste of time.

210
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,510
There is a way.

211
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,179
Come on.

212
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,070
Let me teach you something for free.

213
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,510
Here.

214
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,870
Why don't I have confidence

215
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,150
in Wukong?

216
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,020
It sounds harsh.

217
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,150
You haven't tried it.

218
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,750
How do you know it won't work?

219
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,670
Next.

220
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,950
I've found out the IP address of the poster.

221
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,100
Sha is so reliable.

222
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,950
Hello, Ling Chao.

223
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,790
Where are you?

224
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,590
I'll post something

225
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,500
against online violence

226
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,110
and condemn the irresponsible behavior of those trolls.

227
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,710
You

228
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,310
take charge of

229
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,230
encouraging relatives and friends

230
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,070
to like and comment.

231
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,510
Try to make it trend.

232
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,030
Is there anything I can help?

233
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,310
Registers some smurf accounts on the forum

234
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,630
and comment down below the post.

235
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,630
Tell them

236
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,030
Ling Chao is busy writing codes.

237
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,430
Shift their attention to his academic results.

238
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,110
Ask them to stay away from his personal life.

239
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,860
That sounds about right.

240
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,260
They don't know how excellent Ling Chao is.

241
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,630
I heard

242
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,830
there's a movie called something Jiong.

243
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,030
A sequel is released.

244
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,830
It's quite interesting.

245
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,560
Why don't we watch it together?

246
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,350
Okay, I'll buy the tickets.

247
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,220
No, well…

248
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,430
It just came to me

249
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,670
that I haven't done my homework.

250
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,470
Why don't you come with me to the library to finish my homework?

251
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,550
Sure.

252
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,230
I'll tell Ju Wenyu.

253
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,310
I won't play games with him tonight.

254
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,310
Play games?

255
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,470
It's not the time to play games.

256
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,550
Beef rice.

257
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,230
BBQ pork rice.

258
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,110
Fried rice with chili.

259
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,870
Thank you.

260
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,780
I've set up a block.

261
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,230
I can't receive

262
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,470
those messy things.

263
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,400
Don't worry.

264
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,470
I'm not worried about you.

265
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,110
I'm afraid you are so bad-tempered

266
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,310
that you have to reply to them one by one.

267
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,590
It's a waste of money.

268
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,860
Have you ever thought

269
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,070
what if I'm a scumbag

270
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,970
like they said in the post?

271
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,270
How is that possible?

272
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,950
In summary,

273
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,070
that scumbag in that post

274
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,510
dates Cuihua on Monday, Wednesday and Friday,

275
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,350
and dates Shufen on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

276
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,030
He even seeks someone new on Sunday.

277
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,670
And you

278
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,190
spend almost every day on books and computers,

279
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,550
eight days a week,

280
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,660
32 days a month.

281
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,910
That was in the past.

282
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,070
What if

283
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,380
I've changed

284
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,950
and want to date?

285
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,630
Well…

286
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,190
You're an adult.

287
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,430
I can't control your relationship.

288
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,350
Aren't you afraid

289
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,590
that after I have a girlfriend,

290
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,790
I have no time for you?

291
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,460
I don't think you have time for me

292
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,320
when you don't have a girlfriend.

293
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,590
Go after someone you like.

294
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,470
I support you

295
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,070
as long as she's not Xu Linglong.

296
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,750
Fine.

297
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,790
You said that.

298
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,230
I second it.

299
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,590
I'm all for it.

300
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,720
[Girls' Dormitory]

301
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,230
Why did you ask me to come down so early?

302
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,590
To class.

303
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,900
Didn't we agree to go to school together?

304
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,830
I don't have a morning class today.

305
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,870
The fried dough sticks from the second canteen

306
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,350
and rice balls from the third canteen

307
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,610
are all your favorite.

308
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,710
Do you want to eat?

309
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,930
Go to class with me.

310
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,270
Isn't that Ling Chao?

311
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,630
Isn't he shameful of himself?

312
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,550
That girl looks silly.

313
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,990
Can she be cheated by him?

314
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,190
Do you know him?

315
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,230
Not only knowing him from your side,

316
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,350
but both sides?

317
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,020
No.

318
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,390
What evidence do you have

319
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,710
that Ling Chao is a scumbag?

320
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,470
It's said on the Internet…

321
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,510
On the Internet?

322
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,540
How can you

323
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,710
make a conclusion

324
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,230
on someone's character

325
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,550
only according to some trolls online?

326
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,950
Even the King of Hell can't do that.

327
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,750
Who are you?

328
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,280
Who are you to criticize us?

329
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,550
I'm just a kind citizen passing by.

330
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,190
Let me remind you.

331
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,870
You left your brains at home.

332
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:10,870
Besides,

333
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,270
I don't look stupid.

334
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,650
What's wrong with her?

335
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,310
Let's go. What a bad luck.

336
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,470
These people are not as smart as me.

337
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,860
How did they get into Yunhai?

338
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,430
Seriously.

339
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,650
There are so many people here.

340
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,670
It may not be inappropriate.

341
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,830
So what?

342
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,750
What?

343
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,310
My breakfast.

344
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,570
I need to eat something to blow off steam.

345
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,390
Xiao Tu.

346
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,070
Morning, Senior.

347
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,990
Why don't you eat buns today?

348
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,590
You're right.

349
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,750
There are so many types of breakfast in the canteen.

350
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,830
I need to try more.

351
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,830
so that I can know

352
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,150
what I like the most.

353
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,350
You know each other?

354
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,750
He's my brother.

355
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,080
Brother?

356
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,870
Not related by blood.

357
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,470
What?

358
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,990
Rabbit.

359
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,950
I'm going to the canteen.

360
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,950
Do you want me to bring you anything?

361
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,630
Where is she?

362
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,790
Xiao Tu?

363
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,640
She left at seven this morning.

364
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,510
She has no class today.

365
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,030
Why did she get up so early?

366
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,590
I don't know.

367
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,590
She just answered a call and left.

368
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,110
Looks like someone in our dorm

369
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,070
is going to start a relationship.

370
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,710
Are you going back to bed?

371
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,990
I've been reading a novel all night.

372
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,830
I didn't sleep.

373
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,630
You stayed up all night?

374
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,070
What novel is so good?

375
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,470
Ghost story.

376
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,440
It's better to read it at night.

377
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,110
You scared me.

378
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,510
That post about Ling Chao was deleted.

379
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,270
Really?

380
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,540
The administrator posted something

381
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,390
calling for rules online.

382
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,150
Really?

383
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,910
That means our work

384
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,310
is very effective.

385
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,670
Ling Chao must have stayed up all night because of this.

386
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,260
Well…

387
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,590
He only has me now.

388
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,310
I need to care more about him.

389
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,500
Was I so stupid

390
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,850
when I was fangirling?

391
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,350
Class is over.

392
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,830
I feel like I've slept for a century.

393
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,630
Then you slept for a whole century.

394
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,460
Sorry, Senior.

395
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,910
Did I affect you?

396
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,350
I'm sitting next to you.

397
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,180
I should be the one who got affected the most.

398
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,430
You deserve it.

399
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,870
Who asked you to let me come to class?

400
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,330
I definitely can't get it.

401
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,310
Xiao Tu.

402
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,630
Our department will have a meeting later

403
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,430
to prepare for the psychological health seminar.

404
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,230
You must come.

405
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:24,990
Okay.

406
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,630
What should I prepare?

407
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,430
Don't bother.

408
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,190
I'm sure you'll understand.

409
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,630
You have a series of meetings

410
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,070
for a seminar?

411
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,390
What for?

412
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,790
You know nothing.

413
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,190
By the way,

414
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,670
do you have a camera?

415
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,550
You'll need it for taking pictures.

416
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,310
I just enrolled.

417
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,590
I didn't have time to buy one.

418
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,270
It's okay.

419
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,550
I'll borrow one for you.

420
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,070
Okay, thank you.

421
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,150
Let's go.

422
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,510
Master.

423
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,710
Let's go.

424
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,180
Let's go.

425
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,550
You need to

426
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:18,150
learn to grow up.

427
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,069
Someone said he wouldn't go with us.

428
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,349
He wanted to go by himself.

429
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,109
Now what?

430
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,710
He's alone.

431
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,190
Get lost!

432
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,780
Master, how about this?

433
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,110
Let me be fair.

434
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,230
Now,

435
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,630
I have a reason to think that

436
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,670
the post on the forum

437
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,870
was talking about you.

438
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,150
You have someone in your heart

439
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,270
but are also surrounded by other girls.

440
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,110
You're quite a playboy.

441
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,150
Wukong.

442
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,030
That's why you're stubborn.

443
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,750
What's wrong?

444
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,910
Can't you tell?

445
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,630
What?

446
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,550
Xiao Tu

447
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,670
is Master's

448
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,200
childhood sweetheart.

449
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,470
So Xiao Tu is his childhood sweetheart.

450
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,950
I didn't know Master you like cute girls.

451
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,540
Master.

452
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,670
Didn't you always teach me

453
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,150
when we were in high school?

454
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,830
Why can't you do it yourself?

455
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,510
If you don't take action now,

456
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,540
Madam will be

457
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,150
taken away

458
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,150
by others.

459
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,230
By others.

460
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,750
By others.

461
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,350
By others.

462
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,010
He's angry.

463
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,500
Master.

464
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,070
Don't underestimate this table.

465
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,590
I borrowed this table from the doorkeeper.

466
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,270
I also asked around.

467
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,910
This is the winner seat.

468
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,840
Sitting here can help you get rich.

469
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,150
If you play cards in this seat,

470
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,270
even if you have bad cards,

471
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,310
you'll still win.

472
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,260
I have my own rhythm.

473
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,710
Aren't you afraid that if you fail,

474
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,310
you two won't be able to be friends?

475
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,230
Not being friends

476
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,360
or seeing Xiao Tu taken away by others?

477
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,460
Choose one.

478
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,910
Come on, Sha.

479
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:00,790
Sit here.

480
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,150
I think the most important thing now

481
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,110
is to find a perfect way

482
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,470
for master to attack and defend.

483
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,110
I think

484
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,310
we should start with

485
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,190
what she's interested in.

486
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,070
Based on my understanding of Xiao Tu,

487
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,470
you can't make mistakes by sending her food.

488
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,070
That's it?

489
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,100
Of course it's not just about food.

490
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,750
You can take this opportunity

491
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,710
to hint at your feelings for her

492
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,190
and make some romance.

493
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,830
I'll wait for your good news.

Hello.

Come downstairs.

I have something for you.

What is it?

We shouldn't

512
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,230
treat her

513
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,290
like a normal girl.

It's okay, Xiao Tu.

If Ling Chao doesn't want to do it,

I can cooperate with you.

Is this a new way to prove Ling Chao's innocence?

I don’t' have class in the morning.
