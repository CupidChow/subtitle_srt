00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,180
Is the point the taste of shrimp?

175
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,610
Are you two dating or not?

176
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,490
Are you acting?

177
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,560
I always feel something is wrong.

178
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,100
Then tell me,

179
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,860
how should a relationship be?

180
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,850
It's simple.

181
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,420
If you like someone,

182
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,460
you always want to know what he eats today.

183
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,660
What does he see?

184
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,860
Is there anything interesting thing?

185
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,580
Anyway,

186
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,880
you'd like to share everything with him.

187
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,220
Look.

188
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,500
But Ling Chao is right next to me.

189
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,419
He knows what I ordered.

190
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,030
[Jia Siwen]

191
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,179
That's not what I meant.

192
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,260
It's just dating…

193
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,300
You two should have more interactions

194
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,460
in a relationship.

195
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,100
Ms. Jiang is right.

196
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,580
Right?

197
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,310
Right, well…

198
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,660
How can we interact while we're eating?

199
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,740
That's enough.

200
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,700
You can't eat this much.

201
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,780
How about this, Ms. Zhu?

202
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,660
Let's

203
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,820
show them.

204
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,620
Okay, tell me.

205
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
What should I do?

206
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,540
Babe.

207
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,900
Try this.

208
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,580
I like

209
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,300
whatever you give me.

210
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,030
Is it delicious?

211
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,700
Yes.

212
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,780
Babe.

213
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,460
I can't open this bottle.

214
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,140
Can you open it for me?

215
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,080
Let me do it.

216
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,860
Babe, you're amazing!

217
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,420
You're good at opening the bottle.

218
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,340
I want to hit you.

219
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,540
By the way,

220
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,060
neither of you had a relationship before, right?

221
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,100
Right.

222
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,140
Why should I listen to you two

223
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,730
teaching me how to date?

224
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,180
Babe, she's mad at me.

225
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,980
Protect me.

226
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,570
You...

227
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,480
What are you doing?

228
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,290
I'll send it to Jia Siwen.

229
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,500
Well, you...

230
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,220
Sorry, I was wrong.

231
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,860
Hurry up. Delete it.

232
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,580
-Delete it. -I already sent it.

233
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,040
-Delete it. -Just sent it.

234
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,170
Recall it.

235
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,900
Shouldn't we hand in the photography homework?

236
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,060
Let's find a place to take photos tomorrow.

237
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,140
I'm done.

238
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,540
When?

239
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,820
I took some pictures at the meet-and-greet

240
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,410
a few days ago.

241
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,700
Well…

242
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,140
Just come with me.

243
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,340
I'll buy you milk tea.

244
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,620
Please.

245
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,010
You have a boyfriend now.

246
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,530
Don't let me accompany you for everything.

247
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,060
You should learn to grow up.

248
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,140
You should ask Ling Chao

249
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,540
to take pictures with you.

250
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,180
It's tiresome.

251
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,900
That's not what I meant.

252
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,220
I mean you and Ling Chao

253
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,660
should go out more often

254
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,120
and see the outside world.

255
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,380
Don't always date

256
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,540
in the library or a canteen.

257
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,420
It's boring.

258
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,490
You're young.

259
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,580
You should broaden your horizons.

260
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,740
Broaden.

261
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,340
Look.

262
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,100
Learn how others date.

263
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,490
Look at these high heels.

264
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,500
The skirt. Learn it.

265
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,690
Don't always wear these.

266
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,390
What's wrong with this?

267
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,210
Boy.

268
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,140
New trend.

269
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,020
You got it.

270
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,150
Don't move.

271
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,910
Give me your bag.

272
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,540
It's okay. Let's go.

273
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,780
One, two, three. Cheese.

274
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,300
Let me help you carry it.

275
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,940
It's okay. It's not heavy.

276
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,900
This is not good.

277
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,330
What pictures are these?

278
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,860
Miss.

279
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,140
You must be a photographer.

280
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,100
You look professional.

281
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,020
Could you please

282
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,220
take some photos for us?

283
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,580
Okay.

284
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,490
Okay, okay.

285
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,140
Thank you.

286
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,860
Here, thank you.

287
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,820
Come here.

288
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,700
Let's take a photo together.

289
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,690
She's professional.

290
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,420
Come on.

291
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,770
Two, three.

292
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,220
Cheese.

293
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:04,980
Okay.

294
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,900
Another pose.

295
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,340
Another pose.

296
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,610
Face the wind.

297
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,980
Cheese.

298
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,980
What do you think?

299
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,020
It looks good.

300
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,660
Let me see.

301
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,460
Let me see.

302
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,580
Nice.

303
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,220
Great.

304
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,820
Thank you.

305
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,500
Thank you.

306
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,900
-Miss. -You're welcome.

307
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,940
Miss.

308
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,300
He's so handsome.

309
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,860
Is he your boyfriend?

310
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,740
What's wrong with your eyes?

311
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,820
If they are a couple,

312
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,660
would the girl carry her own bag?

313
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,340
Of course, I can tell that.

314
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,980
The way he looked at the girl just now

315
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,420
sold himself out.

316
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,340
Madam.

317
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,960
We're here for a visit.

318
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,420
Can you take a photo for us?

319
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,180
Sure.

320
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,090
It's a good background.

321
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,500
I'll take a good picture for you.

322
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,580
One, two, three.

323
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,460
I feel something is missing.

324
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,260
It's okay.

325
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,660
It looks good.

326
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,790
Are you okay?

327
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,780
I'm fine.

328
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,700
If it's not convenient for you,

329
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,900
you don't have to wear a skirt next time.

330
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,260
Okay.

331
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,140
I can't open it.

332
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,780
Thank you. Amazing.

333
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,460
That's enough.

334
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,060
It'll be too over if you keep acting.

335
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,220
Ling Chao.

336
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,340
Do you think

337
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,070
we don't look like a couple?

338
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,420
I don't know,

339
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,180
but there's no rules

340
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,740
about what a couple should do.

341
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,580
You're right,

342
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,140
but

343
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,260
the couples in those dramas

344
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,530
are not like us.

345
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,210
Like this.

346
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,300
Or...

347
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,470
How about this?

348
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,340
Or...

What I like is the real you,

so there's really no need to do anything on purpose.

No matter what others say,

355

I suddenly feel that I'm quite lucky.

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,020

How many more boyfriends do you want?

Maybe we can't be like other couples,

368

369

just tell me.

370
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,180
Since we're familiar with each other,

371
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,020
there's no need to hide it.

if you want to find a new tourist spot,

382
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,480
you can ask the local, Sha.

The park next to the provincial library is also good.

my teacher took me to a forest park.

It takes three hours to take the bus there.

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,030
but I've bought the ticket.

524
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,540
Besides,

525
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,820
Wenhui won't remember who I am.

526
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,780
So you'd better save it

527
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,340
for next time.

528
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,380
Juan.

529
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,900
Actually,

530
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,860
I just want you to accompany me.

531
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,540
Come on.

532
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,600
Ask your boyfriend to accompany you.

533
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,220
At this point,

534
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,460
I can only tell you the truth.

535
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,100
Actually,

536
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,770
there are some problems

537
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,020
in my relationship with Ling Chao

538
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,220
Maybe

539
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,140
it's what people call

540
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,120
the burnout phase in a relationship.

541
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,620
How long have you been dating

542
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,260
and you're already entering the burnout phase?

543
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,780
Isn't it too early?

544
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,180
I don't know.

545
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,060
Maybe

546
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,300
we've known each other for too long,

547
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,010
so he has lost

548
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,980
his curiosity about me.

549
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,580
Anyway,

550
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,180
I'm not interested in doing anything recently.

551
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,580
Life is boring.

552
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,500
If you could accompany me,

553
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,580
I would feel better.

554
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,770
Okay.

555
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,980
I'll return the ticket.

556
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,040
I'll stay with you.

557
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:48,900
Great.

558
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Will it affect you

559
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,140
deepening your relationship with Wenhui?

560
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,420
It's okay.

561
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,100
Wenhui will understand.

562
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,020
After all,

563
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
friends are the most important.

564
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,300
Buy me a cup of milk tea.

565
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,890
Okay.

566
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,540
Hello, what would you like to order?

567
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,380
A cup of milk tea.

568
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,780
One red bean double skin milk

569
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,660
and two ice cream cones.

570
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,060
Okay.

571
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,920
What about you?

572
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,060
You don't look like

573
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,740
upset at all.

574
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,980
It's because you're with me.

575
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,200
That's too greasy.

576
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,060
I want a cup of milk tea without sugar.

577
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,500
Okay.

578
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,100
Thank you.

579
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,100
Fine.

580
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,220
Men are all bad.

581
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,460
Ling.

582
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,030
What are you doing here?

583
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,420
Didn't we agree to go to the library?

584
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,820
I don't want to go.

585
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,980
Let's go eat first.

586
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,840
I'm not hungry yet.

587
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,100
Shall we go for a walk?

588
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,260
No.

589
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,220
It's boring.

590
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,500
What happened?

591
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,380
Master.

592
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,190
I heard you and your girlfriend are getting into the burnout phase in a relationship.

593
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,350
See you at the sports field at 6 p.m.

594
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,660
I have something important to tell you.

595
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,660
Ling Chao.

596
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,060
I think it's a mistake for us to be together.

597
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,180
I'm really

598
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,420
not interested in you.

599
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,980
Holding your hand is like holding my own hand.

600
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,380
Let's break up.

601
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,420
[Seven-year Itch]

602
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,260
Hurry up.

603
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,060
What's wrong?

604
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,340
I saw Ling Chao

605
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,780
walking with another girl on Wutong Avenue.

606
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,580
What?

607
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,250
How could he do that?

608
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,220
Wait. I'll help you teach him a lesson.

609
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,820
Okay.

610
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,780
Scum.

611
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,860
You want to change your taste

612
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,980
after getting tired of dating a short girl?

613
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,220
Men really like women with long legs.

614
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,340
Today, I'll let others see

615
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,300
what kind of shameless cheaters you are.

616
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,340
Shameless cheaters!

617
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,220
Shameless cheaters!

618
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,500
-Shameless cheaters! -Jia Siwen?

619
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,540
-Shameless cheaters. -Turn it off.

620
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
-How can I Turn it off? -Shameless cheaters.

621
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,420
-Well… -Shameless cheaters.

622
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,450
-Well… -Shameless cheaters.

623
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:02,980
Shameless cheaters.

624
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,660
Well…

625
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
All right.

626
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,100
What is this?

627
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,180
Well…

628
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,540
Fine.

629
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,660
Jia Siwen, tell me.

630
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,820
Is he trying to confess to me?

631
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,950
Jiang Juanjuan.

632
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,430
What's going on?

633
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,140
He's going to confess his love.

634
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,980
Tonight…

635
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,660
There's going to be a once-in-a-century meteor shower tonight.

636
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,780
We may not be able to observe it

637
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
for various reasons

638
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,100
like the weather, visibility and the phase of the moon.

639
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,860
But it's about to happen

640
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,120
in this time and space.

641
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,340
Even when we can't see each other,

642
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,620
he still loves me deeply.

643
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,780
It's 18:12 now.

644
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,220
Even if it's still daytime in UTC-5

645
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,060
and it's winter in the southern hemisphere,

646
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,780
this minute

647
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,660
is the best summer dusk for me.

648
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,220
Is he trying to say

649
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,060
no matter what the world is like,

650
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,220
he only cares about me?

651
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,940
Actually,

652
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,780
I didn't think about what I'm going to say before I came here.

653
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,780
I just want to talk about meteors

654
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,940
and sunset

655
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,260
at this special time.

656
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,780
What is he talking about?

657
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,020
I don't know.

658
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,380
But…

659
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,020
It's not only about meteors,

660
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,060
but also…

661
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,260
I like you too.

662
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,700
That's it.

663
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,770
This must be your first time coming to our campus, isn't it?

664
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,340
Let me show you around.

665
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:46,940
Okay.

666
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,670
I also want to walk on the road you usually walk on.

667
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,520
This is the romance and sense of ritual Jiang Juanjuan mentioned.

668
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,180
Jia Siwen.

669
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,820
When did you fall in love with me?

670
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,000
Be careful.

671
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,740
I...

672
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,660
Do you remember

673
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,590
the globe I gave you in high school?

674
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,020
Yes.

675
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,260
You said

676
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,140
the Earth is round

677
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,300
and people will meet,

678
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,260
so the long distance between us is not a problem,

679
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,020
right?

680
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,260
You can understand it this way.

681
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,580
But actually,

682
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,710
I engraved something under the globe.

683
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,060
Engraved something?

684
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
You've liked me since then?

685
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,580
Let me get the flowers.

686
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,420
I'll give it to you when you get to the dorm.

687
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,020
Okay.

688
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,980
Take it with another hand,

689
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,100
so I can hold your hand.

690
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,090
Why is their love happening

691
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,420
at the burnout phase in our relationship?

692
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,500
I promised Jia Siwen not to tell anyone.

693
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,740
Anyone?

694
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,100
Am I included?
