511
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,900
it was just a trivial matter

512
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,380
to you.

513
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,830
But it has really affected me a lot.

514
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,300
In fact, I've been praised a lot

515
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,820
since childhood.

516
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,740
But I know in most cases, people just praised me to show courtesy.

517
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,700
Therefore,

518
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

519
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,140
Am I really as good as you said?

520
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,290
No matter what others think of you,

521
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,500
you're the best.

522
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,140
Then why don't you think of yourself like that?

523
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,000
Actually, you're very good, too.

524
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,900
You don't have to envy the brightness

525
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,360
of the sunshine in summer.

526
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,100
Though the sunshine in winter lasts for a short time,

527
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,500
it's also very warm.

528
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,580
Actually, I've thought a lot these days.

529
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,140
The sun won't change its regular pattern

530
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,000
because of people's preference.

531
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,380
Therefore,

532
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,780
we shouldn't lose ourselves so easily

533
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,140
because of others.

534
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,380
Will the sun in winter

535
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,460
become the sun in summer one day?

536
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,610
Of course.

537
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,380
It'll be the deadline this weekend.

538
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,910
Do you want to see it with me?

539
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:33,850
I'll go.

540
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,660
The teacher in Yin Zihan's class delayed the time of ending the lecture?

541
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,380
I don't think so.

542
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,980
Just now I saw Zhang Danian

543
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,510
running faster than being chased by zombies.

544
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,760
Aren't they in the same class?

545
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,980
It took them so long to buy their lunch.

546
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,860
Have they gone to plant vegetables or kill pigs?

547
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,970
Will they be able to have lunch before the end of this year?

548
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,420
Yin Zihan is so pitiful.

549
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,380
He's sick, but no one even cares about him.

550
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,980
He's absent today, but poeple don't even know about that.

551
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,980
I'm such a gossiper. I don't even know the news,

552
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,380
but you actually know it?

553
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,280
What happened?

554
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,770
When I went to the office to deliver the homework,

555
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,300
I heard it from their teacher.

556
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,430
His teacher said that he seemed to have caught a cold and a fever yesterday.

557
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,740
Yesterday?

558
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,500
No.

559
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,180
Do you want some?

560
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,620
Do you think I should call Yin Zihan

561
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,680
to show my concern?

562
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,460
If someone has a cold and a fever, what he needs most is to sleep.

563
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,140
What if he's taking a rest?

564
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,660
As the cause of his illness, you should behave yourself.

565
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,740
You're really something.

566
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,470
You even forgot about your appointment with him.

567
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,420
Well,

568
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,750
I can send a message to show my concern?

569
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,070
That's more like it.

570
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,700
Write the message sincerely.

571
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,960
You should write it so sincerely that he'll forgive you as soon as he reads it.

572
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,820
Yin Zihan.

00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,980
I'll visit you after school.

575
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:08,340
I didn't mean to stand you up yesterday.

576
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,420
It's not straightforward enough, right?

577
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,100
It's my fault. Do whatever you want to punish me.

578
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,460
It's too hard.

579
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,910
What should I write to show my sincerity?

580
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,260
It's hard to heal a broken heart.

581
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,660
You can only exchange your sincerity for his sincerity.

582
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,690
Where did you go yesterday?

583
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,900
Just tell the truth

584
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,260
and ask for his forgiveness.

585
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,180
It was all because of Ling Chao.

586
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,370
Ling Chao?

00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,690

you still have to tie your shoelaces into a bow.

590

You have a sharp tongue when you argue with others.

591

How come you look weak while drinking water?

592
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,400
It's because I was hit by someone.

593
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,620
Why do you hold a grudge?

594

Why don't you let me hit you in return?

I'll go find him next door.

the person you really like

682
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,140
is Ling Chao.

683
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,180
Are you crazy?

684
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,220
Don't you know my relationship with Ling Chao?

685
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,940
Right.

686

First come, first served.

You can become a couple as long as you two are not biological siblings.

688

You have a special relationship with Ling Chao.

689
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,860
Last year, you told me so confidently that

I liked Yin Zihan.

691

I really thought I liked Yin Zihan.

692
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,060
Now you're telling me that I like Ling Chao?

693
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,360
So you've been talking nonsense?

694
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,060
I was so young that

695
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,380
I believed your false statements.

696
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,210
Ridiculous.

697
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,900
I'm an amazing fortune teller in Yidong who can predicate everything so accurately.

698
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,220
Would I talk nonsense?
