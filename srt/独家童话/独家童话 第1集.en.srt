I'm the pitiful one.

241

Two years ago,

242
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,730
you said you would plant a pot of roses for her.

243
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,790
You made such a great deal out of it,

244

like you wanted the whole world to know.

245
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,070
But before her birthday,

246
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,550
the roses withered.

247
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,670
In the end, I searched all over for a pot of roses

248
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,510
to help you.

to celebrate my mom's birthday.

252

If I didn't rush in with the fire extinguisher,

253

the kitchen wouldn't be the only place damaged.

254
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,600

I texted you.

519
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,640
Who knew you lent your phone to your classmate?

520
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,030
And I rode my bike.

521
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,400
If this happens again,

522
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,530
go home by yourself.

523
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,920
Don't wander around at night.

524
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,350
That won't do.

525
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,240
I said I would protect you forever.

526
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,790
Will my dad never come back?

527
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,590
He doesn't want me and Mum anymore?

528
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,880
Godfather just went to work to earn money.

529
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,440
He will definitely come back.

530
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,590
Really?

531
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,830
I'm the elder sister.

532
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,680
I never lie to little boys.

533
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,590
If you don't believe me,

534
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,000
I'll wait for Godfather with you.

535
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,350
My doll and I will always be with you

536
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,270
and protect you.

537
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,830
Thank you.

538
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,030
I won't go missing.

539
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,040
Don't worry.

540
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,920
Or I can just

541
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,960
wait for you at the stairs, okay?

542
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,240
What did you say?

543
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,880
We share the same fate.

544
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,680
If you go missing,

545
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,610
I won't be able to live.

546
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,270
Ling Chao.

547
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,440
I'm scared just thinking about it.

548
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,270
If I lose you,

549
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,310
my mom will kill me.

550
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,350
Shut up.

551
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,210
Wipe your hair.

552
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,570
What are you looking at?

553
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,750
Why are you so tall?

554
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,350
Sit down.

555
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,720
You have good physique.

556
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,030
You're almost done wiping your hair.

557
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,160
I have a cold.

558
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,680
How dare you steal it from me?

559
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,310
Yeah.

560
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,960
It's already enough

561
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,420
for one of us to have a cold.

562
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,930
We should share our good luck.

563
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,200
Actually, I've always found this little rabbit

564
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,800
who insisted on being my elder sister since childhood annoying.

565
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Until that day...

566
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,640
something seemed different.

[Exclusive Epilogue]

568
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,400
Ling Chao.

569
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,720
I can't clasp your heart

570
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,920
but I can clasp your bike.

571
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,880
Why is it you again?
