I'm really worried about them.

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,220
Ms. Xiao,

175
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,820
do you think it's necessary to change their seats?

176
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,370
These two students in your class

177
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,380
have been playing tricks

178
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,840
in class for not only once.

179
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,020
I think you should transfer her to the corner

180
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,900
so that she can play by herself

181
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,540
and won't affect anyone else.

182
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,060
Anyway,

183
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,450
only a few students can go to the top universities

184
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,620
in the end.

185
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,980
If they don't want to learn, it's useless no matter how you teach them.

186
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,780
It's better to spend more time

187
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,300
on those who study well.

188
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,580
It's not that serious.

189
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,820
High school freshmen

190
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,820
all like to play.

191
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,620
They'll grow up gradually.

192
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,500
Students' grades vary.

193
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,740
Isn't that normal?

194
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,820
Besides,

195
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,380
aren't there some students who lag behind

196
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,540
to make a comeback every year?

197
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,260
I think these two girls are very clever.

198
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,460
If they really work hard,

199
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,260
they won't be worse than anyone.

200
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,960
But in the current situation,

201
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,900
you really should change their seats.

202
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,580

Thank you.

516
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,540
You're welcome.

517
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,860
We are classmates.

518
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,540
I'm doing this for you

519
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,610
for the last time.

520
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,260
Luckily, you found out.

521
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,440
Otherwise, he would have left without dignity.

522
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,140
OK. Come on.

523
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,020
Warm up. Let's get ready.

524
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,640
It's our turn. Come on.

525
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,090
Okay.

526
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,740
Have you checked the time?

527
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,500
Don't worry.

528
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,960
I've checked it 800 times.

529
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,220
I'm sure it'll be accurate.

530
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:14,980
Okay.

531
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,200
How much time left?

532
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,710
One minute and ten seconds.

533
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,540
Everyone, get ready.

534
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,020
Start.

535
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,380
Wen Jun.

536
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,010
Dad, Mom.

537
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:30,060
We're not meant to be in this life.

538
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,580
I always make you angry.

539
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,900
I'm sorry.

540
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,740
Only in the next life

541
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,260
can I be your warrior.

542
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,380
We'll be a family in our next life.

543
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,420
Countdown.

544
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,900
Ten.

545
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,100
Nine.

546
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:47,900
Eight.

547
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,420
Seven.

548
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,700
-Six.
-Am I handsome?

549
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,460
Five.

550
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,580
Four.

551
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,860
Three.

552
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,570
Two.

553
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,300
Two.

554
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,380
One.

555
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:57,980
One.

556
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,420
Xiao Tu.

557
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,420
Are you okay?

558
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,820
Xiao Tu, are you okay?

559
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,460
Xiao Tu.

560
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,060
Are you okay?

561
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,300
So serious?

562
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:18,980
Xiao Tu.

563
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,140
Ling Chao, your friend is so...

564
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:23,700
Cute.

565
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,630
Let's go have a look.

566
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,460
Are you okay?

567
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,180
Are you two okay?

568
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,540
We're fine.

569
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,580
Everyone else, go on.

570
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,220
You're so clumsy.

571
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,940
It's none of my business.

572
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,180
Sitting on the field,

573
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,710
the ball comes from the sky.

574
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,860
Junior.

575
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,780
I'm sorry.

576
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,070
Come on. Re-assign the positions.

577
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,020
Look. Look.

578
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,580
Look at Ling Chao's T-shirt.

579
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,100
It's a rabbit.

580
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,220
There's even a tail.

581
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,180
I didn't expect a cold and handsome guy to have a girlish heart.

582
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:13,320
â™«It's a sunny day, the most beautiful destiny's signâ™«

583
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,500
He's quite cute.

584
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:10,900
Hello.

585
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,440
Let's play.

586
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:21,210
â™«You are my most beautiful encounterâ™«

587
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,060
â™«You light up my heartâ™«

588
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,920
â™«Making all worries disappearâ™«

589
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,210
â™«I really want to freeze timeâ™«

590
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,690
â™«My heartbeats have flowed through my fingertipsâ™«

591
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,030
Mom, why didn't you close the door?

592
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,920
Is there a guest coming today?

593
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,460
Chao.

594
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,540
About the one I mentioned to you before...

595
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,100
I think it's time for you to meet.

596
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,700
The soup is still in the pot.

597
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Let me go check it.

598
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,820
Does he

599
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,860
treat you well?

600
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,740
Yes.

601
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,100
You're here.

602
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,820
Yes.

603
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,090
Put them on the table.

604
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:44,700
Okay.

605
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,100
Ling Chao,

606
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,740
isn't this car

607
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,270
the one which picked up my godmother that day?

608
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,220
Well,

609
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,980
wouldn't Ling Chao...

610
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,500
Mr. Ling, Iâ€™d better

611
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,050
wait for you in the car.

612
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,890
-What do you think?
-Okay.

613
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,500
Okay.

614
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,580
Take care.

615
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,180
Okay.

616
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,520
Here, have some water.

617
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,660
Did you buy these for Ling Chao?

618
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,300
Yes.

619
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,900
I don't know what kids nowadays like.

620
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,160
I just bought a little bit of everything.

621
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,450
Chao.

622
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,330
Dad bought you a lot of things.

623
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,740
Come out and have a look.

624
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,230
Xiao Tu asked me to help her with some questions.

625
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,160
I need to go out.

626
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,460
Let's go.

627
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,980
-You...
-My dad wanted to

628
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,980
ask you to watch TV together. Come on.

629
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,300
When did I say that?

630
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,900
You did.

631
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,780
You forgot.

632
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,260
Move over.

633
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,980
Really?

634
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,700
Yeah.

635
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,420
Now you want to control me.

636
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,500
What were you doing earlier?

637
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,340
What are you doing?

638
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,540
Why do we watch TV?

639
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,580
Let's play games.

640
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,530
What game?

641
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,100
The plot is at the critical moment.

642
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,980
Give it to me.

643
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,820
We can watch TV anytime.

644
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,180
But this is the weekend,

645
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,660
as a family, we must relax

646
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,620
when we gather together.

647
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,220
Mom, stop working.

648
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,060
Game time!

649
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,180
Playing games?

650
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,140
OK. Come on.

651
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,380
Come on.

652
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,380
Mom, what is this?

653
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,700
Many animals have disappeared

654
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,500
during the long history of Earth.

655
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,900
The most famous of the animals are dinosaurs.

I'll kill you.

Kill me.

660
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,500
How did I get a math test paper?

661
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,860
Let's check out mine.

00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,460
Mom, you must have done it on purpose.

666
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,500
You can't afford it, right?

667
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,090
Look how good Chao is.

668
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:45,700
Look.

669
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,340
His are playing computer, having a feast and watching TV.

670
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,380
You're so stupid.

671
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,980
Something is wrong with you.

672
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,960
It's just a probability problem.

673
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,900
It must be my feng shui here.

674
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,780
I'll change with you.

675
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,580
Get up.

No, thanks.

679
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,500
It's getting late.

680
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,840
I'll go back first.

681
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,940
Otherwise Ling Chao will feel uncomfortable when he comes back.

682
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,940
He doesn't mean anything else.

683
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,740
It's just that you suddenly came back,

684

685
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,420
I understand.

686
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,590
After all, I failed to fulfill my duty as a father.

687
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,140
Maybe he almost forgot

688
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,940
he has a relative called dad.

00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,260
Don't say that.

690
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,140
You did it for our family.

691
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,500
I was too prideful.

692
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,740
I always want to do well and prove it to you.

693
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,700
If I hadn't...

694
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
-If I wasn't so resolute...
-Let bygones be

695
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,580
bygones.

696
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,660
Ling,

697
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,880
I believe it will be better in the future.

698
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,620
Don't cheat.

699
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,500
Let me do it.

700
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,940
Dad, you got something good.

701
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,090
You're cheating.

702
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,060
Xiao, you cheated.

703
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,900
Ling Chao, your turn.

704
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:06,230
[Exclusive Epilogue]

You're in high school.

706
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,030
You still wear this?

707
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,110
But there's nothing surprising about it.

708
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,660
Do you have a problem?
