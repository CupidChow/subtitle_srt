It concerns a big project next year.

Let's go. Bye.

180
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,220
Let's go. I want to talk to you alone.

181
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,940
I'll get straight to the point.

182
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,800
I hope you can come to our company after graduation.

183
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,700
I won't beat around the bush.

What's good for me?

I can't guarantee too much,

but I promise

187

after you come,

you can do whatever you want.

189
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,780
That's too rough.

190
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,420
I've seen the program you designed.

191
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,940
It's pretty much what Handuo wants,

192
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,300
so I have to fight for you no matter what.

193
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,820
Since it's a fight,

194
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,860
there must be some conditions.

195
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,500
Of course.

196
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,460
Tell me.

197
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,310
Two conditions.

198
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,780
First,

199
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,780
I want to form my own team.

200
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,820
I don't need too many members,

201
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,730
but I want to work with my roommates.

202
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,100
You just met them.

203
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,740
I’ll skip the introduction.

204
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,860
You're all top students from the Computer Department of Yunhai University.

205
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,220
You're professional.

206
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,500
You also get along with each other.

207
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,140
It's worth considering it

208
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,020
since it can help the company save the cost on team building.

209
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,740
Second,

210
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,920
stay away from Xiao Tu.

211
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,520
Don't get too close to her.

212
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,140
This condition is too harsh.

213
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,860
I need to think it over.

214
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,540
I'm just kidding.

215
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,820
Why are you so serious?

216
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,420
But Handuo is still at an early stage.

217
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
I need to discuss it with my partner.

218
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,980
You don't even have the right to decide this?

219
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,510
I thought you are in charge.

220
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,960
I don't care about others,

221
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,260
but you're such an excellent talent.

222
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,780
Of course, I have to discuss this with the management.

223
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,100
That way, we're showing our respect to you.

224
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,560
You're really something.

225

I have a feeling.

229

If we work together,

230
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,040
it must be a pleasant journey.

231

How can he be a bad guy?

528
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,580
It's said that appearance stands for one's personality.

529

The old saying makes sense.

The more I look at him, the more handsome he looks.

Xiao Tu, listen.

686
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,660
Am I hallucinating?

687
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,090
Why did I hear someone calling me?

688
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,090
I think so too... I'll go take a look.

689
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,140
Xiao Tu, come down.

690
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,220
It's your Romeo.

691
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,340
No, your Romeo Zhou is here.

692
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,180
Here.

693
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,460
Look who's here.

694
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,540
What are you doing?

695
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,060
From now on,

696
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,940
I'll leave the back seat of my motorcycle for you.

697
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,400
You want to thank me again?

698
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,980
Well, I appreciate your kindness,

699
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,580
but I can't accept this gift.

700
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,680
How about this?

701
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,340
Think of it as an exchange for your rubber band.

702
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,020
Okay?

703
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,100
That's not what I mean.

704
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,380
The thing you did

705
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,260
about the helmet and candles

706
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,400
will make people misunderstand.

707
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,140
Misunderstand what?

708
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,700
They'll misunderstand that you like...

709
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,900
I like you.

710
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,620
I said I like you.

711
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,950
I'm going to pursue you.

712
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,660
Cut it out.

713
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,220
I have a boyfriend.

714
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,540
Zhou Xingyu looks cool,

715
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,380
but why is his confession so cheesy?

716
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,500
I know.

717
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,660
But so what?

718
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,540
Dating depends on one's ability.

719
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,410
Yes. And in the end,

720
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,540
we don't know who will win.

721
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,090
Right?

722
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,740
Yes, that's right.

723
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,140
You do have a personality,

724
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,060
but I really have to tell you

725
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,860
not to waste your time, okay?

726
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,820
Look who this girl is.

727
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,820
Look who this girl is.

728
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,500
Who is she?

729
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,380
Xiao Tu.

730
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,650
I know this

731
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,460
-is a bit abrupt
-Why is Xiao Tu here?

732
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,380
for you.

733
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,700
I'm not asking you to make a decision right now.

734
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,020
I just want you to get my feelings.

735
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,250
I like you, Xiao Tu.

736
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,140
I just feel that Ling Chao

737
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,660
is being cheated on.

738
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,700
Does that mean I have a chance?

739
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,860
Does he know that lighting so many candles at night

740
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,130
can attract ghosts?

741
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,620
Why can't you understand?

742
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,860
I told you. It's impossible between us.

743
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,260
Go back and get some sleep.

744
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,540
You might grow taller.

745
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,900
Your helmet.

746
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,700
Besides,

747
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,340
don't call me Xiao Tu.

748
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,220
I'm older than you.

749
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,140
You have to respect me.

750
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,000
Call me sister.

751
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,250
Well…

752
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,290
Your helmet.

753
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,260
She's back.

754
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,500
Hurry up. She's back.

755
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,420
Master.

756
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,970
Master!

757
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,860
Master!

758
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,060
Master, you got cheated on.
