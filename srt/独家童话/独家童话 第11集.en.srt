00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,260
Isn't that near Jiang Juanjuan's home?

175
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,860
Yes.

176
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,220
According to the information,

177
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,680
she has been heading south

178
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
from Huaihai Park.

179
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,300
South? Which direction is south?

180
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,940
North at the top, south at the bottom, west on the left and east on the right.

181
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,700
-You can just directly... -This way.

182
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,299
This way.

183
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,010
Okay.

184
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,350
Jiang Juanjuan!

185
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,460
Watch out!

186
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,810
Why are you here?

187
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,580
You can't even distinguish the four directions.

188
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,740
I'm afraid I'll have to look for you too later.

189
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,820
I'm here.

190
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,100
She won't go missing.

191
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,460
Let's go.

192
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,680
[Xianyun Street]

193
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:38,660
[Exit]

194
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,540
He always says he is busy,

195
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,020
so he doesn't have time to take care of my mother and me.

196
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
He also said that he would find a way to make it up to us

197
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,620
and try his best to give us a better life.

198
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,940
People always say that father's love is like a mountain.

199
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,860
Maybe father's love is just so deep.

200
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,060
Who would have thought that

201
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,580
those are all his excuses?

202
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,940
Calm down.

203
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,180
Maybe it's not like what you think.

204
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,200
You don't have to explain for him.

205
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,700
I only blame myself for being useless.

206
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,950
Due to my bad performance in study,

207
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,420
he and my mother

208
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,780
always quarrel with each other because of me.

209
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,500
It leads to this ending today.

210
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,250
Don't belittle yourself.

211
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,980
This is what you told me before.

212
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,140
But I will never

213
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,300
let this bad woman who has ruined my family

214
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,860
have her way like this.

215
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,340
What?

216
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,600
This is their privacy.

217
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,230
We need to get some evidence for an affair like this, right?

218
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,140
You look very pretty.

219
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,190
Why are you here?

220
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,740
You're doing this so openly.

221
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,540
Yes.

222
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,580
I'll inform Mr. Xue.

223
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,500
Jiang,

224
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,900
though you're not young anymore,

225
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,220
you're still good at

226
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,700
all these tricks.

227
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,870
What are you talking about?

228
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,930
I'm doing this for you.

229
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,900
For me?

230
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,620
You let this woman join your family.

231
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,100
You said it was for me?

232
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,780
How could you talk to your father like that?

233
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,460
I don't have a father like you.

234
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,590
-You... -Mr. Jiang.

235
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,660
Since your daughter doesn't understand,

236
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,620
just forget it.

237
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,060
Bao Bei, wait.

238
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,340
Let me deal with it.

239
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,100
Baby?

240
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,660
How dare you call her baby?

241
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,860
Okay.

242
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,020
Whom are you going to deal with?

243
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,950
How are you going to deal with this?

244
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,020
I finally found someone I like.

245
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,260
You scared her away.

246
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,140
Are you satisfied now?

247
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,180
How shameless!

248
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,580
Are you Mr. Jiang?

249
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,740
I have an appointment with you

250
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,000
to see you here at 6 p.m.

251
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,700
Would you please tell me whether we should continue the interview?

252
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Interview?

253
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,900
Now people have to compete for the position of mistress?

254
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,780
Mistress?

255
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,540
What?

256
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,820
Do you want to say that he cheated you?

257
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,580
Shut up!

258
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,460
Listen to me.

259
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,220
How dare you do such a thing with the excuse of

260
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,300
looking for a tutor?

261
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,760
How dirty and disgusting!

262
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,060
Listen to me!

263
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,060
Listen to me.

264
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,900
Tutor?

265
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,220
Stop right there!

266
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,700
Something like this happened,

267
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,020
because I was negligent in disciplining you.

268
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,250
But you also have to reflect on yourself carefully.

269
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,250
Don't do it again.

270
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,990
You'll be a student in Senior 3 next semester.

271
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,700
I just wanted to hire a tutor

272
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,060
to help you with your study.

273
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,460
But it was in a mess in the end

274
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,320
because of you.

275
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,460
You could have told me about it.

276
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,890
Since you wanted to hire a tutor for me,

277
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,340
why didn't you ask me about my opinion?

278
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,060
I just wanted to hire someone who had strong ability

279
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,060
and had no common interest with you.

280
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,700
Well,

281
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,540
you and mom...

282
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,340
Both your mom and I

283
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,380
agreed to hire a tutor.

284
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,730
Please enjoy.

285
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,340
Thank you.

286
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,420
Just eat.

287
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,340
Let's go home.

288
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,540
Wait.

289
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,180
Haven't you seen enough?

290
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,340
I want to eat cakes, too.

291
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,860
Where's Yin Zihan?

292
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,760
How come he's missing after we found her?

293
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,180
Hello, Mr. Xue.

294
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,180
Jiang Juanjusn is with her dad.

295
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,100
She's safe.

296
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,260
Don't worry.

297
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,780
Are you a pervert?

298
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,900
If you keep following me, I'll call the police.

299
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,030
You misunderstood.

300
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,580
The general manager of Yiqi Entertainment?

301
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,180
No talent scout

302
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,140
would find artists in the bathroom.

303
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,090
Right.

304
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,380
The meaning is not good.

305
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,010
He stinks before his debut.

306
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,660
If this is a new way of swindle,

307
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,360
should we call the police?

308
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,220
Did you call the police just now?

309
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,340
Yiqi Entertainment.

310
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,220
Its main business includes these four fields of music, brokerage,

311
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,700
films and television programs, and variety shows.

312
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,180
Their general manager looks like this.

313
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,290
[Yiqi Entertainment]

314
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,210
It's him!

315
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,580
But even if it's true,

316
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,060
it has nothing to do with me.

317
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,420
I won't be a trainee.

318
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,380
Why?

319
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,980
Hasn't it been your dream

320
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,660
to be a dancing singer?

321
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,980
As you said, it's only a dream.

322
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,910
It's fine for me to only dream of it.

323
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,380
Just give it a try.

324
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,780
You sing so well.

325
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,620
Your dancing

326
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,220
is very unique.

327
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,660
Maybe you'll be chosen.

328
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
There are

329
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,540
many possibilities in life.

330
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,620
Stop it.

331
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,340
It'll get cold if you don't eat.

332
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,060
Don't eat my cake.

333
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,140
I'm back.

334
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,950
You're back.

335
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,300
I have something to tell you.

336
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,700
Sit.

337
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,160
The college entrance exam is coming.

338
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,700
I want to know your plans for the future,

339
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,500
and see if there's anything

340
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,060
I can help you with.

341
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,260
I want to study Computer Science at Yunhai University.

342
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,500
Yunhai University?

343
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,500
With your grades, it’s not hard for you to go to Qingbei University.

Why do you want to apply for Yunhai University?

345
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,540
Although Qingbei University ranks the first

346
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,940
in the whole country in terms of comprehensive capacity,

347
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,500
I've checked the introduction of teachers and teaching directions

348
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,760

349

353

and turn your hobby into a career,

354
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,820
this will be a good choice.

355

359

I want to force you to major in finance

360
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,060
so that you can inherit the company?

361
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,460
If you want to inherit the company,

362
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,540
it's okay.

363

367
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,780
can live a carefree life.

368

Though I'm not good at other things,

I'm indeed quite capable of collecting

389
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,980
and tracking information.

390
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,420
It means I was born to be an entertainment reporter.

391
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,620
I will definitely apply for the major

has changed his career and become an actor.

437

He was invited to be the leading actor in many idol dramas.

Instead of playing the role of a handsome and domineering boss,

we could encourage ourselves by doing this.

682
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,780
But this is someone else's desk.

683
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,739
Then let's leave now.

684
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,980
I can buy you a cake.

Let's go.

687
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,179
At this hour,

688
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,510
the cake shop is closed.

No one eats a Wife Cake to celebrate his birthday.

692
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,460
Just make do with it.

693
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,260
Besides, it has a good meaning.

694
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,860
Maybe you can really get a wife after eating it.

695
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,140
I might as well find some fish flesh

696
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,100
in the Fish-flavoured Shredded Pork.

Wait.

Make a wish first.

700
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,340
But there are no candles.

All right.

So soon?

705
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,100
It looks like you decided what wish to make long ago.

706
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,220
What wish did you make?

707
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,480
I hope that you can be admitted into your ideal university.

What era is it now?

You're still playing these tricks   aimed at kids.

No.

It's true. Look.

Yes.

How beautiful.

Even though so many girls have asked our master for a date recently,

he has made no response.
