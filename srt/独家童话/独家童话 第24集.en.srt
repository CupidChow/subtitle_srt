00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,350
The meal is ready.

5
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,830
You finally got up.

6
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,150
I don't think you two cook very often.

7
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,190
The pot is too thin.

8
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,950
The fire is too strong.

9
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,750
The knife is too blunt.

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,150
The seasoning is almost expired.

11
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,080
Nothing useful.

You are acting like my mom.

14
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,950
How can you ask a guest to cook?

15
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,800
I didn't ask him to come.

16
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,789
Well. I wanted to come.

17
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,750
It's because

18
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,710
someone brazenly said he would treat me to home-cooked dishes.

19
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,990
But now,

20
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,070
I bought the ingredients.

21
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,110
I cooked the meal.

22
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,590
And someone wouldn't get up.

23
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,890

You seem to have aged.

38

No way.

42

00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,870
It was for my public persona.

I was there too.

110
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,610
Why did they remove me?

111
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,770
Am I not worth mentioning?

112
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,830
They used "seeing a pretty girl" in previous reports.

113

But in this report, they used "a girl".

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,070
I saw it.

118
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,830
These unscrupulous media.

119
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,550
I'll ask Jiang Juanjuan

to write reports for me from now on.

121

Wait.

122
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,110
Sister.

123
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,690
Can we not remove the trending topic now?

124
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:40,790
Is this the girl whose program

125
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,790
you insisted on joining?

126
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,670
I knew there must be a reason

127
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,470
why you suddenly wanted to accept that interview.

128
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,430
It's great to be on the trending topic.

129
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,350
It's good.

130

Look.

133
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,270
The photo is good.

134
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,230
So romantic like idol dramas.

135
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,870
I think

136
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,260
a producer will ask me to film soon.

137
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,190
Don't contact him too often in the future.

138
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,120
It's been several years since we last saw each other.

139
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,270
Chatting is not okay either.

140
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,270

You still don't understand?

I will make you understand today.

145
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,190
Close your eyes.

147
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,620
Should I get up

148
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,220
or keep pretending to sleep?

149
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,550
Don't go.

150
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,280
Get some more sleep.

151
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,630

Please don't do this.

156
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,510
What?

157
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,750
Well, I...

158
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,470
I'm thinking what to wear today.

to go shopping this afternoon.

161
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,560
No need to think.

162
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,970
You only have one suit of clothes.

163

It got dirty last night.

164

Then how should I go out today?

166
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,630
Then don't go out.

167
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,630
But Jiang Juanjuan...

168

It's all my mom's fault.

She said it was good for health.

After she suffered a bone fracture,

I was forced to be the lead dancer.

-She just doesn't gain weight.

I didn't expect that after four years in college,

I didn't even make it to the graduation performance.

The book you read in high school.

513

The cover is in English.

514
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,230
But it's

515
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,980
actually a romance novel.

516
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,230
You read it?

517
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,950
So you should know

518
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,820
what I want to tell you today.

519
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,610
Before your college entrance exam scores were announced,

520
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,230
I thought

521
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,510
if we couldn't go to the same university,

522
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,710
and if you didn't come to Yunhai,

523
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,580
would we go our separate ways

524
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,670
like other childhood sweethearts

525
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,750
just like that?

526
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,910
But then I thought about it.

527
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,270
We won't.

528
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,830
Are you that confident?

529
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,590
If we were always together,

530
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,550
I might never have this feeling.

531
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,430
But we separated

532
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,830
in the first year of college.

533
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,910
I walked a long road alone.

534
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,390
But I still wanted to come back to you.

535
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,630
I'm not home.

536
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,880
I wonder if she can handle it on her own.

537
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,190
So I'm more confident in you

538
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,390
than in myself.

539
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,750
I made a bet.

540
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,150
No matter where we go,

541
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,390
I still want to go back to the stairway in the childhood

542
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,620
to wait for you.

543
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,170
As long as I'm waiting,

544
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,830
you would come.

545
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,630
Congratulations.

546
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,550
You win.

549

It's called the eternity of a moment.

552

So, will you marry me

553

554
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,750
Yes.

555
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,030
Shouldn't you have a ring when you propose?

556

Where is your ring?

557
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,540
I came out in a hurry.

558

I didn't have time to prepare.

559
