One is "rabbit" and one is "grass".

Medical University is good.

It's good for girls to study medicine.

Take it easy.

00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,460
Yunhai offered a journalism major this year

544

and it expanded enrollment.

545

547
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,780
You could apply for journalism major

Isn't your birthday over?

690
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,140
June 20.

691
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,540
Today is my lunar birthday.

692
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,340
How do you know that?

693

You give me a ball.

695
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,780
What do you mean?

696

This is the graduation gift for you.

697

although Yunhai and Qingbei are far away,

700
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,780
but as the earth is a ball,

701

we will finally meet again someday.

702

Yes.

703

One of my other friends

Who dares not to admit our Little Rabbit?

730

734
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,700
in our community,

735
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,020
but I think

736
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,480
this is too ostentatious.

737
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,940
Too ostentatious.

738
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,140
There are many candidates in the community.

739
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,020
If you hold a roadside banquet,

740
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,460
won't you make a fool of yourself?

741

Where is Ling Chao?

745
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,740
He caught a cold. I didn't ask him to come.

746
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,270
He didn't want to infect us.

747
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,940
Hasn't he had a cold for a while?

748
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,700
Exactly.

749

It's summer now.

750

How can he catch a cold?

751
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,420
But he's getting better.

752
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,620
At the end of a cold,

753
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,980
it is most contagious.

754

It's me who pushed him into the lake.

776

But if he hadn't come closer,

how could I have done it?

778
