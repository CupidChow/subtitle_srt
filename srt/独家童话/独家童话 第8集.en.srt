00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,500
That's not okay.

173
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,460
Even if you trust Zheng,

174
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,760
you can't let an outsider attend the parents' meeting.

175
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,780
I know Little Rabbit's situation very well.

176
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,100
I'll attend the meeting for her.

177
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,780
You can attend the meeting for Ling Chao.

178
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,380
Okay?

179
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,020
But I know little about Ling Chao's situation.

180
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,560
Ling Chao's situation

181
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,040
is the same every year.

182
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,820
There will be no problem.

183
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
You just need to attend the meeting.

184
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,380
Alright.

185
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:32,900
Come on.

186
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,950
Help me put on the necklace.

187
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,039
Why aren't you wearing the earrings you chose just now?

188
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,080
After you gave them to me at that time,

189
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,960
I didn't wear them all the time as they are precious.

190
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,100
Ling Bo.

191
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,020
Let bygones be bygones.

192
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,850
If you hadn't been sending money to us all these years,

193
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,250
we wouldn't have become the ones we are now.

194
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,820
You always bear the hardships by yourself.

195
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,820
There are some things that the kid doesn't know,

196
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,660
but I know, don't I?

197
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,740
All these years,

198
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,580
I've owed you two too much.

199
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,370
Don't worry.

200
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,370
I will compensate you and Ling Chao more

201
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,000
so that you can live a better life.

202
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,020
Alright, alright. Stop blaming yourself.

203
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,620
Let's go.

204
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,940
Lady Juan.

205
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,730
Which insolent brat

206
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,580
made you angry?

207
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,380
Let me teach him a lesson for you.

208
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,780
This time, I'm the one who is insolent.

209
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,560
Your idol's image has been ruined again?

210
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,380
It's because of my dad this time.

211
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,460
He never cared about

212
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,780
my grades.

213
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,860
I don't know what's wrong with him this time,

214
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,780
but he's coming to the parents' meeting.

215
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,900
He has just told me that

216
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,620
he is on his way here.

217
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,460
It's good that

218
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,690
your dad cares about you.

219
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,980
But my grades dropped a lot this time.

220
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,420
He'll be angry if he knows it.

221
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,590
So, when he asked me what time the parents' meeting would start,

222
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,000
I was so impulsive that

223
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,560
I told him the time which was two hours later.

224
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,780
I thought when he came,

225
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,780
the parents' meeting would be over,

226
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,960
and then the problem would be solved.

227
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,220
It's okay.

228
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,580
Maybe your dad just did it on the spur of the moment.

229
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,220
He might not be able to come if he suddenly has something else to deal with later.

230
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,380
I hope so.

231
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,500
I just hope that Xue can do it quickly

232
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,430
and end the parents' meeting soon.

233
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,540
Well,

234
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,260
how about we go to the playground for some fresh air later?

235
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,540
Maybe you'll feel better.

236
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,180
Okay.

237
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,820
Hello, hello.

238
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,220
Little Rabbit's mother.

239
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,740
Let me introduce myself.

240
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,270
I'm Yin Zihan's mother, and Zihan is Little Rabbit's deskmate.

241
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,020
Hello.

242
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,490
I heard Han talk at home every day

243
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,420
about Little Rabbit being like this today,

244
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,650
and being like that tomorrow.

245
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,660
He cares so much

246
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,660
about your Little Rabbit.

247
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,020
Little Rabbit didn't talk much about

248
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,050
Yin Zihan.

249
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,020
She has a better relationship with Ling Chao in Grade 12.

250
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,460
You mean Ling Chao?

251
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,980
His academic record is good.

252
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,440
But I've heard that he has a bad personality.

253
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,300
He's a bit weird.

254
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:06,940
No.

255
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,310
It's called arrogance.

256
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,970
But...

257
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,580
But Little Rabbit thinks that Ling Chao is good.

258
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,420
He always ranks first in his class.

259
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,020
Besides, he often tutors her in her homework

260
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,020
and teaches her to do the exercises.

261
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,100
No matter how good Ling Chao is,

262
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,180
he's a student in Grade 12 after all.

263
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,580
Little Rabbit and Han

264
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,060
are deskmates,

265
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,660
and because of this, they can get closer and closer to each other.

266
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,860
Rabbits don't eat grass by their nests.

267
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,500
But they are still young.

268
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,980
We don't know what will happen in the future.

269
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,260
So,

270
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,540
I mean we should let these two kids communicate more

271
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,530
with each other

272
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,220
and learn from each other.

273
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,100
There's nothing wrong with this.

274
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:48,900
Hello. Hello.

275
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,760
Sit over there.

276
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,900
Right. He needs to be more focused.

277
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,860
Watch him do his homework at home.

278
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,900
Keep an eye on him.

279
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,780
Who are you?

280
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,900
Hello, I'm Ling Chao's father.

281
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,780
Hello, Ling Chao's dad.

282
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,460
I'm his class adviser. My surname is Xiao.

283
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,700
His mother attended the parents' meeting every time,

284
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,980
so I didn't recognize you.

285
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,580
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,340
It's okay.

287
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,060
How is Ling Chao at school?

288
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,900
There's no problem with Ling Chao's grades.

289
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,100
He has always been recognized as

290
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,700
the most excellent student.

291
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,220
However, his individual consciousness is a bit strong.

292
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,220
If he meets a problem, he wouldn't talk to the teacher.

293
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,970
You mean Ling Chao is a bit unsociable and eccentric at school?

294
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,850
No, no, it's not that serious.

295
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,220
He merely has his own ideas and has a unique personality.

296
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,780
So, as parents,

297
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,220
you should communicate more

298
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,980
with your child,

299
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,310
and care more about him.

300
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,020
Thank you, Ms. Xiao.

301
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,350
I'll be careful with it.

302
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,860
Mr. Xue.

303
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,620
Hello, hello.

304
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,980
I haven't seen you for a long time. You've become more handsome.

305
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,100
You are...

306
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,350
Yin Zihan's mother, right?

307
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,610
Yes, yes, yes.

308
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,100
You have such a good memory.

309
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,460
How come I remember that Yin Zihan

310
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,660
has been assigned to the science class?

311
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,620
Have you gone to the wrong place?

312
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,980
I just came here to say hello to you

313
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,260
and to see you.

314
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,340
I've said hello to you.

315
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
I'm leaving.

316
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,920
Let me see you off. Come on.

317
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,660
Bye.

318
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,340
Let me see you off.

319
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,780
No need, Mr. Xue. Bye.

320
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,310
After you go out, take the stairs and enter the first classroom.

321
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,420
God bless me.

322
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,060
Please let Xue talk fast

323
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,220
so that the parents' meeting will end soon.

324
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,020
Thank you.

325
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,770
Thank you.

326
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,700
Be fast. Be fast. Be fast.

327
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,770
Is that necessary?

328
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,010
You only did a bad job in one exam.

329
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,740
Besides, you didn't rank last.

330
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,540
If your dad really knows it,

331
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,180
just get scolded by him and apologize, and it'll be over.

332
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,300
No.

333
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,500
You know what?

334
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,060
My dad looks very fierce when he gets angry.

335
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,260
Jiang Juanjuan!

336
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,700
With your grades like these,

337
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,700
do you deserve my efforts of bringing you up?

338
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,230
Don't even think about getting pocket money from me this month.

339
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,180
I don't care if he doesn't give me money normally.

340
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,820
But this month, my idol will publish a new limited-edition book.

341
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,340
How can I buy it without money?

342
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,380
Although our grades this time

343
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,380
meet the expected goal,

344
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,700
it has something to do with the ranking of...

345
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,300
Hello.

346
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,100
Are you having a parents' meeting?

347
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,500
Yes. Who are you?

348
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,660
I'm Jiang Juanjuan's father.

349
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,300
Sorry.

350
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm late.

351
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,800
It's okay. Take a seat.

352
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,730
Over there.

353
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,340
That seat.

354
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,060
Okay.

355
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,150
Okay. Thank you.

356
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,820
Don't cry.

357
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,540
How much is it?

358
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,600
I'll buy it for you.

359
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,980
200 yuan?

360
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,020
Just go on crying.

361
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,020
Go on crying.

362
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,420
You'll feel better after you finish crying.

363
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,820
Just cry. Go on crying.

364
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,190
You should worry about yourself.

365
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,340
You'll be the one who should cry after the parents' meeting.

366
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,300
No. Why should I worry?

367
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,220
My godmother will surely put in a good word for me.

368
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,340
Little Rabbit,

369
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,500
it doesn't matter if you did a bad job in an exam once or twice.

370
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,020
You're so smart and cute.

371
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,190
Maybe you'll get enlightened one day.

372
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,550
It's your turn.

373
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,650
My mom will probably be like this.

374
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,660
Han.

375
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,060
Dose my dress look good today?

376
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,120
I didn't embarrass you, did I?

377
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,380
Today, I talked with

378
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,900
the parents and your classmates at school all afternoon.

379
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,340
I'm so tired.

380
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,260
You're so good at acting.

381
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,550
Of course.

382
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,619
I can do well in all these three fields of movies, TV dramas and music.

383
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,500
I'm an all-rounder.

384
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,030
Then write a song yourself.

385
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:16,220
I'll think about it. I've been busy lately.

386
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,780
We can't improve our ability if we don't learn.

387
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,660
We can't make achievements if we don't have any aspiration.

388
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,940
As long as you firmly stick to your goal

389
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,099
and work hard,

390
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,220
you'll gain something eventually.

391
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,750
Why did you suddenly recite a passage from our textbook?

392
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,700
No.

393
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,380
Aren't we imitating the way our parents talk?

394
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,060
That's how my dad talks.

395
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,900
Yes, yes, yes.

396
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Jia Siwen's father is a professor in college.

397
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,760
He must quote passages from classics when he talks.

398
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,820
Ling Chao,

399
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,840
it's your turn.

400
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,000
Let me play the role of your acting partner for you. Come on.

401
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,420
How was the parents' meeting today?

402
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,420
Start acting.

403
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,700
You must be tired.

404
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,220
Honey.

405
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,300
Expressionless acting skills.

406
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,630
Who can sense that you are imitating the way your dad smokes?

407
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,340
Did you sense it or not?

408
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,380
Xiao Haishan.

409
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,420
Can you turn down the TV a bit?

410
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,380
Can't you see that we're talking about serious business?

411
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,290
Okay.

412
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,890
Let's continue. Ignore him.

413
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,460
Yin Zihan's mother

414
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,700
is so unreliable.

415
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,780
If our Little Rabbit

416
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,640
is entrusted to her in the future,

417
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,740
I won't be able to rest assured.

418
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,500
Right.

419
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,900
People always say that marriage is a matter of two families.

420
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,220
We should be careful.

421
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,940
What should we do now?

422
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,010
How come you're talking about marriage?

423
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,020
They are still kids.

424
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,420
I think Yin Zihan

425
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,150
has evil intentions towards our Little Rabbit.

426
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,020
Our Little Rabbit is so innocent that

427
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,500
she treats him as a friend.

428
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,540
In the future,

429
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,780
after they're with each other for a long time

430
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,180
and fall in love with each other,

431
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,380
what should we do?

432
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,660
Right.

433
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,740
Girls tend to suffer losses more easily in love.

434
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,020
We must prepare for it in advance this time.

435
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,680
Let's figure out a way at once.

436
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,990
I've thought about it carefully.

437
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,820
If you and Xiao don't despise us,

438
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,300
just let Xiao Tu marry into our family.

439
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,060
After all, I watched her grow up.

440
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,580
I treat her as my own daughter.

441
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,540
I won't give her a hard time.

442
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,660
Okay.

443
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,180
However, Little Rabbit will have to condescend to

444
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,040
get married with Ling Chao who is not quite perfect.

445
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,270
How can you say that?

446
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,610
Why?

447
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,740
Rabbits don't eat grass by their nests.

448
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,900
What era is it now?

449
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,950
Why did you say that?

450
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,620
We two families know each other well.

451
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,540
It's lucky for us to have this chance.

452
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,420
Yes.

453
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,900
Wenhui is right.

454
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,140
Chao is so outstanding.

455
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,220
I also like Chao very much.

456
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,380
If he can be my son-in-law,

457
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,380
our Little Rabbit

458
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,460
will be a very lucky girl.

459
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,380
Then it's easy to deal with this.

460
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,380
Then let's get Little Rabbit and Ling Chao together.

461
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,180
Okay.

462
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,420
I agree. I agree.

463
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,300
Ling Bo, what do you think?

464
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,020
I...

465
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,180
I think it makes sense.

466
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,740
For the things between these two kids,

467
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,460
no matter how much we say, it'll be useless.

468
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,790
Let them handle the things by themselves.

469
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,140
How can we neglect

470
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,100
the things about our kids?

471
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,090
Besides,

472
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,260
our Little Rabbit is so innocent and kind.

473
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,580
What if she's tricked by Yin Zihan?

474
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,740
Ling Chao

475
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,420
is just a blockhead.

476
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,740
What does he know?

477
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,440
If he takes this step wrongly,

478
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,140
what should we do?

479
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:30,980
It's okay.

480
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,540
-I feel very worried. -I know.

481
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,660
Wenhui.

482
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,150
Calm down. It won't happen.

483
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,280
We'll listen to you.

484
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,140
Right.

485
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,060
It's settled then.

486
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,490
No. What do you mean by saying that it's settled?

487
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,220
The kids are still young.

488
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,290
Shut up!

489
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,000
If my silly daughter marries a smart man,

490
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,540
she'll be cheated sooner or later, won't she?

491
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,980
These are all the posters in the store.

492
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,820
If it's not enough,

493
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,620
let's go to another store after school to buy more.

494
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,260
This is the new flavor.

495
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,320
I think it looks delicious. Taste it.

496
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,460
Well,

497
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,820
drink this.

498
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,500
I call it Happy Water.

499
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,760
Every time when I finish drinking it, I'll be in a good mood.

500
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,940
It's useless.

501
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,740
I feel extremely disappointed now.

502
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,290
My dad threw away all my idol's posters.

503
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,780
My pocket money was deducted.

504
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,300
My mobile phone was confiscated, too.

505
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,420
I will never be happy again.

506
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,540

and he works hard to pursue his dream.

00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,420
Xiao Tu is a child bride in Ling Chao's family.

675
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,370
How come I heard that Xiao Tu's family owed a lot of money

676
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,300
and they had no choice

[Class 4, Grade 10]

678
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,020
but to mortgage Xiao Tu to Ling Chao's family?

679
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,460
Why is she so lucky?

680
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,340
Maybe not.

681
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,020
Who knows whether Ling Chao will bully her or not?

682
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,010
How come Xiao Tu is someone like this?

683
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,690
[Class 4, Grade 10]

684
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,980
Wasn't she very close to Yin Zihan previously?

685
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,180
One is a rich boy,

686
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,500
and the other is a talented boy.

687
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,180
If I were her,

688
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,820
I would also think it was hard to make a choice.

689
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,460
Forget it.

[Class 4, Grade 10]

691

Xiao Tu is not a child bride.

692
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,340
She's just close to Ling Chao's family.

693
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,380
Besides,

694
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,340
Xiao Tu is usually the one who bullies Ling Chao.

695
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,660
Ling Chao is a nice guy and he doesn't blame her.

696
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,060
Nonsense.

697

Look.

698
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,240
You said you wanted to surpass Ling Chao.

699
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,340
What's the result now?

Mr. Xue.

701
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,460
That's not true.

702

Alright, alright.

703
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,300
I suggest you to focus on your studies.

704
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,420
Only after you become a truly strong man

705
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,420
can you surpass him in every aspect.

706

How about this?

707
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,940
After you're admitted into college,

You've succeeded?

It's a secret.

Nonsense.

721
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,380
There are so many people gossiping about us.

722
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,780
We must avoid suspicion.

723
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,100
People once gossiped that you and Yin Zihan were lovers.

724
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,220
I didn't see you avoid suspicion at that time.

725
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,300
All those rumors were not true.

726
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,580
So the rumor about you and me is true?

727
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
Of course not.

728
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,180
Then it's fine.

you even called me husband.

You're afraid of the gossip that we're lovers?

Stop looking. Come and help me walk.
