You only solved one question after so long.

And the right answer is C instead of B.

205

If you don't know how to solve the question, just choose C.

00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,780
Silk!

344
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,580
Have you watched too many dramas?

345
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,340
You're not a new son-in-law.

346
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,580
You don't have to do such social things.

347
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,780
My parents are easy to get along with.

348
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,060
-Let's go.
-It's inappropriate.

349
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,820
Let's go.

350
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,950
Don't buy anything.

351
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,740
Hurry up.

352
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,300
-It's full. It's everywhere.
- This...

353
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,540
Is this vinegar?

354
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,460
-Yes.
-Dad, Mum.

355
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,460
I brought my classmate here to play.

356
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,290
Okay.

357
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,260
Wait a minute.

358
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,830
I'll get you a pair of slippers.

359
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,980
This pair belongs to Ling Chao.

360
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,820
This pair is too small.

361
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,260
Are you done?

362
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,020
I can't hold it any longer.

363
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,260
Wait.

364
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,580
Who did you bring?

365
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,460
Hello.

366
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,060
Hello, Dad and Mom.

367
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,940
What are you doing?

368
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,220
Have an orange.

369
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,980
Okay.

370
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,220
Thank you, Uncle.

371
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,060
Wenhui, where are you?

372
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,020
Let me tell you.

373
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,220
Rabbit brought a classmate home.

374
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,380
A boy.

375
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,860
What? Rabbit brought a boy home?

376
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,620
Is he handsome?

377
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,020
Not bad.

378
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,900
Not as handsome as Ling Chao.

379
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,870
He's about the same height as Chao.

380
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,900
What am I talking to you about?

381
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,860
I just want to ask you,

382
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,700
it's the first time she's bringing a boy home,

383
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,780
what should I do?

384
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,160
Don't worry. I'll be right there. Let's talk in person.

385
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,890
Okay, hurry up.

386
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,730
I'm hanging up.

387
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,060
Okay, I'll wait for you.

388
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,500
Xiao Tu,

389
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,100
I think your classmate is very tall.

390
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,540
He's more handsome than Ling Chao.

391
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,700
Have some apples.

392
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,490
His hair is curly.

393
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,860
He looks handsome.

394
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,980
Have an apple.

395
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,780
I'll add another dish.

396
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,890
He's handsome.

397
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,990
Have table manners.

398
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,010
Don't play while eating.

399
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,460
He has a good appetite.

400
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,590
He's already had two bowls of rice.

401
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,900
If you want to eat something,

402
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,820
help yourself.

403
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,300
Make yourself at home.

404
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,660
Okay, thank you, Dad.

405
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,220
Thank you, Uncle.

406
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,780
Eat up.

407
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,140
The food price

408
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,180
has gone up.

409
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,240
I can't even afford to eat scallion, ginger and garlic.

410
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,740
Yes.

411
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,780
So,

412
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,810
Rabbit,

413
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,460
don't be picky.

414
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,579
Do you hear me?

415
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,420
I... I have too much rice.

416
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,940
Ling Chao will help me.

417
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,660
You're eating just this little?

418
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,320
Too little.

419
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,010
Let me get you a bowl.

420
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,380
No, it's okay, Uncle.

421
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,340
I usually don't eat much.

422
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,700
Auntie's cooking is so good.

423
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,620
That's why I ate more.

424
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,220
I told you.

425
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,780
My mom is a good cook.

426
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,460
You should eat more.

427
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,620
You won't have such a good chance in the future.

428
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,060
You can come

429
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,740
whenever you want.

430
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,700
Okay.

431
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,980
We only need to add an extra pair of chopsticks.

432
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,590
Come...

433
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,980
He won't have time for a while.

434
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,910
He signed up for a competition.

435
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,860
He has training after school.

436
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,500
Right?

437
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,250
Ju...nior.

438
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,540
A competition?

439
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,620
Good.

440
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,940
A straight A student.

441
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,860
Xiao Tu, if you

442
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,340
have any questions,

443
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,670
you should ask him more.

444
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,260
Xiao Tu and I are deskmates.

445
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,020
It's my duty.

446
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,500
Okay.

447
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,220
In school,

448
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,460
don't bother your classmate.

449
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,900
We already have a tutor at home.

450
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,540
Yeah.

451
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,940
Ling Chao, do you hear me?

452
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,940
Chao is a good student, right?

453
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,580
If he tutors Xiao Tu,

454
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,900
to put it nicely,

455
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,460
it's more than enough.

456
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,620
But to be frank,

457
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,340
it's a waste of talent.

458
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,140
Mom.

459
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,260
You can chat with each other.

460
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,990
Why do you have to talk about me?

461
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,180
Sit down.

462
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,180
How can we let you do it?

463
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,220
Ling Chao, go.

464
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,140
Look, he knows where it is.

465
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,180
A man

466
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,380
should do more work.

467
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,740
Yes, Wenhui.

468
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,540
I envy you so much.

469
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,660
Look at Chao.

470
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,940
He's so sensible.

471
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,860
He also has good grades.

472
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,700
He can do housework too.

473
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,900
It's rare to see such a good boy

474
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,420
as Chao is.

475
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,380
Auntie.

476
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,660
Thank you for cooking so many dishes.

477
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,380
Later,

478
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,590
let me wash the dishes and clean up.

479
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,380
-You're quite diligent.
-No, no.

480
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,420
How can I let you do the dishes?

481
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:34,980
Uncle, Auntie.

482
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,860
You don't have to stand on ceremony.

483
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,260
Let me help you.

484
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,300
No, I can do it myself.

485
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,380
I'm also good at housework.

486
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,700
I...

487
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,740
The toilet is over there.

488
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,180
Yin, you must be tired.

489
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,860
Come on, sit down and watch TV.

490
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,820
What are you talking about?

491
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,250
What time is it?

492
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,980
Let him go home.

493
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,100
Is it late?

494
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,970
His parents will be worried.

495
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,340
He has homework to do.

496
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,980
Yeah.

497
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,740
Get ready.

498
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,060
That's good.

499
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,300
Anyway, come often

500
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,380
when you have time.

501
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,180
Xiao Tu.

502
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,660
See your classmates off.

503
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,580
Ling Chao.

504
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,540
You go too. Hurry up.

505
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,740
You go with Rabbit.

506
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:40,940
Well,

507
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,820
Uncle, Auntie. Thank you for the food.

508
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,660
See you next time.

509
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,380
-Take care.
-You're welcome.

510
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,300
Bye. Take care.

511
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,180
Bye. Bye.

512
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,260
Bye.

513
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,780
Goodbye, Uncle.

514
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,180
Okay, take care.

515
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,660
Where is my bike?

516
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,580
You didn't lock it?

517
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,900
I forgot.

518
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,700
I usually park it in my yard.

519
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,940
I never lock it.

520
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Why did they only steal your bike?

521
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,590
There's discrimination among bikes too?

522
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,620
I...

523
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,020
Ask your family to pick you up.

524
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,480
Don't call.

525
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,860
It's quite suitable.

526
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,640
I think you should stay away from him.

527
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,290
Why?

528
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,620
Didn't you know that he approached you with a purpose?

529
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,620
I know.

530
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,610
Ridiculous.

531
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,900
Ling Chao,

532
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,020
do you think I should choose liberal arts or science?

533
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,420
Is there any difference?

534
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,980
It doesn't affect your placing at the bottom anyway./You will come in last place anyway.

535
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,620
You did it on purpose.

536
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,420
Ling Chao.

537
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,420
Morning.

538
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,300
Hello, Senior.

539
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,700
I brought it for you

540
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,930
when I passed by the breakfast shop today.

541
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,620
Thank you.

542
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,420
I've already had breakfast.

543
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,380
Junior,

544
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,500
I think you should choose liberal arts.

545
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,940
I chose science.

546
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,900
It is actually quite hard to learn.

547
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,580
But luckily, I have Ling Chao.

548
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,380
He taught me all the questions I don't know.

549
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,460
Thank you. Senior.

550
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,350
Let's go. We're being late.

551
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,250
You are so patient.

552
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,260
Why didn't you teach me how to solve questions?

553
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,320
Did I not teach you?

554
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,900
You can't be taught at all.

555
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,500
Is that called teaching?

556
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,380
How can you learn how to solve a math question at once?

557
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,900
When I taught you the second time,

558
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,580
you were already sleeping like a pig.

559
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,380
It's my fault?

560
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,790
Where's Senior?

561
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,180
Lan, good morning.

562
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,580
Why did you stop here?

563
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,540
It's nothing.

564
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,570
Let's go.

565
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,700
Yin Xinlan is jealous

566
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
because you and Ling Chao are close.

567
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,300
Why would such a beautiful senior

568
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,580
be jealous of me?

569
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,540
I have a better relationship with QQ gummies.

570
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,900
It's fine that she's stupid,

571
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,460
but she always troubles Ling Chao.

572
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,620
I'm speechless.

573
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,140
[Conserve every drop of water] [Be careful of scalding]

574

Is it that bad?

575
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,260
It's not like you didn't see what happened on the doomsday.

576
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,460
What a joke.

577
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,180
And she can't even solve middle school problems.

578
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,250
If Ling Chao hadn't been her neighbor  since they were kids,

579
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,660
he wouldn't be her friend.

Senior.

Are you okay?

585
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,980
I'm normally not interested in other people's business,

586
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,860
but I think I should tell you.

587
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,820
Don't fill too much water.

588
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,220
Otherwise, you'll burn yourself.

589
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,290
Speaking ill of others is also like this.

590
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,490
You'll be punished if you talk too much.

[Conserve every drop of water]

I didn't expect you to have such a charismatic side.

[Step 321]

595

Of course.

596
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,980
I didn't watched those court intrigue dramas

597
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,580
for nothing.

598
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,380
Your Highness.

599

Is it an earthquake?

600
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,780
Why is the bottle in your hands

601
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,660
shaking nonstop?

602
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,240
It's my first time acting such a role.

603
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,740
I was flustered too.

604
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,220
Right?

605
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,380
But this Yin Xinlan...

606
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,020
I thought she was my goddess.

607
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,200
I didn't expect her to have two faces.

608
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,940
She is more formidable than Ling Chao.

609
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,100
If they really get married,

610
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,290
it'll be bad.

611
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,010
They will quarrel every day

612
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,820
and won't have peace.

613
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,140
By then, I'll still be the unlucky one mediating the situation.

614
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,340
We already have someone with a bad temper at home,

You worry so much.

This horoscope column is very accurate.

I think you can try squeezing a little more out.

I can't.

624

You don't know how lucky you are.

Do you believe in constellations?

I believe knowledge changes fate.

The training class Ms. Xiao mentioned

632

is full of boys.

The principal's son is married.

641
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,820
Now he sees everyone as a couple.

642
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,550
He doesn't care about seperating boys and girls.

643

00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,150
[Ling Chao]

688
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,970
What is Green Soda?

689
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,190
The band Ling Chao likes.

690
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,250
[Ling Chao]

691
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,580
Look.

692
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,700
What a coincidence.

693
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,820
I like Green Soda too.

694
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,970
[Ling Chao]

695
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:48,740
Do you like their Big Love Song?

696
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,930
[Ling Chao]

697
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,550
[Ling Chao]

698
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,860
Why does he always say yes?

699
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,950
Is this an automated reply?

700
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,700
You know him.

701
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,220
He's always like this to strangers.

702
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,460
It's okay. He's just like a computer.

703
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,340
What a coincidence.

704
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,530
[Ling Chao]

705
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,620
Me too.

706
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,580
Don't you think we're a good match?

707
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,060
[Ling Chao]

708
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,540
It's okay.

709
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,680
We're different from your bad romance.

710
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,970
[Ling Chao]

711
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,170
[Ling Chao]

712
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,260
Why did you...

713
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,540
It's sent.

714
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,570
[Ling Chao]

715
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,300
Why didn't he reply?

716
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,620
Maybe he's shy.

717
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,540
It's okay.

718
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:37,620
There's a new fried chicken restaurant near the school.

719
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,610
[Ling Chao]

720
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,290
Let's go eat after school.

721
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,370
[Ling Chao]

722
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,500
I'm not going.

723
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,700
Come on.

724
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,750
[Ling Chao]

725
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,420
Xiao Tu.

726
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,380
Just tell me if you want fried chicken.

727
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,540
Don't be ridiculous.

728
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,870
How did he know it was me?

729
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,860
I don't know.

730
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,020
He's working so hard.

731
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,620
Let me do a test for you.

732
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,420
You've walked in the desert for three days and three nights.

733
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,020
At this time, an animal comes to save you.

734
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,420
Which animal is it?

735
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,340
Why an animal?

736
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,790
Don't care about that.

737
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,980
Then.

738
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:30,820
A turtle.

739
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,300
At this time,

740
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
the turtle decides to give you something.

741
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,560
What do you think it is?

742
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,180
Why would a turtle give me something?

743
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,440
Don't care about that.

744
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,220
It must be milk tea.

745
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,260
I'm in the desert.

746
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,580
If the milk tea must be paired with something

747
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,500
to be eaten together,

748
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,180
what would you choose?

749
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,940
Tiramisu.

750
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,340
You do like Yin Zihan.

751
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,860
Why?

752
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,180
Did you make up this test?

753
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,980
When you were struggling in the sea of exercises,

754
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,140
Yin Zihan came to save you.

755
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,220
Were you happy?

756
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,220
Yes.

757
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,620
When Yin Zihan gave you milk tea,

758
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,660
were you happy?

759
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,420
Yes.

760
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,260
You still don't admit that you like Yin Zihan?

761
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,820
He took you to eat tiramisu once.

762
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,280
And you still remember it.

763
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,660
Then I guess I like him.

764
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,500
Generally, when it gets to Episode 8,

765
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,860
the male and female lead will kiss each other in Korean dramas.

766
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,340
How come there's no progress

767
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,800
between you and Yin Zihan?

768
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,340
But I still don't know

769
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,220
what he likes about me

770
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,620
and what I like about him.

771
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,380
Didn't you hear him?

772
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,810
How can we figure out

773
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,200
something as complicated as love is?

774
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,740
You can't  figure out how to study.

775
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,200
Don't think about more complicated things.

776
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,860
I think Yin Zihan is good.

777
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Don't be a coward.

778
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,990
Seize the opportunity.

779
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,060
Then I...

780
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,020
Go watch a movie

781
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,220
and take a walk with him.

782
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,380
Talk about poetry, songs, and philosophy of life.

783
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,420
Or do something you're good at

00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,580
OK?

786
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,820
Xiao Tu, I don't know how.

787
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,180
Xiao Tu, I don't know how.

788
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:46,780
I...

789
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,460
Don't run!

790
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,300
No, I can't do it.

791
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,110
Why are you running?

792
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,220
No!

[Taekwondo Gym]

794
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,180
Mom, I'm home.

795
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,770
Mom.

796
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,470
I forgot to give some books to Xiao Tu.

I'm going out.

I'm sorry.

I just thought I was good at it.

801
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,270
I didn't expect you didn't know how to do it at all.

It's okay.

803

Today, I've learned that Taekwondo has po...

804
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,140
Charm.

805
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,770
Why don't you go back and rest first?

806
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,060
I can go back by myself.

807

No.

It's so dark. It's so late.

809
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,050
You must be scared if you go back alone.

Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

Sure.

Dimples and long eyelashes

Not bad.

You sing well.

827
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,260
Of course.

828
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,180
If it weren't for my parents' disagreement,

829
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,900
I really want to be a singer and dancer.

830
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,860
Really?

831
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,500
I thought you have no other pursuit

832
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,100
besides surpassing Ling Chao.

833
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,260
How is that possible?

834
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,570
Surpassing Ling Chao is just my small goal.

835
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,330
My big goal is to perform on stage.

836
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,900
Imagine

837
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,030
when you stand in the center of the stage,

838
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,940
the spotlight is on you,

839
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,469
it's like you're the center of the world.

840
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,100
You sing your favorite song

841
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,500
and follow the rhythm of music.

842
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,000
Below the stage

843
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,980
are applause and glowsticks.

844
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,820
This feeling.

845
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,340
Why didn't your family agree?

846
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,530
Not everyone with dreams

847
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,639
is qualified to pursue their dreams.

848
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,420
But

849
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,980
having a dream

850
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,900
is already great.

851
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:48,860
Are you really okay?

852
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,940
I'm fine.

00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,580
Okay.

860
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,380
See you tomorrow.

861
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,940
You scared me.

862
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,420
Do you really think

863
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,300
Yin Zihan is your Mr. Right?

864
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,100
Mind your own

865
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,980
bad romance.

866
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,740
Some flowers look beautiful,

867
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,780
but actually they are poisonous.

868
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,780
Be careful.

869
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,900
It's different.

870
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,300
Forget it.

871
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,940
Let me tell you directly.

872
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,560
Yin Zihan approached you with a purpose.

873
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,620
Yes.

874
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,500
His purpose is to get me.

875
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,940
What else could it be? You?

876
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,740
He wants you because you have a bad temper

877
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,140
or because you can't speak human language?

878
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,620
How do you know it's impossible?

879
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,300
Didn't the horoscope book say

880
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,340
I would have bad romance?

881
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,420
Can you clean it up?

882
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,830
[Exclusive Epilogue]

883
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,470
You spread them out every time.

884
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,210
Didn't you say you were going to buy a birthday gift?

885
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,940
Why did you bring a turtle back?

886
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,140
Don't mention it.

887
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,460
She got it from the kids' amusement park herself.

888
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,500
Others caught goldfish.

889
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,180
She

890
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,380
caught a turtle.

891
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,580
Turtle is also good.

892
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,780
It has a good meaning.

893
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,860
It means to get a rich and successful husband.

894
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,660
Right?
