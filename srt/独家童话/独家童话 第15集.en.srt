he is seeking attention?

351
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,819
Objectively speaking,

352
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,420
Ling Chao is indeed a senior.

353
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,300
It depends.

354
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,980
Maybe it's fate.

355
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,740
Or maybe

356
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,700
your cousin

357
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,300
appears in a way that

358
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,540
made him feel

359
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:30,010
he should show up in front of her.

360
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,740
And this senior

361
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,460
is special to her.

362
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,220
She has a little crush on him.

363
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,060
But she's not sure

364
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,620
if he likes her or not.

365
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,780
So your cousin...

366
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,400
she has never been in a relationship, right?

367
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,060
I think

368
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,640
she should believe in her intuition.

369
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,220
Since she has never been in a relationship,

370
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,090
yet she has developed

371
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,980
a special feeling toward this senior.

372
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,580
I think

373
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,900
it has a special meaning.

374
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,330
I'll go back and think about me...

375
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,820
about my cousin.

376
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,540

you've helped me so many times.

If I don't treat you to a meal,

I would feel sorry.

380
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,140
Okay, let's go.

You just gave your dad the scarf?

Are you sure you are going to Ling Chao's birthday empty-handed?

391

He doesn't need gifts.

There are birthdays every year.

393

I'll give him next year.

What did you prepare?

We can't both go to the birthday dinner empty-handed.

Jia Siwen picked a computer book for me.

It's very practical.

Didn't he reject Xu Linglong?

He didn't say he liked me.

What if he rejected me too?

How is that possible?

405
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,660
He was so fierce

someone stayed up for several nights

457
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,140

458
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,530
But then she heard that

459
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,900
our birthday boy is particularly not afraid of cold

460
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,140
that he doesn't need a scarf at all.

461
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,860
So she gave it to her dad.

462
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,060
