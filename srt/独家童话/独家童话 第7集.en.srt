when I kept following you and Ling Chao.

140

I know.

141
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,540
It was the car following us.

You just finished school?

145
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,260
What a coincidence.

146
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,700
I was about to visit you.

147
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,740
Stop pretending.

148
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,910
You've been following me for so many days.

149
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,950
What do you want?

150
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,620
Well, you...

151

You misunderstood. I...

152

I was just passing by today. I...

153
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,260
Is it fun?

154
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,150
Donâ€™t disturb our life.

155
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,210
Chao, I...

156
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:43,540
I wanted to investigate something before.

157
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,460
But it doesn't matter now.

158
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,860
I will try my best

159
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,580
to get what I want.

Xiao Tu.

161
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,220
I'm really happy

162
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,970
to be friends with you.

163
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,060
Me too.

164
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,600
Jia Siwen, spin it.

165
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,690
One, two, three.

166

I want to sing a love song.

167

From now on,

168
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,620
don't dance too much.

169
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,060
How is that possible?

170
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,260
I dance so well.

171
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,500
Honey.

172
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,610
Ling Chao,

173
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,940
Juan's house is too far away.

174
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,170
It's getting dark.

175
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,380
Send her home.

176
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,790
Who will send me back after?

177
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,730
No need.

We are on the same way.

179
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,679
I can send her home.

180
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,820
What's wrong with him?

181
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,549
I don't know.

182
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,540
Maybe he was upset because we pulled out his leg hair just now.

183
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,490
Definitely.

184
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,260
You pulled the most out just now.

185
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,100
I...

186
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,740
He's unhappy about that.

187
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,660
Bye.

188
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,330
Bye.

Yin Zihan, come often.

191
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,770
Why don't you ask Jiang Juanjuan to come often?

192
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,700
She came uninvited.

193
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,100
Do I need to say anything?

194
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,590
You too. Come often.

195

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,710
You went out to play?

197
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,350
I went to Xiao Tuâ€™s home.

198
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,380
Well,

199
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,180
how are you recently?

200
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,380
I'm fine.

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,600
What about you?

202
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,980
I'm fine. Everything is fine.

203
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,980
Go upstairs.

204
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,220

Okay.

Yes, we'll go straight to the venue.

209

Hurry up if you didn't hand in the form.

210
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,760
I have to hand it over to the teacher soon.

whether Zhang Danian chose liberal arts or science.

213
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,300
Does it affect you?

214
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,660
Of course.

215
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,860
Except him,

216
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,500
who else can compete with me?

217
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,260
You're humiliating Zhang Danian.

Are you going to choose science?

230
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,540
Yes.

231
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,540
After all, two tigers cannot share the same mountain.

-If the two of us were in the same class,
-Come closer.

233
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,140
it would only result in both of us being worse off.

234

Listen.

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,900
Everyone in the class is saying that...

00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,140
I'm afraid Yin Zihan would hit me.

240
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,060
What does it have to do with him?

241
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,940
I think Yin Zihan is a little weird.

242
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,580
But I'm not sure.

243

No.

Okay.

[The diligent gardener; the noble teacher's grace]

254

After the/our class is divided,

255
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,940
I will still be

256
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,500
the head teacher of Class 4.

257
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,860
Iâ€™m glad that you chose liberal arts.

258
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,770
In this way, we can spend

259
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,570
two extra happy years together.

260
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,960
But have you discussed with your parents

261
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,230
about which subject you would choose?

262
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,300
The college entrance exam is the first obstacle in life.

263
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,660
If you get over it, you will be smooth sailing.

264
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,770
But before you start,

265
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,220
you must think carefully

266
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,180
whether to go left or right.

267
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,740
Based on your conditions,

268
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,100
I suggest

269
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,500
you should go back and think twice about it.

270
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,500
Although it's your life,

271
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,230
this is an important decision.

272
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,260
I think you should

273
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,920
discuss it with your parents.

274
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,980
How about this?

275
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,610
I'll give you one more day.

276
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,120
Go back and think about it.

277
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,670
Okay, I got it.

You chose liberal arts.

But Xue didn't allow it, right?

297
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,420
Mr. Xue asked me to think twice about it.

298
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,180
If I were Xue, I would also ask you to think twice about it.

299
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,060
After all, you have good grades.

300
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,390
You'll have more advantage in the college entrance exam if you study science.

301
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
But I'm not Xue.

It's not like only studying science

can lead to getting into good universities.

310

With such good qualifications,

315
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,460
of course you can choose the one you like.

What if I choose the wrong one?

317
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,340
Before you choose,

318
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,000
how do you know you were wrong?

319
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,380
Besides,

320
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,420
there are so few female students in science and engineering universities.

321

354
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,670
took part in a national dance competition

355
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,080
and won the gold award.

I heard that many great directors

360
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,820
are watching this competition.

361
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,140
If some director discovers her,

362
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,780
maybe she can be a star.

368
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,020
I don't expect her to be a superstar.

369
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,540
But after winning this award,

370
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,740
she has a fifty percent chance of getting into

371
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,340
the Dance Department at Yunhai University.

372
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,099
She can get special recruitment for colleges/universities?

373
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,260

00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,770
How can I sleep when you're here?

695
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,570
Just wait a little longer.

696
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,570
It should be soon.

697
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,980
You have been spending so much time with Godfather.

698
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,240
I bet you're immune just by watching him.

699
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,260
I still don't know how to get along with him.

700
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,330
You are so contradictory.

701
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,620
The more you avoid, the more it shows that you care.

702
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,460
Since you care,

703
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,900
why are you running away?

704
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,220
The person who should apologize, apologizes;

705
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,380
the person who should get angry, gets angry.

706
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,420
If you keep being like this,

707
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,820
there will never be a result.

708
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,620
You'll only make things difficult for Godmother.

709
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,770
You're already so good?

710
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,380
You can actually say such sophisticated words?

711
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,620
Watching TV shows is not a waste of time.

712
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,980
I understand family ethics very well.

713
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,140
Go to sleep.

714
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,070
I'm leaving.

715
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,700
You've been home late recently.

716
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:28,900
Sometimes.

717
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,060
You...

718
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,090
Pay more attention to your mother.

719
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,940
Go home early when you're free.

720
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,740
Well,

721
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,700
I won't go upstairs.

722
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,700
Take this up.

723
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,900
Like all teenagers,

724
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,280
I, at the age of sixteen or seventeen,

725
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,980
-easily immerse myself
-Ling Chao.

726
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,780
in my own sadness and confusion.

727
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,660
Because of this self-esteem...

728
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,580
I'll go.

729
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,340
I ignored my mom's feelings.

730
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,300
Are you not feeling well?

731
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,020
I always envy Xiao Tu for being carefree.

732
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,830
But she always sees through me so thoroughly.

733
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,460
The person who should apologize, apologizes;

734
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,700
the person who should get angry, gets angry.

735
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,740
If you keep being like this,

736
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,090
there will never be a result.

737
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,700
You'll only make things difficult for Godmother.

738
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,620
She even

739
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,510
knows what I should do better than myself.

740
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,580
At this moment,

741
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,420
I want to be Xiao Tu

742
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,700
so that I have the courage not to run away anymore.

743
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,540
Let's go up together.

744
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,520
[Exclusive Epilogue]

745
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,860
You have a secret.

746
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,290
When did you start loving to eat chocolate?

747
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,420
Rabbit.

748
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,660
I don't want to. I won't leave.

749
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,460
Stop eating. Look at your mouth.

750
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,350
Are you not leaving?

751
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,500
Then you stay here alone.

752
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,140
I'll leave.

753
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,140
Don't scold him.

754
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,220
Wenhui.

755
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,460
You hold hands with him.

756
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,050
Wait for me here.

757
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,500
Don't run around, you hear me?

758
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,430
Okay, good girl.

759
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,500
Wenhui!

760
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,860
Why won't you go to kindergarten?

761
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,580
Dad used to take me to kindergarten.

762
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,180
Don't be afraid. I'll hold your hand.

763
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,010
Mom told us to hold hands.

764
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,460
Don't cry.

765
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,340
Is it good?

766
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,739
Yes.
