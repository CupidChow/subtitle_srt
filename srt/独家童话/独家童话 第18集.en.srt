I'm going to be a mother-in-law.

175
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,180
Your son is so fast.

176
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,180
Not just me.

177
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,970
It's

178
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,500
us.

179
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,980
You mean

180
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,580
Ling Chao and Xiao Tu are dating?

181
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,060
Really?

182
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,300
It's too…

183
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,420
Wait.

184
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,300
Why didn't I know?

185
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Tell me what happened between them.

186
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,420
These two...

187
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,820
Let me feed you. Open your mouth.

188
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,020
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

189
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,380
Isn't it a good thing?

190
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,780
Why didn't they tell me?

191
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,740
They must be afraid

192
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,100
that Xiao's father can't accept it.

193
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
So,

194
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,500
I asked Ling to turn everything down today.

195
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,140
It took him a lot of effort

196
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,340
to trick your husband to play cards.

197
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,140
I just want to leave them more space

198
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,400
to spend more time alone with each other.

199
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,460
Great.

200
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,580
Well, it won't last long.

201
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,140
Well…

202
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,540
It's not a long-term plan for him to play cards all the time.

203
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,380
What about tomorrow? What about the day after tomorrow and so on?

204
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,060
Right?

205
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,540

Let the four of us take this opportunity

208
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,220
to go on a trip

209
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,420
without children.

210
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,060
What do you think?

211
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,380
Sounds great.

212
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,700
It's a deal.

213
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,230
Didn't you go shopping with my mom?

214
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,260
Why aren't you wearing new clothes?

215
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,390
Yes, I am wearing it.

216
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,580
Isn't this the one you wore in the morning?

217
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,540
I'm warning you.

218
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,420
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

219
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,060
I think Godmother knows something.

220
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,420
So what?

221
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,420
We can't hide it forever.

222
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,060
Or do you just want to have a secret relationship with me,

223
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,390
so you can dump me after you get tired of me?

224
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,980
Can you stop

225
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,780
talking about me like I'm a jerk.

226
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,100
Anyway,

227
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,300
let's keep some distance

228
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,180
in front of our parents.

229
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,310
It's safer this way.

230
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,300
Fine,

231
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,090
but there's no one around now.

232
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,420
Okay.

233
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,180
What a coincidence.

234
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
You live in this neighborhood too?

235
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,580
Are you here to exercise?

236
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,060
Yes.

237
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,030
I've been living here for almost 20 years.

238
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,340
You even want to hide it from your neighbors?

239
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,660
Of course.

240
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,180
The neighbors are all my parents' colleagues.

241
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,380
Rumors spread faster among them than the broadband speed

242
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,420
Fine.

Help me check these cards.

247
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,330
I'm farsighted.

248
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,100
The words are too small. I can't see them clearly.

249

Xiao.

250
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,380
You two can't play together.

251

If you do this,

252
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,760
I’ll also need to ask for help.

Why are you looking at me?

259
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,500

A pair of Fives.

269

Were you insulting me with those two Straights?

270
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,460
No.

271
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,360
You must have calculated.

272
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,060
It's so obvious. There's no need to calculate.

273
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,650
So what if you're good at math?

274
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,300
Tell me.

275
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,180
Xiao Tu.

276
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,300
Don't fight. It's not about math.

277
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,380
It's a logic problem.

278

Were Wenhui and I

279
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,370
wrong?

280
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,460
