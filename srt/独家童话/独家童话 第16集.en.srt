Where are my parents?

They went for a checkup.

Why didn't you go?

9
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,580
Our department had a checkup last week.

you like Rabbit?

57
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,540
Yes.

Well.

Does Rabbit like you?

62
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,540
Right.

63
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,220
This is more important.

64
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,290
Probably.

65

Not yet.

68

When are you going to confess to her?

69
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,960

Mom.

73
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,980
Don't you think I'm not good enough for Xiao Tu?

74
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,380
Really?

75
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,410
It's normal.

76
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,260
Rabbit is so cute.

77
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,260
You only bully her.

78
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,620
Besides,

79
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,340
your personality is weird

80
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,540
and unlikeable.

81
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,830
I don't know who you take after.

82
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,279
The biggest regret

83
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,540
for me

84
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,410
is that I don't have a daughter.

85
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,019
So,

86
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,500
I always treat Rabbit as my daughter.

87
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,020
In the past, they were young,

88
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,740
so I didn't think about that.

89
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,820
But that day,

90
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,860
that boy came to our house for dinner.

91
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,810
It was Yin...

92
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,740
Yin Zihan.

93
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,740
Yes, that was him.

94
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,780
She brought a boy back.

95
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,740
It felt like I was losing her.

96
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,020
Also,

97
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,740
I met

98
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,620
Yin's mother

99
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,940
when I went to the parent-teacher conference for Rabbit.

100
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,460
She looked unreliable.

101
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,100
I can't imagine

102
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,820
Rabbit marrying into their family in the future.

103
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,420
Right.

104
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,700
Your mother is right.

105
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,260
If Rabbit really gets married,

106
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,260
she won't come to our house often.

107
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,610
I'll also feel quite lonely.

108
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,780
Ling Chao, let me tell you.

109
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,740
You can do anything you want.

110
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,860
Be thick-skinned

111
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,140
and thoughtful.

112
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,340
If you can't do it,

113
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,780
you can even cry and make a scene.

114
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,500
I don't care.

115
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,900
You must marry Rabbit.

116
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,630
I'll try my best.

117
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,300
Go back first.

118
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,580
If you need anything,

119
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,860
just let us know.

120
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,060
Okay.

121
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,390
Don't worry.

122
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,980
I can do it.

123
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,620
Can he really do it?

124
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:00,860
Hello.

125
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:01,930
Hello.

126
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,580
Yin Zihan.

127
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,660
What time is it now?

128
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,700
Don't you know I'm suffering from jet lag?

129
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,760
It's nine o'clock.

130
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,460
What's the matter?

131
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,020
Nothing.

132
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,060
Please thank your mother for me.

133
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,720

Ling Chao, are you crazy?

135
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,300
You bought so many things.

136
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,100
This is the special tea from Yunhai.

137
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,300
The local students said it's very good.

138
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,460
Okay.

139
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,300
Okay.

140
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,460
This is dried fruit.

141
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,120
It's a good snack while you're watching dramas.

142
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,780
Try it.

143
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,260
And this is the sweet potato.

144
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,060
I've been feeling cold

145
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,300
around my neck lately.

146
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,100
Let me find something to wrap it up.

147
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,860
This…

148
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,020
A scarf, right?

149
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,980
Let me find it for you.

150
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,820
A scarf.

151
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,880
-Is there any? -Sure, I must have one.

152
00:06:59,260 --> 00:06:59,860
This.

153
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,700
It was my first time knitting.

154
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,020
I saw my classmates knitting.

155
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,180
It doesn't look good.

156
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,780
Why did you knit?

157
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,740
It's tiring.

158
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,910
It's well knitted.

159
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,940
This is so fashionable.

160
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,020
Yes, it is.

161
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,100
The ones sold in the mall

162
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,340
are designed to be ripped

163
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,070
Yours is much better than that.

164
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,020
Put it on.

165
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,780
Who do your classmates

166
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,780
knit scarfs for?

167
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,540
Their boyfriends.

168
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,700
That means

169
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,580
there must a lot of girls in your class who are dating.

170
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,660
Yes, there are a few.

171
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,990
I'm not sure about that.

172
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,659
Is there any boy

173
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,820
interested in our Rabbit?

174
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,380
Mom.

175
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,260
Are you asking if I'm in a relationship?

176
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,180
Can't I ask?

177
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,940

Not mine.

696
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,860
Why didn't you dry your hair?

697
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,780
It's easy to catch a cold

698
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,740
in this season.

699
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,520
It's okay. I'm inside the room...

700
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,360
Don't move.

701
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:28,460
Itchy.

702
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:56,070
[Exclusive Epilogue]

703
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,580
Ling Chao.

704
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,860
I must talk to you.

705
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,980
What?

706
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,460
We have a big competition tomorrow.

707
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,740
It's not good to be so tired

708
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,630
the night before the competition.

709
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,700
Go to sleep.

710
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,060
We'll win first place

711
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,820
when we wake up.
