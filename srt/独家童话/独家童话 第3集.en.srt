Dinner is ready.

525
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,550
There's a package at the front door.

526
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,830
I don't know who sent it.

527
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,510
Go take a look.

528
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,350
Okay.

I couldn't wake you up.

Did you have that dream?

What are you thinking
