[Episode 10: You, the One from My Memory]

7
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,340
It's so cold outside today.

8
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,700
You two are so happy.

9
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,260
You know what?

10
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,490
Xu Linglong's mother

11
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,170
is really funny.

12
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,380
Her nephew has come back from abroad,

13
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,180
and she always takes him everywhere

14
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,340
to brag about him.

15
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,870
He played the violin last time, right?

16
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,340
Guess what he did this time?

17
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,140
What did he do?

18
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,600
He set up a stall in our neighborhood to write couplets.

19
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,920
It's surprising that she came up with this idea.

20
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,970
So funny.

21
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,620
It was not easy for that young man.

22
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,540
Take it as a warm gift

23
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,980
to the neighbors.

24
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,780
What kind of warm gift is it?

25
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,940
That young man had no choice.

26
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,340
Luckily,

27
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,000
we don't have such relatives.

28
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,130
Otherwise,

29
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,220
Xiao Tu

30
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,579
might be asked to perform

31
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:42,260
the show of breaking stones on her chest.

32
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,140
I can't imagine it.

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,500
Mom, I once learned taekwondo,

34
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,140
not acrobatics.

35
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,660
For the skills of taekwondo, you also

36
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,500
do the kicking and break bricks.

37
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,900
They are almost the same.

38
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,540
Can't you make an analogy?

39
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,660
Then according to what you said,

40
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,579
if I can speak,

41
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,640
am I able to perform a comic dialogue?

42
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,810
I haven't hit you for three days.

43
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,780
Do you feel like being hit now?

44
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,820
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

45
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,980
Where are you going?

46
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,860
During the winter vacation,

47
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,180
she's always missing.

48
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,600
And you, Xiao Haishan,

49
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,780
you're sitting here all day long

50
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,620
to watch your mobile phone.

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,500
Both the father and the daughter are troublesome.

52
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,740
Who else wants some couplets?

53
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,100
Me, me, me!

54
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,020
Ye Jun,

55
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,480
can you write a set of couplets for me as well?

56
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,420
Sure. What do you want me to write on them?

57
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,540
Write...

58
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,030
Chicken, duck, fish and rice.

59
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,620
Sleep until 10:30 a.m. every day.

60
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,940
The horizontal scroll, Happy New Year to Xiao Tu.

61
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,700
Xiao Tu, are you educated?

62
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,780
Who would write such a long sentence on a horizontal scroll?

63
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,620
Ye Jun didn't say anything about it.

64
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,150
It's none of your business.

65
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,079
I think you are quite free.

66
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,540
Don't tell me you didn't do your winter-vacation homework at all.

67
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,140
It's still early. The winter vacation has just begun.

68
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,579
Ling Chao, you're here.

69
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,220
This is my cousin.

70
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,220
We played together when we were kids.

71
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,900
Cousin.

72
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,460
This is Ling Chao.

73
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,140
Ling Chao has grown so tall.

74
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,260
Ling Chao,

75
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,660
what couplets do you want?

76
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,820
I'll ask my cousin to write them for you.

77
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,460
No need.

78
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,720
We don't lack couplets in our family.

79
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,020
That's different.

80
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,019
Ye Jun will write these couplets personally.

81
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:16,779
Ye Jun.

82
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,839
Just write these words for Ling Chao.

83
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,300
Steak, milk tea and crispy fried pork.

84
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,700
Have a Happy New Year.

85
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,340
I think it's you who want another set of couplets, huh?

86
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,140
No way.

87
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,420
My cousin is going to accompany me to

88
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,020
do homework and practice piano later.

89
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,140
He doesn't have time

90
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,980
to write such ridiculous things.

91
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,620
It's okay.

92
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,080
If Little Rabbit wants it,

93
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,550
I can write another set.

94
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,340
What?

95
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,820
Have you finished your winter-vacation homework?

96
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,130
Xiao Tu.

97
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,420
I didn't expect that you'd come to this stage.

98
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,540
You even want to copy my winter-vacation homework.

99
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,620
You think too highly of yourself.

100
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,500
Even if I need to copy someone else's homework, I won't copy yours.

101
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,410
I don't want to argue with you.

102
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,740
What a waste of time.

103
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,820
Don't go. Let me finish.

104
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,060
Well, I want you to come to my home so that we can

105
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,700
do winter-vacation homework together.

106
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,900
Have you forgotten that

107
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,660
we are not

108
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,580
good friends?

109
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,620
Don't try to please me.

110
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,020
I won't accept it.

111
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,420
Our relationship

112
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,750
is not very good indeed.

113
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,540
However,

114
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,100
I can't let this trivial matter

115
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,500
affect my relationship with Ye Jun.

116
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,540
Ye Jun will tutor you in your homework, won't he?

117
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,100
Our homework is the same anyway.

118
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,700
Come to my home and let's do homework together.

119
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,500
I see.

120
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,370
Ask Ling Chao to join us, too.

121
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,100
I guess he's also very eager to

122
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,700
communicate with my cousin.

123
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,220
But

124
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,540
Ling Chao usually likes to study alone.

125
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,900
You can't even do this little thing.

126
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,900
You still want me to make an appointment with my cousin for you?

127
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,700
I'm not a philanthropist.

128
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,260
If you want to make an appointment with my cousin, it's okay.

129
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,020
Just exchange Ling Chao for him.

130
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,780
Fine.

131
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,460
You're in charge of asking Ye Jun to come to my home.

132
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,190
I'll ask Ling Chao to come over.

133
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,850
Your house has been quite lively recently.

134
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,850
There are still guests at this hour.

135
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,380
Dear guest,

136
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,940
don't you know you should knock on the door before entering someone else's room?

137
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,300
I'm a guest?

138
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,780
Ask this door.

139
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,660
Have I ever knocked on the door for these ten years?

140
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,100
Are you having an English class?

141
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,020
I won't see it if you don't allow it.

142
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,460
What a petty guy.

143
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,180
Come to my home tomorrow to do homework.

144
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,659
I finished my homework long ago.

145
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,420
It's been only a few days since the winter vacation began.

146
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,260
Is that what a human can do?

147
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,060
Forget it.

148
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,659
Come and read a book.

149
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,540
It's also okay to stay there in a trance.

150
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,340
It'll be fine as long as you come.

151
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,110
What are you up to this time?

152
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,659
I...

153
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,740
No.

154
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,860
It's been so long since the winter vacation began.

155
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,740
It's time to study.

156
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,290
Then you should study hard.

157
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,220
I won't disturb you.

158
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,020
Don't.

159
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,140
Alright.

160
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,870
I have an appointment with Xu Linglong and Ye Jun.

161
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,980
Anyway, Ye Jun

162
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,580
needs to tutor Xu Linglong.

163
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,860
He can also tutor me.

164
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,700
You want to ask a science student who is about to graduate from college

165
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,780
and has been away from senior high school for so long

166
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,260
to teach you,

167
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,940
a liberal arts student who ranks last in the class?

168
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,020
Let's not talk about whether you can learn it or not.

169
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,820
Does Ye Jun know how to teach you?

170
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,540
Why can't he do that?

171

It's just a piece of cake

172
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,300
for Ye Jun to teach me.

173
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,180
I can only say that he's too young

174
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,610
and has never experienced

175
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,670
the torture from someone who only got 38 points in math.

176

Ye Jun is a nice guy.

Do you know what this phrase means?

Don't use it if you don't know its meaning.

194
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,700
Of course I know its meaning.

All you cared about was eating your own food.

Luckily, Ye Jun found that I didn't have chicken legs,

198
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,950
and he gave one to me specially.

Ye Jun is so considerate

and so gentle.

214
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,100
He gave the chicken leg to you,

because no one dared to compete with you for it.

216
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,900
He brought you the lollipops

217
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,980
because you kept staring

218

instead of taking the whole box away.

Even if what you said is true,

it can still prove that

He's also talented and has a good personality.

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,740
The fried chicken won't taste good after it gets cold.

Come on.

342

Stop pretending.

Yes.

Here's the thing.

413
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,530
I think the house we're living in now

00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,860
is a bit small.

Look. You don't have a separate study room.

416

I don't have a reception room, either.

417

or talk about business.

419
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,420
Besides, this is an old neighborhood.

420
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,460
There's also no garage.

421

and didn't discuss with me about anything.

I've grown up now, but you're still treating me like this.

Is something bothering you?

459
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,700
It's because of my husband and son.

460
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,420
My husband wants to move to a new house,

461
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,620
but my son disagrees.

462
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,340
My son got angry because of the disagreement.

463
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,540
Then your husband can move,

464

485
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,460
I'll go back and tell Ling Bo that

we won't move.

Listen to me.

490
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,230
This is really a good thing.

491
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,580
I'm truly happy for you.

492
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,620
Remember,

493
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,620

00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,740
Are you going to move to a new house?

511
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,540
Yes, that's what I plan to do.

512
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,620
Well,

513
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,260
Ling Chao isn't willing to do so, right?

514
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,500
I want to talk to him patiently again.

515
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:51,980
Godfather,

516
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,490
do you still remember

517
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,950
the computer you gave Ling Chao at that time?

518
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,860
He still keeps it now.

519
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,380
Actually, we all know

520
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,740
it's not that he doesn't want to discard that computer.

521
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,620
He just doesn't want to let go of the memories about you and him.

522
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,020
For several times,

523
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,660
I saw him secretly looking at the family photo.

524
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,580
Later, I realized that

525
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,660
he was used to holding back many of

526
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,050
his thoughts and emotions.

527
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,980
But he actually values family relationships very much.

528
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,380
For what you've said,

529
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,920
I know it all very well.

530
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,940
That's why I feel that

531
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,660
I've owed Ling Chao too much.

532
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,500
I want to make it up to him.

533
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,860
This time, we're going to move,

534
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,780
and it's for his own good actually.

535
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,860
But Godfather,

536
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,260
for Ling Chao,

537
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,650
your return

538
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,620
is the best thing.

539
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
Actually,

540
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,620
Ling Chao doesn't care whether the house is big or not.

541
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,940
What he wants

542
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,920
is that the whole family can be together.

543
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,100
It seems that

544
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,540
I didn't think this through indeed.

545
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,380
Rabbit.

546
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,020
Look.

547
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,140
I've specially designed a separate

548
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,860
study room for him in this new house.

549
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,540
He won't be disturbed when he studies

550
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,140
and does his homework there in the future.

551
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,000
Look here, too.

552
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,180
I asked someone

553
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,500
to make a separate

554
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,260
computer room for him specially.

555
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,920
Godfather,

556
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,140
this is the new house you bought?

557
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,780
Yes.

558
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,980
It's so big.

559
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,640
Let me tell you.

560
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,260
Ling Chao's bedroom

561
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,740
is as big as this living room.

562
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,350
There's also a swimming pool and a garden.

563
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,140
So nice.

564
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,340
But I

565
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,900
still don't want you to move elsewhere.

566
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,060
Don't worry.

567
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,140
I've thought about it.

568
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,500
I've specially reserved

569
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,820
a room for you in this new house.

570
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,980
It's right here.

571
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,620
After we really move to the new house,

572
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,420
you can come to visit us anytime.

573
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,900
Godfather,

574
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,340
why don't you talk to Ling Chao patiently again?

575
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,200
Or you can take him to the villa directly.

576
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,300
Then he might agree.

577
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:15,850
Okay.

578
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,020
I'll carefully discuss it

579
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,550
with your godmother again.

580
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,460
I'm the elder sister.

581
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,340
I never lie to little brothers.

582
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,220
If you don't believe me,

583
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,620
I'll wait for my godfather with you.

584
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,260
My doll and I will always be with you

585
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,300
and protect you.

586
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,780
Thank you, Sister.

587
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,210
Who is it?

588
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,460
Ling Chao.

589
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,020
Are you really going to move to a new house?

590
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,820
If you wake me up

591
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,060
at 6 a.m. again

592
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,290
next time,

593
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,580
I'd rather move elsewhere.

594
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,710
Then I won't wake you up so early again.

595
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,700
You...

596
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,670
How come you have no sense of humor at all?

597
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,780
I'm just kidding.

598
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,940
It has nothing to do with you.

599
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,700
I know that

600
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,500
you don't lack anything in your new house,

601
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,780
but you still need to take some things with you.

602
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,840
For this tea table,

603
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,210
we scrambled for candies here when we were kids,

604
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,700
which made you hurt your head.

605
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,030
You still have a scar on your forehead now.

606
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,900
And this cabinet.

607
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,900
We played hide-and-seek here when we were kids.

608
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,940
You hid inside.

609
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,420
In the middle of the game,

610
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,860
I was attracted by the sugar cakes

611
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,980
bought by my godmother.

612
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,820
Because of that, you hid inside for a long time,

613
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,280
and fell asleep in the end.

614
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,730
And this sofa.

615
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,500
When we were in junior high school,

616
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,940
we sat here and ate watermelon.

617
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,660
We insisted on having a competition of spitting watermelon seeds.

618
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,260
But we had to clean them by ourselves in the end.

619
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,820
Now that I think of it, we were quite childish.

620
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,420
And that little turtle.

621
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,220
You must take it with you.

622
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,460
Otherwise, it will starve to death.

623
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,580
Did you skip breakfast?

624
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,620
Why do you sound so weak when you talk?

625
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,980
At this time,

626
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,710
how could I have the mood to eat?

627
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,660
Porridge or deep-fried dough sticks?

628
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,660
Of course I'll eat Madam Zhang's soy milk with deep-fried dough sticks.

629
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,740
When these dough sticks were fried,

630
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,540
the temperature of the oil was just appropriate.

631
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,270
Both sides look golden yellow.

632
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,180
It tastes crispy outside but tender inside.

633
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,820
Take a sip of sweet soy milk while eating it.

634
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,180
It's chewy

635
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,870
[Nutritious Breakfast]

636
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,980
with different layers of taste.

637
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,500
When we eat steamed buns,

638
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,020
we should eat them with this dipping sauce.

639
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,140
It tastes sweet and sour.

640
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,140
It's also appetizing and helps to cleanse the palate.

641
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,010
Ling Chao.

642
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,220
There are so many delicious foods for breakfast.

643
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,550
Are you really willing to move elsewhere?

644
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,380
Hey!

645
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,340
I've told you so much.

646
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,420
Did you hear me?

647
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,760
Who said that I would move elsewhere?

648
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:21,950
Don't worry.

649
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,020
I won't leave.

650
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,260
Eat more.

651
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,810
Come on. Eat more. Just eat.

652
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,290
Eat more.

653
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,300
Eat more.

654
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,980
This is delicious.

655
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,740
It's very delicious.

656
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,940
This is also delicious.

657
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,820
This is yours, too.

658
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,880
They're all yours.

659
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,010
Eat. Just eat.

660
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,420
Where did Ling Chao

661
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,180
go so early in the morning?

662
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,980
He even didn't bring his mobile phone with him.

663
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,620
I wonder if he had breakfast.

664
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,960
Leave some for him.

665
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,300
Look at this bowl.

666
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,980
Chao refused to eat when he was a kid.

667
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,840
He even broke a corner of the bowl.

668
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,140
I didn't expect that he would use

669
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,060
this small broken bowl

670
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,380
for so many years.

671
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,540
Ling,

672
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,960
are we really going to move to a new house?

673
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,260
You're back.

674
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,820
Where did you go so early in the morning?

675
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,260
I bought some breakfast.

676
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,980
You went to buy the breakfast.

677
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,660
Let's eat together.

678
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,740
I'll fetch a bowl for you.

679
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,330
Okay.

680
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,740
Come on. Here.

681
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,980
Why did you get up so early today?

682
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,670
Put it in the middle.

683
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,860
Why did you think of buying deep-fried dough sticks today?

684
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,860
I just went out

685
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,140
and happened to see them, so...

686
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,940
Is it because I like eating them?

687
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,500
We won't move.

688
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,390
We're not going to move.

689
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,780
Come on. Let's eat.

690
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,420
Okay.

691
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,840
The books are all here.

692
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,900
See if there's any book you're looking for.

693
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,630
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

694
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,700
There are so many books about the major of Computer Science.

695
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,620
Are you going to apply for the major of Computer Science in the future?

696
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,900
I bought them because I was interested.

697
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,780
I think you are talented in this.

698
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,050
Why don't you consider

699
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,180
joining my company?

700
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,120
It's too early to say that now.

701
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,100
You're right.

702
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,540
I found it.

703
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,580
This is it.

704
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,260
Nothing.

705
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,440
I just think this is interesting.

706
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,300
What do you think

707
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,540
of Xiao Tu?

708
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,140
Xiao Tu.

709
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,860
She's quite special.

710
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,100
Does Ye Jun

711
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,340
also have such a bad taste that he has a crush on Xiao Tu?

712
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,340
Wait.

713
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,470
Why did I say "also"?

714
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:23,810
[Exclusive Epilogue]

715
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,240
Godfather.

716
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,220
When I watched this TV drama,

717
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,580
I saw that the heroine often

718
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,300
leaned her head on the shoulder of a boy.

719
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,660
I wanted to give it a try to see if it feels comfortable.

720
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,220
You're not okay.

721
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,060
You're too thin.

722
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,820
Your bones made me feel uncomfortable.
