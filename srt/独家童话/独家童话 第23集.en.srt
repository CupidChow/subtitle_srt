He's so handsome. Let's look at the next one.

00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,180
she offered something

to invite him here?

She is not a local.

376
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,860
I think she is probably thinking

377
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,420
if she can know a celebrity one day...

So Xiao Tu's boyfriend is him.

Who?

416
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,380
When we made the episode featuring Ye Jun,

417
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,940
I searched his company.

418
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,820
I have a deep impression of Ling Chao in his team.

419
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,540
He is handsome.

420
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,660
And he has been a straight A student since he was little.

421
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,940
He got many national scholarships

422
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,340
and is a computer genius.

423
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,780
Xiao Tu must have saved the galaxy in her previous life.

424
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,020
Oh my god.

425
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,620
Why were you so exaggerated today?

426
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,480
I think you scared my colleagues.

427
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,580
You mean my suit or the desserts?

428
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,700
So you know.

429
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,890
How did you know Yin Zihan

430
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,460
and I were together filming the program?

431
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,540
Yin Zihan told me.

432
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,630
He bought the desserts.

433
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,140
I came here after I met the investor.

434
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,460
It was actually credited to him.

435
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,590
That was indeed something he would do.

436
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,620
About your work,

437
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,490
you always talk to me casually.

438
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,060
You didn't tell me when you faced challenges.

439
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,320
It makes me feel

440
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,140
that I'm not a good boyfriend.

441
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,500
They didn't really bully me.

442
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,380
Didn't you tell me

443
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,540
it's normal to encounter difficulties?

444
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,820
So I told myself

445
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,980
these are precious experiences.

446
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,580
They will be useful in the future.

448
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,660
I'm not afraid of difficulties.

449
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,980
I'll keep going no matter what.

450
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,990
I regret saying those words to you all of a sudden.

451
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,010
Why?

452
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,640
I think you are more independent.

453
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,610
You are less dependent on me.

454
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,620
Who said that?

455
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,700
You are driving for me, right?

456
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,140
If something like this happens again,

457
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,480
you must tell me first.

458
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,940
I want to help you too.

459
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,330
I know.

460
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,100
Why do I feel like

461
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,740
I'm the heroine in idol dramas?

462
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,340
Alright, get some sleep.

463
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,180
You can have everything in your dream.

464
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,640
I'm really going to sleep.

465
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,460
Sleep.

466
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,020
Are you ready?

467
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,380
OK. Come on.

468
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,900
Slow down. Too fast.

469
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,980
You can't take it now?

470
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,300
Didn't you say I was too slow?

471
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,700
I thought you were slow because I was afraid it would be burnt.

472
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,180
Now you're too fast.

473
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,910
I'm afraid the oil will burn me.

474

Let me do it.

475
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,580
You said you would teach me, right?

476
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,660
It's enough that one of us can cook.

477

Isn't it too early to call me that now?

We've been married for three years.

Isn't it too late to regret it?

When did we get married?

518

You are not having a fever.

Why did you talk nonsense?

There's something you may not believe.

I might have lost my memories.

Qualified.

529
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,180
What about my work at the TV station?

It's good.

Yes.

He has no other intentions.

when Xiao Tu was just born,

she was only this little.
