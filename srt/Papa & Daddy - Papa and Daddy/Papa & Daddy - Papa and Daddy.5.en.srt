00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,583
Hello, fans.

2
00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:03,458
To celebrate Cooking with Jerry

3
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:06,625
hitting 500k subscribers.

4
00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:07,708
I'm happy to invite

5
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:08,542
my super good friend

6
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,292
to cook with me today.

7
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:12,250
Be prepared to scream
at the top of your lungs,

8
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,583
and welcome the well-known internet celebrity

9
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,333
Brian.

10
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:19,250
Dear fans, I'm here.

11
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:22,667
Do you know what we're doing today?

12
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:24,250
That's why I wore my apron.

13
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,208
But this outfit's a bit flirty.

14
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,083
Don’t flirt with me.

15
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,250
Wait.

16
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,708
Jerry, stop fooling around and cook.

17
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,583
Sorry, that was out of line.

18
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:36,125
It's because

19
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,958
his outfit is way too out of line.

20
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,958
I couldn't help it.

21
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,167
I wore this just for you, okay?

22
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:45,542
And your fans seem to like it.

23
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,583
Fine.

24
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,708
Then let's thank Brian

25
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,708
for this treat.

26
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,417
Can we start?

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,917
So what do I do?

28
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:56,958
First of all, these can't get wet today,

29
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,375
I just had them done.

30
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,750
Then why are you here today?

31
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:04,792
To be the pretty face.

32
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,083
Let's start.

33
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:16,958
Let's cut the bell peppers first.

34
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,083
Bell peppers.

35
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:21,958
Save these first,

36
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,083
I'll be using them later.

37
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,417
Let's cut the next one now.

38
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:28,417
What the heck are you doing?

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
(Papa & Daddy EP5. Coming Out)

40
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:55,500
Damn it.

41
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,208
After this episode,

42
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,542
I'm doomed.

43
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:58,792
Come on, you didn't take anything off.

44
00:01:58,917 --> 00:01:59,875
I was the one who sacrificed.

45
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,542
You were just showing your true colors.

46
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,333
Right, true colors.

47
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,292
Go, go, answer it.

48
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:12,917
Hurry.

49
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:19,792
Mom.

50
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,625
Jerry Pan.

51
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,167
The one on your broadcast just now,

52
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:25,125
was that your college classmate?

53
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,792
Yes.

54
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:27,458
What happened to him?

55
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,000
You can't tell if he's a guy or a girl now.

56
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,083
Don't criticize him, okay?

57
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,542
He's very popular.

58
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:34,792
Why did you call?

59
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,333
To congratulate you.

60
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,083
You have over 500k fans.

61
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,458
That's really awesome.

62
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,333
How much do you make?

63
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,792
Decent.

64
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:48,000
If I get paid for advertisements,

65
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,375
then I can get comission.

66
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:50,625
Not bad.

67
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,375
How long do you think this can last?

68
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:54,583
How would I know?

69
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,333
All I can do is think about good content.

70
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,500
Why do you care so much?

71
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,833
Don't be impatient.

72
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,417
Mom wants to tell you

73
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,042
now that you have stable income,

74
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,917
you can start going on blind dates.

75
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,875
Blind date?

76
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,708
Mom, I don't have time for relationships.

77
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,500
Blind dates are the fastest.

78
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,875
Everyone has the same goal.

79
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,167
If you see a fit, you get married.

80
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,500
I'm very busy every day.

81
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,333
My schedule's full for the next 3 months.

82
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,917
No more excuses.

83
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,250
You go on a blind date.

84
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,000
I've paid already.

85
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,958
Mom's busy, I don't have time
to go with you.

86
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,625
Dress nice.

87
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,917
Hurry up and go.

88
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:37,542
Bye.

89
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,458
How about I pretend to be your girlfriend,

90
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,042
and scare off the ladies?

91
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:46,875
What do you think?

92
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:48,583
Idiot.

93
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:57,708
Mr. Pan,

94
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:58,958
I follow your lives

95
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,083
and learn to cook.

96
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,500
Wow, you're even more handsome in person.

97
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:04,708
Thank you.

98
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,542
But there's an episode,

99
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:07,750
the one with spicy stir-fried squids.

100
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:09,625
If you stir-fry Sichuan pepper first,

101
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,792
the taste and fragrance
would be even better.

102
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,750
And bitter gourd.

103
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,958
The one with bitter gourd fried salted eggs.

104
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,083
Bitter gourd has to be blanched first
to wash off the bitterness.

105
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,667
My cooking's superb.

106
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,083
Just ask my daughter.

107
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,583
What are you so shy about?

108
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,708
Why do you still need to eat,
with something so delicious right in front of you?

109
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,125
If I were younger,

110
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,667
I'd go after him myself.

111
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:33,333
Mrs. Huang

112
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,042
please have some tea.

113
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:36,333
Thank you.

114
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:41,667
Hello, I'm Pan Jerry.

115
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,042
Jerry Pan.

116
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,958
I'm a YouTuber.

117
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:48,333
What's your occupation?

118
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,250
I'm in second year graduate school,

119
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,625
studying people's behavior patterns

120
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,833
before entering marriage.

121
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,458
I'm preparing for my thesis.

122
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:56,750
No wonder.

123
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,125
You don't look like you're on a blind date.

124
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,917
You don’t seem you need blind dates, either.

125
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,792
Usually there's only one possibility:

126
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:04,875
forced by family.

127
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:05,708
Correct.

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,917
You're amazing

129
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,000
for guessing it correctly.

130
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,500
Why are you so obedient?

131
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,042
I'm the eldest son in the family,

132
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,208
my dad's the only son.

133
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,292
My Nom's Chinese Zodiac's monkey,

134
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,333
so she's anxious all the time,

135
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,333
pushing me to go on blind dates.

136
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,500
You're a Capricorn, right?

137
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,375
How'd you know?

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,583
That's too cool.

139
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,458
It's like the daughter went with the mom
to see her idol.

140
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,708
That mom's crazy.

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,292
She even gave me a cookbook.

142
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,667
So funny.

143
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,250
Looks like you enjoyed the process.

144
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:39,958
Very interesting.

145
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:42,417
And this girl.

146
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:44,958
Look.

147
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:46,167
Pretty cool, right?

148
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:48,292
She's very smart.

149
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,417
We only talked for a bit,

150
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:50,958
and she got my zodiac sign right.

151
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,250
How many more of these,

152
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,125
do you need to go?

153
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:57,833
Let me see.

154
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,417
There are a few more next week.

155
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,167
Don't you think it's a waste of time?

156
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,708
To go pick up Kai from school today,

157
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,208
I had to postpone two meetings.

158
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:12,167
Sorry.

159
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,583
It's not like I want to.

160
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,750
You know my mom.

161
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,625
I don't.

162
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:18,958
I only know that you're a grown man,

163
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,417
who can make your own decisions.

164
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,000
Maybe you can't understand.

165
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,375
But in my mom's eyes I'll always be a child.

166
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:29,542
You allowed her to make the decision for you.

167
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,208
Why don't you just refuse?

168
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,333
You mean why don't I just come out?

169
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,375
Sorry,

170
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,333
I'm not like you.

171
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,417
You can do whatever you want.

172
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:37,750
Your family supports you unconditionally.

173
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:39,958
Sorry, baby.

174
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,625
I didn't mean that.

175
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,750
But I did.

176
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,083
I'm going to sleep with Kai.

177
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:47,917
Baby.

178
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,042
Baby.

179
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:51,708
Baby.

180
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:20,875
Hey, mom.

181
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,250
Where are you?

182
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,042
Shopping

183
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:24,708
for the live later.

184
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,417
The lady at the agency told me

185
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,333
Miss Huang's mom likes you a lot.

186
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,167
Did you contact her?

187
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:33,625
Miss Huang?

188
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:35,917
She's too quiet.

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,375
Her mom and I have more to talk about.

190
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,875
Do you mind me

191
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,208
dating someone your age?

192
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:43,583
Don't joke.

193
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,792
What about the other one?

194
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,708
I heard she's the top in her class.

195
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,167
Should be pretty good.

196
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,625
She's not interested in me.

197
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:57,292
Mr. Pan.

198
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,167
It's me,

199
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:02,542
the one from that café, with my mom.

200
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:04,875
Miss Huang.

201
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,458
It's nice to finally hear your voice.

202
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,458
Actually it's my mom,

203
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,583
she's been waiting for you to contact us.

204
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:16,417
I'm a bit busy lately.

205
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:17,167
Sorry.

206
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:18,750
Papa.

207
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,292
Kai's dad, you're so late today.

208
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,000
His schoolbag.

209
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:25,875
Okay, thank you.

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,708
Bye.

211
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,333
He's your son?

212
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,625
Miss Huang.

213
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,083
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

214
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,167
I have my difficulties.

215
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,792
I hope that you won't tell your mom.

216
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,333
Okay, I won't.

217
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,958
But it's better we don't keep in touch.

218
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:44,083
I know, I'm sorry.

219
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,333
When you go on blind dates in the future,

220
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,875
you should be honest.

221
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:05,583
You hungry?

222
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:13,792
Still mad?

223
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,333
You're the one who's still mad.

224
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,375
Hubby.

225
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,583
I'm sorry.

226
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,667
I'm too much of a coward.

227
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,667
It ends up hurting you,

228
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,958
and the girls looking for a partner.

229
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:50,625
What happened?

230
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,333
When I picked up Kai from school today,

231
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,917
I ran into Miss Huang.

232
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,500
She looked so sad.

233
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:02,917
As if we’ve been dating for a long time,

234
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,125
and I was caught cheating.

235
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,083
Then it seems that

236
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,875
she really likes you.

237
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:15,625
What do you plan to do next?

238
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,167
There's another one tomorrow.

239
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,875
I don't want to stand her up.

240
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,458
But I want to tell her in person

241
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,833
the truth.

242
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,292
And I won't go on any more blind dates after.

243
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,417
I don't want to deceive anyone anymore.

244
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,917
Why don't I go with you tomorrow?

245
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,708
If they see us so loving,

246
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,292
they'll understand.

247
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,417
But what about your mom?

248
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,208
I don't know.

249
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:06,000
It's ok.

250
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,917
Baby steps.

251
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,583
Thank you.

252
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,250
Miss Chen, sorry.

253
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,792
There's some stuff

254
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,000
I need to tell you in person.

255
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,250
My mom arranged this blind date.

256
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,250
But

257
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:33,167
I like boys.

258
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:36,708
In particular, him.

259
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,167
We've been together for 6 years.

260
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,500
Then why did you agree to the blind date?

261
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,250
Really sorry

262
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,583
for wasting your time.

263
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,292
I'm not brave enough.

264
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,458
Miss Chen.

265
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,417
We'll pay for all the expenses today.

266
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,167
Sorry for letting you make the trip.

267
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,000
It's okay, it wasn't much.

268
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,125
Please, we really want to make it up.

269
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,458
It's nothing.

270
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,083
Not like I was cheated of money or sex.

271
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,333
It's not that serious.

272
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,042
Or,

273
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:14,083
what type of boys do you like?

274
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,000
We can help introduce.

275
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:15,667
Yes.

276
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:20,125
I know a few that are quite good.

277
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:21,500
It's ok.

278
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:22,833
Anyone you two think are good

279
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,333
are probably gay, too.

280
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:27,000
Jerry Pan.

281
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,917
After so many blind dates

282
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,333
with no results.

283
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:34,458
I thought

284
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:37,000
you were too shy to get along with the girls.

285
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,417
But this is the truth?

286
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:42,292
Mrs. Pan.

287
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:43,250
Don't talk.

288
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:46,292
You lied to me with him.

289
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:48,833
Sorry.

290
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,292
Didn't you have a girlfriend in high school?

291
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:00,583
That was a cover.

292
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,917
I found out that I like boys

293
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:04,875
in middle school.

294
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,500
You hid it for that long?

295
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,125
How?

296
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:22,750
You,

297
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,208
your sister.

298
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,167
It's all my fault

299
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:28,833
for making you gay.

300
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,667
It's my fault to make you sick.

301
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,583
It has nothing to do with you.

302
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,125
Gayness isn't sickness.

303
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,083
Taiwan already legalized same-sex marriage.

304
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:42,708
I don't care.

305
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,750
There must be a way to change.

306
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:45,208
Go.

307
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,917
I'll take you to see psychiatrists.

308
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:48,792
Can you calm down?

309
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,083
This is exactly why

310
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,583
I didn't tell you.

311
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,375
Then you should have lied until the end.

312
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,042
You should be like a normal person,

313
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,333
get married and have children,
start a family and work.

314
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,125
How can I

315
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,458
explain this to your dad?

316
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,250
Explain what?

317
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,333
What am I doing wrong?

318
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,333
I'm very happy now.

319
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,542
There's someone by my side.

320
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:15,000
Isn't this what you want?

321
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,625
You're too selfish.

322
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,958
I won't get in the middle anymore.

323
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,458
You and Mian won’t get my approval.

324
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:44,583
Papa, don't cry.

325
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:08,208
Thank you, Kai.

326
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,750
Daddy will take you to school today, okay?

327
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,250
Okay.

328
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,000
I'll take him to school.

329
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:53,833
Why do you act like
you're going through a break-up?

330
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,208
I'll deal with ,om.

331
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:56,750
Remember when

332
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,542
she caught me making out
with my girlfriend?

333
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,958
She said all that mean stuff.

334
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,458
But we're all good now.

335
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,333
She warned me not to find others, too.

336
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,958
That's because she gave up on me.

337
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,917
So you won’t be disappointed

338
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,708
if you have nothing to look forward to.

339
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,667
I told you to come out a long time ago.

340
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:16,167
But you just kept on dragging it out.

341
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,458
It's because you didn't see mom's face.

342
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,625
It's like she wished I was never born.

343
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,583
She's good with emotional blackmails.

344
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,375
Sis and I have seen through it long ago.

345
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:26,625
You're the only one who still falls for it,

346
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,417
and not tired of it.

347
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:29,875
Fang knows?

348
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,000
Of course.

349
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,458
Mom called us right away,

350
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,750
and asked if we knew.

351
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:34,500
You know,

352
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,833
sister was in a meeting.

353
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,458
Mom's voice was so loud,

354
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,250
the supervisor thought a family member died.

355
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:41,917
It might as well.

356
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:44,125
It's not that bad.

357
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,917
Think about it.

358
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,792
Now you can be yourself.

359
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,208
I guess.

360
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,417
Not like it could get any worse.

361
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,542
Or do you want to talk with dad?

362
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:00,417
No.

363
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:02,542
I'm warning you.

364
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,625
Don't let dad know.

365
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,292
I'm not joking.

366
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,125
Fine…

367
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,417
This way, this way.

368
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,708
Is it?

369
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:19,500
Where's the octopus?

370
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,292
Octopus.

371
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,500
Let me see.

372
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,458
- Here?
- Yes.

373
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,125
- This is its tail.
- Its tail.

374
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:30,375
Your mom.

375
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:30,958
My mom?

376
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:31,625
Yes.

377
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:39,708
Mom?

378
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,500
Jerry Pan.

379
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,375
Why don't you answer your phone?

380
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,708
It's charging.

381
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,583
Tell Mian to take Kai out right now.

382
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,000
Your dad and I just attended
a wedding in Taipei.

383
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,208
He says he wants to go see you.

384
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,792
My parents are coming over,

385
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:57,833
can you take Kai out?

386
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:58,750
Just for two hours.

387
00:19:58,875 --> 00:19:59,458
Now?

388
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,792
- Kai, let's stop playing, okay?
- No.

389
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,375
I want to play puzzle.

390
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,375
Daddy take you out for ice cream.

391
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,750
Come on.

392
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,667
No.

393
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,167
He had a stomachache last night

394
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,417
from eating too much ice cream lately.

395
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,833
- I want to play puzzles.
- I'll help him clean up.

396
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:13,500
Kai.

397
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:15,792
How about we go to the park

398
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,375
and play on the slide?

399
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,250
No.

400
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:20,500
Please.

401
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,708
- No.
- Just for a little bit.

402
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,333
- No.
- I'm sorry.

403
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,667
- Papa suddenly has something urgent.
- No.

404
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:26,000
Please.

405
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,500
- Come, daddy will help you change.
- No.

406
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,000
We'll be back soon.

407
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:29,917
No.

408
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:33,417
We'll change first, okay?

409
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,000
Let's go out.

410
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:35,917
We'll be back soon.

411
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:37,000
- Please.
- No.

412
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,208
I'll help you change, okay?

413
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,208
No.

414
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,458
Hubby, sorry.

415
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,333
It's not your fault.

416
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,333
Come on.

417
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,333
Careful with your hand.

418
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,917
Dad, mom, why are you here?

419
00:20:58,042 --> 00:20:59,333
This is my friend,

420
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,333
they were just leaving.

421
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:01,792
Your friend?

422
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,417
Come on in.

423
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,667
I'd like to meet them, too.

424
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,000
It's okay.

425
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:07,583
I'm running late.

426
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:08,583
Kai.

427
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,750
No need to go out.

428
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,750
Dad, mom,

429
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,833
you should have told me first.

430
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:34,792
I haven't had time to clean up.

431
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,083
We're family.

432
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,625
No need for that, sit.

433
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:45,833
Dad.

434
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,292
He's Jerry's...

435
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,500
- Roommate.
- Colleague.

436
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,042
Right.

437
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,583
They were roommates.

438
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:57,208
I thought you said he moved out last month.

439
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:58,542
Yes.

440
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,042
He moved out.

441
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:01,417
We're just colleagues now.

442
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:05,042
Just pure colleagues.

443
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,500
Mr. Pan, hello.

444
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,333
I'm Damian.

445
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:40,583
Something…

446
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,292
as a greeting.

447
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,458
Thank you for

448
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,542
taking care of Jerry in the past few years.

449
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,583
I should have came sooner.

450
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,208
I just saw you on TV

451
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,208
at the gay parade.

452
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:06,250
Was that your brother beside you?

453
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,042
We're on TV?

454
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,042
Why was he holding a boy's hand?

455
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,167
Don't ask me.

456
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,292
It'd be better coming from him.

457
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:16,167
I'm hanging up.

458
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,542
It's nothing expensive.

459
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:30,167
But it's the same one as the one

460
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:34,542
I gave Jerry when he graduated University.

461
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,292
The exact same.

462
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,667
Although I can't understand your

463
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:44,792
relationshi,

464
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,625
but Mr. Pan watches the news.

465
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,792
I know that the world now

466
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,708
is quite different from the one we knew.

467
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:00,708
Thank you.

468
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:02,917
Mr. Pan.

469
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,042
Dad, sorry.

470
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:18,542
Dad, can you really accept it?

471
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:24,458
Even if I don't, nothing changes.

472
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:25,583
So,

473
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:27,750
I choose to accept.

474
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,958
Dad.

475
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,208
When I knew he was gay,

476
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,167
I was so stressed.

477
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,958
I couldn't sleep at all.

478
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,917
I had insomnia every day.

479
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:42,583
You knew?

480
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:45,625
I was having a hard time holding it in.

481
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:04,875
What's your name?

482
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,750
Kai.

483
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,083
Kai.

484
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,875
Mommy,

485
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,708
this is our grandson.

486
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:14,958
Kai.

487
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,083
Grandpa hug.

488
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:24,875
Look.

489
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,875
Kai.
