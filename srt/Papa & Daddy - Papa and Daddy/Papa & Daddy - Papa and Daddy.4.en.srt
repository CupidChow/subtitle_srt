00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,417
Hello to all Jerry's fans.

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:04,167
Why is it that

3
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:06,125
calling others' fans feel normal,

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,000
but calling mine feels weird?

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,208
Nevermind.

6
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,042
I'll cut the chit chat.

7
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:14,875
Welcome to Cooking with Jerry.

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,792
Don't you think these look delicious?

9
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:21,167
I'm drooling myself.

10
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,125
Okay, today we're at Verso,

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,167
a well-known restaurant in Eastern District.

12
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,583
I invited Auntie Celine.

13
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,125
What wonderful dishes is she going to bring

14
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,583
to their upcoming second location?

15
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:32,875
Let's see.

16
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,500
I'm not Auntie Celine.

17
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,042
I'm Sis Celine.

18
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:38,000
Awkward.

19
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,875
Welcome to our upcoming second restaurant

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,083
The feature is

21
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,042
there's no fixed menu.

22
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:47,042
All our dishes are focused on spices.

23
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:50,625
This is curry series.

24
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:51,833
- Curry series.
- Yes.

25
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,583
This is turmeric series.

26
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,125
Turmeric series over here.

27
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,333
This is the flower series.

28
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,000
Flower series.

29
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,000
Use spices to decide your menu.

30
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,083
Give your taste buds a whole new experience.

31
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,333
Wow, new expectations.

32
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,208
Then I can't call you Auntie Celine.

33
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,417
What should I call you?

34
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:13,625
Spice girl?

35
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:15,125
You mean…

36
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:27,208
That's so dumb,

37
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,167
but I think that's good.

38
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:29,458
Look how many viewers there are.

39
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:30,042
Okay.

40
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:31,750
- I think...
- Who made this decision?

41
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,542
Why didn't you tell me?

42
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:34,917
You do know.

43
00:01:35,042 --> 00:01:35,750
I told you yesterday…

44
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,042
Do you know how much extra cost

45
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,083
means not having a fixed menu?

46
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,083
Every dish will be improvised.

47
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,750
It's difficult to guarantee the quality.

48
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,000
What if you ruin our brand?

49
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:47,083
That depends on how much you trust me.

50
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,292
It’s nothing about trust.
It's all about quality control.

51
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:53,833
I want every single dish

52
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,708
to be well thought out.

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,750
I don't want any accidents.

54
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,083
What do you mean?

55
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,333
You think I do?

56
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:03,208
Compared to me,

57
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,083
you're not cautious at all.

58
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,125
I won't

59
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:09,708
let this idea hold.

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,500
(Papa & Daddy EP4. Aunt Mommy)

61
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:47,667
Don't be like this.

62
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,333
She has Verso's interest in mind.

63
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:53,167
You don't know her.

64
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,917
This is the way she is.

65
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:56,042
Just does whatever she wants,

66
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:57,875
totally disregarding the feelings of others.

67
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,167
Did you know?

68
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,083
When she was in the third grade,

69
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,125
she locked me out,
just to fight with my dad.

70
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,625
I ended up getting pneumonia.

71
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,083
I was in bed for a full month.

72
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:09,833
Oh, and

73
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:12,250
she

74
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,500
she really liked the Miracle Mushroom on TV.

75
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,792
She stole mom's lipstick

76
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:20,958
and drew two big red circles

77
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,667
on my cheeks.

78
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,000
I got allergies.

79
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,458
The worst was,

80
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,167
in the States, she wanted to go on a date.

81
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:33,542
She left me at school.

82
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,375
My mom was so worried
she almost called the cops.

83
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,125
How unbelievable?

84
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,833
Hi, Kai's dad.

85
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,792
- Hi.
- Kai.

86
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:45,375
Kai.

87
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,292
Get in the car.

88
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's go.

89
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:48,667
Bye.

90
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,417
- Thank you, teacher.
- Bye.

91
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,625
Okay, come in.

92
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:52,750
Sit still.

93
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,417
Open your legs wide.

94
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:56,458
Kai, let me tell you.

95
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,708
Daddy's in a bad mood today.

96
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:58,917
Let's go have ice cream.

97
00:03:59,250 --> 00:03:59,833
Okay.

98
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,333
Okay, let's go have ice cream.

99
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,083
Okay.

100
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,042
High five.

101
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:06,750
Let's go.

102
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:08,917
Let's go.

103
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,458
Ice cream.

104
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:14,500
Thank you.

105
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,833
Kai, let's go have ice cream.

106
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,750
You sit first.

107
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:25,208
You have a bite first.

108
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:27,042
Thank you.

109
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,333
Daddy wants to have a bite, okay?

110
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:31,667
You have a bite.

111
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,583
It fell?

112
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:42,250
- It’s okay, let me.
- Sorry.

113
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,042
Sorry.

114
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,042
Hubby, go buy another one.

115
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,208
Okay, buy another one.

116
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,083
Go buy another one.

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,708
It fell.

118
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,125
- What should we do?
- Be careful with your hands.

119
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,833
Kai, you guys are here, too?

120
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,792
- Hi, Kai's Dad.
- Hi, Yang's Mom.

121
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:58,833
Kai's classmate?

122
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,625
Yes.

123
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,458
My treat then.

124
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,833
Thank you, and you are?

125
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,375
I'm Kai's daddy.

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,750
Daddy.

127
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,083
I know Kai's dad.

128
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:13,333
Daddy.

129
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,208
Uh…

130
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,417
Here you go.

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,375
I want chocolate.

132
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,667
Kai, we're leaving.

133
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:26,417
Yang's mom, bye.

134
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,292
- Kai, let's go.
- Okay.

135
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,292
- Bye, Yang.
- Bye.

136
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,792
I have Papa and Daddy.

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,083
What are you hiding?

138
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,000
Who are you chatting with?

139
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,625
What? I'm shopping online.
Didn't want you to yell at me.

140
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,458
Liar.

141
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:55,542
It's true.

142
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:57,875
Wait.

143
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:58,958
What?

144
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,250
So? You feeling better?

145
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,292
Really?

146
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,542
Did you know about it?

147
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:09,875
Kai's dad.

148
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,500
- Come, be careful.
- Okay.

149
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,875
- Bye.
- Let’s go home.

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,458
Kai's cad, wait a minute.

151
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,667
The gentleman at the ice cream shop last time.

152
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,917
He's Kai's godfather?

153
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,083
Yang's mom, you won't stop Yang
from playing with Kai

154
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,792
because of that, would you?

155
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:25,000
You're so pretty,
generous and understanding.

156
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh, not that.

157
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:26,875
It's because

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,833
Yang kept on asking me

159
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,875
what's the difference
between Papa and Daddy?

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,042
I could't answer.

161
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,833
Then the two of them

162
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,042
almost got into a fight today at school.

163
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,542
So what's the relationship between you two?

164
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,333
Jerry, Kai.

165
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,875
Class dismissed.

166
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,250
We're going home. Bye.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,125
So beautiful.

168
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,625
His wife is so beautiful.

169
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,000
We misunderstood them.

170
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:05,792
What?

171
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,583
I can't believe it.

172
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,833
I never knew you were so romantic,

173
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,750
booked such a beautiful restaurant,

174
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,667
to surprise me.

175
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,792
I'm so happy.

176
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,750
I have to show it occasionally.

177
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,208
Happy 6th Anniversary.

178
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:38,958
Happy 6th Anniversary.

179
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,125
So that's what you were doing

180
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,792
that night.

181
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,417
Looking forward to the future.

182
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,583
Cheers.

183
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,333
Fine dining is different.

184
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,708
They fill up ten times faster than in Verso.

185
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,833
Cheers.

186
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,292
Kai.

187
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,667
Papa said you were in a bad mood today, right?

188
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:40,458
Yeah.

189
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:42,750
No matter what it is,

190
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,625
you can tell auntie.

191
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,875
Anything you find dirty, ugly,

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,333
very happy about,

193
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,000
or unhappy about,

194
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,875
or anything

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
you're afraid to let Papa or Daddy know,

196
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,667
you can tell auntie.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,292
Auntie has a small mic here.

198
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,875
You can save all your little secrets

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
in here with auntie.

200
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:09,542
How does that sound?

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,417
Why do other kids

202
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,833
have daddy and mommy?

203
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,750
Kai has two dads, and that's great, too.

204
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,625
Why do I have two dads?

205
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,875
Because kids with two dads

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,375
are the happiest.

207
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,500
I'm here to clear your plates.

208
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,042
She wouldn't let Kai drink, would she?

209
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,125
Or have raw fish?

210
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:42,708
Why doesn't she return my calls?

211
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:48,000
Can you only love me tonight?

212
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,542
You're jealous of your son?

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,667
Yes, I'm jealous of the whole world today.

214
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,000
You're only allowed to see me.

215
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,333
I love you the most.

216
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,292
Here's your dessert.

217
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,333
You booked a room?

218
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:37,083
Need to make good use of the babysitter.

219
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:41,917
Let's go.

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,667
Why are you not tired at all?

221
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:17,375
Good morning.

222
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,917
- Morning.
- The kids are inside already.

223
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,625
Hi, morning.

224
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,917
You're so beautiful.

225
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:25,417
Thank you.

226
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,125
Are you in the fashion industry?

227
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:27,542
No.

228
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,667
No wonder your kid's so stylish.

229
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,417
You fly a lot?

230
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,250
No.

231
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,375
I've never seen you.

232
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,417
She has a good husband.

233
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:38,333
Willing to pick up the kid from school.

234
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,083
You're so lucky to marry such a good man.

235
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:40,583
I know.

236
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,375
And you kept your body
in such a good shape.

237
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,083
It's ok.

238
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:43,667
I'm serious.

239
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,708
You're so pretty, my goodness.

240
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,000
Goddess.

241
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,250
This is my best friend today, Yang.

242
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,333
Hello, Kai's mommy.

243
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,917
Kai, Yang, come on in.

244
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,083
Come over, come on in.

245
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,667
The quality is so good.

246
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll be going now. Bye.

247
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,042
She's so beautiful,
probably a model, right?

248
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,167
For sure.

249
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,417
- Daddy.
- Kai.

250
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:18,417
We're back.

251
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:19,542
Come here.

252
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:20,708
Let's go.

253
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,000
You're back.

254
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,875
Thanks, sis,

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,375
to let us spend our anniversary

256
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,917
without worrying about anything.

257
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:31,000
Thank you for lending me Kai for a day.

258
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,750
We also had a lot of fun.

259
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,625
Did you do something that you shouldn't?

260
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,542
I just saw a funny cartoon,

261
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,083
so I watched it with Kai.

262
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,292
Should be okay to watch it once in a while?

263
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:45,625
Of course it matters.

264
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,833
Sis, Damian and I agreed

265
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,417
not to let Kai watch TV
at such a young age.

266
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,125
I think I've told you?

267
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,333
Can you care about others

268
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,292
just for once?

269
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,917
Is it so difficult to respect others?

270
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,167
First the restaurant and now Kai,
it's the same.

271
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,708
You can't even say thank you.

272
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,000
Jerry deserves my love more than you.

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,208
And let me tell you,

274
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,125
I'm sorry for letting Kai watch cartoons,

275
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:16,750
but I've worked hard for that restaurant.

276
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,083
I'll stick to my ideas.

277
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,208
Can't even say thank you.

278
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:45,042
Kai, what are you drawing?

279
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,125
Kai.

280
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,167
Head can put things.

281
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,000
Head has a rope.

282
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,625
The head can have a rope hanging out.

283
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:04,000
So cool.

284
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,125
Look, the rope sticks out from here.

285
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,000
Do you want to draw eyes?

286
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't want to go to school.

287
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,125
Come on.

288
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,000
Kai, what's the matter?

289
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,958
I don't want to go to school.

290
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,167
Batman is calling out to Kai.

291
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:36,000
Over.

292
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,000
You can't see me.

293
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,375
Kai, do you know that

294
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,000
we have a very important task today?

295
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,208
We need to go to school
to find the Philosopher's Stone.

296
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:50,458
I don't want to.

297
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,792
If you don't,

298
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:55,875
Batman will be sad.

299
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,333
I want auntie.

300
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,000
Auntie?

301
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,125
Kai.

302
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,542
Let's go to school.

303
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:14,542
Okay?

304
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,125
No, I want auntie.

305
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:21,042
Hey, it's me.

306
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,208
I'm not calling you about the restaurant.

307
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,542
I want to ask you

308
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:27,792
what happened

309
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,208
when you took Kai to school?

310
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,708
He doesn't want to go to school today.

311
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He wants you.

312
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:39,208
Is Auntie taking me to school?

313
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:43,833
What happened

314
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,583
is what I told you over the phone.

315
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,833
Basically those gossip mothers

316
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,750
thought I was Kai's mother.

317
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,625
So they praised me one after another.

318
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:56,958
I think

319
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,417
after he arrived at school,

320
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:01,042
his friends probably asked him about me.

321
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:03,667
This means that

322
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,000
now in everyone's eyes,

323
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,917
he has a Mom.

324
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,542
And because of that

325
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,250
everyone's more willing to play with him.

326
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,083
He wants you to continue to take him

327
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,750
to keep it up.

328
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,833
That sounds right.

329
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,208
Teacher, I'm Kai's dad.

330
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,250
Yes.

331
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,125
Before we enrolled

332
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,000
we discussed this

333
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,042
Yes, that's right.

334
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,917
Could you please help

335
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:46,333
let everyone know?

336
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,000
Okay, thank you.

337
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,625
I'll tell him.

338
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,083
Ok, please, thank you.

339
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,458
Kai.

340
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,792
Although you don't have a mother,

341
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:17,375
Papa and Daddy

342
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,417
love you very much.

343
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,625
You're not girls.

344
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,583
That's right.

345
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,667
But we take care of you

346
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:30,000
the same way moms do.

347
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,208
There's also me.

348
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,250
Auntie takes care of Kai as well, right?

349
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,417
You're a girl, but you're not mom.

350
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,917
The point is

351
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,833
we're always by your side.

352
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,833
It doesn't matter what you call us.

353
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,417
Kai.

354
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,375
You are no different

355
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,042
from the other kids.

356
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,083
I have two dads, no one else does.

357
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,250
Hi, Kai's dads.

358
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:29,875
Good morning.

359
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,792
- Morning.
- Sorry.

360
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,917
Thank you for telling me about it.

361
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,750
I'll find a moment to tell the classmates,

362
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,333
and communicate with the parents.

363
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,583
Thank you, teacher.

364
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,667
Children are like blank slates.

365
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:44,250
It's a pity to impose labels on them so early.

366
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:45,667
Then…

367
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,292
Okay.

368
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:47,250
Come, give me the bag.

369
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:47,875
Thank you.

370
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,333
- Let's go in.
- Kai.

371
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,625
Come, let's come in.

372
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,958
Come, be careful.

373
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,167
Bye.

374
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,500
About today,

375
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:08,292
thank you.

376
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,958
And I thought about the second restaurant,

377
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,000
you meant well.

378
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:20,833
Fine,

379
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,000
I thought about a way

380
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,208
to meet both our needs.

381
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,708
Let's discuss at Verso later.

382
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:32,000
You're so annoying.

383
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,583
Awesome.

384
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,625
We're good.

385
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:37,583
Let's go.
