1
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,083
Baby.

2
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,250
It smells so good.

3
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,208
We haven't done it in so long.

4
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,250
Stop it.

5
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:43,625
What's wrong?

6
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,792
I lied in front of Kai today.

7
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,000
What did you lie about?

8
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:51,792
Hi.

9
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:53,125
Hi, Kai's dad.

10
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:53,833
Yang's mom.

11
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,167
Is it Yang's birthday today?

12
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:56,458
No,

13
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,875
his birthday's this Saturday.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,958
I bought candies for everyone first.

15
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,000
Happy birthday, Yang.

16
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:03,958
Thank you.

17
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,833
We have a birthday party on Saturday.

18
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:06,875
You're welcome to bring your wife

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,333
and Kai over.

20
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,333
We had plans already.

21
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,417
Sorry.

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,125
Okay.

23
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,333
Is daddy your wife?

24
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,625
Then go.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,583
But she told me to take my wife.

26
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,333
I can be your wife.

27
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:33,625
The point is

28
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,750
they don't know about our family situation.

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,417
So what?

30
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,875
You care too much about others' opinions.

31
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,542
I do.

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,400
(Papa & Daddy EP6. Family Portrait)

33
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,292
After the little monkey’s birthday party's over,

34
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,542
all the kids went home happily.

35
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:25,417
Kai, did you know that

36
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,208
your birthday's on December 15th?

37
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:29,875
Wow, you're good.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,833
How did you know?

39
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,000
And still remember.

40
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,542
I want someone to spend my birthday with.

41
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:37,750
Sure.

42
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,750
Then let's invite a lot of friends.

43
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:41,875
Like…

44
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:45,750
aunt Sasa's kid,

45
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,625
uncle Mike's,

46
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,958
aunt Celine,

47
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:50,792
grandpa and grandma.

48
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:53,708
But grandpa and grandma are in the States.

49
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,375
They're in Hualien.

50
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:01,125
Okay.

51
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:03,208
Then let's invite them.

52
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,667
And Yang.

53
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:07,000
He's my best friend.

54
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,500
No problem.

55
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,583
We'll also invite Yang.

56
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:14,708
It almost your birthday.

57
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,667
Like the little monkey.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,375
Kai's finally asleep.

59
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:33,750
Why did you agree to let Kai

60
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,583
have a birthday party with his classmates?

61
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,542
Baby,

62
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,042
isn't this what you wanted?

63
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,042
This way

64
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,500
we can clear the air with everyone.

65
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,208
But,

66
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,208
I'm scared of dealing with those parents.

67
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:51,208
I'm so conflicted.

68
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:55,542
You're worried that after they learn about

69
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,042
our family's situation,

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,375
it'll affect Kai's friendship with them.

71
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,917
And for those who have a problem with gay people,

72
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:04,125
and teach their kids otherwise,

73
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,708
Kai will have difficulties

74
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,375
getting along with them at school.

75
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,750
This is a problem Kai must face

76
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,500
sooner or later.

77
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,792
If we run away from it now,

78
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:17,083
it's unfair for Kai.

79
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,667
I know.

80
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:20,875
But I don’t want him to face this

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,375
at such a young age.

82
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:23,208
Baby,

83
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:26,125
we can't care for how everyone thinks.

84
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,167
We're the people Kai trusts the most.

85
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,583
If we back down,

86
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,833
he'll feel like we've done something wrong.

87
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:38,542
Look,

88
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,875
you came out to your family,

89
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:44,083
that's the hardest.

90
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,625
What else is there to be scared of?

91
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,333
Of course I'm not scared.

92
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,500
But we must protect Kai.

93
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:56,833
The best way to protect Kai,

94
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,583
is to face it.

95
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,083
You wouldn't want to impose

96
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,125
the pain you had when you came out

97
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,125
on him, would you?

98
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,208
Fine,

99
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,708
all that you said is right.

100
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,292
We didn't do anything wrong.

101
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,708
Kai shouldn't be hiding,

102
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,250
or feel weird.

103
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,625
That's right.

104
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,625
We're about to have a party.

105
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,250
Be happy.

106
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,000
Smile.

107
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,000
Of course you're not worried at all.

108
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:40,292
I'm the one who has to face the moms.

109
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,292
But this is our son’s wish.

110
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:46,667
But,

111
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,750
if you want me to invite them

112
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:49,833
that's okay, too.

113
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,667
I believe no one can refuse me.

114
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,375
Chef, come and sit.

115
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:03,000
Looks good.

116
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:03,917
So?

117
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:07,875
Any thoughts for this Christmas?

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,750
Dress up?

119
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,500
It's my favorite, green curry.

120
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,208
You haven't eaten?

121
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,292
Yeah.

122
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,583
Those bosses don't eat
when talking business.

123
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,542
But,

124
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,375
Chairman Lin agreed to sign.

125
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Oh my gosh.

126
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,583
I was just thinking
if he still doesn't sign,

127
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,750
I might need to use my beauty.

128
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:38,583
You mean I'd need to use my beauty.

129
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,417
Then we'll have to sacrifice you.

130
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,333
He's the big boss.

131
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,375
He only agreed

132
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,250
after seeing Verso's annual growth curve

133
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,375
and turnover report.

134
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,250
So happy.

135
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,125
Must open a bottle of wine to celebrate.

136
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,042
Such a drunk.

137
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,833
Will only go home after drunk.

138
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:06,833
Cheers.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,750
Have you contacted Kate recently?

140
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:21,917
Not really.

141
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,167
What's up?

142
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:25,458
I heard she's getting married.

143
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,125
Really?

144
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Still with that guy?

145
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:33,958
Aaron?

146
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:35,792
Adam.

147
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,792
At least call her to congratulate her.

148
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:45,667
You were married after all.

149
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,375
This wine's pretty good.

150
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,375
We should order more.

151
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,667
Hao, I have something to discuss with you.

152
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,875
Can you help me…

153
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,292
What sneaky business are you up to?

154
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,750
Not that.

155
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:20,708
I'm typing up Kai birthday's invitation card.

156
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,667
Can you take a look?

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,500
My Mandarin's not that good.

158
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,833
Can you take a look?

159
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,542
My eyes can't focus now.

160
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,500
Or

161
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,333
read it to me?

162
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,167
Okay.

163
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:43,917
Dear parents,

164
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:44,875
hello.

165
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,708
I'm Kai's papa.

166
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,292
Kai's been in school
for almost three months.

167
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,125
Thank you all for taking care of him.

168
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,750
December 15th is Kai's birthday.

169
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,792
I would like to invite you all

170
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:59,542
and your kids to Kai’s birthday party.

171
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,917
Also introduce you all to my husband,

172
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,542
Kai's daddy.

173
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,917
Some of you may have met him already.

174
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,917
We're a gay family

175
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,500
with two dads and a kid.

176
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,708
We haven't had the chance
to communicate with everyone.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,792
What do you think?

178
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:19,708
Is it okay?

179
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,542
It's great.

180
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,292
See.

181
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,083
Told you it wasn't hard.

182
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,792
But,

183
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:36,000
is it too long?

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,833
Baby.

185
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,083
Thank you

186
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,208
for everything you've done for me.

187
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:50,917
It hasn’t been easy for you.

188
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,708
It's ok.

189
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,042
I'm just not used to the whole

190
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,708
coming out to the public.

191
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,542
A bit surreal.

192
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:09,625
Now when I think of

193
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,833
your parents accepting us,

194
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,958
I just feel

195
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,083
so happy,

196
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
so lucky.

197
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,792
After Verso's second restaurant gets on track,

198
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,042
I'll help them move to Taipei

199
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,208
and live with us.

200
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,125
Really?

201
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,625
That's too much.

202
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:54,042
Someone's mind is dirty after getting drunk.

203
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,417
You're so delicious.

204
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,292
Kai, bye.

205
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,125
Kai's dad, you didn't have to.

206
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,833
We love hanging out with gay men.

207
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,458
Yes, I have so many gay friends.

208
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,167
I can tell them all the things
I can't to my husband.

209
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:46,375
Yes, and in recent years,

210
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,125
gay men are more popular than straight men.

211
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,792
They have men's ability
and women's delicacy.

212
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:53,833
Kai's daddy is the one

213
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,000
from the ice cream shop I told you about.

214
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,167
He's so handsome.

215
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,500
So envious.

216
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,833
How'd you know?

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,250
You sent it to the group yourself.

218
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,750
Fine, let me tell you.

219
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,417
Let us know when the party's date is set.

220
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:08,167
Let's go.

221
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,792
His husband's so tall and handsome.

222
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,500
Really?

223
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,625
That's too much.

224
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:57,625
It's me.

225
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,542
How are you?

226
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,042
Fine, what's up?

227
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:05,333
Everything okay out there? How's Jimmy?

228
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,458
We're fine.

229
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,708
How about Celine? Everything good?

230
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,542
You know her.

231
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,542
She never gets bored.

232
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,542
True.

233
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,208
Big congrats on getting married.

234
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,750
Thank you.

235
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:27,333
You and Adam have been together
for a long time, right?

236
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,000
6 years.

237
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,583
Longer than us.

238
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:33,417
Okay.

239
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,708
Alright, I just wanted to drop my greetings.

240
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,792
Anyway, I'm still working now.

241
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:42,833
Hold on.

242
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,667
Actually there's something I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

243
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,083
It's about Jimmy.

244
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,292
Yes.

245
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,250
It's Kai's birthday.

246
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,208
Just close the store that day and come up.

247
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:02,542
Sure.

248
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,708
What does Kai like?

249
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,917
We'll buy it for him.

250
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:06,917
Don't need to buy anything.

251
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:07,958
He has enough toys.

252
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,042
See for yourself.

253
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,125
Just come empty-handed.

254
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,167
I'm not buying toys for you,

255
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:15,667
it's for my grandson.

256
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:17,833
Fine.

257
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,125
Then buy puzzles.

258
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,583
Kai likes puzzles recently.

259
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,125
Are those sauerkraut and meat dumplings?

260
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,750
I haven't had them for so long.

261
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,708
I'll bring some with me.

262
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,208
Are 5 packs enough?

263
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,917
And 2 packs of cabbage ones.

264
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,375
Damian likes them.

265
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,792
Damian, hurry.

266
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:40,458
Come say hi to my parents.

267
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,375
Come.

268
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,125
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Pan.

269
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,083
Mian.

270
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,833
You worked until so late?

271
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,208
Must be tiring.

272
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,583
You lost weight.

273
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,708
Wait till I go to Taipei.

274
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,042
I'll make the chicken soup everyone loves.

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,250
Okay, thank you.

276
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,125
Jerry said you like a Hualien's famous snack.

277
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:08,625
Mrs. Pan will bring some for you.

278
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,167
Okay, thank you.

279
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:12,083
You guys hurry up and rest.

280
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,333
It's getting late.

281
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:14,750
Bye.

282
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:15,833
Bye.

283
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,458
Let me tell you something funny.

284
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,875
I accidentally sent out
the message last night.

285
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,042
Turns out the moms support me fully.

286
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,417
I worried for nothing.

287
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:30,542
Told you.

288
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:31,750
Wasn't that hard.

289
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:33,083
I know.

290
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,458
They're all so nice.

291
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:36,125
Oh ya,

292
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,042
I picked out a few restaurants.

293
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,125
Take a look.

294
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:41,208
There'll be about 20 people.

295
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:42,208
And,

296
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,000
these here are more suitable.

297
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,917
I like this one better.

298
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,250
What's wrong?

299
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,042
You're not answering

300
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:57,667
Nothing.

301
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,167
I was just on the phone with Kate.

302
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:04,208
Some stuff on my mind.

303
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:05,833
She…

304
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:06,792
What's wrong?

305
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:10,667
Nothing.

306
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:12,875
It's a good thing.

307
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,375
She's getting married.

308
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:17,917
Congratulations.

309
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:20,208
Her husband must love her a lot.

310
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:21,250
He does.

311
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,792
I'm very happy for her.

312
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,042
Let's give her a red envelope.

313
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,833
They don't do that in the States.

314
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:31,542
But I'll send them your greetings.

315
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:34,917
Alright, baby.

316
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:35,875
I'm tired.

317
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:36,792
I'll go back to the room first.

318
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,042
Okay, go to sleep.

319
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,500
Good night.

320
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,500
- Bro.
- Hi.

321
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:57,667
I'll put the gift there.

322
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:58,417
Okay.

323
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,958
Dad, mom.

324
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:01,500
Son.

325
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,125
I'll take you inside.

326
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,542
Kai.

327
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,458
Kai's daddy.

328
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,125
I forgot to introduce myself last time.

329
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,083
I'm Yang's mom,

330
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,125
I'm Julia.

331
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:17,333
Hi, Julia.

332
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,292
I'm Dou's mom,

333
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:19,292
I'm Cindy.

334
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,375
Hi, Cindy.

335
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,250
You work out.

336
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,458
So strong.

337
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,000
Please come in.

338
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,958
Hi, long time no see.

339
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:32,375
This is for you.

340
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,625
I heard you opened a restaurant.

341
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,417
Where?

342
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,292
It’s called Verso, in the East District.

343
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,917
Verso's famous.

344
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,917
Happy birthday.

345
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,083
Our second store will open soon.

346
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,167
I'll treat you, guys.

347
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,417
Great.

348
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:57,083
Cindy, Julia, Nancy.

349
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,292
No problem, leave it to me.

350
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:00,542
Awesome.

351
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,792
Mom, why aren't you guys eating?

352
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,458
Won't someone take our order?

353
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,667
Today's buffet style.

354
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:10,542
I see.

355
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:11,542
Is there anything you want?

356
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:12,458
I'll go grab it for you.

357
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:14,875
It's okay, don't mind us.

358
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,917
Go greet your friends.

359
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,125
Where's Kai?

360
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:19,125
Ya,

361
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,208
I haven't seen him in a while.

362
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,667
Kai.

363
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:25,417
Kai.

364
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,250
Ball pool.

365
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,333
Thanks.

366
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,125
Kai.

367
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,417
Kai's, Dad's calling for you.

368
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,375
Come.

369
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,375
- Go say hello to grandpa and grandma.
- No.

370
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,750
I still want to play.

371
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,083
Kai, hurry up.

372
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,292
- Grandpa, grandma.
- No, I want to play.

373
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,333
Kai, look who came.

374
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,417
Grandpa, grandma.

375
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,333
Happy birthday, Kai.

376
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,125
Kai, hurry up.

377
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,292
- Go.
- Go with dad.

378
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:00,750
- Hurry up.
- No.

379
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:01,083
Hurry.

380
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,333
I want to play.

381
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,917
- Hurry up.
- I want to play.

382
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,125
Grandpa and grandma are here.

383
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,458
No.

384
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,542
Why are you like this?

385
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,583
I want to stay here.

386
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,833
Kai, see who's here.

387
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,875
See who's here.

388
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,333
Kai.

389
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,583
Today's your birthday, are you happy?

390
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,583
Happy.

391
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:35,917
Kai.

392
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,750
This is for you.

393
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,583
Your papa said it's your favorite.

394
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:42,792
Puzzle.

395
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,000
Bingo.

396
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,208
So smart.

397
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:47,375
Thank you.

398
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,250
Want to go and play?

399
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:51,333
Okay.

400
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,250
Sorry about that.

401
00:19:59,042 --> 00:19:59,792
It's okay.

402
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,333
What's wrong?

403
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:26,750
Today is Kai's birthday.

404
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,583
Cheer up.

405
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:32,417
You know it's Kai's birthday?

406
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,250
Why didn't you help out?

407
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,458
I was busy chatting with everyone.

408
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:39,917
Yes.

409
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,042
You had a great time.

410
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,500
Leaving us on the side.

411
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,792
So you were jealous.

412
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:53,625
I was not.

413
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,083
Of those moms?

414
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,125
I was not.

415
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:58,833
Come on.

416
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,500
You're usually the one dealing with them.

417
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,125
I see your parents here,

418
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,208
I wanted to let you relax.

419
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:12,417
Oh my goodness, my baby's so cute.

420
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,167
Here they are.

421
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:19,833
Jerry, what are you doing?

422
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:22,792
I didn't say I don't want to talk to them.

423
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,417
I just wanted to make everyone happy.

424
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,750
So many people came today.

425
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,750
I wanted to behave well.

426
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:32,958
You behaved superb.

427
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,208
Well-done.

428
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,250
Host and guests had a great time.

429
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,542
The kids had a blast.

430
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:37,917
The party was super successful.

431
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,042
Super successful.

432
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,583
My daughter Charlotte said,

433
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,708
"Dad, could uncle Jerry

434
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,875
prepare my birthday party, too?"

435
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,167
No way, I'm exhausted.

436
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,083
Fine, I'm sorry.

437
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,292
I didn't know you were so stressed.

438
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,208
Hello.

439
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,292
You gay really love hugs.

440
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:02,875
Hugged enough?

441
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,542
Let's go cut the cake.

442
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:05,875
We just love to hug.

443
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:08,292
Come hug together?

444
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,458
My hat.

445
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:18,833
Happy birthday to you.

446
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:22,750
Happy birthday dear Kai.

447
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,458
Happy birthday to you.

448
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:35,167
Thank you, friends and family,

449
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:37,542
for coming to Kai's birthday party.

450
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Kai's four years old.

451
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,250
He started attending kindergarten this year,

452
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:46,208
and made some good friends.

453
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:49,500
It hasn't been easy,

454
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,333
but

455
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,333
Jerry and I are very happy,

456
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,083
for having such a

457
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,125
cute and healthy baby.

458
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:00,625
Of course,

459
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,583
also thanks to all my good friends

460
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:04,417
for being by our side.

461
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,833
This year is also the first time

462
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,083
Jerry's parents

463
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,000
attended Kai’s birthday party.

464
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,125
Thank you.

465
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:17,833
Thank you for your love and support.

466
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,042
Thank you.

467
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,375
I want to eat cake.

468
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,625
Okay, give it to him.

469
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,667
Happy birthday.

470
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,042
Mr. Pan, the suspenders were
specially chosen for today.

471
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,792
I think it's pretty.

472
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,417
My dad asked me to choose a trendier one.

473
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,125
Jerry.

474
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,250
Could you help introduce?

475
00:23:59,208 --> 00:23:59,917
Dad, mom.

476
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,917
I hang out with them often,

477
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:04,292
and they take good care of me.

478
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:07,208
Our kids play together, too.

479
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:10,208
So we're all really close.

480
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,458
Thank you guys.

481
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:13,500
Auntie.

482
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,542
Jerry's the most attentive among us.

483
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,042
He's usually the one who takes care of us.

484
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:17,708
Really?

485
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:19,667
You guys know why?

486
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,500
Because I'm the youngest.

487
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,000
They boss me around.

488
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,917
I'm the one you boss around.

489
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:29,583
You boss me around to eat.

490
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:30,708
His cooking's so good.

491
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:31,875
This is from last week's steak.

492
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:33,792
This was chicken soup from the week before.

493
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,542
He's so talented.

494
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,292
He inherited that from me.

495
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:39,417
You just didn’t know.

496
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:41,333
Yes.

497
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,833
Let's have a family portrait.

498
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,000
Okay.

499
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,167
I'll take it for you.

500
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,458
No.

501
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:51,250
Let's all take it together.

502
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,000
Ugly faces.

503
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,208
How is this ugly face?

504
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,583
What is this? Hold on.

505
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:23,875
Tomorrow?

506
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,167
How will I explain to Jerry?

507
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,875
You leave me no choice.

508
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,667
Hubby,

509
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:27,542
where are you so early in the morning?

510
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:29,667
I came to pick someone up at the airport.

511
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:30,917
I'll be back soon.

512
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,583
Okay.

513
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:35,833
Bye.

514
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:37,833
Bye.

515
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:47,500
Welcome home.

516
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,250
Hubby, who's this?

517
00:26:58,917 --> 00:26:59,625
He's Jimmy,

518
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,167
from California.

519
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:02,833
It's winter vacation now,

520
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,042
so he came back for holidays.

521
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,750
Hey, yo, what's up?

522
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,958
You're my daddy's boyfriend?

Cool.

524
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,208
Who's your daddy?

525
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,750
I haven't had the chance to tell you.

00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,542
Actually, he's Kate's and mine.
