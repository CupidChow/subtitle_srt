1
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:31,458
Kai.

2
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,167
Don't.

3
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,833
Daddy worked till very late last night.

4
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,958
Let's not wake him, okay?

5
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,583
Let him sleep some more.

6
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,167
Okay?

7
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,292
Good, give me five.

8
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,083
Daddy, come play with me.

9
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,833
Kai, remember we said not to bother Daddy?

10
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,542
Good morning, Kai.

11
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:01,292
You're so childish.

12
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,708
You scared him.

13
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:05,333
Let's get our revenge.

14
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,083
Charge!

15
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,208
No.

16
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:08,583
No revenge!

17
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:11,583
Your turn.

18
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:12,708
Attack.

19
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:15,292
Attack.

20
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:19,542
Attack.

21
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,042
Dinosaur's coming.

22
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:28,792
Kai, save me.

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,500
(Papa & Daddy EP1. Pilot)

24
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:58,333
Kai, finish your egg first, hurry up.

25
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,792
Hi, thanks.

26
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,750
Kai, good morning.

27
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,208
Transformers.

28
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,417
He has to eat.
Stop distracting him.

29
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,250
Fine.

30
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:16,042
Daddy's upset.

31
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,125
Hurry up and eat.

32
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,250
Hubby.

33
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,750
I'm thinking about opening a new channel.

34
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:27,792
What do you think?

35
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,458
I thought the current one's just fine.

36
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,000
You don't pay attention to me at all.

37
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,042
I haven't updated it in a year.

38
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,000
Fans have almost forgotten about me.

39
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:39,792
Why not?

40
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,208
I didn't have the time.

41
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,500
Aren't you home a lot?

42
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,875
You think I have a lot of spare time?

43
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,125
Every day after I'm done with Kai,
there's still a lot of chores.

44
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,083
After I'm done with those,
I take him out for a walk.

45
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:54,625
I used to do all the editing

46
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,250
when he's asleep.

47
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,042
Now, he doesn't take naps.

48
00:02:58,167 --> 00:02:59,500
When I put him to sleep at night,

49
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,208
sometimes I fall asleep first.

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,792
When do I have time?

51
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:04,333
But,

52
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,125
you have time to do online shopping.

53
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:10,750
That's my only entertainment.

54
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,333
I never thought you're the type of man

55
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,917
who thinks housewives stay at home all day

56
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:18,917
with nothing to do but online shopping.

57
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,958
Fine, you're the busiest.

58
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,375
If you're so busy,

59
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
where's the time for a new channel?

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,875
That's why I was

61
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,583
thinking of…

62
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,792
sending Kai to kindergarten.

63
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,417
Kai, you're done?

64
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,167
He's so small.

65
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,458
You want to send him to school
at such a young age?

66
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,583
I checked online.

67
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,958
The class sizes are quite small,

68
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,208
it won't be too crowded,

69
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,583
and there are a lot of outdoor activities.

70
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,458
Why didn't you discuss with me first

71
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:01,250
before you made the decision?

72
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,042
I'm discussing with you now.

73
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,667
Plus, he's so eager to learn now.

74
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:08,750
I don't have answers

75
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,167
to a lot of his questions.

76
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,833
What could a 3-year-old ask

77
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,583
that you can't answer?

78
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:16,958
What's "mommy"?

79
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,375
Help me move the table to the side,

80
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,250
the flow would be better.

81
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,417
And Jack,

82
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:46,000
help me move the plant in the corner
to the basement.

83
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,125
Thank you.

84
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,000
What's the matter? You seem out of here.

85
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,792
Jerry wants to take Kai to pre-school,

86
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,792
so he can go on with his huge channel.

87
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,875
Good for him.

88
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:08,042
His channel's well liked.

89
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,667
He should continue.

90
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,500
I know. I want to support him, too.

91
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,417
But I don't want Kai
going to school so soon.

92
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,125
Then easy, you take care of Kai.

93
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,000
What?

94
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,583
No, no way.

95
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,875
There are still so many things to do
for the store's expansion.

96
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,542
So your business can't be sacrificed,

97
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,208
but Jerry's can?

98
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,625
Do you know?

99
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:40,042
Guess who would win.

100
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:41,167
Who are you talking about?

101
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:44,375
Onix and Pikachu,

102
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,292
who would win?

103
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,917
Onix.

104
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:48,458
He's that good?

105
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,125
You overheard my answer again, didn't you?

106
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,583
I guessed it myself.

107
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,167
Jerry Hun.

108
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,958
Brian, what are you doing here?

109
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,625
Long time no see.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,583
What a coincidence,
what are you doing here?

111
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,208
I'm meeting with a vendor, you?

112
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,875
I live nearby.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,167
I'm going shopping now.

114
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:08,042
That's nice.

115
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,167
Oh ya.

116
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,750
Kai.

117
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,750
Papa have someone for you to meet.

118
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,917
This is Papa's best friend,

119
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:14,958
Uncle Brian.

120
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,750
Hello, Kai.

121
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,542
I follow your channel. You're awesome.

122
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:22,917
You have over a million subscribers, right?

123
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,292
I have to do everything myself.

124
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:26,417
I'm overwhelmed.

125
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:28,625
You're the luckiest.

126
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,917
With such a cute kid
and a husband to support you.

127
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:32,542
You're so happy.

128
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:33,750
It's ok.

129
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,000
Here…

130
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,292
- Here, Kai.
- No.

131
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:37,667
No need for that.

132
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:38,875
This is a gift for Kai.

133
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,542
It's not for you, silly.

134
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:41,375
I'm leaving.

135
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,375
Come on, have a meal before you go.

136
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,875
I'm late for a meeting.

137
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:45,917
Rain check.

138
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,125
Invite Damian, okay?

139
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,042
- Alright.
- Rain check.

140
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:48,875
- Ok.
- Bye.

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Bye.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,708
There are many kinds of monsters.

143
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,875
Which kind do you like?

144
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,458
I like fire-breathing ones.

145
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,875
Which one?

146
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,250
- Let's see who falls asleep first.
- No.

147
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,583
Let's see who falls asleep first.

148
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,917
It's a race, okay?

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,667
Loser will be eaten.

150
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,083
Time to sleep.

151
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,875
I'll count to 3,
see who falls asleep first.

152
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,958
1 2 3.

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,292
Okay, next question.

154
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:45,417
Why did you give up a high salary
in America's advertising,

155
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:46,792
and came back to Taiwan to cook?

156
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,500
The dining industry has always been my dream.

157
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,958
When I was ready to chase it,

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,042
I wanted it to be

159
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,667
where I grew up.

160
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:07,292
Then how does it feel to
realize your dream?

161
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,583
Steadfast.

162
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,708
Taiwan makes me

163
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,375
want to stay here.

164
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,667
I can freely be myself here,

165
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:20,583
then slowly

166
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,500
work towards my dream.

167
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:24,917
Damian,

168
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,875
I think Verso's different from other bars.

169
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,375
Like the wall behind the bar.

170
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,083
Which cute guy are you looking at?

171
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,125
You're drooling.

172
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:38,333
Nonsense, my husband's cuter.

173
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,833
Not mad at me anymore?

174
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,250
I've thought about it.

175
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,750
- I was too selfish.
- I thought about it, too.

176
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,458
- I think it's too early, too.
- Let Kai go to school.

177
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,542
What did you say?

178
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,000
You did so much for me,

179
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,542
that wasn't in your life plan.

180
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,625
I want to support you this time.

181
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,542
Let Kai go to school.

182
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:28,333
Then you can concentrate on your channel.

183
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,125
You're so caring.

184
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,708
I ran into Brian today.

185
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:36,708
He said he envies me.

186
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,625
Then I realized,

187
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
really,

188
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm really happy.

189
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,333
So I want to make you even happier.

190
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,500
I love

191
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,000
the glow you have when you work.

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,708
But,

193
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,958
I'm not confident if

194
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,542
anyone wants to see me,

195
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,167
and I have no idea

196
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,083
what my channel should focus on now.

197
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,667
Silly.

198
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,708
What are you afraid of?

199
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,833
I'll help you.

200
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,375
Howard, bye.

201
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,833
Howard's mommy, bye.

202
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:35,708
All right.

203
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:36,875
Go.

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,417
Bye.

205
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,542
Ren.

206
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,542
You didn't say bye to me.

207
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,208
You can do something like this.

208
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,708
This is quite funny.

209
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,542
You made this?

210
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:21,333
Ya.

211
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,417
Let me tell you.

212
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,583
No matter if it's teenagers,

213
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,958
elders,

214
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,083
or…

215
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,208
the middle aged group,

216
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,042
they all like to watch

217
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,333
cooking-related shows.

218
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,083
So…

219
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,708
So, my baby

220
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,167
has decided to jump back into the game

221
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:39,583
and start a new channel.

222
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,458
After discussion, we felt

223
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,583
live broadcast suits him better now.

224
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,208
There's no need to edit afterwards.

225
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,958
Yes, editing is really time-consuming.

226
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,958
We outsource that now.

227
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,333
And we have to work during the day,

228
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,083
there's no time for that.

229
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,542
Let me know if you need any help.

230
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,833
Okay, I'll send you the information.

231
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:00,917
No problem.

232
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:01,708
Thank you, sis.

233
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,417
Keep it up, you can do it.

234
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:04,208
Okay.

235
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,583
Congratulations on getting back
in the game.

236
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,542
Cheers.

237
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,542
You're awesome.

238
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,292
So cute.

239
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,083
He got naughtier after starting school.

240
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,458
I know, right?

241
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,958
Kai, do you like to go to school?

242
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,708
Like going to school?

243
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,667
What do you want to say?

244
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,583
He loves going to school.

245
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,458
On the contrary, we feel kind of down.

246
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,417
Like he doesn't need us anymore.

247
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,708
Speak for yourself, I don't feel that way.

248
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,917
Don't lie.

249
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,333
When Kai went into the classroom

250
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,458
without giving us a glance,

251
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,333
someone shed a tear.

252
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,208
Don't let out my secret.

253
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:49,208
So envious.

254
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,708
We really want a kid, too.

255
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,583
Damian, do you have any suggestions?

256
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,583
It took us a lot of time

257
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,958
to find a surrogate mother.

258
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,208
You guys don't have that problem.

259
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,958
As for sperm,

260
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:05,708
if you need my baby's donation,

261
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:06,833
they're pretty good.

262
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,583
Quality gauranteed.

263
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,417
Not bad.

264
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,708
No, that's weird.

265
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,708
No, it won't, you can be the godfather.

266
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,083
Is that okay?

267
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:19,208
You guys are too much.

268
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,708
Okay, give it a rest.

269
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,583
You can contact the LGBT association.

270
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,167
They have a lot of information

271
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:28,667
on foreign sperm banks,

272
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:30,833
and important medical insurances.

273
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,417
I can pass along the info to you.

274
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,417
Great.

275
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,167
- Thanks.
- Hurry up and have one.

276
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,333
Did you guys…

277
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,458
Yes, of course.

278
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:39,792
That's who we went to back then.

279
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,583
Who are you picking up?

280
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,333
I've never seen you before.

281
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,917
I'm Kai's Daddy.

282
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:56,958
Kai.

283
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:57,958
Yes.

284
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,167
Daddy.

285
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,208
Daddy's here to pick you up.

286
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,958
Are you happy?

287
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,708
Bye.

288
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,458
Welcome to

289
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,833
cooking with Jerry.

290
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,083
I'm a little nervous,

291
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,292
I think it's pretty obvious.

292
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:29,708
This is my first time

293
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,958
doing a live.

294
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:34,708
Hello, friends and fans,

295
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,542
remember to interact with me later.

296
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,667
Hopefully, there won't be
any awkward silence.

297
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,833
Though I may be too busy cooking to respond.

298
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:43,458
Today we'll be making

299
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,833
my personal favorite

300
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:50,208
easy to make yet very savory
sweet and sour potato chips.

301
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:51,833
Nowadays there are more and more

302
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:52,958
dinkies like myself.

303
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,833
Eating out is unhealthy,

304
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,042
but cooking might result in food waste.

305
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:57,792
So,

306
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:00,958
picking a dish is critical.

307
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:03,333
Chop the hot pepper,

308
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,708
then,

309
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,708
we're going to saute it.

310
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,583
Now all the ingredients are ready.

311
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,458
Papa, I want ice cream today.

312
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,167
Kai, no, no.

313
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:27,167
Now let's pour some oil,

314
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,708
and heat it up a bit.

315
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:31,333
(Jerry's a Dad?)

316
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,417
(Out of wedlock.)

317
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:33,458
(That kid's so cute.)

318
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,583
(Jerry's married?)

319
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,708
(Congratulations, the kid's so cute.)

320
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,833
(Jerry has a kid!)

321
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,083
(The kid seems quite grown up.)

322
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,583
Sorry, babe.

323
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,958
I thought your live
would only take 10 minutes.

324
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:50,667
I actually took Kai

325
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:52,833
to have ice cream before we came back.

326
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,083
Because it's live,

327
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,958
I spent a lot of time practicing.

328
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,833
Or maybe the next broadcast

329
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,708
could be earlier?

330
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,208
No one looks at that in the morning.

331
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:14,917
And cooking should be just before dinner.

332
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,667
Kai, Papa wants to tell you something.

333
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:35,333
Next time you come home from school.

334
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,083
If you see Papa filming,

335
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,667
don't bother Papa.

336
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,833
I like to film, too.

337
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,083
I know.

338
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,042
But Papa's working, not playing.

339
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:52,333
So Papa can't play with me anymore?

340
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,458
No.

341
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:58,583
Kai, it's not like that.

342
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,333
It's not that we don't want to play with you.

343
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,417
We want to make more money,

344
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,583
to buy more toys,

345
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,542
and more of your favorite food.

346
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:12,542
If we make more money,

347
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,833
we can give you a better life.

348
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,208
We're joining.

349
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,167
So many tornadoes!

350
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:04,958
So Papa can't play with me anymore?

351
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,417
- Good morning, baby.
- Good morning.

352
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,583
Already starting to prepare?

353
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:36,958
I want to try having the live at noon.

354
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,042
Then when Kai gets back from school,

355
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:41,167
I can spend time with him.

356
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,583
So sweet.

357
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,042
Then I'll call out to everyone

358
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,708
to watch your show.

359
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:50,833
Sure.

360
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,083
Who can it be? It's so early.

361
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,917
Maybe my online shopping.

362
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:08,042
Hello.

363
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,458
Excuse me,

364
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,167
does Jerry Pan live here?

365
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,792
You are?

366
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,292
Mom.

367
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:15,958
Mom?

368
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,833
This place is so hard to find.

369
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,333
I brought all these from Hualien,

370
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,167
all your favorite.

371
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,583
There's that.

372
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,708
Look, our signature dumplings,

373
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,583
braised chicken feet and others.

374
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,083
I saw your live yesterday,
you're way too skinny now.

375
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,583
How do you know the address?

376
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,208
I asked your sister.

377
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,042
And this is…

378
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,792
your roommate?

379
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,958
Hi Mrs. Pan, I'm Damian.

380
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,917
Jerry Pan.

381
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:51,917
Why was there a kid on your show

382
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:53,708
who called you Papa?
