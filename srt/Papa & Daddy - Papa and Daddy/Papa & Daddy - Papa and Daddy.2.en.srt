00:00:01,958 --> 00:00:04,792
(Six years ago)

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:06,458
I'm telling you.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,167
What we need now

4
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:08,417
are internet celebrities

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,625
to promote us.

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,125
This is way more effective
than advertising.

7
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,958
Like this one, Joyce.

8
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:15,542
She's a food blogger.

9
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:19,667
One of her videos has 4.8 million hits.

10
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,042
Let's not consider girls now.

11
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:23,083
Fine, that's okay.

12
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:23,875
This one.

13
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:25,958
He's a dance teacher.

14
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,583
His Waaking's very seductive.

15
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:29,125
We can

16
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,250
invite him over

17
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,417
to our opening party.

18
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:33,958
He can do a little dance.

19
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:34,708
What do you think?

20
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,042
This can be considered, but

21
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:37,875
I still want

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,042
the first wave to be more energetic.

23
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,083
Energetic.

24
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,958
Ted Cai, is that energetic enough?

25
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,208
And you know him, too.

26
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,750
We…

27
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,583
- He's a super famous YouTuber.
- I know him.

28
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,958
- He's...
- Our style's different.

29
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,583
Damian honey,

30
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,208
this is an opening.

31
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,292
You have to be known.

32
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,542
That's the most important thing right now.

33
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:03,708
So you must

34
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,375
trust me on this, okay?

35
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,792
I do.

36
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:09,458
I'd like to follow your suggestion.

37
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:10,292
But.

38
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:13,542
I knew it, you're so anal.

39
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:16,250
I'm late for yoga.

40
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:16,958
I'm telling you.

41
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,083
Let me be anal.

42
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,500
I'll look at the list myself.

43
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,500
I'll let you know when I make a decision.

44
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,667
If you weren't so cute,

45
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:28,083
I'd just ignore you.

46
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,458
Okay, don't be angry,

47
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:30,500
or else you'll get wrinkles.

48
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:31,125
I…

49
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,250
Enjoy your yoga.

50
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,792
Okay, remember to go through the list.

51
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,750
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

52

(Touring Taipei with Jerry)

53
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,292
Hello everyone,

54
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:01,333
welcome to Touring Taipei with Jerry.

55
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
(Jerry)

56
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,958
To Taipei's most famous

57
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,750
Force Fitness.

58
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,167
The best gym.

59
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:12,917
The appeal here is

60
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:15,241
(He's tired)
anyone who wants to

61
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:18,750
can have the perfect body.

62
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:24,167
Nothing is impossible.

63
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:26,667
If I believe, I can.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,375
I'm finally done.

65
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
I stayed up late the past few days,

66
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,542
I have dark circles under my eyes, so ugly.

67
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,542
I need to go do a facial mask.

68
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,375
Ugly has nothing to do with dark circles.

69
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,333
Your sister.

70
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,083
How about her? You're looking for her?

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,083
Hello, Mrs. Pan.

72
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,625
I'm telling you,

73
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,667
Jerry Pan actually likes boys.

74
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:51,583
He's gay.

75
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:55,042
That's not funny. I'm leaving. Bye.

76
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:57,500
I haven't told you the new gossip.

77
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,375
Why are you in a rush?

78
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,250
I'm late for work.

79
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,083
Forget about him.

80
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,042
He won't turn gay for you, bye.

81
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,875
Don't forget about shooting
the new restaurant, Verso.

82
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,125
Don't forget.

83
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,958
But I have to work every day this week.

84
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,125
I can't get the day off.

85
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,375
That can't be.

86
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,000
I flirted with PR for a month

87
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,833
to get that opportunity.

88
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,708
He'll nag me to death.

89
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,625
I was just teasing you.

90
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,708
I made an appointment to
interview the boss before shooting.

91
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,625
I have the questions ready.

92
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,292
You're so annoying.

93
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,292
I'm leaving.

94
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,708
It was just a joke.

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
(Papa & Daddy EP2. How I Met Your Father)

96
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,958
So you gave up a high salary in America,

97
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,417
to start from zero in Taiwan.

98
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,958
Yeah, to be honest.

99
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,208
Advertising

100
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,500
is just helping others.

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,583
I've always wanted to
start my own business,

102
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,875
and always had a dining dream.

103
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,250
So when I had the opportunity four years ago,

104
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,833
I took it and came back to Taiwan.

105
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,500
That takes a lot of determination.

106
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,000
You're really good.

107
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,375
So how long did it take

108
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,667
for you to build Verso?

109
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:27,542
Two years.

110
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,708
That long?

111
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,667
Because I wanted to make sure

112
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:34,042
that everything went

113
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,000
according to my plan.

114
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,625
So far has your life

115
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:39,875
gone according to your plan?

116
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,000
You can say so.

117
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,333
I really can’t imagine

118
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,375
a derailed life.

119
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,708
But if it's all planned,

120
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,208
isn't it boring?

121
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:57,750
Why would it?

122
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,125
Like traveling.

123
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,792
The most memorable moments,

124
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,333
are often the accidental episodes,

125
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,625
right?

126
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,708
May I ask how old you are now?

127
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,250
Guess.

128
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,875
Want me to guess?

129
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:31,875
27?

130
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,542
No.

131
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:36,542
Older?

132
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,458
Younger.

133
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,417
3?

134
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:47,958
Taipei's a colorful world.

135
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,917
At first, I simply wanted to

136
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:52,292
record my life in Taipei.

137
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,000
I didn’t expect that many people to like it.

138
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,625
Then I somehow became
an internet celebrity.

139
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,250
So where's your hometown?

140
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,792
The beautiful Hualien.

141
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:08,958
Hualien.

142
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,250
I think I've been there with my family
when I was a kid.

143
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,042
Really?

144
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,792
Do you remember where you went?

145
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,375
I don't remember much, but

146
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:23,000
I remember the seaside is very beautiful.

147
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:24,042
Oh ya,

148
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:27,625
there's a famous product there.

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,208
I miss it.

150
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,542
But I don't know what it's called.

151
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:32,958
It's kind of soft…

152
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,583
Mochi.

153
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,250
I don't think that's what it's called.

154
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,917
Shaqima? Hualien potato? Peanuts?

155
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,958
Don't think so.

156
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,125
Then you must be mistaken.

157
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,875
The place you went isn't Hualien.

158
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,250
Are you… free later?

159
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,292
Do you want to…

160
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:03,708
You have a guest?

161
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,333
I'll come back later.

162
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:09,292
Designs.

163
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,250
Oh yes, my drawings.

164
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,583
Sorry, I forgot.

165
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,542
My part's over, you go do your stuff.

166
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,792
Sorry.

167
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,750
Or you can…

168
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,792
Can…

169
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:30,125
Thanks for today.

170
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,958
See you on opening day.

171
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:40,167
Can... I take pictures with you?

172
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,833
Of course, here.

173
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:53,875
Okay.

174
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,583
I'll walk you out.

175
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,208
Someone's weird.

176
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,458
What are you talking about? How?

177
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,542
Tell me, who is it?

178
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,417
The intern, he's so your type.

179
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:17,875
Nonsense.

180
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,083
He's the one coming over

181
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,250
to film the intro video on opening day.

182
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,958
I'm too old for him.

183
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,583
The younger, the merrier.

184
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,167
So tell me,

185
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,000
what do you plan to do with this fresh meat?

186
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,458
- Fresh meat.
- Braise it.

187
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,750
First chop it open.

188
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,708
- Chop it open.
- Then open it up.

189
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,875
Put it in the water.

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,750
- Put it in the water.
- Then.

191
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,000
Bullshit.

192
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,417
I need to focus on work, okay?

193
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:40,583
I don't have time for that.

194
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,958
Work and love can co-exist.

195
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,042
Plus,

196
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,250
you've been single for so long.

197
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,750
Careful what holding in will do to you.

198
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,083
Holding in what?

199
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,958
Don't you forget I still have...

200
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,625
- Lady Five.
- Fine, fine.

201
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,667
I don't want to listen to that.

202
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,458
I'm just sincerely suggesting you.

203
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,083
If you meet someone you like,

204
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,583
don't let the opportunity slip.

205
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,000
Like Amy and I.

206
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,625
Hush, my drawing, my drawing.

207
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,125
Thank you.

208
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,417
I'm only telling you this as a friend.

209
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:10,792
Here.

210
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,500
Fine, this.

211
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,250
I changed some things after the last meeting.

212
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,667
I put the cooking table here.

213
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,583
Then the serving problem is also solved.

214
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,600
(Jerry Pan,
when was the last time you came back?)

215
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,042
Senior year doesn't have a lot of classes,

216
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,250
why aren't you back on weekends?

217
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,167
Mom's nagging is driving me crazy.

218
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,083
You're getting grumpy.

219
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,625
I don't want to attend university at all.

220
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,208
But Mom's forcing me.

221
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,042
Come back to distract her.

222
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,167
I want to work.

223
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,750
Come work with Dad,

224
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,042
he'll give you money.

225
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:01,625
Just come home soon.

226
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,375
I'll send you a link later

227
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,542
to a sports boutique store.

228
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,000
Buy me a pair of sunglasses.

229
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,042
Bye, bye.

230
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:13,125
All you do is order me around.

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,083
Hi everyone,

232
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:56,250
welcome to Touring Taipei with Jerry.

233
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:58,074
(Jerry)

234
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,875
To Taipei's most famous

235
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,625
Force Fitness.

236
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,167
The best gym.

237
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,958
The appeal here is

238
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:09,982
(Working hard!)
anyone who wants to

239
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,392
(Go!)
can have the perfect body.

240
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,416
(Cool!)

241
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
(Touring Taipei with Jerry)

242
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,667
Nice work.

243
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:26,750
- Bye, Damian.
- Bye.

244
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,500
Good job today.

245
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,458
Good luck tomorrow.

246
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,583
- Bye.
- Rest early today.

247
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,667
Be careful on your way home, bye.

248
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,833
- You, too.
- You, too.

249
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:34,958
Rest early, okay?

250
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:35,667
Okay, rest early.

251
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:36,750
Okay, I'm leaving, Bye.

252
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:40,292
Bye, be careful on your way home.

253
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,250
Why are you here?

254
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,333
Waiting for you.

255
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,500
It's so humid outside,

256
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,458
why not go in?

257
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:01,458
Didn't want to disturb you.

258
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:03,833
You won't.

259
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,417
Don't be afraid.

260
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,208
Look, I went back to Hualien,

261
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,208
and bought all the famous products
I could think of.

262
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,875
It you still can't remember
what you had before,

263
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,042
then I'm pretty sure

264
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,500
where you went wasn't Hualien.

265
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,333
Where did you come from?

266
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,542
You disrupted my plans.

267
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,375
I'm your most beautiful episode.

268
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,333
You're the baby

269
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,375
who stole my heart.

270
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,833
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

271
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,333
It smells so good.

272
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,250
Why are you here?

273
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,917
To come pick you up.

274
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:05,583
I want to take you somewhere…

275
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,958
He's so cute.

276
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,167
Mysterious.

277
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:09,625
I'm Brian.

278
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,167
Hi, I'm Damian.

279
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:13,000
Hello there.

280
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,125
So envious, you have someone to
pick you up.

281
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,375
Let's get in.

282
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,708
I'm out.

283
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,500
Bye.

284
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:35,833
Whose turn?

285
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,583
My baby's? Okay.

286
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,167
Baby?

287
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,250
Eight.

288
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,625
You done? My turn?

289
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,917
Yes, your turn.

290
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,917
Joker.

291
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:54,708
Oh, yeah?

292
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,875
Kiss.

293
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,833
You actually kissed.

294
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:08,750
- Is it too heavy?
- Here.

295
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,875
No. From now on, this will be your home.

296
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:01,083
Congratulations.

297
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,042
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

298
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,792
Congratulations.

299
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,208
Thank you.

300
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,250
So happy for you.

301
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,250
That hug was too long.

302
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,583
You and Jeff's turn.

303
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,500
Who's Jeff? I'm single today.

304
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,167
Stop fooling around.

305
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:19,125
Thank you for coming.

306
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,125
So happy to see you.

307
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,292
Thank you all.

308
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:29,958
Happy Wedding.

309
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,417
Thanks to everyone for sharing
this joyful moment with Amy and I.

310
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:35,750
We finally got married,

311
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,167
after been together for five years.

312
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:38,500
Married.

313
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,417
Everyone here knows that,

314
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:49,792
back then

315
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:51,708
for me to settle down,

316
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,000
was basically impossible.

317
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,042
Until I met you.

318
00:17:58,417 --> 00:17:59,958
You make me understand,

319
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:01,333
freedom

320
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,500
is very precious

321
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,333
and very important

322
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,333
in a relationship.

323
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:15,458
Free to be yourself and with each other.

324
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,250
You've never

325
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,208
asked me to change.

326
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:22,750
Also,

327
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,208
you're proven that

328
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,292
I can love a person

329
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:32,000
more and more

330
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:32,917
every day.

331
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,458
Thank you.

332
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,208
I want to be better.

333
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,208
And

334
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,583
I hope that we can

335
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,167
be better together,

336
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,500
and grow old together.

337
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,750
Although we're not perfect.

338
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,417
But it turns out,

339
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,917
there is someone

340
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:00,208
who will be willing

341
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,333
to tolerate,

342
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,583
to understand,

343
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:09,500
even cherish all your imperfections.

344
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,750
Willing to protect you.

345
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,375
Make you a better version of yourself.

346
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:21,792
Thank you, my love,

347
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,958
my best friend,

348
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,083
my wife.

349
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,875
I will always hold your hand

350
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,042
like right now, till forever.

351
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:37,750
And be grateful

352
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,375
for every single day

353
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,833
that we spend together.

354
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:50,500
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

355
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:02,083
Kiss.

356
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,167
All drinks on me tonight.

357
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,167
My first time attending this kind of party.

358
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:23,583
It's so touching.

359
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,333
We can do this, too.

360
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:46,208
You're very lucky

361
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,250
to marry her.

362
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,875
Come over.

363
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,583
- Hey.
- What?

364
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,125
Let me introduce someone to you.

365
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,875
To everyone.

366
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,958
My wife, my wife alone.

367
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,417
Nobody try to fight me for her.

368
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,292
What are you so cocky about?

369
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:08,125
I have one, too.

370
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,333
I have my baby, too.

371
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,083
I'm telling you.

372
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,208
Since the first time I saw you,

373
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,417
I told you

374
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,000
you're his type.

375
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,958
Then he was all…

376
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,583
You are the best... you know me best.

377
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:31,375
Hurry up, when are you guys getting married?

378
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,583
And we agreed to have kids together.

379
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,375
You forgot.

380
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,083
I'll do as promised.

381
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,750
Then our kids will

382
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,875
grow up together.

383
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,792
Have kids.

384
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:56,375
Damian, where are you? Damian.

385
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:09,875
Damian, where are you? Damian.

386
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:06,542
What's the matter,
baby? You don't feel good?

387
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,750
Bored of shopping?

388
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:11,458
I heard that there's a cafe nearby

389
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,042
with amazing tiramisu.

390
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:14,708
Let's go there.

391
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,083
You want kids?

392
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:26,958
Yes.

393
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,583
My plan was to wait
till Verso's stabilized,

394
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,583
then go have a kid in the States.

395
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,833
Another plan.

396
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,333
So whether I showed up or not,

397
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,958
you'd do that?

398
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:44,250
But now I have you.

399
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,250
But I don’t even know

400
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,542
where my own future lies.

401
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
My plan doesn't include a kid.

402
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,542
I know.

403
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,292
It's not like

404
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:58,250
I'm going to make a kid right now.

405
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,917
We can make long-term plans.

406
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,083
Let's break up.

407
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,167
Why? I don't want to.

408
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:11,667
Let's break up before things get harder.

409
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:30,083
Mom?

410
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,208
This place is so hard to find.

411
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:37,167
I saw your live yesterday,
you're way too skinny now.

412
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,250
And this is…

413
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,583
your roommate?

414
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Hi Mrs. Pan, I'm Damian.

415
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,000
Jerry Pan.

416
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:48,875
Why was there a kid on your show

417
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,917
who called you Papa?

418
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,833
Mrs. Pan, the thing is

419
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:01,583
Kai is actually my child.

420
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,000
He has no mother.

421
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,958
And I'm very busy at work.

422
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,000
So Jerry usually takes care of him.

423
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,708
Jerry treats him as his own child.

424
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:11,333
So Kai would also call him Papa.

425
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:14,167
I'm really grateful.

426
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,333
I see.

427
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,917
Yes, Jerry has always liked children.

428
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:20,542
He is also very patient with them.

429
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:23,042
He used to help
take care of his little sister.

430
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,083
Oh, really?

431
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,208
I couldn't tell.

432
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:29,833
But

433
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,500
still have to teach your child
not to call him that.

434
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,750
It's easy to cause misunderstandings.

435
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:36,083
Sorry, I get it.

436
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:37,167
Ok, Mom.

437
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:39,375
Okay, I have to work later.

438
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,625
Wait.

439
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,875
Mian, Mian, look.

440
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,208
Let me show you.

441
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,875
This is the site I use

442
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,333
to help Jerry set up blind dates.

443
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,083
It's very useful. Take a look.

444
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,667
The girls inside

445
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:51,042
are both capable and beautiful.

446
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,000
You're a single father,
you should pick one.

447
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,708
- Sure.
- It's tough for you.

448
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:55,458
Am I right?

449
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:58,500
Mom, don't give others bad ideas.

450
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,375
Who's Mian?

451
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,250
You don't like it
doesn't mean others don't.

452
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,583
Mian, help me persuade him.

453
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:07,000
He's almost 30,

454
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,583
and still single.

455
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:09,958
I don't know when my husband and I

456
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,500
can be grandparents.

457
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,667
I know.

458
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:16,292
You really shouldn't be like this.

459
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,750
I'll help you persuade him.
