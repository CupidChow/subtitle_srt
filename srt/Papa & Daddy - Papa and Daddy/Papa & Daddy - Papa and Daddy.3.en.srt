1
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,750
This is so cute.

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:10,542
Look at this.

3
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:11,792
So cute.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,167
And his little hat.

5
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:19,042
Do you remember this?

6
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:20,917
Of course.

7
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:23,250
He was so tiny back then.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,042
So cute.

9
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:32,000
You sure we want to try again?

10
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:33,875
Of course.

11
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm fully prepared this time.

12
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:40,583
Kai must experience the parade.

13
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,000
Ya, his first parade.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,167
First parade.

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,300
(Papa & Daddy EP3. Taipei Pride)

16
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:17,542
Status report.

17
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:18,750
The first year.

18
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:22,000
Jerry's mom suddenly appeared
the day before the parade.

19
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,333
To stop her from finding out,
I took Kai out.

20
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,208
But then his mom

21
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,417
had a stomachache and slept over.

22
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:30,792
Jerry had to accompany her.

23
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,333
Kai and I had to wait till she left

24
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,542
to go back home.

25
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,500
We missed the parade completely.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,583
Solution 1: Mike's home.

27
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,250
Yes, what should we do?

28
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:44,500
We'll take Kai to your place
the day before.

29
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,583
Will you be ready?

30
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,208
Sir, yes, Sir.

31
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:50,708
My sister will stay home to keep Mom
occupied the day before.

32
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,000
You guys

33
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,583
take care of Kai for a few hours.

34
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:54,875
Till my mom's asleep,

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,167
and made sure won't show up.

36
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,000
We are ready.

37
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,042
Good.

38
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,042
The second year.

39
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,208
Kai brought his favorite toy out.

40
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,667
Halfway through

41
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:12,417
his toy

42
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,167
flew out the window.

43
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,917
He cried so hard.

44
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,458
We went back to find it.

45
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,167
It took us forever.

46
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:21,292
Missed the parade again.

47
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:22,292
Solution 2:

48
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:23,458
Sasa's place.

49
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:24,417
Yes, Sir.

50
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,208
I'll drive right behind you,

51
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,042
in case anything falls out of the car.

52
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,875
This is Kai's new favorite.

53
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:32,833
Pipi.

54
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,375
One, two.

55
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,125
We'll prepare extras in the car,

56
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,292
in case it drops and cannot be found,

57
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:40,458
or taken by aliens.

58
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,833
Then we can recover immediately.

59
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,625
There won't be any aliens that day.

60
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,667
You never know.

61
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:45,708
Okay.

62
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:46,750
Remember to take off the labels.

63
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,875
I'll pay you later.

64
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:51,333
Gay parade.

65
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,208
We will make it!

66
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,250
Gay parade.

67
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,375
Here comes Kai-Kai.

68
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,667
Cheers.

69
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,708
Kai's asleep?

70
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:32,958
Yes.

71
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,000
You're sure your mom's asleep,

72
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,625
and won't raid Taipei?

73
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,583
I'm sure.

74
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,375
Positive.

75
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,292
100%.

76
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:44,042
My sister kept an eye on her,

77
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:45,917
and she is sure.

78
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,917
Okay.

79
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,500
I'll take him into the room.

80
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:52,417
Okay.

81
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,708
Turn off the TV.

82
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
(Alarm)

83
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,792
Parade…

84
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,667
Must succeed.

85
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:40,417
Let's go see your pretty uncles and aunts later.

86
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:44,250
- They're really nice.
- The Rainbow Gathering.

87
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,333
How did you know?

88
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:51,250
Kai, the uncles and aunts are great,

89
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,750
because they're also brave like you.

90
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,292
Yes.

91
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:56,833
They will love you,

92
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:57,958
and care for you a lot.

93
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,000
It's so early, who could it be?

94
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,583
Can it be your mom?

95
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,250
What if she took an early morning ride?

96
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:17,917
My sister left in the middle of the night.

97
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,667
No one watched over her this morning.

98
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:24,958
What should we do?

99
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,417
Let me take a peek.

100
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:28,000
If it's really her,

101
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,667
we'll just pretend we're not home, okay?

102
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,375
Okay.

103
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:39,167
There's someone outside.

104
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,500
Open the door.

105
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,042
There's someone outside.

106
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:45,333
Open the door.

107
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,583
Parade.

108
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,792
Kai, go!

109
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,792
Finally succeeded.

110
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,542
You need to thank me

111
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,583
for keeping mom busy last night.

112
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,208
We took the early train this morning,
we're exhausted.

113
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,167
Ya, bro, I didn't sleep at all.

114
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,667
Alright, here…

115
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,708
- Go buy some food to eat.
- Thank you, Damian.

116
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,208
You're the best.

117
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:40,125
Your legs are sore, daddy hug.

118
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,250
Daddy, my legs are sore, too.

119
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,417
These two are exhausted.

120
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,375
I'm exhausted, too.

121
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,667
Let's find somewhere to rest?

122
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:01,833
Sure.

123
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,667
I know a nice shop nearby.

124
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,333
You lead the way.

125
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,000
Come with me.

126
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:08,917
Lead the way.

127
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:11,042
Let's go, let's go rest.

128
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,083
Go…

129
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,208
Isn't it pretty?

130
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,667
So beautiful.

131
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,125
This Barefoot Bubbly

132
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,792
is a rainbow sparkling wine to celebrate

133
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,250
equal rights and same-sex marriage.

134
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,458
I asked my friend to mail it
from the States,

135
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,500
the only one in Taiwan.

136
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,250
Thanks, hubby.

137
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,375
Can I really drink it?

138
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,042
Of course, open it up.

139
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:47,625
Yes.

140
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,833
Of course you can drink it.

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,292
Barefoot

142
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:51,458
is your favorite wine.

143
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,250
You haven't drunk much lately.

144
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:57,042
Alex's taking care of the kids today.

145
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,958
We can celebrate.

146
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:00,833
Drink.

147
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:01,875
No problem.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,042
I agree to drinking.

149
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,208
Then I'll drink a little.

150
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,667
But don’t push me.

151
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:10,000
We won’t.

152
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,750
No pushing.

153
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,917
Look at today's occasion.

154
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:17,042
Heartwarming.

155
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:20,583
I like that.

156
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:27,417
You're good.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,375
Cheers.

158
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,458
Let's play a game, okay?

159
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,417
Great.

160
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,208
Play what?

161
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,333
"Never have I ever".

162
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:40,833
Sure, cool.

163
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:41,833
I'll go first.

164
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:42,833
Okay.

165
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,250
I've never had a one-night stand.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,333
Be honest.

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,625
Who?

168
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,542
Hurry up and admit it.

169
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,167
I've never raised a son.

170
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:00,625
I've never been with someone older.

171
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,458
Fine, I'll drink.

172
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:10,708
I've never left someone for another person.

173
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,125
Fine.

174
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,250
Getting exciting.

175
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,417
Getting exciting.

176
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:17,250
I've never had sex in public.

177
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,500
You two.

178
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,125
I want to know.

179
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,833
I've never had a boyfriend.

180
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:31,625
This is too targeted.

181
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,708
This is too targeted.

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,792
1 2 3 4, go go.

183
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,500
You're too good at this.

184
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,750
Play 10 15.

185
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,750
- 10.
- 10.

186
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:43,958
- 10.
- 15.

187
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:44,958
10

188
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,083
- 10.
- 10.

189
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:49,792
How drunk are you?

190
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:50,542
50-50.

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,625
Everyone must toast to her.

192
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:01,833
We all have to.

193
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:02,375
Come on.

194
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,542
All together.

195
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,292
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

196
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,583
We should go back to the parade.

197
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,083
Time to go back.

198
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,083
Okay.

199
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,417
Finish the wine.

200
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,833
Finish the wine first.

201
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,208
Hubby, you go pick up Kai.

202
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,000
Hurry up.

203
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:24,833
Matt.

204
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,375
Okay, I'm going over now.

205
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,958
Okay, we're going back to the parade.

206
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,625
Parade.

207
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,458
Come on.

208
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,167
Thanks everyone.

209
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:02,708
I'm very happy that everyone

210
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,167
gathered here today because of love.

211
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,250
Later,

212
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,458
I'll pass the mic around.

213
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,792
When you get the mic,

214
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:12,167
you can make a wish for next year.

215
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,875
Does anyone want to make a wish?

216
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,208
Here's a pair of cute transnational couple.

217
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,500
Come on, make a wish.

218
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,500
I wish that our love is something

219
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,625
not just for pride,

220
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,500
but every day for the year to come.

221
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,542
Oh my gosh, so touching.

222
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,083
What about you?

223
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,292
Don't lose.

224
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,250
I hope our happiness can last very long.

225
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,375
Your "happiness" means sex, right?

226
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,167
You're good.

227
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,417
I hope gay adoption can be legalized.

228
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,458
Just like us.

229
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,458
Great, I want a kiss, too.

230
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,250
Here's another couple,

231
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,542
very cute and handsome.

232
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,792
I hope the person I love the most

233
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,333
can express their love loudly.

234
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,792
Love…

235
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:08,958
Love…

236
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,458
Wish you happy forever.

237
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,208
Baby, did you have fun today?

238
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,583
I haven't had this much fun in a long time.

239
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:25,792
Kai is so cute.

240
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:27,625
I love him so much.

241
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:29,417
Do you remember?

242
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,042
Every time Kai sees

243
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,583
street artists,

244
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:37,000
he runs over and take their mic.

245
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,167
Yes…

246
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,583
Those still performance artists,

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,958
he runs over and tickle them.

248
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,833
Like this?

249
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,250
Kai learned that from you.

250
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,833
Fine, I'll leave you alone.

251
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,792
Remember that time you got sick?

252
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:57,792
Of course I do.

253
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:02,667
He came to touch my forehead
every 3 minutes.

254
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,875
And took a bucket of ice
to reduce my fever.

255
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,292
My pillow was completely wet.

256
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:12,583
That's his way of showing love.

257
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:16,833
We are so happy.

258
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,292
So I must work harder,

259
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,583
to give Kai a better future.

260
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,625
And lots and lots of love.

261
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:30,667
And ice cream.

262
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,583
Kai.

263
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,708
Kai.

264
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,833
When was the last time you saw Kai?

265
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,625
He was walking with Sasa's kids

266
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,042
right behind us.

267
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,125
That was ten minutes ago.

268
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,750
Kai-Kai.

269
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,292
Kai-Kai.

270
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:54,333
Sorry.

271
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:55,208
Kai-Kai.

272
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:58,833
Kai-Kai.

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,667
Kai-Kai.

274
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,542
Sorry.

275
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:06,375
Kai-Kai.

276
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,000
Excuse me.

277
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:08,458
Excuse me.

278
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,500
Kai-Kai.

279
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,583
Kai-Kai.

280
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,792
Come on, hurry.

281
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,042
Sasa.

282
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,292
Sasa, have you seen Kai-Kai?

283
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:24,417
Was he with you?

284
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:25,000
No.

285
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,125
What's wrong?

286
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,958
Was Kai playing with you?

287
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:28,583
Yes.

288
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,417
Where's he now?

289
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,125
Where's he?

290
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,208
Did you see him?

291
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:31,708
Okay, hold on.

292
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:32,750
Matt, tell Mom.

293
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,458
Was Kai playing with you?

294
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,917
- Yes.
- Okay, then what?

295
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,125
Why weren't you playing after?

296
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,375
I want to take his Pipi.

297
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,292
He said he wants his Papa to protect him.

298
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,292
I should have protected him.

299
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:47,625
I didn't protect him.

300
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,083
We keep looking.

301
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,417
Keep looking.

302
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:52,167
Don't worry.

303
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:52,833
Kai-Kai.

304
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:53,917
Kai-Kai.

305
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,375
Kai-Kai.

306
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,208
Kai-Kai.

307
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:56,958
Kai-Kai.

308
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,000
Excuse me.

309
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,792
We just lost a little boy.

310
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,458
Four years old and about this height.

311
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,125
He was wearing denim shirt and jeans,

312
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:04,792
white shirt,

313
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,208
rainbow bowtie,

314
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,292
red shoes,

315
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,583
the Spider-Man kind.

316
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,375
Can you help us find him?

317
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:09,833
Please.

318
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:10,292
Thank you.

319
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:11,542
I'll ask the staff to make an announcement.

320
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:12,375
Hold on.

321
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:13,708
We lost a little boy.

322
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,167
This was his outfit.

323
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,208
Please broadcast it for me.

324
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:16,625
Okay.

325
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,875
May we have your attention, please.

326
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,292
We have a missing kid.

327
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,667
Hey, let's not panic.

328
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,917
Or you can think about

329
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,000
which route you've taken today,

330
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,250
and trace your way back.

331
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,000
We went to

332
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,458
watch the show, right?

333
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,167
Then that…

334
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,583
Cafe.

335
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:44,542
We'll go to the cafe.

336
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:45,542
Okay?

337
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:45,792
Let's go.

338
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:46,708
Thanks, Mike.

339
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,042
Let us know if you find him.

340
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:48,875
Be careful.

341
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,375
What happened, bro?

342
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:51,917
Kai's missing.

343
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,333
How?

344
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,875
Ok, calm down.

345
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,125
You calm down.

346
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,500
Let's call the cops.

347
00:16:58,917 --> 00:16:59,833
No.

348
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:00,833
If you call the cops, they'll kill him.

349
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,042
Don't you watch the news?

350
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,292
No one's killing him.

351
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:04,333
We're not rich.

352
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,667
No one's kidnapped him.

353
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,333
Did you set up any enemies at Verso?

354
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,292
Took others' money?

355
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:09,833
What are you talking about?
That's mpossible.

356
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,833
Stop fighting.

357
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,000
Do you guys have Kai's video or photos

358
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,042
from today?

359
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,875
Send it in the group, ask everyone to help.

360
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,333
Yes.

361
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,833
A lot of people came to the parade today.

362
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:18,542
Everyone can help.

363
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:19,042
Great.

364
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:19,667
Hurry.

365
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:20,292
Sasa,

366
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:21,542
could you trace back

367
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,000
the parade's route,

368
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:23,958
and see if you find Ka?

369
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,083
Of course.

370
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,292
Alex, you go over there.

371
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:27,458
We'll go this way.

372
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,833
I'll send it to you, thank you.

373
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,083
Kai.

374
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:37,417
Hi.

375
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,125
Hello.

376
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,583
I want to ask about your monthly fee.

377
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,958
Our usual monthly fee is 7 USD.

378
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,417
Today….

379
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:44,875
Free of charge.

380
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Free of charge.

381
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:47,833
How come there's a kid here?

382
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:49,792
- Little kid.
- Kai.

383
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:51,000
Where are your parents?

384
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:51,417
Over there.

385
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:53,083
Papa and Daddy are looking for you.

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,667
Kai, can you tell your uncles and aunts

387
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:56,792
that you're looking for us?

388
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,375
Are you saying this is your Daddy's voice?

389
00:17:59,500 --> 00:17:59,875
Yes.

390
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,875
You sure?

391
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,708
- Yes.
- Then hurry.

392
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,458
Ya, he's probably lost.

393
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,542
I need to take him to Information.

394
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,292
His jacket.

395
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,792
May I have your attention please.

396
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:12,083
We have a missing kid.

397
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,667
About four years old.

398
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,917
Wearing white shirt, denim jacket.

399
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:21,208
Kai.

400
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,000
Papa's so sorry.

401
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,542
Look at my Pipi.

402
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:27,667
You're probably the Dad.

403
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:28,583
Thank you.

404
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,292
Great.

405
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:29,958
Thank you.

406
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,083
You're welcome.

407
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,042
Kai, where were you?

408
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,417
I saved Pipi.

409
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,292
You saved Daddy.

410
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,750
Kai.

411
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:43,667
We were scared to death.

412
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,167
Thank you.

413
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:47,625
It's nothing.

414
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,917
My staff was too careless.

415
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,208
They were too focused on playing with him.

416
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,958
Forgot to think that a kid his age

417
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,500
being alone might mean he's lost.

418
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,333
I should be the one apologizing.

419
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,292
Kai, were you scared?

420
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:01,917
No.

421
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:02,792
Why?

422
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,708
Because everyone here
is very kind.

423
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,208
They played with me.

424
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:08,875
Wow.

425
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:11,958
- Thankfully he ran into you.
- Kai.

426
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:12,917
Thank you.

427
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:13,708
You're welcome.

428
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,500
Look who it is.

429
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:17,708
We were so scared.

430
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:18,750
Where's Kai?

431
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,292
How did you find him?

432
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,750
Fortunately he ran into them.

433
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,000
Thank you.

434
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,458
Kai, what do you want for dinner?

435
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,167
No ice cream,

436
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:40,292
only savory food.

437
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:42,333
I want ice cream with scrambled eggs.

438
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,917
Kai, that's so disgusting.

439
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,667
Baby, what do you want?

440
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:53,792
Hello, hello.

441
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
I'm Pipi.

442
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,625
- Hi, everyone.
- Kai, no.

443
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,667
Pipi will fall.

444
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,583
My Pipi fell.

445
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,250
Husband.

446
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,875
Stop.

447
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:01,500
Stop the car.

448
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,708
My Pipi.

449
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,292
I want my Pipi.

450
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,500
- Hello?
- Sir.

451
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,292
Don't worry.

452
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,000
We got it.

453
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,208
You've been behind us this whole time?

454
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,417
Yes, sir.

455
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,708
Here, Kai.

456
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,667
Kai, your Pipi.

457
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:25,208
Come one.

458
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,417
Kai, your Pipi.

459
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,333
Thank you.

460
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,208
- Kai, what's this?
- Your Pipi.

461
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:34,000
Thank you all.

462
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:34,417
Thank you.

463
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:35,708
It dropped.

464
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:36,542
Are you happy?

465
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,333
Are you happy?

466
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,583
Fortunately they picked him up.

467
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,583
I know.

468
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,333
- Thank you.
- Group hug.
