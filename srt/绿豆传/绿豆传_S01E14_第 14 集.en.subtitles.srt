1
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,420
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,921
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,971
Do you...

4
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,018
know...

5
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,437
who I am?

6
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,628
Go.

7
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,883
I said, go!

8
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,924
Guard Yeon.

9
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,176
What are you doing here?

10
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,722
She was not at the inn,
so I was looking for her.

11
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,599
Pardon?

12
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,853
She just ran away.

13
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,982
-I am sure she ran this way.
-No one came here.

14
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,401
I will search around here.

15
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,154
So take your troops and go that way.

16
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,906
Okay.

17
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,785
By the way,

18
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,248
why did you not bring
any police bureau officers?

19
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,168
Even if you are after a mere girl--

20
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,502
I had to come urgently.

21
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,005
You should hurry off.

22
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,304
Let us go.

23
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,874
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

24
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,002
-We are still searching, so I am sure--
-Forget it.

25
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,340
She is just a little girl.
What can she do on her own?

26
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,301
She will get caught soon.

27
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,806
You may leave now.

28
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,312
Do you have more to say?

29
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,732
No, Your Majesty.

30
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,251
I want you to secretly
investigate Guard Yeon.

31
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,212
Find out where he lives,
whom he meets, what he does,

32
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,506
and about his hometown
in the south of the country.

33
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,008
I want to know everything about him.

34
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,262
Let me know right away
if you find anything suspicious.

35
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,139
Okay.

36
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,532
GWANGHWAMUN GATE

37
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,726
His Majesty must have
left the palace by now.

38
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,436
Yes.

39
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,272
He must be out of the capital,
Your Highness.

40
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,274
I see.

41
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,027
Then let us return to the palace,
Court Lady Kim.

42
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,154
Pardon?

43
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,740
I must meet him.

44
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,960
Your Highness.

45
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,215
Free him now.

46
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,300
I will take

47
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,469
full responsibility.

48
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,445
Do you have something to say to me?

49
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,280
No, Your Majesty.

50
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,075
Then why do you keep staring at me?

51
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,662
It did not mean anything.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

52
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,623
You do not need to be nervous
just because we are outside the palace.

53
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,125
You can act as usual.

54
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,087
Yes, Your Majesty.

55
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,881
What do you mean he is with His Majesty?

56
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,967
After he found out everything,

57
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,386
he joined the trip
as His Majesty's royal guard.

58
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,971
"His Majesty's royal guard"?

59
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,607
The chief administrative officer
gave me this?

60
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,610
Yes, he is now a royal guard.

61
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,280
Is that so?

62
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,241
How grateful.

63
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,618
His royal guard?

64
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,788
Then the chief administrative officer
from that night...

65
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,172
I am a chief administrative officer
at the police bureau.

66
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,676
However, I lost my hat
somewhere in the palace.

67
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,472
Yes.

68
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,561
He is His Majesty's son
whom I saved 20 years ago.

69
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:08,065
Then why is he with His Majesty
even when he knows everything?

70
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,233
That means...

71
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,405
Therefore, you cannot join me.

72
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,451
I will stop him,
so stay somewhere safe, Your Highness.

73
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,955
Your Highness, we must leave now.

74
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,716
Be careful.

75
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,261
And this may sound shameless,

76
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,264
but please keep

77
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,309
my son safe.

78
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,488
Your Majesty, do you feel ill?

79
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,866
You must be tired since you have not
been out of the palace in a long time.

80
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,496
His Majesty traveled all over the country
when he was the Crown Prince.

81
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,956
So you do not need to worry.

82
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,458
During the Japanese invasion,

83
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,044
he even stayed in a thatched cottage
on countless occasions.

84
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,588
Am I wrong, Your Majesty?

85
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,802
Of course, I do know that.

86
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,845
I was with His Majesty back then.

87
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,892
He gave great courage and hope
to the people in suffering.

88
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,521
Is that so?

89
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:20,150
Yes, you risked your life
to protect the country and people.

90
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:25,030
Knowing that they were not abandoned
helped them through the harsh times.

91
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,869
How could I abandon my people
who were like my own children?

92
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,248
I only did what was right.

93
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,003
Therefore,

94
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,797
I must kill

95
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,509
-that boy.
-Your Majesty.

96
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,596
He is your son.

97
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,641
You already tried to kill him once,
but he survived!

98
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,477
He is your son, Your Majesty!

99
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,439
He should not have lived!
He should not have survived!

100
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,067
What are you doing?

101
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,738
I must keep an eye on the outside.

102
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,158
I apologize, Your Majesty,
but may I excuse myself?

103
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,619
How dare you act this way
in front of His Majesty?

104
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,999
Old stories from aged people
could be boring for him.

105
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,669
You may leave.

106
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,518
I miss her so much.

107
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,486
Nok...

108
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,746
Dong-ju.

109
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,261
Have you lost your mind?

110
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,847
How could you leave like that?

111
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,435
Since we will stay here another night,

112
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,978
I had to check the retreat in advance.

113
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,190
I know that,
but do you have to do that now?

114
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,277
Anyway,

115
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,197
make sure you are there before 10 p.m.--

116
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,657
I clearly told you that
I have everything under control.

117
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,831
Okay. Let us go back inside.

118
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,881
What is the matter?

119
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,925
Is someone here?

120
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,135
Who could be out here?

121
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,845
Let us go inside.

122
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,769
Your Majesty!

123
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,443
Jung Yun-jeo has

124
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,029
escaped from prison, Your Majesty.

125
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,948
How could a sinner escape from prison?

126
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,874
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

127
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,964
It appears that the Queen set him free

128
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,133
and disappeared with him.

129
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,509
What?

130
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,429
How dare they?

131
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,071
Your Majesty.

132
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,926
They are trying to get rid of me
and get that brute on the throne.

133
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,262
On my very throne.

134
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,976
Send a messenger to tell them
to put more guards around the palace

135
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,728
and find the escaped sinner and the Queen.

136
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,065
I must head to Hanyang right now.

137
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,109
Yes, Your Majesty.

138
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:31,415
Your Majesty,
what about the prearranged ritual?

139
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,167
Which way is the fastest route to Hanyang?

140
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,461
The fastest way is
to climb over that mountain.

141
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,088
Then let us go that way.

142
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,924
Let us not waste a single moment.

143
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,677
-Hurry.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,826
Our route has changed.

145
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,163
I want you to take the lead
and make sure nothing happens.

146
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,789
-Yes, master.
-Yes, master.

147
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,136
Put down your weapon.

148
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,843
Did we not meet yesterday?

149
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,932
I guess we are heading the same way.

150
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,351
You're against the royal troops.

151
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,270
So it cannot be an honorable path.

152
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,857
Talk about yourself.

153
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,986
It seems like you and I are
in the same situation.

154
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,076
You had better stop following them.

155
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,788
You do not seem gifted with such skills.

156
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,331
What about you?

157
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,583
Are you a gifted warrior?

158
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,338
I am not here to hurt anyone.

159
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,007
I am here to protect someone I love.

160
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,510
Is that

161
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,471
-the King?
-Then why I would

162
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,348
have killed his guard?

163
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,811
Then I do not care what you do.

164
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,980
Just do not get in my way.

165
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,401
What you are about to do is impossible.
Do you know that?

166
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:09,030
Even if you succeed, you will not survive.

167
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,118
Do you still wish to do it?

168
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,997
I am doing it because I must.

169
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,418
I promised my last mother

170
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,796
that I will take revenge for my family.

171
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:30,844
You promised your mother
that you would kill someone?

172
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,724
Yes.

173
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,768
So just turn a blind eye on this.

174
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,855
-Please.
-You are lying.

175
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,900
No parents would wish that
upon their child.

176
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,152
What?

177
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,321
No matter how wrongful their death was,

178
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,866
they would never ask their surviving child
to kill someone for revenge.

179
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,495
No parents would do such a thing.

180
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,415
-What do you know?
-I know well enough.

181
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,628
I am a parent myself,
and that scares me the most.

182
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,381
I am scared

183
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:12,636
that my son might waste
his precious life on mere revenge

184
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,764
and that he might ruin himself.

185
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,322
I am sure your family

186
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,577
wanted at least you
to lead a happy and peaceful life,

187
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,040
rather than living in misery for revenge.

188
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,460
That is what parents are like.

189
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,802
Wake up.

190
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,554
Wake up, Eun-seo.

191
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,726
Stay alive.

192
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,729
Promise me.

193
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,232
You must...

194
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,027
You must stay alive and...

195
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,949
Mother.

196
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,827
Do not be sorry.

197
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,414
And do not be sad

198
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,750
for too long.

199
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,799
Forget about this terrible tragedy.

200
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,304
Forget about it all

201
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,934
and stay alive no matter what, my baby.

202
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,855
Mother.

203
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,150
My baby.

204
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,862
My Eun-seo.

205
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,124
Mother.

206
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,338
Mother!

207
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,094
Mother.

208
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,607
She told me not to be sorry

209
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,028
and forget about everything.

210
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,156
But how?

211
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,869
They died right before my eyes.

212
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,581
They all left me behind.

213
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,377
How can I possibly live happily?

214
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,712
How?

215
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,632
What am I supposed to do?

216
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,309
I am sorry.

217
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,895
I should not have been too nosy.

218
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,985
But I hope you ponder upon what I said.

219
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,488
Think if you really want to do this.

220
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,541
-Your Majesty.
-What happened?

221
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,670
The bridge leading to the village
suddenly collapsed.

222
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,799
So most of the subjects and soldiers
are taking a detour around the mountain.

223
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,386
Since the sun will set soon,
and it is also raining,

224
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,346
it will take them more than a night.

225
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,099
Thus, you must sleep here tonight.

226
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:32,103
Whatever the case,
I will get going the moment they arrive.

227
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

228
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,776
You broke the bridge
to trap him inside the village?

229
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,111
You came up with a clever idea.

230
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,905
It would not have been possible

231
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,907
without the guards you brought
to keep an eye on me.

232
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,575
So I should thank you.

233
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,286
Anyway, you must hurry.

234
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,372
We must abduct the King
before the rest of the group arrives.

235
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,833
Leave it to me
and just send word to Hanyang.

236
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,961
Tell them to proceed as planned
since I will be there in time.

237
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,259
That darn little...

238
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,149
I am sure your family

239
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,986
wanted you to lead
a happy and peaceful life,

240
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,783
rather than living in misery for revenge.

241
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,329
That is what parents are like.

242
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,667
He knows nothing at all.

243
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,557
Wait.

244
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,519
Why did they tighten the security
at the palace?

245
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,523
Are you afraid?

246
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,483
No, that is not it.

247
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,444
It is time for you to man up
now that we have come this far.

248
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,239
Do not worry.

249
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,242
Our plan will go as planned.

250
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,412
What is that?

251
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,764
We have a situation.

252
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,767
-Open the gate.
-Pardon?

253
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,978
This is treason.
There are soldiers outside.

254
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,313
It is a reformation.

255
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,860
I also took part
in planning this reformation.

256
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,156
Whoever wishes to risk their lives
to protect the current King

257
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,202
will have to step forward
and kill me first.

258
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,167
Is the King really worth your life?

259
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,921
Open the gate now!

260
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,593
Why did you have to be born

261
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,762
on the 19th of November?

262
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,057
Why does it have to be today?

263
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,814
You are here.

264
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,739
I heard you asked for me, Your Majesty.

265
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,074
I wanted to drink with you.

266
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,160
Have a seat.

267
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,420
Drink up.

268
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,223
One drink would not hurt.

269
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,517
No, I cannot.

270
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,065
I suppose I did the right thing
to choose you as my royal guard.

271
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,736
Did you send word to your family?

272
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,781
You passed the exam and even got promoted.

273
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,162
No, I did not yet.

274
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,208
Your father must be very stubborn

275
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,419
seeing that you are still hesitant.

276
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:51,964
He is also

277
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,426
very benevolent and warm-hearted.

278
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,679
I am nothing but an undutiful son,

279
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,265
but he is still always...

280
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,067
It is pleasant to see

281
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,695
how you and your father
are fond of each other.

282
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,699
I envy you.

283
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,960
I was always scared of my father.

284
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,256
Since it felt like walking on thin ice,

285
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,882
I always held my breath

286
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,094
and stayed on my toes.

287
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,057
I thought I was scared

288
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,936
that he might abandon me.

289
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,524
Come to think of it,

290
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,694
I was simply

291
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:01,534
trying to find favor in his eye
at least once.

292
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,456
At least just once.

293
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:17,842
I know.

294
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,971
I do not deserve to say this.

295
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,976
If I had never found out

296
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:33,524
and had lived with my son
growing fondness for each other...

297
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,736
Do you

298
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,363
regret it?

299
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,827
The ice shattered long ago.

300
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,039
I have already been struggling
enough in freezing water.

301
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,167
It is useless to regret it now.

302
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,299
I should get some rest.

303
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,706
At this rate, the royal troops
that we barely threw off

304
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,166
will arrive here soon.

305
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,337
Are you getting second thoughts?

306
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,509
You must have gotten cold feet
since your father--

307
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,388
Who says he is my father?

308
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,349
If I could do things my way,
I would kill him now.

309
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,101
But I am barely holding it back.

310
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,145
Unless you wish to die instead,
keep your mouth shut.

311
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,066
Are you crazy?

312
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,236
The King must arrive at the palace alive.
Are you trying to ruin this?

313
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,572
If you want to succeed in your revolt
using the absurd pretext of yours,

314
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,157
just stay still.

315
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,993
"Stay still"?

316
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,203
What will you do if I do not stay still?

317
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:13,582
What? Will you really kill the King here?

318
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,751
You must be out of your mind.

319
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,965
That little...

320
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,896
Your Highness.

321
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:37,857
Let us go.

322
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,670
The soldiers are on our side now,
and we stopped the messenger from leaving.

323
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,673
We also brought the Queen Dowager
to the palace.

324
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,267
Now, as soon as
your brother to do his job,

325
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,436
this country will see a new king.

326
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,104
Once you become the King,

327
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,774
will you keep the promise you made me?

328
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,318
That is also up to your brother.

329
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,532
If Nok-du does his job,
and the revolt succeeds--

330
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,950
I will kill him.

331
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,370
As I told you.

332
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,665
What is wrong?

333
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,959
Does that bother you?

334
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,339
No.

335
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,925
You just need to keep your promise.

336
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,893
Your Majesty. This is Officer Baek.

337
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,645
Yes.

338
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,482
Come in.

339
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,164
What is it?

340
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,750
Well...

341
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,754
-The thing is...
-Tell me.

342
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,132
Did you find the sinner and the Queen?

343
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,470
No, that is not it.

344
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,849
It is regarding Guard Yeon.

345
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,578
Yeon Su

346
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,581
is dead?

347
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,708
Yes.

348
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,212
His family must not have known

349
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,214
since they lost touch with him.

350
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,551
But he died of an illness a long time ago.

351
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,718
Then

352
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,887
what about my royal guard?

353
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,182
Who in the world is he?

354
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,101
Since he seemed suspicious,

355
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,604
I looked into Yoo Yeon-gyeong
and his family.

356
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,357
As I looked into his surroundings,

357
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,402
I came across a name.

358
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:05,499
Nok-du?

359
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,670
Did you just say "Nok-du"?

360
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,548
Yes, Your Majesty.

361
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,051
He was called by that name.

362
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,354
-So my royal guard is--
-I think he is your son

363
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,066
who was raised by Jung Yun-jeo.

364
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,405
No way.

365
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,742
That is impossible.

366
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,578
-Your Majesty.
-I must see him.

367
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,372
I must ask him myself.

368
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,208
Bring him here.

369
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,253
Yes, Your Majesty.

370
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,976
Something seems to be on your mind.

371
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,606
Yes, there is.

372
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,192
There is something I must find out

373
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,069
but do not wish to find out
at the same time.

374
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,946
And I am scared I might actually find out.

375
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,451
-Come on. Hurry.
-My goodness.

376
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,580
We are close enough to ignore
the customs of the palace.

377
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,833
Is that so, Your Majesty?

378
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,627
Why

379
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,630
are you crying?

380
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,185
No, Your Majesty.

381
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,148
I trusted him

382
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,444
with all my heart.

383
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:00,989
How could he?

384
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:03,742
How dare he?

385
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,889
How dare he fool me
when he is staying by my side?

386
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,560
But...

387
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,813
Your Majesty.

388
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,005
We cannot afford to delay any longer.

389
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,757
Let us take the King ourselves.

390
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,051
Kill Guard Yeon the moment you see him.

391
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,596
And kill everyone who gets in our way.

392
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,475
Let us go.

393
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,749
Chief Royal Secretary.

394
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,752
Yes, Your Majesty. It is me.

395
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,963
It is very late.

396
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,716
You should not be somewhere so dangerous.

397
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,094
It is none of your business.

398
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,723
But who are all these men?

399
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,767
It is my business.

400
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:57,564
Because I must take you to the palace
without anyone knowing it.

401
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,108
By tonight.

402
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,569
What did you just say?

403
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,310
Chief Royal Secretary, is that you?

404
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:50,993
Your Majesty.

405
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,078
It is me.

406
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,080
You...

407
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,749
You are Dong-ju.

408
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,377
What are you doing here?

409
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,088
And why are you dressed like that?

410
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,090
Will you please

411
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,135
throw that sword down the cliff?

412
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,636
What?

413
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,347
What are you talking about?

414
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,020
Please.

415
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,739
Then I will answer your questions.

416
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,199
If not...

417
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,014
Your Majesty!

418
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:55,766
Your Majesty!

419
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,268
Your Majesty!

420
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,145
Your Majesty!

421
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,648
Your Majesty!

422
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,234
Keep looking.

423
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,944
Okay.

424
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,457
Your Majesty!

425
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,584
Your Majesty!

426
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,671
Your Majesty!

427
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,570
There.

428
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,325
Now, tell me why you are doing this to me.

429
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,285
First of all,

430
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,788
my name is

431
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,290
Yoo Eun-seo.

432
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,543
"Yoo Eun-seo"?

433
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,045
Not only did you kill my entire family
for committing treason,

434
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,340
but you even dug up their graves.

435
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,260
Yoo Yeon-gyeong?

436
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,596
Then are you

437
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,308
the only survivor of his family?

438
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,436
Yes.

439
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,479
He was my grandfather,

440
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,525
who always told me

441
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,361
to do everything I want despite my gender.

442
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,206
You lost your family at a young age.

443
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,752
So you must have lived a tough life.

444
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,004
Thanks to you, Your Majesty.

445
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,592
Who knew I would have
to make my own arrow and shoot it.

446
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,012
So you could kill me?

447
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,389
Yes.

448
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,856
So is that why you approached me
just like him?

449
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,441
Tell me.

450
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:12,027
Did you collude with him to get rid of me?

451
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,571
What are you saying?

452
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,617
Do you think I killed your grandfather
even though he was innocent?

453
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,244
No. If I had not killed him,

454
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,915
he would have killed me
and replaced me with a new king.

455
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:26,875
That was

456
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,921
the kind of world
your grandfather and I had to live in.

457
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:36,051
Look who is after my throne!

458
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,428
It is my own son!

459
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,556
My son whom I thought was dead!

460
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,812
What did you just say?

461
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,022
Nok-du is whom?

462
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,316
The person who killed your family

463
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,863
and completely ruined your life.

464
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,782
The darn king

465
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:02,869
whom you loathe
and desperately wish to kill!

466
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,789
He is...

467
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,709
He is the king's son.

468
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,213
So I am going to set things straight.

469
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,383
I must protect my father.

470
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,554
Do you think I will not let that happen?

471
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,140
I will kill him first. It cannot be hard.

472
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,268
There is no reason not to kill him twice.

473
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,479
You will kill your own son?

474
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:32,190
Yes.

475
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,819
I will kill every single person

476
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,281
who tries to steal my throne.

477
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,454
Does Nok-du also know

478
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,041
that you think of him this way?

479
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,335
I am sure he knows it very well.

480
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,755
While he secretly approached me
and aimed at me,

481
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,300
he saw and heard everything.

482
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,110
You are crazy.

483
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:24,951
Yes.

484
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,955
That is the only way to endure the throne.

485
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,626
For the longest time,

486
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,004
I dreamed of killing you.

487
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,799
I thought I would feel relieved
and unburdened.

488
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,385
But I was wrong.

489
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,265
I cannot believe wasted all these years

490
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,559
and even hurt him

491
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,312
just to kill a brute like you.

492
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,066
What did you just say?

493
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,693
You may be the King

494
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,571
who has everyone at your feet.

495
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,700
But you are already dead inside.

496
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,828
You trust no one,

497
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,164
and no one trusts you.

498
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,708
You are nothing but an empty shell.

499
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,474
You do not

500
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,101
even deserve to die.

501
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,249
Have you seen His Majesty?

502
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,209
He went out looking for you.

503
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,798
I have something to tell you.

504
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,067
Your Highness, we have a situation.

505
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,572
Prince Neungyang is trying
to usurp the throne?

506
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,033
His Majesty fell down the cliff,

507
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,953
and the palace has been seized
by the rebel forces?

508
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,081
Yes, while people search for His Majesty,

509
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,667
I must head to the palace
to get there in time

510
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,294
along with you
and the rest of the soldiers.

511
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:13,508
Right now, our priority is
to find His Majesty and stop the treason.

512
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:17,595
Send a messenger and tell them
to gather soldiers nearby.

513
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,640
You must do it as fast as possible
so they can arrive at the palace

514
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,351
-while we buy time.
-If this is all true,

515
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,688
the soldiers we have here
are nowhere near enough.

516
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,690
I know.

517
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,775
We will do our best to hold out.

518
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:15,862
Good work.

519
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:41,054
What do you think you are doing?

520
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,266
I am here to get rid of all the traitors.

521
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,561
Whoever regrets your choice,
come forward now.

522
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,063
I promise I will show you mercy.

523
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,316
No one?

524
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,444
Well then, so be it.

525
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,488
Come inside.

526
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,444
I am sorry.

527
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,863
I had no idea you were alive.

528
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,700
How can they serve a king
with an unknown past?

529
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,035
Did you not spend most of your time
at the kisaeng house?

530
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,499
Father, I do not want
to live in hiding again.

531
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:53,835
Let us leave the palace. If we stay here--

532
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,130
Father!

533
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,465
Why would you come here?

534
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,717
I will follow wherever you go

535
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,010
even if it is a battlefield
or a fiery pit.

536
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,596
I told you.

537
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,141
I can no longer live without you.

538
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:11,352
