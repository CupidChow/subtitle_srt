1
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,253
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,796
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,300
Oh, my goodness!

4
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,723
How dare you?

5
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,645
-You darn punk.
-Come here.

6
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,401
-How dare you?
-My gosh, please stop.

7
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,070
-Enough.
-Do not hurt me.

8
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,822
I am a human being.

9
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,366
Shut your mouth.
You are no better than an animal.

10
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,369
Just because you are wearing
a nice outfit does not mean you are human!

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,162
"A nice outfit"?

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,250
-Vice-Curator Yeon.
-Why...

13
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,216
Did you drink?

14
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,927
Who is this?

15
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,721
Yes, I did.

16
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,057
I finally met the woman of my dreams,

17
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,143
so how could I not drink?

18
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,980
By the way,

19
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,483
where do you keep your winged clothes?

20
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,651
My gosh, I should just...

21
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,826
-Sun-nyeo.
-Sun-nyeo.

22
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:44,122
He tends to lose his memory
when he gets drunk.

23
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,626
It looks like he lost his life.

24
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,588
He got drunk and tripped,

25
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,923
and we just happened to find him here.

26
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,932
Right. Okay.

27
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,810
I will go along with that.

28
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,829
Why do you keep glancing at me?

29
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,083
I know everything.

30
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,377
Know what?

31
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,590
I know why you utterly refused
to join us in the water.

32
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,134
What? How...

33
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,513
To be honest, I am also just like you.

34
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,141
What? You are just like me?

35
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,894
It is okay

36
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,356
to have small breasts.

37
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,693
-What?
-What matters is your heart.

38
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,073
Do not let yourself get intimidated
just because you have small breasts.

39
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,117
You need to be confident, okay?

40
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,039
My heart... You're right.

41
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,466
The corpse disappeared?

42
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,009
WE FOLLOWED AND POISONED HIM

43
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,094
Yes.

44
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,638
It was gone when they got there.

45
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,225
But I was told that he died.

46
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,813
He pretended to be dead
and went after the Muwol Corps.

47
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,189
Then is he at the widow village?

48
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,608
But men aren't allowed in there.

49
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,069
He could be at the kisaeng house
or hiding somewhere nearby.

50
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,988
Tell them to search everywhere.

51
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,907
What happened to His Majesty's vassal
at the island?

52
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,617
They were sent to other places.

53
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,077
Only the Muwol Corps remains.

54
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,871
So our secret is safe with us.

55
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,207
What about those
who ran away from the island?

56
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,543
The widows across the country
will start looking for them.

57
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,961
So it will not take long.

58
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,381
We need to find every single one of them.
Do you understand?

59
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,716
Yes, master.

60
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,685
You have such a tenacious life.

61
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,646
Why did you have to show up again?

62
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,815
Why now?

63
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,652
What? You saw whom?

64
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,363
Jung Yun-jeo. I am sure it was him.

65
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,533
I went there to help the people in need,

66
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,869
and you have no idea
how startled I was when I saw him.

67
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,705
Yun-jeo died during the war.

68
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,082
Exactly.

69
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,668
That is why I looked again to check.

70
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,087
But it was definitely him.

71
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,051
You were probably mistaken.

72
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,844
You should not say that to other people.

73
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,305
People will think
you are talking nonsense.

74
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,393
His Majesty actually seemed very happy
to hear about him.

75
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,900
You told His Majesty already?

76
00:05:58,983 --> 00:05:59,984
Yes, of course.

77
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,944
Just like you,

78
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,990
His Majesty was also
very good friends with him.

79
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,190
Are you okay?

80
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,240
Once we reach the shore,
I will head to Hanyang.

81
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,826
-I want you to stay with General Hwang--
-No.

82
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,371
The assassins came
after your trip to the mainland.

83
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,707
If you go to Hanyang,
they will chase after you again.

84
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,176
Where is the drugstore?

85
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,389
-Excuse me. Where is the drugstore?
-Go that way.

86
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,935
Are you not Jung Yun-jeo?

87
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,981
No, you must be mistaken.

88
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,691
It's me, Lee In-woo.

89
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,943
We fought together
during the Japanese invasion.

90
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,613
But I heard you died back then.

91
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,198
How is this possible?

92
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,492
I told you you are mistaken!

93
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,916
I should have been more careful.

94
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,839
-But you do not need to worry--
-Do you really think

95
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,843
the secret will stay hidden forever
as long as you bring Nok-du back?

96
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,807
You should get some sleep.

97
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:09,322
My goodness,
I have not visited my hometown in ages.

98
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,203
It is deep in the mountains,

99
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,538
so it will be hard to find you.

100
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,209
Thank you. And I am sorry
that I put you through this.

101
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,168
My goodness.

102
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,212
Why would you apologize?

103
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,881
We are going to be in-laws in the future.

104
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,883
Is that not right?

105
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,395
Jung Yun-jeo was not there?

106
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,439
No, Your Majesty.

107
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,317
I searched the Kangryang Harbor
and nearby islands,

108
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,735
but he was nowhere to be found.

109
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,321
I think he was mistaken.

110
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,156
Is that so?

111
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,202
I thought my old friend had died
during the Japanese invasion,

112
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,621
so I was excited to find out
he is still alive.

113
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,998
But what a pity.

114
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,918
You may go now.

115
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,990
Are you going to sleep wearing that?

116
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,700
Your clothes are all wet.

117
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,830
Then

118
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,791
can you give me a towel?

119
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,134
Can you also lend me a pair of underpants
that you do not wear?

120
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,814
Can you wait outside
until I finish getting changed?

121
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,276
My gosh, you ask for so many things.

122
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,195
I really hate people like you.

123
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,990
You should know
how to take care of yourself.

124
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,787
Wait.

125
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:27,501
Can you get me a cup of warm water?

126
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,676
She does not even know
that I saved her life.

127
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,267
That blanket is mine. This is yours.

128
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,477
Oh, really?

129
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,480
-Then you can use mine.
-I do not want to.

130
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,440
Then can you wait outside? I will--

131
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,817
My gosh, let us just go to bed.

132
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,323
Gosh, will you stop that?

133
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,742
What? Stop what?

134
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,203
Stop taking off your clothes
without telling me.

135
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,954
Will you please give me a heads up?

136
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,207
Why don't I just tell everyone
in the marketplace in advance?

137
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,584
It is basic manners
to get changed outside, is it not?

138
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,214
Hey, listen to me. This is my room.

139
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,132
So you want me to wait outside
when you get changed

140
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,884
and go outside again
when I need to get changed?

141
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,387
Do not touch me.

142
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,725
Hey, what--

143
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,311
If you think about it,
this room belongs to Madam Chun,

144
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,604
not you.

145
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,244
If you hate me so much,
why not just sleep outside?

146
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,995
If I sleep outside,

147
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,625
my face will be paralyzed.

148
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,683
Stop it.

149
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,310
Hey, if you sleep here,
your face will be paralyzed.

150
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,188
Whatever. I am not going home.

151
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,238
This island is too small
to run away from home.

152
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,115
Are you not sick of doing this?

153
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,243
Go home. Mom will be worried.

154
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,536
She is worried about you, too.

155
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,830
Let us go back inside.

156
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,543
Do you really think so?

157
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,340
It is not like I ran away to the mainland.

158
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,177
You were sick,
so I got on the fishing boat instead.

159
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,928
Dad did not have to cause
a huge fuss about it.

160
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,516
Nok-du.

161
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,977
Dad has a reason behind everything.

162
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,396
You know that, right?

163
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,231
Then why can he not just
tell me the reason?

164
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,233
Then I will give up
or do something about it.

165
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,777
Hey, are you really going to give up
moving to the mainland

166
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,738
and becoming a general?

167
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,156
Seriously...

168
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,240
No.

169
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,288
-What is wrong?
-What is this?

170
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,372
-Nok-du.
-What is it?

171
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,499
Look at my face.

172
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,542
My gosh, what is your problem?

173
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,211
If you sleep here,
you will look like this.

174
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,837
-I am not going home.
-Let us go.

175
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,255
-Gosh, let's go.
-No, I am not going.

176
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,007
-Oh, gosh!
-What is wrong?

177
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,550
-My goodness.
-What is the matter?

178
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,968
Look at my face.

179
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,512
My gosh.

180
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,973
-Come on. Let us go home.
-Okay, let me stay for a bit longer.

181
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,558
Gosh, forget it.

182
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,769
-Your face will be paralyzed.
-Whatever.

183
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,187
-It will be paralyzed.
-I do not care.

184
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,283
That cannot be.

185
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,619
I saw him collapse with my own two eyes.

186
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,704
If he drank that poison,
he would have died on the spot.

187
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,749
The fact that he is still alive
means he fooled us on purpose.

188
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,544
Was there not a guy who got kicked out

189
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,671
while trying to enter our village?

190
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,048
There are tons of jerks
who try to enter our village.

191
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,551
That was the day that Deul-re came back.

192
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,594
-Do you think--
-I will kill him right now.

193
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,013
This is not just your mission anymore.

194
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,307
We all need to get involved.

195
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,893
Let us stick to the orders.

196
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,078
You should apologize for bumping into me.

197
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,788
You darn brat.

198
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,180
BREWERY

199
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,754
As you all know,

200
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,256
we failed to accomplish our last mission
for the first time.

201
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,926
But those people were not
corrupt officials or aristocrats.

202
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,385
So why did we need to kill them?

203
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,305
She is right. It was very unlikely of us.

204
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,891
Who gave us such orders?

205
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,852
Only our boss knows the answer to that.

206
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,897
-My goodness.
-Who could it be?

207
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,982
Only the boss knows?

208
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,651
Who is their boss?

209
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,987
What's important is that one of those guys

210
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,531
followed us to the widow village.

211
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,535
He will probably try to enter the village
when it is dark.

212
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:58,582
So we should stand guard
for the village and the kisaeng house.

213
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,753
The Virtuous Women Corps
are already protecting the village.

214
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,505
He is a very skilled man.

215
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,050
The Virtuous Women Corps
take turns patrolling the village.

216
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,719
But they're not trained in martial arts,
so we will need to help.

217
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,098
Search all the places
where he might be hiding.

218
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,808
And check the kisaeng house
extra carefully

219
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,476
since lots of people come and go there.

220
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,938
Here is a composite sketch Deul-re drew.

221
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,691
-"A composite sketch"?
-Memorize what he looks like.

222
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,452
I will leave you to it.
I need to go to meet our boss.

223
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,469
What are you doing there?

224
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,388
Do you not need to meet the boss?

225
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,725
Yes. I just thought I heard something.

226
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,601
It was probably me.

227
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,730
Do you think so? Okay then. See you.

228
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,589
Who...

229
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,234
This way!

230
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,924
Are you the new widow?

231
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,886
Where are you coming from?

232
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,888
It is very late.

233
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,974
I woke up because of the noise.

234
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,976
So I went outside to take a walk.

235
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,144
What noise?

236
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,983
My roommate talks in her sleep
way too much.

237
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,654
Dong-ju?

238
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,283
I heard she turns even nastier
when she gets drunk.

239
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,162
I do not think
I will ever be drinking with her...

240
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,539
But

241
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,293
where are you two coming from
dressed like this?

242
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,632
We sometimes help out with the work.

243
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,718
It helps us make some extra money.
Am I right?

244
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,181
I will be off then.

245
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,688
I should have seen their boss.

246
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,865
What is wrong?

247
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:44,910
Nothing.

248
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,925
An unknown man showed up

249
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,719
at the widow village last night
and caused a huge uproar.

250
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,430
My goodness, a man tried
to enter the widow village?

251
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,891
Yes. He must have done something terrible

252
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,935
seeing that the widows are after him.

253
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,103
I hope they catch him.

254
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,064
Whoever that guy is,
he is one terrible punk.

255
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,611
Here.

256
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,782
Hey.

257
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,821
Hwa-su, who is he?

258
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,073
You must have never seen him before.

259
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,159
He is Joseon's best--

260
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,285
Swordsman?

261
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,579
Pushover.

262
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,414
He is Joseon's best pushover.

263
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,832
He is Lord Cha's friend,

264
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,584
and he is extremely loyal to Lord Cha.

265
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,128
He is the best pushover ever.

266
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:34,186
Gosh, I thought he came
to relay the royal command or something.

267
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,647
Unbelievable.

268
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,239
It is sweet and cold.

269
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,116
Have a bite before it melts.

270
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,660
Here.

271
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,093
She could have at least tried a bite.

272
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,265
My gosh, you startled me.

273
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,478
Okay.

274
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,230
It tastes good.

275
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,231
It is very sweet and cold.

276
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,883
Gosh, if only he had not bumped into me...

277
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,302
Darn it.

278
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,897
In order to kill him,

279
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,858
I will just have to enter the palace.

280
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,992
Let's beard the lion in his den.

281
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,225
Excuse...

282
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,187
I am never going
to the kisaeng house again.

283
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,231
The kisaeng house? Why?

284
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,109
I went there earlier
to give them the wine we made.

285
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,820
And some guy suddenly held my hand.

286
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,196
Why? Why did he do that?

287
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,157
So I got startled
and pushed his hand away.

288
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,118
And he told me

289
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,662
that he mistook me for Hwa-su.

290
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,205
The beautiful kisaeng?

291
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,499
The kisaeng who gets everything
thanks to her pretty face?

292
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,835
The really charming one?

293
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,838
Is she charming?

294
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,299
I think her skin is too pale
to be attractive.

295
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,342
What do you ladies think?

296
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,344
Do I really look that similar?

297
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,650
Yes, you do.

298
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,652
I get why he was confused.

299
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,655
My gosh, I am not that happy about it.

300
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,033
Well, too bad.

301
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,952
You will have to bear with your beauty.

302
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,081
What is going on?

303
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,001
Unbelievable. Have you all gone blind?

304
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,503
What?

305
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,466
You do not need to worry.

306
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,640
You really do not need to worry at all.

307
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,856
I am sorry someone mistook you

308
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,483
for someone you do not like.

309
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,194
But here is what I think.

310
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,738
Hwa-su has a high nose,

311
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,490
and crescent moon shaped eyebrows.

312
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,033
But as for you,

313
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,160
you have a big nose

314
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,703
and your eyebrows are thick

315
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,955
like pine caterpillars,
and that makes you look more cheerful.

316
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,499
You look nothing like her.

317
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,251
I have a big nose?

318
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,963
Yes. On top of that, Hwa-su is too pale.

319
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,884
Her skin should be darker like yours
in order to seem strong.

320
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,469
Right?

321
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,097
"Dark"?

322
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,431
Hey!

323
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,184
Who are you?

324
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,520
Are you here as a judge or what?

325
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,941
I should have introduced myself first.

326
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,818
I am Lady Kim from Hanyang.

327
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,486
Whatever.

328
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,904
Who do you think you are?

329
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,531
How dare you call my nose big?

330
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,159
You look like a weasel
that is drowning in water!

331
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,454
A weasel.

332
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,666
"A weasel"?

333
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,085
-Are you serious?
-What is wrong?

334
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,255
You got to say everything you wanted,
so why can I not?

335
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,176
-Help me!
-I will kill you

336
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,553
and kill myself afterward!

337
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,054
Oh, my goodness!

338
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,932
-You little weasel!
-Gosh, that's enough.

339
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,268
-You need to stop.
-Get off me!

340
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,020
Gosh, it is hot!

341
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,356
My gosh, my hands!

342
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,650
-Are you okay?
-Stop it!

343
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,533
Gosh, my butt!

344
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,204
My goodness, they hurt so much.

345
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,040
Oh, gosh.

346
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,507
Gosh, it stings.

347
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,332
It is raining so viciously.

348
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,214
Just like that night

349
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,966
when Yun-jeo died.

350
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,011
Leave.

351
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,934
I will say the baby died,
and you buried him

352
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,438
and that you fell into the water
after I stabbed you.

353
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,149
So live like you do not exist.

354
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,735
Like you do not exist.

355
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,961
INN

356
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,992
I need to meet Yun.

357
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,875
I really do not understand.

358
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,878
She was upset about it,
so I just wanted to help.

359
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,632
Do you really think that helped?

360
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,344
I mean, she was upset to hear
that she looked like Hwa-su.

361
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,597
So I honestly told her
that she does not look like Hwa-su at all.

362
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,309
Lady Kim.

363
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,145
-You do not have any friends, do you?
-What?

364
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,649
You are from an aristocrat's family,
so I bet you were surrounded by servants.

365
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:28,613
Should I give you a tip
on how you should have reacted?

366
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,159
Yes.

367
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,333
-For free?
-What?

368
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,676
So here is what you need to do.

369
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:54,055
"Really?" "No way."

370
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,476
-Can not believe what?
-Do not try to be reasonable.

371
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,436
"My goodness, really?

372
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,398
You look just like her.
I cannot believe it."

373
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,109
That is how you need to react from now on.

374
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,072
I really do not get what you mean.

375
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,454
There is something
you cannot say yourself,

376
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,457
so you want someone else
to say it for you.

377
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,876
You just need to chime in
and listen to her talk.

378
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,423
How could you not know? You are a woman.

379
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,092
My gosh, you are being absurd.

380
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,760
I am not done eating.

381
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,638
Lady Kim, can you help me with this
before you go?

382
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,600
Will you stop taking your clothes off
wherever you go?

383
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,353
But this is my room.

384
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,105
Take off the bandage
and get changed yourself.

385
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,648
I cannot help you get changed.

386
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,707
-Lady Kim.
-What?

387
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,169
I cannot sleep without a pillow.

388
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,972
Do you not think you are being too mean?

389
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,557
I need your help.

390
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,853
My gosh, you ask for so many things.

391
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,396
I really hate people like you.

392
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,108
You should know
how to take care of yourself.

393
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,152
Okay, fine.

394
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,197
I will stop asking you for help.

395
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,454
What am I doing?

396
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,540
At this rate, every woman here
will end up hating me.

397
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,546
"Really?" "No way."

398
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,592
This really is unbelievable.

399
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,807
My gosh.

400
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,142
What are you doing?

401
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:11,526
It started itching
because I could not get changed.

402
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,162
No... It is not...

403
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,415
What?

404
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,585
Just a little...

405
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,587
Will you say it louder?

406
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,466
Just a little to the side.

407
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,677
And scratch harder.

408
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,262
Yes, that is right.

409
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,097
Yes, right there.

410
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,432
Just a bit more to the side.

411
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,977
A little lower than that.

412
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,688
Yes, that feels nice.

413
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,273
A little lower.

414
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,733
Gosh, that is it.

415
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,444
Just a bit lower. Just a bit more.

416
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,717
Why did she suddenly stop?

417
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,594
My gosh.

418
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,005
I forgot Lady Kim got a burn as well.

419
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,757
It must hurt.

420
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,845
Lady Kim.

421
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,893
I guess she is tired.

422
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,836
What kind of atrocious behavior is this?

423
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,589
How dare you do this, you animal?

424
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,925
Have you no fear of God?

425
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,220
I wanted to put some medicinal herb on you

426
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,847
since you also got a burn.
I figured your butt might hurt.

427
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,892
My butt? Ointment?

428
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:54,563
How could a woman do that
to another woman?

429
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,236
I do not get it.

430
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,239
Gosh, I am very taken aback.

431
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,453
This is extremely upsetting.

432
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,290
What is upsetting?

433
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,333
"Checkmate."

434
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,212
You forgot to say that, Your Majesty.

435
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,840
I completely forgot.

436
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,759
Then this one does not count as well.
Let us play again.

437
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,553
It is late now.

438
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,930
Should you not go back to the palace?

439
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,057
We have a lot of time
before the morning comes.

440
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:36,272
Do you still have trouble going to bed,
Your Majesty?

441
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,108
Yes.

442
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,903
So please do not kick me out.

443
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,155
How could I ever dare?

444
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,199
Do not say that, Your Majesty.

445
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,453
Yun-jeo

446
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,581
was very good at playing this game.

447
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,547
Every time I asked him to go back a move,

448
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,382
he never even budged.

449
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,301
He was a very resolute man.

450
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,890
Yes, he was.

451
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,643
Remember the day Yun-jeo died?

452
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:21,067
You said that he died
after he buried his son, right?

453
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,947
Yes, that is what happened, Your Majesty.

454
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,199
And then, he was killed

455
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,285
by your sword?

456
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

457
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,085
Okay.

458
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,338
I know you already told me this.

459
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,090
I should not have asked.

460
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,427
It cannot be a lie.
There is no way you would ever lie to me.

461
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,892
Let us take a short break.

462
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,436
I am tired.

463
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,878
I do not think the local functionary

464
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,839
was mistaken about what he saw.

465
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,551
Keep looking for Jung Yun-jeo.

466
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,596
Yes, Your Majesty.

467
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,562
"Really?" "No way."

468
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,858
"My gosh, really?" "No..."

469
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,856
Wait.

470
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,114
Lady Kim.

471
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,164
Ouch.

472
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:26,085
Lady Kim, I heard you got a burn.

473
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:28,837
-Yes.
-My goodness.

474
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,466
Here you go.

475
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,428
It is for scars.

476
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,723
I also got hurt a few days ago
because I tripped in the mountains,

477
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,308
so I got this from a physician.

478
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,561
It is an ointment.

479
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,771
Oh, okay.

480
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,404
Thank you.

481
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,531
What...

482
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,627
Why did you have to like a woman like me?

483
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,671
Where did you get injured?

484
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,048
Let me apply it for you.

485
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,344
-Here.
-No, not there!

486
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,519
You are a pervert.

487
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,816
No, it is not like that.

488
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:31,859
It's just...

489
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,653
I am only bleeding
because my scars got infected!

490
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,917
I should stay out of her sight.

491
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,012
BREWERY

492
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,003
It is me.

493
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,049
What are you doing?

494
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,343
Why would you do the laundry
with those hands?

495
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,555
They are a lot better now. Give it back.

496
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,850
If you do not let them heal properly,
they might get infected.

497
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,156
I told you to stay away from my butt.

498
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,866
I am fine.

499
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,160
Sit on this.

500
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,079
Otherwise, it might get infected.

501
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,636
You do laundry pretty well for someone
who must have had a comfortable life.

502
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,348
I am only helping for today.
There will not be a next time.

503
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,892
You say that now,

504
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,352
but I bet you will help me again.

505
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,687
That is nonsense.

506
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,273
If your wound gets infected,
I will be the one who gets busy.

507
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,608
I am only helping because I have to.

508
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,820
My gosh.

509
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,548
When did you go to see a physician?

510
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,800
I never met a physician.

511
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,844
I just found it on my way here.

512
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,262
Sure. Whatever.

513
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,017
But I have to say,
this does not feel too bad.

514
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:11,977
What?

515
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,813
To have someone care for me.

516
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,356
It reminds me of the past.

517
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:25,115
No one would help you
so devotedly like I do.

518
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,659
I am practically like your mom.

519
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,871
Exactly.

520
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,251
By the way,

521
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,546
you must have had a great mother.

522
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:44,426
Yes, she was great. Very great.

523
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,516
I am jealous that you have
a lot of good memories of your mother.

524
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,687
No, those memories make me feel miserable.

525
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,233
Because they always remind me of her.

526
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,281
What kind of mother did you have?

527
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,164
My mom?

528
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:16,917
Mom.

529
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,586
Dad will soon be here with the medicine.

530
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,921
Hang in there just a little longer.

531
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,258
My son.

532
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,096
Yes, I am right here.

533
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,683
I am sorry you had to live like this.

534
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,561
You are such a precious child.

535
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,105
I am so sorry

536
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,485
you had to live a life like this,
I-hyeong.

537
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,446
What?

538
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,282
Listen to me carefully.

539
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,326
Your name

540
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,329
is not Hwang-tae.

541
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,832
It is Jung...

542
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,751
I...

543
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,174
Mom!

544
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,761
Hwang-tae! Hwang-tae, come over here!

545
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:11,805
Mom.

546
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,726
It is all because of you.

547
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,145
If it had not been for you,

548
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,773
my son...

549
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,276
My family...

550
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,486
Mom.

551
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,325
Mom.

552
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,578
Mom.

553
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,872
Mom!

554
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,130
She was a kind person.

555
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,966
She had to live a sad and pitiful life.

556
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,431
Does your butt not hurt?

557
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,975
Should I put some ointment on it?

558
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,561
My gosh, stop it.

559
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,438
By the way...

560
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,148
Yes?

561
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,574
Can I treat you like a sister?

562
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:47,234
I mean, if you don't mind, that is.

563
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:52,989
Why? Do you not want a younger sister?

564
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,410
-No, I don't.
-What?

565
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,124
Because I am not your sister.

566
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:03,792
Oh, well...

567
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,796
I was born in the year of the lamb.
Are you younger than me?

568
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,634
I thought she was born
in the year of the snake.

569
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,678
The year of the snake?

570
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,013
By the year of the snake,
I had already mastered the Cheonjamun

571
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,849
and memorized
all of Four Books and Five Classics!

572
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,730
I mean,

573
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:28,191
it is not like I wanted to treat you

574
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,610
like my sister no matter what.

575
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,572
I should go now.
I have something to take care of.

576
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,497
My gosh, what is her problem?

577
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,875
I am busy, too.

578
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,841
Am I crazy? What is wrong with me?

579
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,010
I wonder if she saw me blush.

580
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,262
So what if she did?

581
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,098
Why did she have to say such nonsense?

582
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,183
Darn it.

583
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:24,956
Bok-nyeo?

584
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,294
-What in the world is--
-Be quiet.

585
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:56,655
That shaman over there
is praying for all the widows

586
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,406
who died wrongful deaths.

587
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,951
If you roam around like this,
you will be in big trouble.

588
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,953
What big trouble?

589
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,581
The vengeful spirits
are all across the village.

590
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:10,001
So you should not open the door
or turn on the lights.

591
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,546
-What?
-Let us go to my house for now.

592
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:17,801
Some widows even disappeared
after they just ignored the warning.

593
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,010
So do not...

594
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:20,929
Hey!

595
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:22,764
Lady Kim!

596
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,831
A man?

597
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,643
What? What happened?

598
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,981
A darn drunk did this.

599
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,983
My gosh, you reek of alcohol.

600
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,069
I will get you some new clothes.
You should take a shower.

601
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,447
You are the best.

602
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,782
My gosh, you're getting it on me as well.

603
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,118
I want the jade green one.
You know what it is, right?

604
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,619
Just wear whatever I give you.

605
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,663
My gosh, that hurts.

606
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,166
Lady Kim.

607
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,586
Gosh, you startled me.

608
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,048
I thought a pervert was
taking a peep at the kisaeng house.

609
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,759
What? I'm not a pervert.

610
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:15,181
What brings you here? You said
you had something to take care of.

611
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,350
My gosh.

612
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,144
We cannot disturb the guests.

613
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:20,979
Okay.

614
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,278
Lady Kim, I asked you why you are here.

615
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,362
What?

616
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,116
I was looking for scissors,

617
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,577
and someone told me to look here.

618
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:36,953
Why do you need scissors?

619
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,205
Then you should have opened the door.

620
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,832
-Why did you make holes--
-Well...

621
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,418
What do you want?

622
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,509
I wanted to cut your hair.

623
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,262
Why cut my hair all of a sudden?

624
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,764
I felt bad seeing you walk around
like a filthy beggar.

625
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,350
-Close your eyes.
-Why?

626
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,270
I don't want hair going into your eyes.

627
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:06,357
My gosh, why would you
poke my eyes like that?

628
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,776
My gosh, they hurt so much.

629
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,070
My goodness.

630
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,896
-Is he here?
-Yes.

631
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,773
I think he is hiding somewhere in here.

632
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,933
Just make them even.

633
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:23,518
You do not need to be so careful.

634
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,522
It is your precious hair.

635
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,607
So it is only right for me to be careful.

636
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,986
Then why did you put on a straight face

637
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,405
when I asked you
if I could treat you like a sister?

638
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,328
Something is on your chin.

639
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,081
Ouch.

640
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,375
I am bleeding, am I not?

641
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,585
Look. Is it bleeding?

642
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,755
No!

643
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,050
Well...

644
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:58,886
What are you doing?

645
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,432
You do not need to look into a mirror.

646
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:05,935
You are being weird.

647
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,855
-Give me that.
-No.

648
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,109
You are being weird. Give it to me.

649
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,111
-No.
-Let me see how I look.

650
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,195
No.

651
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,782
-My gosh, let me see.
-No!

652
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,035
-No.
-My gosh, come on.

653
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,450
My goodness!

654
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,077
Ouch!

655
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,861
I am on my way to the bathroom.

656
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,446
Okay, I will go back inside.

657
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:23,281
That is great.

658
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,491
What are you doing here?

659
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,869
I told you not to go anywhere!

660
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,704
Stop right there.
I will not let you leave.

661
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:30,913
Stay right beside me.

662
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,039
Dong-ju?

663
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,250
I heard she is old enough.

664
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,793
She may be of age, but she's still...

665
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,796
I'm the one who gets to decide, not you.

666
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,673
Dong-ju!

667
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,093
How much did you hear?

668
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,179
That you are planning to kill someone?

669
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,597
You heard it correctly.

670
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,769
