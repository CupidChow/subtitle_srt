1
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,421
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,256
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,509
Widows?

4
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,971
So, the killers who tried to kill
the local functionary were women?

5
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,890
Yes.

6
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,351
One of them was

7
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,396
wearing a white dress.

8
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,984
Are you sure?

9
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,028
Why would women--

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,988
I saw them with my own eyes.

11
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,495
They were no ordinary--

12
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,331
Hey!

13
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,718
Where is Yun?

14
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,054
I was informed that he went
to the kisaeng house he frequents.

15
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,598
-Kisaeng house?
-Yes.

16
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,184
It is called Yeonhwa House in Mudamgol.

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,603
All right.

18
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,939
Take care of the corpse.

19
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

20
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,651
Wait.

21
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,781
Is Mudamgol not a widow village?

22
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,199
Sorry?

23
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,162
Come to think of it, there is a
widow village right by the kisaeng house.

24
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,680
Welcome!

25
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,307
I am not here as a customer.

26
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,018
I have to search this place quietly,
so cooperate.

27
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,311
Yes, my lord.

28
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,001
BREWERY

29
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,147
There is no need to complicate things.

30
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,902
Instead of the young and foolish
Grand Prince Yeongchang,

31
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,446
you can use me instead.

32
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,492
Make me become the King.

33
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,495
That is the only thing that has changed.

34
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,818
You say you want to become the king.

35
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,447
But do you think you have what it takes?

36
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,110
Is he on the same side?

37
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,534
No, then he would be wearing
the same outfit as the rest.

38
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,125
What are you doing here?

39
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,128
This is a widow village
protected under the King's order.

40
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,046
A man shall not enter!

41
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,300
Will you learn your lesson
only after I beat you up?

42
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,593
Oh, my!

43
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,763
Are you here to catch your daughter-in-law
who ran away?

44
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,933
Then that is all the more reason
why you should leave.

45
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,772
You are hiding something.

46
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,406
Goodness.

47
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,284
What are you doing
to a powerless woman like me?

48
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,286
What would I be hiding?

49
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,293
What brings you here?

50
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,989
Chancellor Heo just left
from the kisaeng house,

51
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,367
and we did not find anyone suspicious.

52
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,258
Good work, everyone.

53
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,468
Thank you for stalling time.

54
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,054
Had it not been for you,
we would be in deep trouble.

55
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,515
I was quite impressed

56
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,475
with her fighting skills
at the birthday party.

57
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,394
Turns out she is resourceful as well.

58
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,441
Looks like we can officially assign you
some tasks.

59
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,110
I will do my best.

60
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,577
Who is he?

61
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,253
Why did you bring me here?

62
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,552
The all mighty Chancellor like you
can be so helpless.

63
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,347
I thought you had His Majesty's trust.

64
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,935
But it seems like
you are caught red-handed.

65
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,899
The Grand Prince ended up like that
thanks to you,

66
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,735
so how much worse can it be
to have His Majesty find out?

67
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,446
We are lost.

68
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,698
Lost?

69
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,367
I told you in a very kind manner.

70
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,245
You have to make me the king.

71
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,666
Why do you want to be the King?

72
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,840
Because I wish our poor people

73
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:32,470
to thrive and live bountiful lives.

74
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,352
Need I really say such cliche?

75
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,146
A king should genuinely care
about his people!

76
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,567
I am

77
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:52,323
going to become a king
with absolute power and authority.

78
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,577
And under my authority, Chancellor,
you can...

79
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,163
Are you heading out to tell His Majesty

80
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,500
that you once planned treason against him?

81
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,086
Or,

82
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,630
that his son,

83
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,426
who should have died 20 years ago,
is still alive?

84
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,678
Is that

85
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,430
what you are going to tell him?

86
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,601
Here is my answer to your question

87
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,104
as to why you are here at my annex.

88
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,773
Come in.

89
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,749
I had an unexpected gain
while keeping my eyes on you.

90
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,180
Hearing that you sent the Muwol Corps
to some island,

91
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,475
I was wondering why you did so.

92
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,813
It turns out that

93
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,232
people were hiding in that island
as if they did not exist.

94
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,818
That is when I realized

95
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,574
that the stories Father had told me
were true after all.

96
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,785
Were you not curious?

97
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,956
Why do you think His Majesty tried so hard

98
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,126
to get rid of his own son
and Jung Yun-jeo from this world?

99
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,922
Well, clearly not.

100
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,175
Had you been curious,
you would not be alive.

101
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,469
Are you--

102
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,763
If I were the King's son,
I at least would not have gotten upset

103
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,767
that I had to stay hidden
throughout my entire life.

104
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,813
You are Yun-jeo's son!

105
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,981
I must

106
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,484
make this man King.

107
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,111
Because he is the only person

108
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,113
who can give me back everything I lost.

109
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,412
What do you think?

110
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,248
Revealing this much

111
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,584
usually leads to becoming a team.

112
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,568
-You cannot come in here.
-Yes, I can.

113
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,654
I am allowed to.

114
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,115
Pardon?

115
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,201
I can go anywhere I want
and get rid of anyone I want.

116
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,496
That is who I am.

117
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,834
What do you mean?

118
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,462
I finally figured out who has your heart.

119
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,299
Are we talking about this again?

120
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,176
I told you that that is not--

121
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,096
Then would it not matter if I kill him?

122
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,256
I am leaving soon.

123
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,051
That is what I used him for.

124
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,679
I know

125
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,057
I owe a lot to Madam Chun
for looking after me.

126
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,103
But thanks to him, I can leave in peace.

127
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,485
-You used him?
-Yes.

128
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,364
Just like how you are manipulating me
by using my secret,

129
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,367
I manipulated him using his.

130
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,537
So please, do not make

131
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,540
such rash assumptions
and say such evil things.

132
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,047
Fine.

133
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,424
Leave this place and come to me.

134
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,218
-I will--
-No.

135
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,180
I do not ever want to hear that again.

136
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,475
Please leave.

137
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,240
What? Why?

138
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,665
Why did you say that man was a pervert?

139
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,793
Why did you disappear?
What were you doing?

140
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,131
Why on earth are you here?

141
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,679
-I am not telling you.
-What?

142
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,807
-You said you will tell me everything.
-You said you do not care.

143
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,434
You said
that we should never question each other.

144
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,228
And you are--

145
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,729
I am leaving soon.

146
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,191
That is what I used him for.

147
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,238
-I am what?
-Whatever.

148
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,074
Why did you just stop mid-sentence?

149
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,993
Stop hiding secrets and answer me!

150
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,082
Why should I be the only one
to tell you everything?

151
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,876
What about you?

152
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,961
Why are you turning this on me?

153
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,005
We are talking about you being suspicious
right now.

154
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,924
Why does it matter what I do?

155
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,384
-Why you little...
-What?

156
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,969
Stop it, you two!

157
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,388
For goodness' sake!

158
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,395
My goodness.

159
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,565
Are you kids or what?

160
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,318
Even if you have things to fight about,

161
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,862
you should be talking it out
in a calm manner.

162
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,115
Why quarrel so early in the morning?

163
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,953
Aeng-du,

164
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,706
can you ask her where she is going
without cleaning up?

165
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,125
He is asking where you are going.

166
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,418
I am heading to work.

167
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,713
And can you remind him
that he is the dishwasher?

168
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,299
You are the dishwasher.

169
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,842
Do not go.

170
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,054
Do you even know what kind of guy he is?

171
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,222
I live with you, yet I do not know you.

172
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,641
So how would I possibly know him?

173
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,895
Just do not go. I am telling you!

174
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,647
Who are you to tell me things?

175
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,898
I am...

176
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,234
I am your mother.

177
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,071
Aeng-du, tell him he should be ashamed.

178
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,405
You two are driving me crazy!

179
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,909
You will not even let me finish my meal?

180
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,165
You have already finished.

181
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,251
I cannot watch this anymore.

182
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,754
You two are so childish!

183
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,090
Hey! Where do you think you are going?

184
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,633
To see my sweet Lord Cha.

185
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,926
Are you going to stop me or what?

186
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,886
Why would you go see him?

187
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,721
I need to have lunch

188
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,682
now that I have finished breakfast.

189
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,646
Darn it!

190
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,731
This is so annoying!

191
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,116
Where is Yul-mu?

192
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,326
I guess he is not here.

193
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,870
This is not the only kisaeng house
he visits.

194
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,166
Great, I can do the dishes now.

195
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,501
What about lunch?

196
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,420
What about my lunch?

197
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,255
He promised to make me flower pancakes.

198
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,550
He told me that we will pack some
and go on a picnic.

199
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,138
He said flower pancakes taste best
when eaten on a picnic.

200
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,265
He promised me!

201
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,144
Gosh, I will make
those flower pancakes for you.

202
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,064
Goodness. Are you confident
that you can cook it well?

203
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,524
I am not confident.

204
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,569
-How can I face His Majesty?
-Just act normal.

205
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,531
He will be more suspicious now.
What should we do?

206
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,825
We will be moving the Muwol Corps' base.

207
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,660
So tell everyone to stop going
to Yeonhwa House

208
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,704
and tell them to be extra careful.

209
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,249
My Lord, what if we side
with Prince Neungyang and revolt?

210
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,127
Everyone thinks it is not a bad idea.

211
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,380
Grand Prince is no longer with us,
so we need to find another way.

212
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,174
I am going to find another way.

213
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,968
I will never side with him.

214
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,901
Tomorrow night,

215
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,904
everyone in the Muwol Corps
must leave the village.

216
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,572
-Sorry?
-Sorry?

217
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,617
Make sure that you are not leaving
any traces behind,

218
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,620
and start moving in groups of 3 or 4
once it gets dark.

219
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,581
I will see you at Aseowon in Hanyang.

220
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,541
Who gave us this order?

221
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,418
Was it Chancellor Heo?

222
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,837
Yes. He sent me a letter.

223
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,590
We saw what happened last night.

224
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,425
Does he really have any authority
right now?

225
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,262
How can we just suddenly
serve a different person?

226
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,431
Lord Cha.

227
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,600
No...

228
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,646
Prince Neungyang had been preparing it
all along.

229
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,942
We had no other choice
as long as he was the one with the power.

230
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,778
If we refuse,
we might put everyone in danger.

231
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,323
However,

232
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,701
he is also the one who can help us
with our goal.

233
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,206
The Chancellor will surely join us
soon enough,

234
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,583
so we are not betraying anyone.

235
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,254
We just need to trust and follow both.

236
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,090
Neither seems any different.

237
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,301
I will visit the Chancellor
to sort things out tomorrow.

238
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,764
But I do believe it is right
for us to move our base.

239
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,684
I will escort you to Hanyang.

240
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,603
No, please stay here to organize the move.

241
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,189
I will take

242
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,318
Lady Kim with me.

243
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,654
Yes, madam.

244
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,754
Are you really going to leave?

245
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,549
The Chancellor and His Majesty's nephew?

246
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,926
Let us just stop here.

247
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,137
Let us return to where your father is--

248
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,346
And what?

249
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,932
Hide in the mountains?

250
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,978
Goodness.

251
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,064
The elites join forces in secret
to create a new world

252
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,858
behind His Majesty's back.

253
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,361
Do you have any idea what that means?

254
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,447
A revolt.

255
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,240
So you know!

256
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,160
And you still want to go?

257
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,369
What are you going to do?

258
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,913
They are the ones doing it,

259
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,664
so Father is not the rebel here.

260
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,711
It took me pretending to be a woman
to figure out their weakness

261
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,171
so I need to make good use of it.

262
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,926
If things go south, I may as well go
to the police bureau and spill everything.

263
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,929
My goodness.

264
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,433
Whether I kill them or not,
I am going to see the end of this.

265
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,228
And then I can live as who I am

266
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,689
with Father and Hwang-tae.

267
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,028
And...

268
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,156
I am leaving soon.

269
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,201
And...

270
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:47,996
Yes.

271
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,001
We will live with you

272
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,088
and be who we are. Let us do it.

273
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,464
Yes.

274
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:02,135
Of course! I will definitely live
with you and Aeng-du, too.

275
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,054
Indeed.

276
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,270
Hey.

277
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,564
You should use glutinous rice water
for flower pancakes.

278
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,984
How could you just throw soaked rice cake
right into the oil?

279
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,569
I thought it would not matter.

280
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,238
Does everything not taste the same
when fried in oil?

281
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,993
I am hungry. You make some for me.

282
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,828
I am busy. I do not have time for this.

283
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,042
Yul-mu would have cooked some for me.

284
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,844
Let us finish that one up
and be on our way.

285
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,721
-To where?
-To where?

286
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,348
We are supposed to go on a picnic
with these, remember?

287
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,976
-When did I agree to this?
-I told you I am busy.

288
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,980
I miss Yul-mu.

289
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,274
Fine, let us go!

290
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,468
Have some.

291
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,845
Are you protecting me,

292
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,348
or trying to lock me up?

293
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,314
I am locking you up to protect you.

294
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,776
I do not have time for this.

295
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,028
I must find my sons!

296
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,489
I will order my people to look

297
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,783
for the older son in the mountains.

298
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,120
If there is no body, that means
he is hiding in the mountains.

299
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,375
Please find him for me.

300
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,211
As for His Majesty's child,

301
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,590
if I do find him...

302
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,384
We will go to Ming.

303
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,386
If you want us to go farther, we will go.

304
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,346
We will hide wherever you tell us to--

305
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,141
You told me that he grew
into a fine young man.

306
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,146
Maybe he can be...

307
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,190
What are you talking about?

308
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,152
Never mind.

309
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,529
I will keep looking for him,

310
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,364
so you stay here down low.

311
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:13,160
Do not worry about anyone getting hurt.

312
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,442
Why are you dressed like a man today?

313
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,319
We are far out of the village, anyway.

314
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,404
Is it not nice? I look great.

315
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,989
Here.

316
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,454
Great, my foot!

317
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,418
Hey!

318
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,974
Just give up. You do not even know
how to fish.

319
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,811
Look who is talking!
It took you more than an hour.

320
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,064
Let us just head back.

321
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,815
Why did you bring me here with you?

322
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,859
You think I brought you here
because I wanted to?

323
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,612
Had you not offered to make
flower pancakes for her--

324
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,490
I told her that I would cook for her,
not go on a picnic.

325
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,117
Anyway, it is all your fault.

326
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,495
You should not have visited
Yul-mu's kitchen!

327
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,414
-I went out because of you--
-He is the worst one.

328
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,792
If he made a promise to a child,
he should have kept it.

329
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,877
He should not have promised her
if he could not keep it.

330
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,879
For goodness' sake!

331
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,756
Here.

332
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,175
This is how everyone falls in love.

333
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:56,304
Why do you two keep fighting over nothing?

334
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,599
That is because your brother has
so many secrets.

335
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,559
He says he will tell me everything,
but he never does.

336
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,400
I just do not want to lie to you.

337
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,318
What?

338
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,073
I cannot tell you why I am here right now.

339
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,909
If I were to tell you,
I would have to lie again.

340
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,495
I do not want to lie. Happy now?

341
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:30,463
I am sorry to interrupt,

342
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,551
but we are going to need
to go back to land.

343
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,685
Now I can breathe.

344
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,982
Could you find me a big leaf?

345
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,860
A tender one, please.

346
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,166
Hey!

347
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,918
Where are you going?

348
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,045
Hey!

349
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,172
Hey!

350
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,052
Hey!

351
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,139
Hey!

352
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,603
Hey!

353
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,939
Hey!

354
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,156
Did you see that?
I do not need a fishing rod...

355
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,536
My goodness.

356
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,540
Why are you crying?

357
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,419
Gosh. Come on.

358
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,356
Why did you not tell her
that you lived on an island?

359
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,607
She never asked.

360
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,028
My goodness.

361
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,049
Aeng-du!

362
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,594
Go and eat this over there.

363
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,642
What are you doing?

364
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,813
Are you dumb? You should have
dried your feet first.

365
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,648
I am fine. Let us just go.

366
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,900
You will catch a cold
if your feet are cold.

367
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,444
Do not try to put me through trouble.

368
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:17,839
Good.

369
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,591
There you go.

370
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,387
-I told you to--
-Not do things like this?

371
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,806
I do whatever I want.

372
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,892
It is not like you listen to me, either.

373
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,644
It is not that.

374
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,356
I do not know your real name.

375
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,194
What?

376
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,863
When I thought that you were drowning,

377
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,034
I could not call you
because I did not know your name.

378
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,414
Do you want me to tell you?

379
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,958
I am not telling you.

380
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,214
-Why are you keeping that a secret?
-I will tell you later,

381
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,467
if you take good care of
Dong-dong and Dong-ju.

382
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,136
I will tell you once they grow up,
lay eggs,

383
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,846
and become chickens.

384
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,309
Why does everything have to be later?

385
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:13,937
Whatever.

386
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,441
I will tell you then. So stick around
and take good care of them.

387
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,529
They cannot live without you.
You are their mother, okay?

388
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,700
Promise me that you will.

389
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,210
I will just keep calling you a scamp.

390
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,965
Hey! Why are you always so harsh?

391
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,967
I am not asking you for a big favor.

392
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,302
Promise me, will you?

393
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,936
TOMORROW NIGHT, MUWOL CORPS
IS TO LEAVE THE VILLAGE

394
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,355
The Chancellor is so naive.

395
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,191
This is what he came up with?

396
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,195
To get the Muwol Corps to flee to Hanyang?

397
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,698
But is it not dangerous for us
to stay here,

398
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,784
especially when His Majesty
is keeping an eye on the village?

399
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,287
You should stop coming--

400
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,455
I have been coming here almost every day.

401
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,250
Would it not be more suspicious of me
to stop coming all of a sudden?

402
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,712
But what should we--

403
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,297
Do as the Chancellor says.

404
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,717
Yes, my lord.

405
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,761
I plan on heading to Hanyang
first thing in the morning.

406
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,222
I have something to ask the Chancellor.

407
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,392
I plan on

408
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,479
asking him to join the majority.

409
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,859
I will get a guard and a horse for you.

410
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,277
That is okay.

411
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,780
I will be going with a widow
that newly joined the Muwol Corps.

412
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,493
You know her, too.

413
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,246
I know her?

414
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,839
Your Majesty!

415
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:09,344
I am Vice-Curator Yeon,

416
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,763
who looks after the widow village
in Mudamgol--

417
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,889
I got it.

418
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,391
Tell me about the widow village.

419
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,144
Tell me about everything.

420
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,314
You will be killed
if you do not tell me the truth.

421
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,191
Yes, Your Majesty.

422
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,716
You joined the Muwol Corps?

423
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,135
I heard it pays well.

424
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,389
And I heard you are planning treason.

425
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,985
I have so many reasons to kill you.
But I am letting you live only because

426
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,987
Dong-ju asked me not to kill you.

427
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,948
But it is getting harder and harder

428
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,534
to keep that promise.

429
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,705
I do not fear men who is all talk.

430
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,874
You can do as you wish.

431
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,586
Do not make Dong-ju overthink.

432
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,548
Unlike you, I do not give out warnings.

433
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,877
Hey! I lost him because of you!

434
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,587
Who are you?

435
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,174
Are you not--

436
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,095
I almost promised him

437
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,682
that I will raise the chicks.

438
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,532
I keep wanting to.

439
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,330
I want to be by his side.

440
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,666
I am sorry, Mom.

441
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,388
Her belongings are still here.

442
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,974
No way.

443
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,810
This cannot be.

444
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,236
What were you doing?

445
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,823
-What?
-What were you doing

446
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,575
-out all night without telling me?
-You did the same.

447
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,163
I was with Hwa-su because
she needed help with something.

448
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,706
You think I have not checked there?

449
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,046
Looks like you are heading out.

450
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,174
Go. I am going to get some sleep.

451
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,241
I will not ask you to like me back.

452
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,952
You can use me if you want.

453
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,912
So,

454
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,001
just do not disappear.

455
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,463
Please.

456
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,947
Are you sure it is okay for us
to be so noticeable?

457
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,575
Have you not heard

458
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,077
that the Chancellor is my pimp?

459
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,079
Sorry?

460
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:52,293
That is why it would be natural
to visit him like this.

461
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,253
We are here now.

462
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,878
You are leaving today?

463
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,923
Yes.

464
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,219
Are you rushing

465
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,264
because of him?

466
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,059
No, because I am ready.

467
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,980
Okay, then let me go with you to Hanyang.

468
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,983
I will be going alone.
Please do not follow me.

469
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,027
Fine.

470
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,863
Then let me at least know
when you arrive in Hanyang.

471
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,991
Do you remember the swing?

472
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,243
Just show me your face at 10 p.m. there.

473
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,661
That is all I ask for.

474
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,040
Then

475
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,419
you will not do anything, right?

476
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,090
To him?

477
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,801
Yes.

478
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,263
Promise me
that you will not do anything to him.

479
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,098
And you say you do not love him?

480
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,775
Even if I do, I will hide it.

481
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,446
I am going to break his heart
by leaving without notice,

482
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,905
so that he will hate me.

483
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,786
That would be better for him

484
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:55,416
than to love me and lose me to death.

485
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,295
I know how terrible it is

486
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:05,301
to lose someone I love
and to live on without them.

487
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,222
That is why I will never
put him through that.

488
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,310
So you do not need
to worry about anything.

489
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,945
You are crying

490
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,033
because of him.

491
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,792
You are not giving me a warning.

492
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,546
You are confessing your feelings for him.

493
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,052
Just pay me for all the work I have done.

494
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,513
No.

495
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,975
I will pay you in Hanyang. Do not be late.

496
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,569
Thank you.

497
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,124
I am alive.

498
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,960
A kisaeng house
that financially supports a widow village?

499
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:27,091
Bring the madam
and all the widows who are close to her.

500
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,806
If we do not have evidence,
witnesses should do.

501
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,391
Yes, Your Majesty.

502
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,413
Everyone is out now, right?

503
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,543
Yes, and Lady Kim left with Madam Chun.

504
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,170
So we are the last ones.

505
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:09,216
My home and all my friends
are in the village.

506
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,554
I did all that killing
because I wanted to live here in peace.

507
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,891
We must leave

508
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,435
in order to protect those friends.

509
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,072
Let us go.

510
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,707
-Pour me a drink, too.
-Sure.

511
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,125
Here you go.

512
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,879
Have a drink.

513
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,797
Hey!

514
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,725
Let us get going.

515
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,478
-Let us go!
-Let us go!

516
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,147
-Let us go!
-Let us go!

517
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,607
Let us go.

518
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,069
My Lord, why do you not

519
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,531
join in with the rest?

520
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,619
He promised
that he would take care of people

521
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,663
who are powerless like us.

522
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,623
Will he

523
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,001
not be better than the incumbent King?

524
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,719
Would you think the same
after seeing this?

525
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,519
This is Deul-re's--

526
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,397
I found her dead in the hills
behind the widow village,

527
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,816
and I have recently found out
who killed her.

528
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,491
Are you saying Prince Neungyang did this?

529
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,704
-Why would he do that?
-To pry on me

530
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,707
and to find my weakness
to threaten me with.

531
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,668
Take care of the powerless?

532
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,799
He does not care for a single soul

533
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,761
to get what he desires.

534
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,378
Prince Neungyang is provoking us.

535
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,089
He is more than well-prepared for this,
so be careful.

536
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,091
Shall I kill him when I find him?

537
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,968
He had to live his whole life

538
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,388
hiding on an island because of his father.
He did nothing wrong.

539
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,723
Bring him back alive.

540
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,268
Island?
Could he be talking about Hwang-tae?

541
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,980
Is it too early to be buddies?

542
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,399
It would be nice for us to become friends.

543
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,318
We will get there in time.

544
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,447
Yes, we will be together
for a long time anyway.

545
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,033
Will I really be of help to the revolt?

546
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,161
I do not keep useless people around me.

547
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,247
That being said, I need you to help me

548
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,458
on something unrelated to the revolt.

549
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,711
I will need to find your brother.

550
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:56,670
No.

551
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,842
I need to find the King's son.

552
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,292
Will you kill him if you do?

553
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,339
Well...

554
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,552
I was going to since
he would not be of help.

555
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,680
What do you think?

556
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,767
I am willing to listen to you.

557
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:10,994
Hwang-tae!

558
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,792
How did you end up getting trapped here?

559
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,753
How are you doing with your injury?

560
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,383
You must have had such a hard time.

561
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,385
I missed you so much.

562
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,846
How did you get here?

563
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,017
It is a long story,

564
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,520
but I am here to save you. Let us get out.

565
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:37,604
No.

566
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,440
I am not trapped here.

567
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,401
What?

568
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,988
Prince Neungyang did not trap you here?

569
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,283
So, you were running away
from the killers--

570
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,701
I almost died on the island

571
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,121
because of you.

572
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,750
-Hwang-tae...
-I almost died

573
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,836
once again because of you,
but Prince Neungyang saved me.

574
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,214
What are you talking about?

575
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:08,260
I now know why we had to hide,

576
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,846
why Mother had such an unfortunate death,

577
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,556
and why we were always being chased.

578
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:17,894
I know everything now.

579
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,355
-And that is all because of me?
-Yes.

580
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,065
It is all because of you.

581
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,237
No.

582
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,156
Whatever. Just go.

583
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,450
This conversation never happened,
so leave!

584
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,035
Why is it because of me?

585
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,121
Why? Tell me.

586
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,332
Tell me!

587
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,834
Do you really want to hear why?

588
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,670
Can you handle it?

589
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:49,885
Say it.

590
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,262
Fine.

591
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,558
It is all because of you.

592
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,479
This is...

593
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,732
all because...

594
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,318
all because...

595
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,908
you are the son

596
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,536
of His Majesty.

597
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,363
Leave him alive.

598
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,288
We need someone to go back
relay our message

599
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,332
that this is pointless.

600
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,752
What are you talking about?

601
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,630
You really expect me to believe

602
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,591
that I am the King's son?

603
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,469
If you cannot,

604
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:18,849
-you can ask the King yourself.
-What is wrong with you?

605
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,978
I am your brother and Father's son.

606
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,521
That is what I thought!

607
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:26,982
That is why

608
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,568
I had to live such an unfortunate life.

609
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:31,820
Mom!

610
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,406
Hwang-tae! Hwang-tae, come over here!

611
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,909
-Mom.
-It is all because of you.

612
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,828
If it had not been for you,

613
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,580
my son...

614
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,624
My family...

615
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,753
I will not live like that anymore.

616
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,131
I will take back everything

617
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,842
that you took away from me.

618
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,430
Hwang-tae,

619
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,475
do not do this.

620
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,269
Let us get out of here together.

621
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,189
What am I supposed to do

622
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,815
when even you are not on my side?

623
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,234
Leave.

624
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,404
That is all I know,
so do not ever come for me again.

625
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,323
Do not try to find out any more.

626
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,867
Just go and live like you do not exist.

627
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,037
Or else,

628
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,124
you will really die.

629
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,711
Get out. Get out right now.

630
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,588
Get out!

631
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:35,801
Brother...

632
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,844
Do not ever call me Brother again.

633
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:40,972
Ever.

634
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,890
Did something happen?

635
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,726
Alcohol is making me a bit sentimental.

636
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,648
What was going on outside?

637
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:33,942
Nothing.

638
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,738
I took care of it, so just get some rest.

639
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,408
I have to head somewhere now.

640
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,465
You are here.

641
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,008
But...

642
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,470
I could not find Lady Kim,
so I came alone.

643
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:46,222
-I have something to ask.
-She is not around?

644
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,767
Okay, head inside.

645
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,518
I have somewhere to go first.

646
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,103
Did you kill Deul-re?

647
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,157
Yes.

648
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,035
Is there an issue

649
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,579
with getting rid of the evidence

650
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,331
before that messes everything up?

651
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,875
So you killed the woman

652
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,879
who devoted her life to you
just because she may get in your way?

653
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,340
It is only in the natural order of things

654
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,050
-to perish when they become useless.
-Then

655
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,845
you will just as easily abandon
the Muwol Corps and the widow village.

656
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,014
So do not make that happen.

657
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,808
And as for the widow village,

658
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,103
I have already abandoned it.

659
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,701
Let us go!

660
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,917
If you need another village,
I can build another one.

661
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,043
If you want a kisaeng house,

662
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,546
I will build the biggest and fanciest one
in Hanyang.

663
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:02,841
Did you also believe

664
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:08,054
that it would be safe
as long as the Muwol Corps is out?

665
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,641
Were you underestimating the King?

666
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,895
Please give me some time.

667
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,189
I will make sure that nobody

668
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,358
say anything to the King.

669
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,486
If needed, I will move everyone
from the village--

670
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,571
Why?

671
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,533
-What?
-Why do all of that work?

672
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:32,245
There is a simple and easy way to do that.

673
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,921
I understand.

674
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,423
Good.

675
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,800
Wait for me at the annex.

676
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,261
And tell Dan-ho to find Lady Kim.

677
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,598
Yes, my lord.

678
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,120
Did you get him?

679
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,708
Who are you?

680
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,920
Why did you try

681
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,130
to kill my father, my brother, and me?

682
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,133
Who am I?

683
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,177
Tell me.

684
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,515
-Are you...
-My Lord!

685
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,767
The widow village is in danger!

686
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,450
Let us get started!

687
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,085
Fire!

688
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,059
Kill all of them!

689
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,525
My goodness.

690
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,420
It is made of rice cake and beef.

691
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,548
Apparently, it is absolutely delicious.

692
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,552
I have never heard of a place
that sells such a dish.

693
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,639
This is so frustrating!

694
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,392
He said it was this place for sure.

695
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,188
Let us just have what we can find
and go back.

696
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,232
Tigers will come down at night.

697
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:48,983
It is fine.

698
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:51,945
We can just stay the night here.

699
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,824
We can stay here for ten nights
with this money.

700
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,996
Such nonsense.

701
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,999
Why did he tell her to eat something
that does not even exist?

702
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,292
My goodness.

703
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,671
How come she has so much money?

704
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,801
Get them!

705
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,650
Here they are.

706
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,903
BREWERY

707
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,873
That is our village.

708
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:47,875
Fire?

709
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,213
Lady Kang, what is happening?

710
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,592
We have no idea.

711
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:38,926
Fire!

712
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,678
Help!

713
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:08,790
Dong-ju!

714
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,750
Stop!

715
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,627
Stop that right now!

716
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:27,433
What is that and where are you going?

717
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,562
Tell him that I am sorry
that it is not much.

718
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,065
To whom?

719
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,197
To your brother.

720
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,533
What is his name?

721
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,001
Nok-du...

722
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,447
Dan-ho, I cannot

723
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,407
let him live anymore.

724
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,535
Was it the bandits' doing?

725
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,538
I will find and kill them at all costs.

726
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:23,216
Is this what the Chancellor
was hiding from me?

727
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,383
Hanyang?

728
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,177
You still need to rest.

729
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,929
There is something
I have not told her yet.

730
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,599
Until when are you going to be
on that swing?

731
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,977
I guess fate found its way to you.

732
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,064
