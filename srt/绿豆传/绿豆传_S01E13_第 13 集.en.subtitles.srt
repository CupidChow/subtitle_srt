1
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,962
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,881
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,774
Is something wrong?

4
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,820
The darn king

5
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,490
whom you loathe
and desperately wish to kill!

6
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,867
He is...

7
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,538
He is the King's son.

8
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,005
No, nothing.

9
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,383
I just had a long day.

10
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,846
I was busy, and now I am tired.

11
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,015
That is all.

12
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,230
I see.

13
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,235
What about you?

14
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,654
Same here.

15
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,824
I had a long day, too.

16
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,563
What about the beach?

17
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,606
Let us go next time.

18
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,317
There is always a next time.

19
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,013
I will head inside now.

20
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,976
Why?

21
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,563
Let us go to the beach next time.

22
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,650
Yes, we promised.

23
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,570
Bye now.

24
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,937
You went to the dungeon to see His Majesty
and came out without seeing him, I hear.

25
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,191
I guess you now know who is in there.

26
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,030
You look like you have heard much worse.

27
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,283
Right.

28
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,245
You would not want to hand
over the evidence

29
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,997
to a father who is so desperately
trying to kill you

30
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,625
after abandoning you.

31
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,670
And what I will do next depends on you.

32
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,214
Do not lay a finger on Hwang-tae.

33
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,217
And promise me that you will not
chase after the Muwol Corps.

34
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,220
If anyone gets hurt...

35
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,513
That is easy.

36
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,932
We will see.

37
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,104
But there is an easier way.

38
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,568
You can join me.

39
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:40,989
What?

40
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,325
I would not need to be scared
by the fact that you have the evidence.

41
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,869
And you will be guaranteed
those people's safety

42
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,624
as well as a chance to take revenge
on your merciless father.

43
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,377
You can do all of that with me.

44
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,504
You are insane.

45
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,551
I will give you two days
to think about it.

46
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,857
No.

47
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,152
Nobody may enter
when His Majesty is not present.

48
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,032
-Well...
-It is the royal command.

49
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,134
Everyone may leave
except for Officer Yeon.

50
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,346
Yes, Your Majesty.

51
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,951
I heard you had something to say to me?

52
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,790
Yes, but there is no use now.

53
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,460
What is it?

54
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,046
I was going to report

55
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,634
that Jung Yun-jeo was seen in Hanyang.

56
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,636
Then you saw he was already arrested

57
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,139
and headed back.

58
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,142
Yes, Your Majesty.

59
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,018
Did you hear?

60
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,604
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,991
But I did not hear.

62
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,161
What did you say?

63
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,165
I did not hear anything
about the past you are trying to hide.

64
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,249
I just

65
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,086
heard your lonely cries.

66
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,431
Will you give it a try?

67
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,821
Yun-jeo was the same.

68
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,408
He was my good friend

69
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,536
who knew how lonely and tired I felt.

70
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,709
Although, it was all hypocrisy.

71
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,006
I will never forgive him.

72
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,675
I will no longer be fooled.

73
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,595
I must get him

74
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,473
and kill him.

75
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,619
I appoint you as my royal guard.

76
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,247
Will you stay by my side

77
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,999
and protect me

78
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,503
without betraying me?

79
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,313
I am honored, Your Majesty.

80
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,316
Your wish is my command.

81
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,548
Is he not the officer
who visits you sometimes?

82
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,720
When did he become a Royal Guard?

83
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,474
A Royal Guard?

84
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,768
A guard who protects His Majesty
right by his side.

85
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,021
Did you not know?

86
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,418
What are you doing?

87
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,129
We have so much work to do.
Let us finish this quickly.

88
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,089
Yes.

89
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,262
It is hard, is it not?

90
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,057
You tried so hard to get into the palace,

91
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,143
but work here is more demanding
than you imagined, right?

92
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,397
Yes.

93
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,191
It is tiring.

94
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,236
-I just want to quit.
-I knew

95
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,032
that Court Lady Kim was working you
way too hard.

96
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,034
I have been wanting this for so long.

97
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,913
I have never thought of doing
anything else other than this.

98
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,125
So I do not know what I have to do
to quit.

99
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,796
I am not sure if I can quit.

100
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,383
I am so lost.

101
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,887
Being a servant is not everything there is
to life, you know.

102
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,015
You are doing well, so stop overthinking.

103
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,657
What do you think you are doing?

104
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,827
Last night...

105
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,830
You must be tired, so let us go first.
I will tell you everything after.

106
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,166
No, I will not go.

107
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,877
I will no longer let you drag me around.

108
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,380
-Brother--
-I told you to not call me that.

109
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,632
My real name is Jung I-hyeong.

110
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,509
And I have nothing to do with you.

111
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,138
I want to restore my family's honor
and live the life I deserve.

112
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,514
Does that bother you so much?

113
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,142
Why do you keep spoiling my plans?

114
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:07,768
Father is...

115
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,063
in the prison inside the palace.

116
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,650
What?

117
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,451
I know that this is all because of me.

118
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,954
I am going to save Father.

119
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,373
How?

120
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,168
Are you going to beg your birth father?

121
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,590
I will let everyone know

122
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,260
everything the King did 20 years ago.

123
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,137
What?

124
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,972
Then it will become harder
to enter the dungeon,

125
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,724
and I will take the chance to...

126
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,059
You are going to tell the world yourself?

127
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,646
You are going to tell everyone
about how you were abandoned?

128
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,028
No.

129
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,157
It will be faster to help Prince Neungyang
become the king and have him help me.

130
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,827
I am going to make that happen
and save Father my way,

131
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,204
-so do not meddle.
-Hwang-tae...

132
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,392
20 YEARS AGO, HIS MAJESTY KILLED HIS SON
TO BECOME KING HIMSELF.

133
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,238
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

134
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,451
Here, read this.

135
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:54,333
His Majesty not only abandoned his son,
but tried to kill him!

136
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,127
Yes, I am telling you!

137
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,735
20 YEARS AGO, HIS MAJESTY KILLED HIS SON
TO BECOME KING HIMSELF

138
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,868
What did you just say?

139
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,538
Your Majesty, it is just a false rumor.

140
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,790
Who started this?

141
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,544
Arrest him immediately and kill him!

142
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,684
Responding to a rumor
will only make it more believable.

143
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,980
What shall I do, then?

144
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,441
Ignore it, Your Majesty.

145
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,737
Then it will go away on its own.

146
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,867
-Is that so?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

147
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,285
Since many are watching,

148
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,538
I advise you not to visit the dungeon
for a while.

149
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,790
If you need to keep an eye
on the prisoner,

150
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,959
I will take care of that,

151
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,129
for we do not know what nonsense
he will say to other people.

152
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,801
Yes, do so.

153
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,805
Yes, Your Majesty.

154
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,742
Father...

155
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,999
How did you get in here?

156
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,003
Get out right now.
This is too dangerous for you.

157
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,130
-If His Majesty finds out--
-Why did you do that?

158
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,512
What do you mean?

159
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,890
Why did you save me and end up in prison?

160
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,269
-Nok-du...
-Why did you let Mother die like that?

161
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,563
And Hwang-tae...

162
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,859
And did you have to save me?

163
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,613
Do not say that.

164
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,324
He was right.

165
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,578
-I should have just died.
-Watch what you say!

166
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,082
How dare a son say that
in front of his father?

167
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,417
Did I raise you to be like this?

168
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,877
You should have just abandoned me
20 years ago.

169
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,054
You were silent as if you were dead.

170
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,891
Then you started crying
at the very last moment.

171
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,562
With that tiny body of yours,
you cried for life.

172
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,189
You cried to show that you were alive.

173
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,485
I just did what I was supposed to do

174
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,573
as a human being, nothing heroic.

175
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,411
Even though it brought

176
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,458
so much tragedy?

177
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,547
Even if I were to go back,

178
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,176
I would have saved you.

179
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,805
So, do not waste your life.

180
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,974
-Leave the palace immediately--
-No.

181
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,852
I will not flee or hide.

182
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,065
I am sorry for keeping you here, Father.

183
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,651
-I will free you soon.
-Nok-du!

184
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,819
I just wanted to see you.

185
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,449
I am good now since I saw you.

186
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,704
Let us go to the beach.

187
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,932
You wanted to go to the beach, no?

188
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,810
I did not know that it was so far away.

189
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,438
We are slacking off at work, are we not?

190
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,108
Do you want to go to the beach that bad?

191
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,528
I do not mind wherever we go.

192
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,576
Having you by my side is more than enough.

193
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,542
Stop saying such cheesy things
and have this.

194
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,888
You made this yourself.

195
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,975
-Why did you do that?
-What a picky eater you are.

196
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,519
I knew you were picky
from the widow village.

197
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,231
-Try this yourself.
-I am not hungry.

198
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,941
Come on, open your mouth.

199
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,068
No, I am not going to eat.

200
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,937
I am not picky, you are just cranky.

201
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,648
You grabbed me by my collar
when we first met,

202
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,316
and punched me whenever you had a chance.

203
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,151
You bullied me around so much.

204
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,612
You are the one who slaved me around,

205
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,113
making me fetch things for you.

206
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,949
Slave you around?

207
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,660
I applied ointment on you,
did the laundry, and even cooked for you.

208
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,496
What an odd girl you are.
I did so much for you.

209
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,831
Says the man who dressed up as a woman

210
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,625
to get into the widow village.

211
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,045
You are the odd one.

212
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,551
Right, I was odd.

213
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,304
The reason I entered the village was

214
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,599
because I grew up always wondering
who I was.

215
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,686
I went into the village to find out.

216
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,897
Because I thought someone who knew that
was at the village.

217
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,150
So,

218
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,820
did you find out

219
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,239
who you are?

220
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,076
Yes, I found out about everything.

221
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,496
So, I am going to make things right.

222
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,166
I have to protect my father.

223
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,894
Let us go back. It is getting late.

224
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,923
The war between Ming and Manchu

225
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,551
is getting intense day by day.

226
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,095
Therefore, I believe that you must
send troops

227
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,930
to assist Ming as soon as possible.

228
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,559
How can I send my people
to another horrific war

229
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,271
when they have not fully recovered
from the Japanese invasion?

230
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,399
-I will not be sending troops.
-Your Majesty!

231
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,152
Have you forgotten
about how they saved us?

232
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,571
Ming is the country that helped us

233
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,240
to fight off Japan during the war.

234
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,825
Helped us?

235
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,079
No, they never helped us.

236
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,624
They came to fight in Joseon
as they did not want war on their land.

237
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,542
And they were disinterested in the war.

238
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:01,171
They were busy leeching off of my people!

239
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,425
Your Majesty!

240
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,720
How could you say such a thing?

241
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,765
Had it not been for merciful Ming--

242
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:12,849
Merciful?

243
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,146
How are you all so sure?

244
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,026
I am the one who experienced the war
at the front line.

245
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,363
It was not you who were busy running off.

246
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:30,158
Your Majesty, you keep ignoring
what is proper,

247
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,828
no wonder such rumors...

248
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,165
What? Rumors?

249
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,169
Excuse me,

250
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,466
I am here to pick up
what Court Lady Kim requested.

251
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,676
I see.

252
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,641
Thank you.

253
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,606
MEDICINE

254
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,693
Goodness.

255
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,573
My lady.

256
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,056
Say that

257
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,350
one more time.

258
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,812
Your Majesty!

259
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,900
I deserve to die!

260
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:43,268
We should have buried them
in the best land we could find,

261
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,813
but we had to do it in secret.

262
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,566
We are too disgraced to see you.

263
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,235
No.

264
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,240
Thank you so much for taking care of them.

265
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,913
You must have had a hard life.

266
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,917
I cannot imagine how difficult it was

267
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,837
for you to grow up
in this tough world alone.

268
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,925
But what brought you to Hanyang?

269
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,219
Why are you at the palace?

270
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,930
Why are you putting yourself
in such a dangerous place?

271
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,933
You are

272
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,562
not planning on doing anything, right?

273
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:35,278
It is too dangerous, my lady!
It is not over yet.

274
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,073
What do you mean?

275
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:43,036
We were brought to His Majesty recently.

276
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,375
He kept asking us if there was
any family member alive.

277
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,211
You must leave.

278
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,756
We will all die if he finds out
that you are still alive,

279
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,633
just like back then.

280
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,555
Is that what he said?

281
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,891
That he will find me and kill me?

282
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,936
Get out of the palace now.

283
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,771
Do not do anything,

284
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,400
and just hide somewhere far away.

285
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,238
No. I will not run.

286
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,366
I cannot give up after
all I have been through.

287
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,872
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

288
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,377
How dare you

289
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,257
bring up such a rumor
in my presence at my palace?

290
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,676
My son is alive?

291
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,221
And he is more qualified
to sit on the throne?

292
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,849
Fine. Is there anyone else?

293
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,102
Come up and tell me

294
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,479
what other false rumors are there.

295
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,356
Go ahead!

296
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,193
Bring His Majesty out,

297
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,738
and the rest of you,
clean up after the corpse.

298
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,156
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

299
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,119
Your Majesty.

300
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,279
How can this happen?

301
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,450
Minister, we must not
turn a blind eye on this.

302
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,202
Do you not agree?

303
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,355
Father!

304
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,439
Father!

305
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,737
Father!

306
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,783
Father!

307
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,091
How...

308
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,553
How could you do this?

309
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,472
-How could you?
-Take him away.

310
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,434
Bring my father back to life.

311
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,438
My father!

312
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,947
This is all your fault.

313
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,075
Had you not saved the boy!

314
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,870
No, Your Majesty.

315
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,874
Whatever I did

316
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:03,630
does not change the terrible things
you have done.

317
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,090
How dare you!

318
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,412
What are you doing?

319
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,457
No, Your Majesty.

320
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,710
Give it to me.

321
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,381
I must find out where the child is now

322
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,801
even if that means I have to kill him.

323
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,845
Have you forgotten about our conversation?

324
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,809
If you do this,
rumors will only get worse.

325
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:44,439
We were brought to His Majesty recently.

326
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:47,900
He kept asking us if there was
any family member alive.

327
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,902
You must leave.

328
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,489
We will all die if he finds out
that you are still alive,

329
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,824
just like back then.

330
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,766
Why did you come back?

331
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,186
What if someone sees?

332
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,778
Nok-du.

333
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,489
I will make him regret

334
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,492
having done this to you.

335
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,577
I will

336
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,163
never forgive him.

337
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,167
What are you going to do?

338
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,794
I am going to take revenge.

339
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,214
I will make him cry tears of remorse.

340
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,553
I will drag him down from the throne
that he fought so dirty to keep.

341
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,763
Are you going to be the same?

342
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,309
Why not?

343
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:50,815
If that is what it takes to correct
everything I have messed up.

344
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,483
He is

345
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,862
your birth father.

346
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,333
Exactly.

347
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,588
That is why I cannot forgive him.

348
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,549
Because he is my father.

349
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,391
Nok-du!

350
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,226
Nok-du!

351
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,158
You look glum today.

352
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,535
Is something wrong?

353
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,414
No, Your Majesty.

354
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,001
Or,

355
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,962
is it that you are disappointed in me?

356
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,090
How could I be, Your Majesty?

357
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,596
Everybody fears and hates me,
and are turning their backs on me.

358
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,642
How come you are not?

359
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:13,105
Even I am terrified of myself.

360
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:24,367
I will never leave your side.

361
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,175
I will be leaving early morning
the day after tomorrow.

362
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:46,472
Let us say that we will visit
the royal tombs and get some fresh air.

363
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,267
Everything will be fine

364
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,478
after that.

365
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,857
Yes, Your Majesty.

366
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,739
I heard that you were looking for me,
Your Majesty.

367
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,786
It seems that I have given you
too big of a task

368
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,372
when all you do is to play with kisaengs.

369
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,042
I apologize, Your Majesty. I will--

370
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,462
When I am back visiting the royal tombs,
he will help you.

371
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,968
He knows everything.

372
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,013
He is wise, and skillful in martial arts.

373
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,931
So, look for him together.

374
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,477
Yes, Your Majesty.

375
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,903
You must find him.

376
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,531
If you fail to capture him,

377
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,867
kill him.

378
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,832
Your Majesty.

379
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,343
-Why are you doing this?
-What do you mean?

380
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,220
I would like to know why you are

381
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,724
trying to kill your son,
since I may be the one to kill him.

382
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,777
He is destined to be the King.

383
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,488
If he is alive,

384
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,824
I will never be able to keep my throne

385
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,203
even though I do become the king.

386
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,541
It took me so much to get here.

387
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,046
Is that...

388
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,843
all?

389
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,851
To me,

390
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,854
that is more than enough.

391
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,649
Are you good now?

392
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,250
I heard it was a shaman
with marvelous insights,

393
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,003
although that was her last prophecy.

394
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,923
Why did you ask?

395
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,927
Did you think that there would be
some special reason?

396
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,245
I did not think this would affect you,

397
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,747
but I understand that you are in shock.

398
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:03,252
After all, he is trying to kill you
because of a prophecy.

399
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,006
It would not be a bad idea to make
his biggest fear come true.

400
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:12,136
Since he will not die a king
if we succeed with the revolt.

401
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,101
Let me kill him myself.

402
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,253
INN

403
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,424
Are you drunk?

404
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,385
Yes.

405
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,720
So that I can come and see you.

406
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,307
Why did you get drunk to see me?

407
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,062
I thought

408
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,359
I would be able to tell you
if I got drunk.

409
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,445
Tell me what?

410
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,701
To leave me.

411
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,880
Then why did you come here
instead of the palace?

412
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,264
I guess I have the same drinking habit
as you.

413
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,309
I thought I would be able to tell you
if I got drunk.

414
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,311
That is why I got drunk,

415
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,648
but now that I am drunk, I cannot lie.

416
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,529
I keep wanting to tell you the truth now.

417
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,282
That is why I did not go.

418
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,121
Sure.

419
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,250
-As you said, we--
-What I really want to say is...

420
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,388
please do not leave.

421
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,603
I know this is irresponsible
and selfish of me.

422
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,398
You can blame it on the alcohol.

423
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,150
But...

424
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,820
even then...

425
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,490
Nok-du.

426
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,674
Whatever I do,

427
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,389
even if I am the worst man on Earth,

428
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,891
I wish...

429
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,313
that you will stay with me.

430
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,180
I am the bad one here.

431
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,062
I should not have,

432
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,233
but I was swayed

433
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,113
when you asked me to follow my heart
just for the time being.

434
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,741
I wanted to follow my heart.

435
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,497
What are you trying to say?

436
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,131
Let us end things here.

437
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:02,885
We have to.

438
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,561
Why? Why is that?

439
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,151
Whatever happens, whatever I do,

440
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,278
it has nothing to do with you.

441
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:23,989
It is...

442
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,366
all because of me.

443
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,410
-So--
-Be more specific.

444
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,415
I am sorry.

445
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,310
I need to know.

446
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,730
-Know what?
-Why you are abandoning me.

447
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,234
There is another reason, is there not?

448
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,487
Why are you acting so weird?

449
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,697
Why are you doing this to me?

450
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,034
Why should I

451
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,746
have to lose you?

452
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,180
Please do not leave me.

453
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,817
There is nothing I can do for you.

454
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,282
You will get hurt if you stay with me.

455
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,999
What do you mean?

456
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,459
I do not want that.

457
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,588
I do not want to hurt you.

458
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,845
So please, let me leave.

459
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,520
Are you here to see Dong-ju?

460
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,105
Yes.

461
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,024
She left the palace early this morning.

462
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:08,111
Court Lady Kim is escorting Her Majesty
to the temple,

463
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,238
so she told Dong-ju that she does not
need to come to work.

464
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,618
Do you know where she is staying?

465
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,578
No, she did not tell me.

466
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,414
I see.

467
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,884
What is all of this?

468
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:34,179
I am sorry that you went through so much
because of me.

469
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,350
I know that I cannot make up for it,

470
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,102
but please at least accept this.

471
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,687
My lady...

472
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,106
Why are you doing this?

473
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,358
What are you trying to do?

474
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,735
I told you not to do it!

475
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,906
It is impossible.
Do not even think about it.

476
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,574
It is the palace you are talking about!

477
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,661
I must do it.

478
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,417
I will get going now.

479
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,474
Did you all see how terrified they were?

480
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:24,688
Looks like His Majesty dug his own grave.

481
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,566
We should not be celebrating
someone's death.

482
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,403
Which is why we need to dethrone him
as soon as possible

483
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,280
before there are more victims.

484
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,907
More importantly, how are things going?

485
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,326
We could not find His Majesty's son.

486
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,786
And what is with the rumor?

487
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:43,331
If it is the son himself
who started the rumor,

488
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,168
-is that not dangerous for us?
-Indeed.

489
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:50,297
And where are the Muwol Corps members?

490
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,761
There has been a change of plans.

491
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,777
What?

492
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,697
-Why is he here?
-Say hello.

493
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,824
He is the man of the rumor.

494
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,411
Are you then His Majesty's son?

495
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,830
Yes, he is. He has been abandoned
a long time ago.

496
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,336
He is joining us.

497
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,005
While we take over the palace,

498
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,883
he will capture the King
and bring him back.

499
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,555
How come I, the Commandant,
did not know this?

500
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,599
Would it not be more fun

501
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,226
to watch the King get dragged by his son?

502
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:01,451
JEON NOK-DU

503
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,288
OATH

504
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,959
-Good?
-If you ever have second thoughts,

505
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,962
remember that your brother's life is
in my hands.

506
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,257
He came back to me on his own again

507
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,300
so do not hate me for it.

508
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,397
Keep a close eye on him.

509
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,818
I ordered some swordsmen
to secretly follow him, so do not worry.

510
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,947
You must take the Royal Seal
while he captures the King,

511
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:42,075
so that there is no trace of him
left behind.

512
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:43,952
Yes.

513
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:47,038
I am the keeper of the Royal Seal
so it will be a piece of cake.

514
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,832
Do not worry at all.

515
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,056
Are you really siding with him?

516
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,393
He will be of great use since
he is crazy for revenge right now.

517
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,688
I am dethroning the King for mistreating
his parents,

518
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,524
so it would be hypocritical of me
to kill my own uncle.

519
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,818
Is it not nice of him to do it for me?

520
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:19,279
Do not worry.

521
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,908
I do not plan on letting a man
who killed his father live.

522
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,868
I will let you

523
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,329
kill him yourself.

524
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,139
I heard that you have been promoted.

525
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,767
Congratulations, my lord.

526
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,852
Thank you, Officer.

527
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,897
What brings you to the police bureau?

528
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:57,108
I heard that you are escorting Her Majesty
to the temple tomorrow.

529
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,362
Yes, I am.

530
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,616
Could you give this to her?

531
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,744
I picked it up at the palace.

532
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,831
She has been looking everywhere for this.

533
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,125
What a relief.

534
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:19,130
Please take good care of her.

535
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:20,924
Sorry?

536
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,134
Right, yes.

537
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,220
Will do.

538
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,224
My lord...

539
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,280
-A revolt?
-Yes.

540
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,201
She is trying to kill His Majesty,

541
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,453
so it is indeed a revolt.

542
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,373
Does that mean that you lied
in front of His Majesty before?

543
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,125
I had no idea.

544
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,795
I did not know that she was alive then.

545
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,923
I obviously thought she was dead.

546
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,343
She was not even 10 years old back then.

547
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,724
It seems that she joined a kisaeng house

548
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,435
and was raised there.

549
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,479
Where is she?

550
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:23,903
You will keep your promise, right?

551
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:28,241
That those who report a revolt does not
get punished.

552
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,702
My wife and I will live, right?

553
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,662
Yes, so tell us where she is right now.

554
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,624
There is an inn

555
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,294
past the market.

556
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,337
Take the lead.

557
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,593
I will go,

558
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,511
so please go to the palace
and tell His Majesty.

559
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,221
Sorry?

560
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,226
Okay.

561
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,271
I will follow you right after I tell
His Majesty.

562
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,023
Take the lead.

563
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,668
Did you just say a kisaeng house
in Mudamgol?

564
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,295
Yes.

565
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,882
But I hear that the kisaeng house
no longer exists.

566
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:30,720
She is now a servant at the palace.

567
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,603
I do not believe this.

568
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,868
Have you seen a woman with short hair?

569
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,328
That woman?

570
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,373
She left her belongings here.
She said she was going out.

571
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,543
INN

572
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,088
Why does everyone keep looking for her?

573
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,506
She is in the room over there.

574
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,514
The order is to kill her
as soon as we catch her.

575
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,470
-Go after her!
-Yes, my lord!

576
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,823
I cannot say.

577
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,701
Just like how you cannot tell me
why you dressed like a woman

578
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,455
to get into the widow village
and why you are here with a fake name,

579
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,333
I have my reasons, okay?

580
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,085
Why are you so complicated?

581
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,297
What are you so scared of?

582
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,593
Why are you so fearless?

583
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,929
We can never predict the future.

584
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:54,942
I had to do something.

585
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,612
It was my goal for my entire life.

586
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,572
I figured

587
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,034
I would be able to meet my mom
and finally be happy

588
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:04,952
when everything is over.

589
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,206
It was what kept me going.

590
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,001
Do you...

591
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,090
know...

592
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:19,592
who I am?

593
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,574
Go.

594
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:48,955
I said, go!

595
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,002
Go.

596
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,671
I said, go!

597
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:24,634
My child, stay alive.

598
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:26,969
You must live...

599
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,722
Mother!

600
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,310
By the Royal Guard,

601
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,479
do you mean the Officer I met back then?

602
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:40,399
He is His Majesty's son I saved
20 years ago.

603
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,152
Yeon Su is dead?

604
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:45,988
He died a long time ago due to an illness.

605
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,490
Then Guard Yeon is...

606
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,826
Who is Guard Yeon, then?

607
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:54,205
