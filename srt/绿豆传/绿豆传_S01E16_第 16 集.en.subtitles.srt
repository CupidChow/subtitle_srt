1
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,253
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,755
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,311
You must catch them

4
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,022
no matter what.

5
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,857
Yes, Your Majesty.

6
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,339
No, I should do it myself.

7
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,082
Nok-du, are you okay?

8
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,130
I am a bit late because I had to take
your father outside the palace.

9
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,756
Is he okay?

10
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,425
-Yes, your father is okay.
-What about you?

11
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,302
Are you okay?

12
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,930
Yes, this is nothing.

13
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,599
But is His Majesty really back?

14
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,478
You must escape
with Hwang-tae and Dong-ju.

15
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,147
What about you?

16
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,940
I need to go somewhere.

17
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:33,069
Okay, bring her safely.
Make sure you be careful.

18
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,704
No, let me go with you.

19
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,792
We have no time to lose. Hurry.

20
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,255
Let us go.

21
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,395
Oh, no.

22
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,771
Oh, dear.

23
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,482
I am okay.

24
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,485
But we must leave the palace.

25
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,404
What do you mean?

26
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,700
His Majesty has returned.

27
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,328
What?

28
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,788
How?

29
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,751
So are you being chased?

30
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,377
Yes.

31
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,637
There is a secret door in the back garden
that leads the way out of the palace.

32
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,097
Court Lady Kim.

33
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,850
-Lead the way.
-Yes, Your Highness.

34
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,186
Follow me.

35
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,188
Okay.

36
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,482
You should come with us, Mother.

37
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,000
No one is in the Crown Prince's palace.

38
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,547
I think I know where he is hiding.

39
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,299
Let us go.

40
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,600
What are you talking about?

41
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,437
Why can you not come with me?

42
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,108
This place is dangerous.
How can I leave you here all alone?

43
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,236
His Majesty cannot kill me.

44
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,198
Because I am the only one

45
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,243
who is left by his side.

46
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,997
What about me?

47
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,582
I finally

48
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,544
got to meet my mother.

49
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,089
You have no idea

50
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,010
how much I do not wish
to say goodbye to you.

51
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,929
Then why?

52
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,390
-Why--
-Because

53
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,768
I am the Queen of this country.

54
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:16,524
My husband may be cold-hearted and brutal.

55
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,569
Still, he is the king of this country.

56
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,947
If I also leave his side,

57
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,704
those shameless men
will destroy his life in an instant.

58
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,749
And I must not let that happen.

59
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,793
Mother.

60
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,470
Nok-du.

61
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,223
Whatever they say,

62
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,603
you are my one and only

63
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,355
precious son.

64
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,651
Keep that in mind

65
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,489
and put behind all your hurtful memories.

66
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,949
Now, go somewhere far away

67
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,038
and live a free life.

68
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,671
Will you do that for me?

69
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,845
I promise we will meet one day.

70
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,098
I promise.

71
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,933
So

72
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,769
make sure you stay alive.

73
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,940
Stay alive no matter what.

74
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,318
You must come this way. Hurry.

75
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,619
You used to live here
when you were the Crown Princess.

76
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,622
And you are not the only one
who knows this place.

77
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,876
Where is he?

78
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,586
How long

79
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,215
are you going to keep being so brutal?

80
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,341
How dare you!

81
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,385
Your Highness.

82
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,347
If anyone moves an inch,

83
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,767
I will cut my own throat.

84
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,729
If you wish to kill me,

85
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,231
then go ahead.

86
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,651
Kill me first!

87
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,448
Then you can go kill your own son!

88
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,466
This is the exit.
You must hurry up and go.

89
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,013
I hope you understand the Queen.

90
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:39,477
She decided to stay because she believes
that is what she needs to do

91
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,562
in order to protect you two.

92
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,900
I hope you stay safe.

93
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,153
Where are they?

94
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,700
There they are.

95
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:40,204
The entire city is in chaos.

96
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,248
Get on board with Aeng-du.

97
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,875
But Nok-du is not here yet.

98
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,129
I told him to hide somewhere
if things go bad, so I will check there.

99
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,048
You should go first
with your father and Aeng-du, okay?

100
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,466
What...

101
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,594
Hey.

102
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,721
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

103
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,806
I am sorry I never got to repay you
for your kindness.

104
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,309
You ladies should leave as well.

105
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,102
You are not safe here.

106
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,066
Hurry up. Get on the boat.

107
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,737
What...

108
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,738
What are you doing?

109
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,658
You think we can trust these weak men
with a little kid?

110
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,995
No way. We will go with them.

111
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,207
Yes, let us go.

112
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,376
My goodness.

113
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,005
Get on board. Give me that.

114
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,759
Hurry up and get on board.

115
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,261
Go on.

116
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,681
Here.

117
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,240
Do... Do not go.

118
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,537
Hold this for me.

119
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,001
What are you still doing here?

120
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,046
You should go now. And be careful.

121
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,548
-Go on.
-Okay.

122
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,280
-Nok-du.
-Yes?

123
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,660
I am okay.

124
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,246
No, you are not.

125
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,999
Why do you always say you are okay?

126
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,836
Do I say that?

127
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,338
Okay then.

128
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,507
I am not okay.

129
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,512
It hurts a lot. It hurts so much.

130
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,690
You should have hugged me earlier.

131
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,694
I finally feel better now.

132
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,034
Do not fall asleep.

133
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,331
I will not fall asleep.

134
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,710
I will keep talking to you.

135
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,214
Talk about what?

136
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,181
Since when

137
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,225
did you start liking me?

138
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,652
Do you seriously
want to talk about that right now?

139
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,991
You liked me ever since we started

140
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,120
living together at the widow village,
did you not?

141
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,967
Why would I fall for a man
who was dressed up as a woman?

142
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,224
Then if we go back in time,

143
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,146
will you not fall for me again?

144
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,133
It is a bloodstain.

145
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,469
He must have gone that way.

146
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,536
You see,

147
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,792
if I could turn back time
to when we first met,

148
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,130
I will do everything I can
to run away with you.

149
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,092
I will make sure
you never find out anything.

150
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,387
I will not let you find out who I am.

151
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,228
I will just run away with you.
It will be just you and me.

152
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,564
And...

153
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,911
Are you listening?

154
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,582
Are you?

155
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,960
Nok-du, no.

156
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,712
Please...

157
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,423
No...

158
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,220
Dong-ju.

159
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,728
-Nok-du.
-Nok-du.

160
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,849
No, not this way.

161
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,692
What is the matter?

162
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,861
If you follow this path,
you will find a river.

163
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,072
And when you get there,
you will see a small boat.

164
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,534
Do you think you can take him there?

165
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,203
What are you talking about?

166
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,497
I will do my best to help you buy time.

167
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,875
So stay here and do as I say.

168
00:16:58,892 --> 00:16:59,977
Oh, and one more thing.

169
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,356
This might be too much to ask.

170
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:09,945
But...

171
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,698
But when you meet Aeng-du--

172
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,867
I cannot take Nok-du there all by myself.

173
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,704
-What?
-We will get caught on our way there.

174
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,373
You know you cannot fight them
on your own.

175
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,959
Then all three of us will die.

176
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,254
Are you trying to...

177
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,674
I am only doing this to survive.

178
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,976
Please do your best

179
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,645
to save Nok-du.

180
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,977
He is dead.

181
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,275
Are you trying to buy him time
with this cheap trick?

182
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,611
And did he send you to do this?

183
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,156
While he was on the run, you caught him
and killed him with your sword.

184
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,784
That is what I want you to say.

185
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,165
If you do that,

186
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,047
I will stay by your side.

187
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,342
You will stay by my side?

188
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,595
Do you even know what that means?

189
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,933
I will never let you go anywhere.

190
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,519
I will keep you hidden
for the rest of your life.

191
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,771
Go ahead.

192
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,065
I do not care.

193
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,250
This is not the way. Let us leave.

194
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,709
I found his body after he fell
into the river and got swept away.

195
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,046
He got stabbed by your sword

196
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,591
and got swept away by the river?

197
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,385
Yes, Your Majesty.

198
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,020
You really brought me his body.

199
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,693
That is not necessary.

200
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,614
I will not be able to recognize him

201
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,824
since he was in the river for days.

202
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,164
And I know you will never

203
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,209
lie to me.

204
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,134
Would you like to try it?

205
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,559
Never mind. If you do not want to...

206
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,238
Is it good?

207
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,826
Yes, it is.

208
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,230
You promised to do anything.

209
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,572
I did.

210
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,033
I will wait

211
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,453
until you truly love me.

212
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,418
I said I do not need your love,
but that was a lie.

213
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,879
You can take as long as you need

214
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,090
to truly open up to me.

215
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,803
That is all I ask.

216
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,680
I can lie

217
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,768
and promise you that I will.

218
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:16,978
But

219
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,357
you and I both know too well

220
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,151
that sincerity

221
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,904
and love

222
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,908
cannot be forced.

223
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,088
Stop.

224
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,250
You may go now.

225
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,571
Dong-ju.

226
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,605
I told you not to.

227
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,149
It is fine as long as they cannot see
from the outside.

228
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:09,776
What do you think?

229
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,153
Even ghosts with good eyes
will pass by our house.

230
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,449
Now, stop whimpering and go to sleep.
You are so loud.

231
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,520
What are you doing?

232
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,481
Why did you not light the candle?

233
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,441
You were alive?

234
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,027
You were alive.

235
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,946
Of course.

236
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,449
I promised that I will...

237
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,756
I am sorry I came so late.

238
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,827
You and I both know too well

239
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,204
that sincerity

240
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,082
and love

241
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,002
cannot be forced.

242
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,304
My lord, if we do not go now,
we will lose them.

243
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,683
-Should we go after them?
-No, let them leave.

244
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,208
My goodness.

245
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,836
I did not know
my daughter-in-law could run so fast.

246
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,006
My precious son died after he married you!

247
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,425
So you should have done as you were told!

248
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,093
How dare you run away?

249
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,221
You are unbelievable.

250
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,432
My goodness!

251
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,645
My goodness.

252
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,481
What? My nose is bleeding.

253
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,317
How dare you!

254
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,461
My goodness.

255
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,463
What...

256
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:44,175
She is not my daughter-in-law.

257
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,107
Who... Who are you?

258
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,280
-My lord!
-My lord!

259
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,783
You must have been startled.

260
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,828
Everything will be okay now.

261
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,749
It was nice

262
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,586
when he first offered to help us.

263
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,671
He is having fun.

264
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,466
He likes pretending to be a widow
so he could beat up their fathers-in-law.

265
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,470
He is worth ten good men
during other missions.

266
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,097
So let him have his fun.

267
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,231
She says she has nowhere to go.

268
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,317
You should come with us to the village.

269
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,028
You can share a room with Lady Jang.

270
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,614
Who are you to decide?

271
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,951
Thank you so much.

272
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,663
I will forever be grateful.

273
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,376
Well, I should go now.

274
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,170
I will see you at the wedding.

275
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,298
We will be sailing there tomorrow,

276
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,799
so just stay the night and go with us.

277
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,428
-No, I cannot!
-Why not?

278
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,891
Because I miss him.

279
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,356
You cannot eat because you miss him?

280
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,026
It has only been three days since he left.

281
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,362
He was supposed to come back yesterday.

282
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,406
The waves were too strong yesterday,

283
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,991
so I bet he could not sail.

284
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:36,371
I know, but that does not change the fact
that I miss him.

285
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,041
I did not think this before,

286
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,543
but she has no respect for widows.

287
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:46,047
She gets on my nerves
every time she waits for him to come back.

288
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,634
He is here!

289
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,388
My goodness.

290
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,016
Be careful.

291
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,440
Nok-du must be back.

292
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,449
Nok-du!

293
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,747
You will fall! Slow down!

294
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,590
-I will kill them.
-No, just let them be.

295
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,425
My goodness, let them be.

296
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,761
I got myself in this mess.

297
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,771
Why did you buy something so expensive?

298
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,482
I was going to wear it at our wedding.

299
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,610
I wanted to surprised you.
Why could you not just wait?

300
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,279
Why do you always spend so much money?

301
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,490
Do you know how much you spent
on our wedding?

302
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,825
Why do you have no sense of romance?

303
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,827
We only get one wedding.

304
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,580
What is wrong with spending
a little money? We make money to spend it.

305
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,005
Look. These are all the things
you have bought so far.

306
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,216
Do you call this a little? Seriously?

307
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,260
I could not help it.
They would all look pretty on you.

308
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,431
Okay, fine. I am sorry.

309
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,936
So let us put this away and do...

310
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,438
Do what?

311
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,526
Let us carry on with
what we were about to do earlier.

312
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,986
No way!

313
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,781
Why not?

314
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,575
Everyone is busy getting ready
for our wedding.

315
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,203
Hurry up and help them out.
I need to clean the room.

316
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,105
I said we should break up out of anger,

317
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:53,359
but she instantly agreed to it,
packed her stuff, and just left.

318
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,944
My goodness.

319
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,656
These rings are pretty.

320
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,200
She seriously has no sense of romance.

321
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,206
How could she be so indifferent
to my feelings?

322
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,002
I married her and moved
all the way to this island just for her.

323
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,337
My goodness.

324
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,801
I should not have fallen
for her beautiful eyes at that dock.

325
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,761
Then I will not have had
to go through this darn...

326
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,054
This darn what?

327
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,107
What are you doing here?
I thought you wanted to break up.

328
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:36,485
Stop complaining and follow me.
Let us go home and talk.

329
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:40,948
Okay.

330
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,492
I will count to three.

331
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,579
One, two, three. I am here.

332
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,040
My goodness.

333
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,917
-Come here.
-Here.

334
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,002
What are you doing?

335
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,838
You make me feel like a baby
every time you do this.

336
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,256
Neh!

337
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,011
What an eyesore. What are they doing?

338
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,225
You are one to talk. You are
the biggest fool in love on this island.

339
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,645
What happened? Did she scold you again?

340
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,104
I did not get scolded.

341
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,440
I got angry at her and left.

342
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,695
What?

343
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,573
I am happy

344
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,201
that we are living together again.

345
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,913
Me too.

346
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,166
I am happy I get to live with you
and Dad again just like the old days.

347
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,751
And

348
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,338
I feel especially grateful to you.
I also feel sorry.

349
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,423
Really?

350
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,717
Then how about you cancel the wedding

351
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,929
so you can keep living with me and Dad
just like the old days?

352
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,056
Stop being absurd.

353
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,393
Hwang-tae, you should get married, too.

354
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,646
What do you think about Lady Lee?

355
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,779
What about Lady Kim?

356
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,872
Cut the nonsense.

357
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,835
-You are being weird.
-Stop being absurd.

358
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,296
What is this reaction?
I think you like her.

359
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,672
Will you stop it?

360
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,443
Smile.

361
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,114
You look pretty.

362
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,076
You must be really happy.

363
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,537
Yes, I am very happy.

364
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,706
Were you not the one who told me

365
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,750
that I should not marry
a good-for-nothing guy like him?

366
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,298
But now, it looks like
that was just part of your big picture.

367
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,092
-I bet that was what it was.
-Is that true?

368
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,428
My goodness, no way.

369
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,890
Aeng-du, that is not true.

370
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,688
Anyway, please take good care of Nok-du.

371
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,149
He may be a little immature,

372
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,860
but he is a good man,
so I hope you have a happy marriage.

373
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,989
Always love each other, okay?

374
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,366
Okay. Thank you.

375
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,500
Wait. Where are the rice cakes?

376
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,211
Wait! You forgot the rice cakes!

377
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,132
-Oh, gosh.
-Oh, my goodness.

378
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,510
-My gosh.
-I am okay, everyone.

379
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,345
-My goodness!
-I cannot believe that just happened.

380
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,555
Okay, everyone. I am okay.

381
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,768
I am okay. Come here, Bok-nyeo. I am okay.

382
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,484
-My gosh!
-What is going on?

383
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,195
-My goodness.
-Everything is fine.

384
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,198
-My gosh.
-The wind is so strong.

385
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,413
The bride is here.

386
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,207
Goodness, she looks beautiful.

387
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:27,229
Okay, everyone. We will now begin
the wedding ceremony

388
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:31,108
of Jeon Nok-du and Dong Dong-ju.

389
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,446
"The groom and bride
must love each other at all times.

390
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,449
But in order to do that, they must..."

391
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,035
-Oh, gosh!
-My goodness!

392
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,829
Go get that!
It took me all night to write that!

393
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,165
My goodness, I need that!

394
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:49,168
-Why is it so windy today?
-My gosh.

395
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:53,422
-My goodness.
-What is going on?

396
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,259
-My gosh.
-It is okay.

397
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,730
Do you think they picked the wrong date?

398
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,858
Why would you say that?

399
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,071
I have to say,
the weather is amazing today.

400
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,288
You should make a congratulatory speech.

401
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,793
-My goodness, no.
-That is a good idea.

402
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,846
Then before the wedding ceremony begins,

403
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:47,476
I would like to say a few words
to the couple.

404
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:54,650
Marriage is when two different people meet

405
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,277
and live together
for the rest of their lives.

406
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:01,949
Therefore, you must respect
and cherish each other.

407
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,452
And if you endure the hardships
and continue to make efforts,

408
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,038
you will build the strength

409
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,125
to overcome whatever obstacle
that may come your way.

410
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:15,254
Therefore, I trust that the two of you

411
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:19,675
will always be happy with each other

412
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,511
and rely on each other

413
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,514
for the rest of your lives

414
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:29,393
regardless of how difficult
things might get...

415
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,520
-My goodness.
-Oh, gosh!

416
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,861
My goodness, what is happening?

417
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,029
My gosh.

418
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,826
My goodness.

419
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,745
What in the world is this mess?

420
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,497
-What a waste.
-Everything is on the ground.

421
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,500
My goodness, will you look at her?

422
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,392
My gosh.

423
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,695
Stop being so upset.

424
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,782
I do not care about the wedding ceremony.

425
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,038
I wanted to give you everything.

426
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,625
I wanted to do everything
we never got to do

427
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,835
and everything we had to give up.

428
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,049
I wanted to give you
a lot of happy memories

429
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,301
so you would not remember what hurt you.

430
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:34,017
I wanted to give you a ring
and promise in front of everyone

431
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,604
that we are going to live together
for the rest of our lives.

432
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,483
-We can do that now.
-What?

433
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:23,650
Nok-du.

434
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,987
I do not think our time together

435
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,740
will always be full
of sunshine and rainbows.

436
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,703
Some days will be windy like today.

437
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,665
And some days will be sad
and full of tears.

438
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,293
But you see,

439
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,463
as long as I am with you,

440
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,101
I am more than willing to endure
all those hardships.

441
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,271
I will endure anything.

442
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:07,986
Okay.

443
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,239
So will I.

444
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,327
I will do so willingly and with joy.

445
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,880
I think flower rings are the prettiest.

446
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,639
You see,

447
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,975
there is something I did not get to do
at the wedding.

448
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,311
What is that?

449
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,217
What are you doing?

450
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,305
I am writing a letter to my mother
saying we got married.

451
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:08,106
MOTHER, DONG-JU AND I ARE MARRIED

452
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,328
9 YEARS LATER

453
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,001
Go!

454
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,005
Get a move on!

455
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,331
You are here.

456
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,839
I thought you were smarter than me.

457
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,175
But I guess not

458
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,011
seeing that you are willing to enter

459
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,556
the gates that lead to misery.

460
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,769
You should not have let me live.

461
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,565
If I did not let you live,

462
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:02,280
I would have become a father
who killed his innocent son twice.

463
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:03,907
Did you know

464
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,077
I was born during the Japanese invasion?

465
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,540
November 19th.

466
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,418
That is

467
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,922
the actual date of my birth.

468
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,468
I was born on the same day as your son.

469
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:28,890
The royal offspring born on November 19th

470
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,643
will become the next king.

471
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:36,564
Had my father not heard that,
I would have died as well.

472
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,401
But as you can see, I am alive.

473
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,362
And just like the prophecy,

474
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,781
I will become the king today.

475
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,703
And you will not

476
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,165
get to die a king.

477
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,892
Will you do me a favor?

478
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,541
I will gladly die

479
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,835
and accept my fate.

480
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,839
If I must live
the rest of my life in fear,

481
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,550
I will do so.

482
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,595
But

483
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,306
let me be the only one

484
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,145
who has to pay for my wrongdoings.

485
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:03,818
Please let the Queen

486
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,781
leave the palace

487
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,326
without anyone knowing about it.

488
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,206
I will grant you that favor.

489
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,339
You will be lonely.

490
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,889
You will be

491
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,310
extremely lonely.

492
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,267
You will be lonely.

493
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,523
You will be extremely lonely.

494
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:41,291
PRINCE NEUNGYANG SUCCEEDED IN REVOLT

495
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,177
Nok-du.

496
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,598
I do not know

497
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,226
how I should be feeling right now.

498
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,898
I feel like crying,
but I am not quite sure.

499
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,029
Come here.

500
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:12,906
Pardon?

501
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,048
You may cry.

502
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,885
And it is fine even if you do not.

503
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,890
I also feel the same way.

504
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,177
Are you nervous?

505
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,515
-A little.
-I am very nervous.

506
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,809
-Why?
-Because

507
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,270
I do not know what she will think of me.

508
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,855
I do not know if she will like me or not.

509
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,359
How could she not like you?

510
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,905
Right? I am too pretty to dislike.

511
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:40,994
You saved my life.

512
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,832
-Stop it.
-I am serious.

513
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,168
You told me that you wish to live
a happy life with me

514
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,462
and promised that you will wait.

515
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,756
What you said that day

516
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,093
made me hold on to my life so many times.

517
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,014
I still feel the same way.

518
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:06,352
And I will keep living happily with you
for the rest of my life.

519
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,609
So if you have a hard time,
you can cry on my shoulder.

520
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,946
And let us enjoy happy moments together
just like we are doing right now.

521
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,951
-Promise.
-My goodness.

522
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,587
The boat is here.

523
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:58,988
Let us go.

524
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,709
WE'D LIKE TO THANK SON BYEONG-HO
FOR MAKING A GUEST APPEARANCE

525
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,023
