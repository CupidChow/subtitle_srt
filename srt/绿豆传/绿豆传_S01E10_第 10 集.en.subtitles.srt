1
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,962
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,839
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,567
Although you are not my family,

4
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,819
you can pretend to be one and visit me.

5
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,030
I cannot do that to you

6
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,450
even though I may be a horrible wench.

7
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,164
The first place
of the military service exam

8
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,957
goes to Yeon Su.

9
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,876
Congratulations.

10
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,719
FIRST PLACE OF THE MILITARY SERVICE EXAM

11
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,939
Do you think I will let you
get away with this?

12
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,903
Are you not going to take the certificate?

13
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,370
This is all because of you.

14
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,207
This is all because you are

15
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,626
the son of His Majesty.

16
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,175
Will you accept your certificate?

17
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,363
Are you okay?

18
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,866
I heard you almost got hurt
at the gambling house.

19
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,535
I am sorry.
I feel responsible for what happened.

20
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,037
No, it is okay.
I went there because I wanted to.

21
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,542
Why do you not just
become a court lady instead?

22
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,460
-You are pretty.
-What?

23
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,922
-A court lady?
-Yes, it will not be hard.

24
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,888
Approach His Majesty, get on the good side
of him when he comes out in disguise.

25
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,181
Then you will easily
get to enter the palace.

26
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,809
He comes out in disguise?

27
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,563
He thinks he comes out in secret,
but everyone in the palace knows

28
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,732
that he goes out for walks at night.

29
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,756
You may go inside.
His Majesty is waiting for you.

30
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,844
Are you not curious?

31
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,474
What do you think I said to His Majesty?

32
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,060
Yeon Su?

33
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,897
Are you here with the vice-curator?

34
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,858
Did you also bring the little girl
and her drunk father?

35
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,444
-You...
-Well then.

36
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,615
Take your time with His Majesty.

37
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,080
Were you that shocked?

38
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,417
Pardon?

39
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,920
You have been staring at me
ever since you came in here.

40
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,798
And you have not said a single word.

41
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,176
I am sorry...

42
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,178
I mean...

43
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,640
I apologize, Your Majesty.
I do not know...

44
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,937
I am not familiar
with the customs of the palace.

45
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,402
You make me smile.

46
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,237
You do not need to try too hard.

47
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,573
We are close enough to ignore
the customs of the palace.

48
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,542
Is that so, Your Majesty?

49
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,600
Of course.

50
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,102
Instead,

51
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,188
do not tell anyone about my evening walks.

52
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,400
Do not tell your woman either.

53
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,569
Will you do that for me?

54
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,281
Yes, Your Majesty.

55
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,996
You will be working with Officer Baek,

56
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,414
the man you met last time.

57
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,958
I want you to help him with his work.

58
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,962
Yes, Your Majesty.

59
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,404
Here.

60
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,034
You are awfully rude to your guest.

61
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,077
"Guest"?

62
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,330
What kind of guest shows up with a sword?

63
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,292
I will be a guest
as long as you do not cause a scene.

64
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,543
What did you just say?

65
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,046
You are the one who barged in
causing a huge scene.

66
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,667
Why are you fighting at the dinner table?

67
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,168
You are ruining my appetite.

68
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:00,962
My goodness.

69
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,136
She is right. That is enough.

70
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,097
You are ruining our reunion.

71
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,642
You brat.

72
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,811
Come here, you brat.

73
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,191
I do not intend to harm you.

74
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,318
-Not yet.
-"Not yet"?

75
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,696
Have you lost your mind?

76
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,707
This is all because of me.

77
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,168
I should not have gone to the palace.

78
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,004
No, it is okay.
He would have put a tail on me anyway.

79
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,966
Follow me.

80
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,772
Unfortunately, you survived.

81
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,357
Yes, thanks to you.

82
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,487
But let me ask you something.
Why are you working at the palace?

83
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,030
To succeed.

84
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,990
I need to make a living.

85
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,534
And as you already know,
I am a great swordsman.

86
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,037
What about you?

87
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,455
What are you trying to pull right now?

88
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,334
You were the first person
to ever stab me with a sword.

89
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,670
I almost lost my mind
and I thought I was going to die.

90
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,089
But after I woke up,

91
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,550
I came to the conclusion

92
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,762
that it would be a waste
to let you die so easily.

93
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,724
Just deal with me.
Do not mess with the others.

94
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,100
-If you do--
-What will you do?

95
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,729
Tell His Majesty
that I am going to commit treason?

96
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,940
Do you think I will not?

97
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,318
I will destroy you
and everyone in your family.

98
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,611
I do not think you can

99
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,865
because your older brother is helping me.

100
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,575
What?

101
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,496
Do not look at me that way.

102
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,207
He came back to me voluntarily.

103
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,876
You have such a weak spot for him,

104
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,171
but unlike you, he is very ambitious.

105
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,924
-Just like me.
-You darn jerk.

106
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,851
What are you doing?

107
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,813
Be careful. You will get hurt.

108
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,732
Are you okay? Did you get injured?

109
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,663
If you do not want things to get worse,
follow me.

110
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,665
What are you saying, you crazy jerk?

111
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,543
-Are you threatening me?
-I do not care how you take it.

112
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,044
But I will not let you stay here.

113
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,422
Go inside and wait there.

114
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,356
I will bring my stuff. Wait here.

115
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,288
Are you angry at Dong-ju?

116
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:26,917
No.

117
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,795
I have just given up.

118
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,464
Pardon?

119
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,508
The only reason I condoned
Dong-ju's reckless plan

120
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,053
was because I knew

121
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,598
that it was the only thing
that kept her alive.

122
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,434
But some guy suddenly showed up

123
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,771
and started to stir her heart.

124
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,899
So I have just decided to give up.

125
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,401
I will no longer try to win her heart.

126
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,029
Then why...

127
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,448
I will make her mine.

128
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,909
I do not care if she does not like me.

129
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,995
I will make her stay by my side forever.

130
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,875
I will accomplish
her long-cherished dream for her.

131
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,753
So I think I deserve that much.

132
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,547
Then why are you keeping him alive?

133
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,217
-He is a dangerous fellow.
-Yes, I know.

134
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:21,138
But after seeing him and his father
not being able to recognize each other,

135
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,809
I suddenly thought of a great plan.

136
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,438
A king who killed his son twice.

137
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,235
It perfectly justifies the restoration.

138
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,614
He will soon be killed

139
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,324
by his own father.

140
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,622
This is the only way.

141
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,707
Are you going to fight him and win?

142
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,919
Then you will always be on the run
for having killed a royal family member.

143
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,879
Are you going to leave Aeng-du
and her father?

144
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,841
-Or are you going to take them with you?
-But still, why would you--

145
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,801
Because that way,
everyone else will be safe.

146
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,511
And now, I no longer have...

147
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,182
I no longer have anything to do with you.

148
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,478
So do not fight him.

149
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,313
I do not want to see you get hurt anymore.

150
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,785
I am just moving.

151
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,663
I will be off now. Do not see me out.

152
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,926
That is enough!

153
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,637
You want him to dethrone his father
and enthrone himself?

154
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,683
I will never let Nok-du do such a thing,

155
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,562
and you have no right
to dethrone the King.

156
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,194
ROYAL COMMAND

157
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,826
My lord.

158
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,090
Everyone is on his side now.

159
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,052
He will make his move soon.

160
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,095
What do you plan to do?

161
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,098
I am

162
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,895
going to become a king
with absolute power and authority.

163
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,358
He destroyed a village of women
just because he needed to.

164
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:41,278
He killed Madam Chun without hesitation
even though she was on his side.

165
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,869
We cannot let Prince Neungyang
become the king.

166
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,393
The government troops
will try to stop you.

167
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,103
Let me go with you.

168
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,896
I want you to stay.

169
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,816
If anything happens to me,

170
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,696
do what I asked you to do.

171
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,075
Yes, my lord.

172
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,911
Please be careful.

173
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,968
You cannot leave. It is the royal command.

174
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,179
Get out of my way.
I need to talk to His Majesty.

175
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,723
Stop.

176
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,766
I will relay your message.

177
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,976
Get out of my way!

178
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,521
I have been serving His Majesty
for far longer than you have.

179
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,400
And I need to meet him
so I can protect him.

180
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,569
So get out of my way.

181
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,076
I will have a palanquin ready.
Please wait.

182
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,298
Let us eat.

183
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,971
You saved me that day

184
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,599
when the widow village got attacked.

185
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,894
Yes, I did. But you left.

186
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,357
How did you get past those bandits?

187
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,068
I am powerful enough to do that.

188
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,988
No, you had enough power
to scheme the attack.

189
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,490
It was inevitable.

190
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,162
Is that who you really are?

191
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,540
Are you the kind of person who
holds people hostage, threatens them,

192
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,834
and kills innocent women?

193
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,880
So what?

194
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,758
Are you disappointed?

195
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,178
Since when did you ever care enough

196
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,806
to show interest
in what kind of person I am?

197
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,559
That is not important.

198
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,894
It was for me.

199
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,397
More than anything else.

200
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,066
Then why are you doing this to me?

201
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,486
Because it does not matter anymore.

202
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,572
I begged you for your love,
but you never gave it to me.

203
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,200
So I found another way.
Therefore, just stay--

204
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,910
I clearly told you.

205
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,955
I may have moved out of that house,

206
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,958
but I do not intend to stay here
like a puppet.

207
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,253
If you want me to stay here,

208
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,922
you will have to kill me.

209
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,925
That will be the quickest way.

210
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,917
I must meet Her Majesty first.

211
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,510
I heard you were locked up.

212
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,138
What in the world happened?

213
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,184
And what is it that you need to tell me?

214
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,896
I see you still have that with you.

215
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,323
20 YEARS AGO

216
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,037
Please bury this alongside my son.

217
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,927
Yes.

218
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,596
I asked you for that favor

219
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,642
so I could keep this with me at all times.

220
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,772
This is how I console myself
for having lost my baby

221
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,235
the moment I gave birth.

222
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,865
Come to think of it,

223
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,410
I never once asked.

224
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,455
Did you bury him safely?

225
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,666
Your Highness.

226
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,127
It is long overdue...

227
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,474
What are you doing here?

228
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,569
He thinks he comes out in secret,
but everyone in the palace knows

229
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,612
that he goes out for walks at night.

230
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,281
He secretly comes out for walks?

231
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,744
I might be able to kill him
without even entering the palace.

232
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,959
Or I might get killed instead.

233
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,673
Boss, are you okay?

234
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,217
Do I look okay to you?

235
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,763
I swear I will catch them

236
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,891
and teach them a lesson.

237
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,268
-Darn it.
-Slowly.

238
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,478
Slowly. Be gentle.

239
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,980
Darn it.

240
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,567
Go slowly. Be gentle.

241
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,236
My goodness, it hurts.

242
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,065
Are you here to see me?

243
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,608
No.

244
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,818
I was just passing by.

245
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,326
Good luck with your new job.

246
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,705
How are you? Are you okay?

247
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,165
Of course I am okay.

248
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,209
I am doing fine. The house is huge.

249
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,002
Look. I am even allowed to come outside.

250
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,924
So do not worry
and just focus on yourself.

251
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,097
What is it?

252
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,933
Do I look extremely handsome in this?

253
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,102
I know.

254
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,271
You have no shame.

255
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,231
You do not look handsome.

256
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,233
But you do look like a newbie.

257
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,195
You should go.

258
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,867
I told you to stay in your house.

259
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,203
I apologize, Your Majesty.

260
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:32,249
But I came to urgently tell you something.

261
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,753
I heard you wish to protect me.

262
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,797
Yes, Your Majesty.

263
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,465
Tell me.

264
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,593
What is it that you need
to protect me from?

265
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,181
I know a man
who is planning to commit treason.

266
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,228
Who is that?

267
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,107
It is Prince Neungyang.

268
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,193
Prince Neungyang is
doing all sorts of wicked things

269
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,571
in order to take the throne.

270
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,697
What?

271
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,074
"Prince Neungyang"?

272
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,201
You must arrest and punish him.

273
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,245
And as soon as you do that,

274
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:14,249
you should also kill me
for being a disloyal subject.

275
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,514
You sounded so desperate

276
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,560
that I almost believed you.

277
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,628
Repeat what you just said.

278
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,507
What did you just say?

279
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,551
Your son who was born

280
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,762
twenty years ago

281
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,724
is still alive.

282
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,520
What? He is still alive?

283
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,776
How did you find out?

284
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,657
I met this man by coincidence

285
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,952
and heard the things

286
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,955
I never should have found out.

287
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,550
He is

288
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,886
Jung Yun-jeo's son

289
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,764
and a living witness.

290
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,937
My so-called brother
turned out to be your son, Your Majesty.

291
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,066
My father raised him.

292
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,113
How do you expect me to believe that?

293
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,448
Please show us mercy, Your Majesty!

294
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,411
What?

295
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,497
There is one more person
who knows about this.

296
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,375
Who is that?

297
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,670
Chancellor

298
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,214
Heo Yun, Your Majesty.

299
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,927
He has been threatening me.

300
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,180
He told me he will frame me
for plotting treason

301
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,516
if I did not agree to stay quiet.

302
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,145
However, I could not stay quiet.

303
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,565
I could not lie to you, Your Majesty!

304
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,084
Your Majesty.

305
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,296
You cannot let him fool you.

306
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,386
Then who am I supposed to trust?

307
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,472
You?

308
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,475
You were my loyal subject and friend.

309
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,852
But you have been lying to me!

310
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,147
Do you know how much I hoped to be wrong?

311
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,191
Even as I doubted you,

312
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,193
I still hoped I was mistaken!

313
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:33,114
Do you have any idea
how much I wished to be wrong?

314
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,369
Kill me, Your Majesty!

315
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:44,334
However,
you cannot trust Prince Neungyang!

316
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,087
I do not want to hear it!

317
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,051
Quietly

318
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,388
take him to the dungeon.

319
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,640
Your Majesty!

320
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,434
You can punish me all you want!

321
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,105
But do not trust Prince Neungyang!

322
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,731
Your Majesty!

323
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,733
Your Majesty!

324
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,736
Do not trust him!

325
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,655
Your Majesty!

326
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,740
Your Majesty!

327
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,618
You cannot trust him!

328
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,496
Your Majesty!

329
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,290
Your Majesty!

330
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,339
I am Yeon Su,
the new chief administrative officer.

331
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,844
-I heard you came to the palace, so--
-Yes, I heard about you.

332
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,681
His Majesty has urgently ordered us
to arrest a criminal.

333
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,350
-So follow me.
-Okay.

334
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,271
We already have a witness.

335
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,398
It will be useless to meet Heo Yun.

336
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,233
The government troops are
guarding his house.

337
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,027
You will not be able to see him.

338
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,446
I should still give it a try.

339
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,364
I need to hear both sides.

340
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,326
-Then let us go with you.
-Yes.

341
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,953
I prefer moving alone. I will not be late.

342
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,915
That brat.

343
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,716
No one can ever know about this man.

344
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,927
So we must arrest him
without causing a scene.

345
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,277
You must escape.

346
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,529
-What is going on?
-Arrest him right now!

347
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,366
-It is the royal command!
-Run out the back door.

348
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,909
I will be right behind you.

349
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,710
Run.

350
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,592
Where is my father?

351
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,098
Lord Heo asked me to give this to you.

352
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,142
He said you will need it
to prove yourself.

353
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,295
They went that way.

354
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,176
Are you okay?

355
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,721
The person who saved Jung Yun-jeo
was a woman.

356
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,399
I told you I can go alone.

357
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,276
I cannot let you do that. You got hurt.

358
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,407
Wait here. I will be right out
after I talk to His Majesty.

359
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,368
Okay.

360
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,831
I will wait here.

361
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,933
You lost him?

362
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,185
How could you fail to catch him?

363
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,772
I apologize, Your Majesty.
I will find him no matter what.

364
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,818
Did you find anything else?

365
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,531
I found this in Chancellor Heo's room.

366
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,616
It is a note that almost got burned.

367
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,434
You must find Jung Yun-jeo.

368
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,937
If you must, you can kill him.

369
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,941
Just bring me his body.

370
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,069
Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,032
Open the gates!

372
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,270
When did you first think of betraying me?

373
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,731
Your Majesty.

374
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,901
Was it 20 years ago

375
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,321
when you told me
that you killed Yun-jeo and my son?

376
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,365
Or...

377
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:38,039
Was it when you decided
to hide the late King's letter?

378
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,252
I told you to bring me the letter
if you ever happened to find it.

379
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,465
However, you told me
that you burned it on the spot.

380
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,010
Is this what you wanted?

381
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,346
You were going to get rid of me

382
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,015
and have the direct heir
take over the throne?

383
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,769
-Your Majesty.
-Just like everyone else,

384
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:03,314
you also thought I do not deserve
to be a king.

385
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:09,112
That is why you tried to betray me
and replace me with a new king.

386
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,001
I deserve to die, Your Majesty.

387
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,962
Your Majesty.

388
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,673
You can punish me all you want.

389
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,969
But you should
never trust Prince Neungyang.

390
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,972
-He is...
-Prince Neungyang?

391
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,516
You are still going on about him?

392
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,601
Fine. Go ahead and tell me!

393
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,855
What is he scheming behind my back?

394
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,655
I figured the government troops
might come for your family,

395
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,532
so they are with me right now.

396
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,909
I promise they will be safe

397
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,245
as long as you keep your mouth shut.

398
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,084
If you stay quiet
and bear everything alone,

399
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,795
your family will be able to live
the rest of their lives

400
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,757
more comfortably.

401
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,808
It was all Prince Neungyang's doing?

402
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,602
Yes.

403
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,645
The reason he got arrested at the palace

404
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,482
is because of the story
between this man and His Majesty.

405
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,109
Then was Prince Neungyang also the one

406
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,820
who killed Deul-re?

407
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,907
Prince Neungyang told me otherwise.

408
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,284
He told me Chancellor Heo was
behind all this.

409
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,622
Who are we supposed to trust?

410
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,208
Think about how Prince Neungyang
managed to get involved

411
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,584
in the first place.

412
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,588
He is a cruel and meticulous person.

413
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,645
There is only one place
where he could go to spend

414
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,979
a fun and secret night.

415
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,981
The best kisaeng house in Hanyang

416
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,942
that is right under Mokmyeoksan Mountain.

417
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,952
-My goodness.
-Thank you.

418
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,204
-Let me pour you a drink.
-Sure.

419
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,956
Then you can be the second minister.

420
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,500
Your Majesty.

421
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,670
Will you take me to the palace
and make me become the queen?

422
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,796
Watch it.

423
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,632
You need to lower your voice.

424
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,597
Here is a drink for the prime minister.

425
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,600
And the chief royal secretary!
Have a drink as well!

426
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,499
You said you do not like me.

427
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,002
And I am fine with that.

428
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,336
But you see,

429
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,589
I will make you like me.

430
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,394
Stop!

431
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,531
My goodness.

432
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,534
-Your Majesty.
-My queen!

433
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:29,830
If you do not answer me,
I will just move onto the next king.

434
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,165
Good idea.

435
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,377
I am more suited to be a king
than that punk.

436
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,338
-Yes, that is right.
-That jerk failed to pass his first exam.

437
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,058
Nok-du.

438
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,768
Nok-du!

439
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,645
You must find Jung Yun-jeo.

440
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,397
If you must,

441
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,774
you can go ahead and kill him.

442
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,527
Just bring me his body.

443
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,962
Are you looking for this?

444
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,317
Show your respect to Her Majesty.

445
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,074
I apologize, Your Highness.

446
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,954
I am a chief administrative officer
at the police bureau.

447
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,416
However, I lost my hat
somewhere in the palace.

448
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,460
But you look like

449
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,880
you have lost your way.

450
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,424
Pardon?

451
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,846
I am not

452
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,557
familiar with the palace yet.

453
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,480
You can take this.

454
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,899
I know my way around the palace.

455
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,405
I am honored, Your Highness.

456
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,976
Lord Heo asked me to give this to you.

457
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,854
He said you will need it
to prove yourself.

458
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,285
What are you in a daze?

459
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,790
I waited for you.

460
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,543
And you came.

461
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,423
What is with that face?

462
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,676
Is someone giving you a hard time at work?

463
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,763
-It is me.
-What?

464
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,391
I am the one who is
giving everyone a hard time.

465
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,439
I should have lived a quiet life.

466
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,942
That would have been right.

467
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,695
I should not have done this.

468
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,530
-Hey.
-I do not know what is right.

469
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,283
I just want someone to tell me the answer.

470
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,286
I do not know who or what to ask

471
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,333
in order to prevent people
from getting hurt.

472
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:46,921
I feel

473
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,006
so lost.

474
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,727
I should not have said that.

475
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:06,190
Just forget everything I said.

476
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,486
I did not understand a word anyway.

477
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,156
Stop acting so sad.

478
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,158
Just go home and get some sleep.

479
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:17,785
Go on.

480
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,497
-Let me take you home first.
-No one wants you there.

481
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,165
-Just go.
-No.

482
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,793
You always come and go whenever you wish.

483
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,795
So let me do that for a change.

484
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,968
Hey.

485
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,931
You really should go.

486
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,350
No.

487
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,938
Do you not hate me?

488
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,107
I am always mean to you.

489
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,778
I adore you.

490
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,157
Why are you so complicated?

491
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,413
What are you so scared of?

492
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,040
Why are you so fearless?

493
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,210
We can never predict the future.

494
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,546
That is exactly why

495
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,298
I want to be honest about my feelings.

496
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,176
And I am walking you home
because I want to.

497
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,270
And I am going to hold your hand.

498
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,358
Just until the end of this path.

499
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,613
Then I should walk slowly.

500
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,428
The government troops caused a scene
at Chancellor Heo's house?

501
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,306
That means Jung Yun-jeo was there.

502
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,892
We must catch Jung Yun-jeo first.

503
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,560
I will head to Aseowon.

504
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,147
I want you to follow Nok-du.
He will visit his father.

505
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,279
Here is a sketch of Jung Yun-jeo.

506
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,073
You must be discreet.

507
00:44:58,946 --> 00:44:59,988
You are...

508
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,575
You still dress in women's clothes?

509
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,286
I have my reasons.

510
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:10,290
Anyway, were you
at Chancellor Heo's house?

511
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,085
How do you know that?

512
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,045
What happened to the man you saved?

513
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,548
How is his injury?

514
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,009
-He left that day--
-Where did he go?

515
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,349
He left because he could not trust me,
so he did not say anything.

516
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,062
But why do you care so much about him?

517
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,149
He is my father.

518
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,402
I see.

519
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,947
He was a bit injured,
but he was okay when he left.

520
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,284
He left with Chancellor Heo's
right-hand man, so do not worry.

521
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,414
But what are you doing here?

522
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,835
Are you going to take revenge
on Prince Neungyang?

523
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,504
"Revenge"?

524
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,802
He is not here yet?

525
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,433
Then can you give this to him for me?

526
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,311
This is the only thing I know
that he likes.

527
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,439
You should wait
and give it to him yourself.

528
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,692
I need to go somewhere.

529
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:04,404
Really? Then you can give it to him
once you come back.

530
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,127
Please give this to him for me.

531
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,171
Okay.

532
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,510
-Goodbye then.
-Bye.

533
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,873
My lord.

534
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,466
We are here for you, not me.

535
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,721
Why do you look like
you have not eaten for three days?

536
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,765
Did you lose the thief
you were chasing after?

537
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,145
I always lose them.

538
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,565
By the way,

539
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,401
were you on your way to the kisaeng house?

540
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,570
Yes.

541
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,031
I have business there.

542
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,617
It does not seem like
you wish to be a kisaeng.

543
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:32,909
No.

544
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,204
I am trying to find a servant job
in the palace.

545
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:38,874
You

546
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,460
also wish to enter the palace?

547
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,755
I heard it is a stable job.

548
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,049
I see.

549
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,057
By the way, do you still
have trouble sleeping?

550
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,435
You did not do as I told you, did you?

551
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,147
No, I could not.

552
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,358
I have left my wife

553
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,570
all alone for way too long.

554
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:13,241
I cannot ask her to comfort me
all of a sudden

555
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,120
just because I feel lonely.

556
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,289
Yes, you can.

557
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,542
If she was lonely for that long,

558
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,212
she might also be waiting for you

559
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,633
to approach her first.

560
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,560
INN

561
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:55,367
Boss, I swear I will find them tomorrow.

562
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,703
-If we stay here...
-Yes.

563
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,123
You!

564
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,961
They say the foot of the candle is dark.

565
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,381
We searched the entire village,
but you were nowhere to be seen.

566
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,341
But it turns out you were so close by.

567
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:12,926
It is nice to see you.

568
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,220
You have the wrong person.

569
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,639
Are you sure?

570
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,516
Let me see.

571
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,893
-Oh, gosh.
-Boss.

572
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,562
Catch her!

573
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,188
-Let us go.
-That little wench...

574
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,028
DO NOT ENTER

575
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,947
PLAGUE OUTBREAK

576
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,378
Why did you run so much?

577
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,006
My butt still hurts from all the flogging.

578
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:52,966
Let us see.

579
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:57,053
You stole money and made me get flogged.

580
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,018
It is okay. Come here.

581
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,897
Come over here. It is dangerous there.

582
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,405
What... What in the world...

583
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,533
PLAGUE OUTBREAK DO NOT ENTER

584
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,659
Oh, my gosh.

585
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,245
Boss!

586
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,290
My goodness, what are you doing here?

587
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:28,126
Everyone in this village died
due to a plague.

588
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,629
-"A plague"?
-Yes.

589
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,218
She is dead. She has to be dead.

590
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,386
I bet she is dead. Let us go.

591
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,862
-Master.
-Hey, you are home.

592
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,407
By the way, is Dong-ju okay?

593
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,537
-Why?
-Because she came by earlier

594
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,705
and asked me to give you this.

595
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,835
And she seemed like a lost puppy.

596
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,855
Help.

597
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,817
Is anyone there?

598
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,443
Help!

599
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,698
Please help! There is someone inside!

600
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:41,199
Help!

601
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,627
Help!

602
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,265
Please help!

603
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,313
Help!

604
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,206
My goodness, it is raining so much.

605
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,170
Hey.

606
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:39,049
So he is not hiding her somewhere?

607
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,467
He is looking for her, too.

608
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,011
Then do you think she left

609
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,181
just like last time?

610
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,271
No.

611
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,231
She could not have.

612
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,275
Then where could she be?

613
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,819
You searched Hanyang for two days.

614
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,698
-I will be off now.
-Hey, wait. Take this.

615
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:05,784
Take this.

616
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,535
Here.

617
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,414
My goodness.

618
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,797
Help.

619
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,841
There is someone inside!

620
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,978
Please...

621
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,019
My goodness.

622
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,071
Boss!

623
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,159
I finally found you, you darn punk.

624
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,745
-Move.
-No.

625
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,497
I will kill you.

626
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,542
You will get to meet that wench
once you die.

627
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,335
-You can look forward to it.
-What?

628
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,131
Did you not know?

629
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,175
She is dead.

630
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,886
I killed her.

631
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:28,051
And I am going to hold your hand.

632
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,309
Just until the end of this path.

633
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,319
Then I should walk slowly.

634
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:19,894
Dong-ju!

635
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,862
No, Dong-ju!

636
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,995
Dong-ju, no!

637
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,833
Dong-ju, wake up! No!

638
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,010
Dong-ju.

639
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,888
Dong-ju, wake up! Dong-ju!

640
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:21,122
I feel ashamed to say this,
but I came here

641
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,333
because I could not sleep.

642
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,210
Pardon?

643
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,504
It is not your fault.

644
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,173
It is all...

645
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,678
It is all my fault.

646
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:38,640
Your Majesty.

647
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,559
If it is okay with you,

648
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,479
will you

649
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,065
let me sleep

650
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,526
by your side tonight

651
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,195
just like the old days?

652
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,719
Are you okay? Do you feel better?

653
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,607
What are you doing?
You need to get more rest.

654
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,861
Go. Go away.

655
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,826
Hey.

656
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,287
How could you...

657
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,664
How could you say that to me?

658
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,208
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

659
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,460
Who told you to worry?

660
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,839
Why did you come looking for me?

661
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,466
Why did you jump into the well?

662
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:08,855
What is the matter with you?

663
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,864
-Dong-ju.
-I had to do something.

664
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,950
It was my goal for my entire life.

665
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,744
I figured

666
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,205
I would be able to meet my mom
and finally be happy

667
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,249
when everything is over.

668
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,461
It was what kept me going.

669
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:36,299
But I almost died before
I can carry out the plan.

670
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,676
But...

671
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,637
But why you?

672
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,725
Why did I suddenly think of you?

673
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,394
I could not stop thinking of you!

674
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,857
You keep making me want to live.

675
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,443
You keep making me want to...

676
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:02,992
I do not know

677
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:07,330
what it is that you need to do

678
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,083
and what you are so scared of

679
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,753
that forces you to push me away like this.

680
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,589
But whatever that may be,

681
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,258
and whatever happens to us,

682
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,470
what matters is
that we are together right now.

683
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,559
So why can you not

684
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,604
just follow your heart?

685
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,401
You see,

686
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,444
I just...

687
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,033
I just like everything about you.

688
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:47,537
I like you.

689
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,248
I like you, too.

690
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,960
I am also crazy about you!

691
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,323
