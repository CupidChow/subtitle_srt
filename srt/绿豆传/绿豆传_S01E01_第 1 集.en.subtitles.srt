1
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,253
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,255
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,984
Honey!

4
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,280
She is doing it again.

5
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,181
Is someone coming for an exile?

6
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,602
Aengdu, stop eating

7
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,270
and listen to me.

8
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,772
What is it?

9
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:47,982
I have

10
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,736
to do something outside of this island.

11
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:53,947
So?

12
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,616
What I am saying is, I cannot marry you.

13
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,746
So, you go and tell Master
that we cannot get married.

14
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,332
Hey!

15
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,542
No.

16
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,211
You promised with my dad
that we will get married.

17
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,047
That is only because I wanted him
to teach me martial arts.

18
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,843
How is a little kid like you so strong?

19
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,931
Goodness!

20
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,559
Master!

21
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,062
There you are, my son-in-law.

22
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,858
Have some of this.

23
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,111
What are you two doing out here?

24
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,115
Dad, Nok-du said
that he will not marry me.

25
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,950
-Hey!
-What?

26
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,035
That is not what I meant.

27
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,831
I just meant to say
that Aengdu is too young right now.

28
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,795
That will not be an issue.

29
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,714
You are also the youngest one
among the lads,

30
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,882
which is perfect.

31
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,925
You two are perfect for each other!

32
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,304
Right, perfect for each other.

33
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,056
-Darn...
-Nok-du!

34
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,641
Nok-du!

35
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,518
My goodness.

36
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,688
Your house is in trouble!

37
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,138
Father!

38
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,094
Who are you?

39
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,471
Father! Hwang-tae!

40
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,014
Are you okay?

41
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,904
Who are you?

42
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,197
Why are you here?

43
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,994
Go! Leave!

44
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,161
No!

45
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,663
No!

46
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,916
Father, they came to harm us.

47
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,128
No need to fight. We just need to flee.

48
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,673
-Do not try to find out more.
-What do you mean?

49
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,175
I cannot just let them go.

50
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:03,970
Nok-du!

51
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,640
It will be over if we leave.
Just forget about all of this.

52
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,935
Father, I know everything.

53
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,229
This is all because...

54
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,066
It is all because of me.
I committed a crime.

55
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,484
So...

56
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,160
No.

57
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,746
It is all because of me.

58
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,876
Why we have been hiding on this island,
why we are trying to run away now,

59
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,546
and why Mother passed away,

60
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,215
all of that is

61
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,926
because of me.

62
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,729
It is all right.

63
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,397
Are you okay, Hwang-tae?

64
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,984
Thankfully, he is not severely injured.

65
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,819
But

66
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,948
I can tell they are trained assassins
by the way they used their swords.

67
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,160
Where could have they come from?

68
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,165
Master, please take care
of Father and Hwang-tae.

69
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,792
Nok-du!

70
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,253
What are you talking about?

71
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,924
My goodness.

72
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,304
You saw how that assassin tried
to commit suicide, right?

73
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,556
It is not going to end
just by defeating a few.

74
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,599
So,

75
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,352
follow after them to find their boss.

76
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:38,523
I will take your father and Hwang-tae
to my hometown.

77
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,941
Yes, Master.

78
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,250
A woman?

79
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,771
Get out of the way!

80
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,108
Get out of the way!

81
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,198
Make way for His Majesty!

82
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,827
Make way for His Majesty!

83
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,880
He is coming.

84
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,413
Your Majesty!

85
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,683
What was that?

86
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,355
Darn it.

87
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,119
It is too late.

88
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,288
Die!

89
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,716
Your Majesty, hear me.

90
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,968
The rock that I just threw was

91
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,305
the very rock you used
to crush my son to death.

92
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,435
It is the very rock you used to crush
my grandson to death.

93
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,395
Get him!

94
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,148
You destroyed the homes
of hundreds of your people,

95
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,901
and crushed innocent people

96
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,611
to build your palace.

97
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,112
Your Majesty, my foot.

98
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,032
You are the King? Nonsense.

99
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,456
He must have accomplices. Find them.

100
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,083
Yes, Your Majesty.

101
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,133
Search the whole area thoroughly.

102
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,093
-Yes!
-Yes!

103
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,844
Arrest everyone here.

104
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,782
I have found an arrow!

105
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,096
What are you doing? Let me go!

106
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,472
Let go of me!

107
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,437
You better follow us.

108
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,064
Someone is hiding in there!

109
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,566
Go and check for yourself.

110
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,717
No!

111
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,403
Come with us!

112
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,239
Take him!

113
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,453
-Come with us.
-Let me go.

114
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,704
Let us go.

115
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,435
I almost had him.

116
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,023
Hey! I lost him because of you!

117
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,816
Who are you?

118
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,695
-Are you not--
-Only if you had not interrupted!

119
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,864
Then what?

120
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,784
Darn it!

121
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,203
What are your eyes for?
Why did you bump into me?

122
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,664
If your eyes worked fine,
why did you not duck?

123
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,291
My plans got messed up because of you.

124
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,710
What a peasant.
Talking to you is a waste of my time.

125
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,671
Peasant?

126
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,215
How old are you?

127
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,342
I was born in the year of the snake.
When were you born?

128
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,010
The year of the snake?

129
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,346
By the year of the snake,
I had already mastered the Cheonjamun

130
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,181
and memorized
all of Four Books and Five Classics!

131
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,350
-How dare you--
-Be quiet!

132
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,645
Goodness.

133
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,949
Look at you. It is a pity
that I am the only one watching.

134
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,119
Do you work with the old man
who threw the rock?

135
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,913
-What?
-If you are innocent,

136
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,498
you will be released next morning anyway.

137
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,874
Why are you trying to escape?

138
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,834
If you get caught, you will be executed.

139
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,253
Is he naive or dumb?

140
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,506
Did you just swear at me?

141
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,552
No, I did not.

142
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,429
Help me.

143
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,014
Come on!

144
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,685
What did you say? I could not hear you.

145
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,153
My lord.

146
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,697
Help me, my lord.

147
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,201
Say "please."

148
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,245
Please.

149
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,934
What?

150
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,395
Are you crying?

151
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,105
You think this is funny?

152
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,527
It is not too bad.

153
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,612
I made it to Hanyang, after all.

154
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,660
I knew you were a hillbilly.

155
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,912
What are you here in Hanyang for?
To see the King?

156
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,499
No.

157
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,796
I am here to find out about who I am.

158
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,010
What a joke.

159
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,347
I cannot believe this coward
tried to escape.

160
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,180
My goodness!

161
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,681
What was that?

162
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,184
-My gosh.
-What is the matter with you?

163
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,858
Everyone in the cell, follow me.

164
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,243
We should follow all the laws
and procedures.

165
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,786
Are you sure this is okay?

166
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,081
This is nonsense. We do not even know

167
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,499
where that arrow came from.

168
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,059
Kill them!

169
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,321
ROYAL INVESTIGATION BUREAU

170
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,123
Continue the questioning.

171
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,709
Who are you and where are you from?

172
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,425
This is for the records. You must tell us.

173
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,180
I am Kim Won-sik from Jidamgol.

174
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,432
What were you doing there?

175
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,811
I was just passing by.

176
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,397
You came all the way from Jidamgol
to Hanyang.

177
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,731
And you were just passing by?

178
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,609
Tell us exactly what you were up to.

179
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,487
If you do not speak the truth,

180
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,197
you will not be able
to walk out of here alive.

181
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,242
My child, stay alive.

182
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,952
You must...

183
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,872
You must live...

184
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,210
Why are you not saying anything?

185
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,469
How dare you!

186
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,346
Answer the question!

187
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,081
Let me meet the King.

188
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,220
I just find this so frustrating.
Just let me meet the King.

189
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,472
How despicable!

190
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,059
Are you asking for death?

191
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,312
I do not want to die.

192
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,688
If I am going to die,

193
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,315
let me say what I want to first.

194
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,567
What a lunatic.

195
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,319
Kill him!

196
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,909
Let us hear him out.

197
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,994
What is so frustrating?

198
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,747
Had he had planned to kill,

199
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,124
would he have exposed himself
and thrown a small rock?

200
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,918
And that arrow.

201
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,962
You do not know where it came from.

202
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,718
I bet words are spreading
all across the country

203
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,512
that hundreds of commoners were arrested

204
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,180
because of some old man who lost his son

205
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,057
and his grandson
because of the palace construction.

206
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,435
Why can you not make better use of us?

207
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,437
What? Use?

208
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,898
Yes. If I were you,

209
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,733
I would cut this nonsense

210
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,820
and cover the graves of the old man's son
and grandson with fresh grass.

211
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,615
I would rather show off how gracious I am.

212
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,160
Is that what you wanted to tell
His Majesty?

213
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,454
Yes.

214
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,124
I was going to suggest
that he should act gracious at least.

215
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,042
Who knows?

216
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,293
The people may be touched

217
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,087
and work even harder to build the palace.

218
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,133
What a lowly peasant.

219
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,094
I will order them to kill him.

220
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,220
No.

221
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,430
He has a point.

222
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,684
He is lowly, but that is not a bad idea.

223
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,729
He is suggesting a way
for this incapable King

224
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,607
to earn some respect from his people.

225
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,195
-Does that mean--
-Yes, let us pretend that I am gracious.

226
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,991
But do not let the old man go alive.

227
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,493
Yes, Your Majesty.

228
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,059
-Goodness!
-I know you are grateful.

229
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,936
Then let me ask you a favor.

230
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,689
What is it?

231
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,067
Do you like gukbap?

232
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,362
-Do you have some money on you?
-Seriously?

233
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,323
Come on.

234
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,911
No!

235
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,635
What use are you
if you are such a weak man?

236
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,178
What did you just say?

237
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,972
I could have been very useful,
had it not been for you!

238
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,225
You are begging for gukbap.
Look who is talking.

239
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,311
Begging? I am merely asking you
to return a favor.

240
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,855
You would be dead and smelling incense
by now,

241
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,482
had it not been for me.

242
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,703
My will!

243
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,288
Oh my goodness. What do I do?

244
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,293
I do not want to see you ever again.

245
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,213
If I do, I might just beat you right up.

246
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,301
He is a chicken, a weakling,
but at least he has a loud voice.

247
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,516
Where am I going to find this?

248
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,313
Wait, I would not be the only one
looking for this mark.

249
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,194
What is wrong with you?

250
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,071
You should not eat
if you do not have money.

251
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,198
Why do you come here every day?

252
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,325
Please, some leftover will be--

253
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,911
I would not give you anything
even if I had rotten food.

254
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,038
Get lost!

255
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,254
Give me a big room for the night.

256
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,047
Do you have money?

257
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,716
Of course, I do.

258
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,302
I am going to have dinner as well,
so I will pay all at once.

259
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,512
Come in.

260
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,815
INN

261
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,111
Come already.

262
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,699
I want to get this over with so that
I can go see Hwang-tae and Father.

263
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,629
Head inside!

264
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,431
Hwang-tae!

265
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,894
Did I not tell you to make sure
that Nok-du does not get on a boat?

266
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,020
Father,

267
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,189
I am sorry.

268
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,857
Why not?

269
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,318
Why can I not learn to read
or to ride a boat?

270
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,279
I want to read books and ride the boat,

271
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,031
but why am I not allowed to do that?

272
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,282
How dare you?

273
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,826
Do you need me to keep beating you?

274
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,660
Are you in there?

275
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,622
INN

276
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,799
A customer ordered it and left.

277
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,385
Do you want it? You did not have dinner.

278
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,805
I was just going to sleep.

279
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,391
Eat it. I will give it to you for free.

280
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,812
For free?

281
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,983
Thank you. I will enjoy the food.

282
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,620
It is midnight now!

283
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,663
Where are you going?

284
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,874
What is wrong? What is he doing?

285
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,002
-Are you okay?
-Please help me.

286
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,464
Hey!

287
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,508
Hey.

288
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,095
He is dead.

289
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,015
Go and get the boss.

290
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,559
-I will look around here.
-Okay.

291
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,869
You are paying me five nyang, right?

292
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,257
This way, sir.

293
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,802
Here!

294
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,179
What?

295
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,057
Chil-bong!

296
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,032
All right, let us go see who your boss is.

297
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,930
That is the hideout.

298
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,682
You are all dead.

299
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,661
-My goodness!
-Oh, no.

300
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,454
What is a man doing here?

301
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,374
How could a man come in?

302
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,876
This is weird.

303
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,836
Why are there only women here?

304
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,130
-How can a man be here?
-What is he doing?

305
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,675
Look at him.

306
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,051
How did he get in here?

307
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,850
What are you doing?

308
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,148
Do you have a death wish?

309
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,067
I think there is a misunderstanding.

310
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,318
Misunderstanding, my ass.

311
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,697
You came because you wanted to
have your way with the widows, right?

312
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,513
WIDOW VILLAGE, MEN FORBIDDEN

313
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,067
Goodness.

314
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,490
So men are forbidden,

315
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,242
but the widows are assassins?

316
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,077
Should I just destroy them all?

317
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,416
No, I would get destroyed
even before getting to the boss.

318
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,752
Is this surely the right way?

319
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:10,048
Yes, this is the only way
into the widow village.

320
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,340
How dare she?

321
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,926
She ran away right before we built
the monument to her and her chastity?

322
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,387
You are still looking for Sung, right?

323
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,431
Yes, we are searching the entire mountain.

324
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,558
He is likely to get caught soon.

325
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,519
Do not worry. Even if we miss him,
he will surely come here.

326
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,699
Over there!

327
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,755
I am here to help. Please excuse me.

328
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,932
Are you okay?

329
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,521
No!

330
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,314
I am okay.

331
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,409
Who are you?

332
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,706
Ddolbok, are you okay?

333
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,667
-Ma'am!
-What?

334
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,795
Are you okay, ma'am?

335
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,887
I am sorry,

336
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,849
you helped me out,
yet I have caused you harm.

337
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,310
I am sorry.

338
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,272
I thought you were out to harm her.

339
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,356
It is fine.

340
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,900
You should not go to the widow village.

341
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,902
Your father-in-law is already there.

342
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,158
Were you

343
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,743
really planning on going there?

344
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,081
Even if that means
that you cannot see me for good?

345
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,335
I would rather not see you for good
than put you in danger--

346
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,797
Why do you not understand me?

347
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,718
No, you cannot go there.

348
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:24,098
I think there is a way.

349
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,028
How come she is still not here?

350
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,363
I wonder if she went elsewhere.

351
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,907
My lord, over there!

352
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,042
You wench!

353
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,422
You should be honored that you can
sacrifice your life for the family,

354
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,798
but how dare you run away instead?

355
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,385
Do you not dream of dying in peace.

356
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,139
Oh, my!

357
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,768
How dare you?

358
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,565
What is this?

359
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,108
Did you

360
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,110
really just hit your father-in-law?

361
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,714
Who are you?

362
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,133
This is not my daughter-in-law.

363
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,513
Please forgive me.

364
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,615
She is beautiful.

365
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,536
She is, indeed.

366
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,330
Especially from the back.

367
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,683
I do not think this is a good idea.

368
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,394
-We should come up with another--
-No.

369
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,438
You look absolutely stunning.

370
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,733
We just need to work on your gait
and your voice.

371
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,027
Right, the way you walk is...

372
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,865
This is a small token of appreciation.

373
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,117
What is this?

374
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,044
I am not doing this
for anything in return.

375
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,921
Did I step over the line again?

376
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:01,964
-Then I will--
-No!

377
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,383
It would be rude of me

378
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,594
to reject a lady's kindness like that.

379
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:08,971
That is true.

380
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,106
All right. Let us go now.

381
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,838
This is nice.

382
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,758
Can I have this one?

383
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,302
Thank you.

384
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,720
Who are you?

385
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,058
I am

386
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,685
a member of the Kim family in Hanyang.

387
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,480
I heard that this is a village for widows
that are being chased.

388
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,856
Is that right?

389
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,817
Come right in.

390
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,862
This way.

391
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,659
This village was established
during the Japanese invasion.

392
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,995
Women who lost their husbands in war

393
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,249
came together and built the village.

394
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,377
Families kept forcing us

395
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,671
to kill ourselves
for the honor of the family.

396
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,756
They spewed all that nonsense,

397
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,216
but for whose benefit?

398
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,468
So we stayed strong for a long time,

399
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,513
and this place became a legitimate village
that the King approved of.

400
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,141
-Is that not right?
-Yes.

401
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,393
-How are you doing?
-It is so nice today.

402
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,811
Do not worry.

403
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,522
That entrance that you entered from,

404
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,566
and the path to the kisaeng house

405
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,359
are the only ways you can get
into the village.

406
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:53,159
These ordinary-looking women are
on one team?

407
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:01,041
You have a very strong build.

408
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,544
A perfect head wife material.

409
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,298
Everyone in my mother's family is tall.

410
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,091
I take after her.

411
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,885
I see.

412
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,638
Are you there?

413
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,515
Yes!

414
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,518
She is a new widow joining us from today.

415
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,645
She fled all the way here from Hanyang.

416
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,610
Hello.

417
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,615
Do not be scared.

418
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:36,535
There are occasionally brainless men
that sneak in.

419
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:40,498
But us the Virtuous Women Corps
do not miss a single man

420
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,041
and send them to hell.

421
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,375
-Always.
-Always.

422
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,754
-I see.
-Leave the men to us.

423
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,341
Madam Chun!

424
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,639
She is a new widow to the village.

425
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,474
She is the head of the kisaeng house.

426
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,850
I see.

427
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:04,563
Why is there a kisaeng house
right next to a widow village?

428
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,899
The female energy is strong here,

429
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,318
which is why they built
a kisaeng house here.

430
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,278
Now, the widows

431
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,781
make the alcohol and clothes
for the kisaeng house.

432
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,825
And Madam Chun takes care of our village.

433
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,495
We are helping each other.

434
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,790
Welcome.

435
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,542
She must be tired.

436
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,211
Report her entry to the Vice-Curator
and let her rest.

437
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,214
Do we have any room available?

438
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,967
It might take a few days to prepare one.

439
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,262
Why do you not have her stay
in your place for now?

440
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,056
Sun-nyeo, host her in your room
since you use it alone.

441
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,392
-That sounds good.
-That is perfect.

442
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,726
No, thank you.

443
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,692
Well, I just...

444
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:55,322
I cannot inconvenience you like that.

445
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,949
That is fine.

446
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,993
I do not mind at all. We are all women.

447
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,329
No! I cannot let myself do that.

448
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,915
You said that the kisaeng house
is right next to the village, right?

449
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,626
Could you just let me stay there?

450
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,336
Sorry?

451
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,338
At the kisaeng house?

452
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,432
Are you sure you will be okay?

453
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:25,561
A lot of men come here
and it might feel uncomfortable.

454
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,439
It is just for a few days. I will be fine.

455
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,690
Sure.

456
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,110
You may share a room with Dong-ju, then.

457
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,155
She has a bad sleeping habit,
but she is...

458
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,490
Come with me!

459
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:42,995
Come right here!

460
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,415
Quiet!

461
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,085
Stop crying.

462
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,170
No!

463
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,507
Let her go.

464
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,426
Dong-ju, you cannot do that.

465
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,845
Does this bitch want to die?

466
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:00,929
My lord.

467
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,357
My lord, what brings you here?

468
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,901
I want to give that girl a chance
to become a true kisaeng,

469
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,362
but how dare that lowly bitch stop me?

470
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,615
Look at this mess!

471
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,912
She is not a kisaeng officially,

472
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,581
and she is only 12 years old.

473
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,334
Take Cho-seon with you inside.

474
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,088
-My lord, let us--
-What?

475
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,632
You must be out of your mind too.

476
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,385
Where are you taking her?

477
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,427
My lord!

478
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:44,056
This is against the law, do you not know?

479
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,266
The law?

480
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,102
The law!

481
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:54,233
You lowly women are talking about the law!

482
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:55,984
You are right.

483
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:00,322
What good is there for lowly kisaengs
like us to talk about the law?

484
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,867
But it is a different story
for you, my lord.

485
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,620
You are a man of class,

486
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,456
so I am just giving you
a friendly reminder

487
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,042
not to lose your dignity
because of a moment of anger.

488
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,629
Then how much longer do I have to wait?

489
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,842
At least three to four years.

490
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:21,885
Fine.

491
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,179
I will wait.

492
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,604
Seriously?

493
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,816
My lord!

494
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,780
Is this good enough?

495
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,783
My lord, what are you doing?

496
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:48,245
I would need to cut it this much to let it
grow back in three to four years.

497
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,830
-My lord!
-Why?

498
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,792
What if someone else takes her
while I wait

499
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,127
for three to four years?

500
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:02,426
Or will you give up your hair instead?

501
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,059
What do you think you are doing?

502
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,649
I will give my hair to you
if that is what you want.

503
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,985
Hair cannot be more important
than the little girl.

504
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,029
Hair always grows back.

505
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,322
You little...

506
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,658
-Oh, no.
-Goodness.

507
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,067
Absolutely despicable.

508
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,028
You are asking for death.

509
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,781
-What are you doing? Teach her a lesson!
-Why you little...

510
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,408
Anybody there?

511
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,326
-My lord!
-My lord.

512
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,536
Yeon-hong and Ok-ran. Hello.

513
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,662
-My lord!
-My lord.

514
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,330
What is wrong?

515
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,332
It is fine.

516
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,084
Darn.

517
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,055
Who are you?

518
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,767
I am sorry about that. Are you all right?

519
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,563
Are you a chef?

520
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,607
Let us say that I am.

521
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,110
You must be bothered by all of this.

522
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,279
Now we are talking.

523
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,823
Look at what these lowly wenches
have done.

524
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:33,619
How dare they treat a nobleman like this?

525
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,496
Here, have this.

526
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,500
-What is it?
-Chew it well.

527
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:44,129
It is an evodia pill that calms anger.

528
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,551
It is so bitter!

529
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,262
Things good for your health are bitter.

530
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,556
Would you like another one?

531
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,683
-Water!
-Where is water?

532
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,602
-Water!
-Bring him water!

533
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,395
-Water!
-Here.

534
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,022
-My lord, have some water.
-Drink up.

535
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,152
Goodness.

536
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:11,740
Oh, no.

537
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,868
I thought it was water,
but it was vinegar.

538
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,245
I am sorry.

539
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,581
Evodia becomes poisonous

540
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,874
when it is consumed with vinegar.

541
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,752
My lord!

542
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:27,172
Get out of my way!

543
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,758
My lord, are you okay?

544
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,931
Does it really become poisonous?

545
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,183
I have no idea. I have never tried it.

546
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,895
Come inside, my lord.

547
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,857
Stop fussing and head inside.

548
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,151
-Yes, madam.
-Yes, madam.

549
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,239
I am sorry for all the mess.

550
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:56,201
-You'll be staying in the room at the end.
-I can find it myself.

551
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,079
This is too bad.

552
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,540
It is fine.

553
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,584
Dong-ju, come with me.

554
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,601
I think I have seen her somewhere.

555
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,520
Where did I see her?

556
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:25,981
That girl...

557
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,215
I am finally here,

558
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,302
but nobody is going to just tell me
who gave the order.

559
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:57,971
How am I going to find out?

560
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,312
Darn it.

561
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,696
What were you thinking?

562
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,492
It has not even been a month
since he took the 13-year-old Mae-hyang

563
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,620
and returned her dead.

564
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,539
How could I just watch him do that again?

565
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,666
So you cut your hair? You are a kisaeng!

566
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,960
I could not let him cut your hair.

567
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,172
I am not an official kisaeng yet.

568
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,883
You should be ashamed
that you are still an apprentice.

569
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,386
Look at you!

570
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,055
He made me so annoyed.

571
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,307
How could he treat us like that?

572
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,352
He is so ugly. Who does he think he is?

573
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,903
Bye now.

574
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,075
I heard you stepped out
of the kisaeng house.

575
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,911
Where did you go?

576
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,876
Do not put yourself in trouble.

577
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,044
Understood?

578
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:13,755
Yes.

579
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:31,273
-Why did you do that?
-It was annoying

580
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,985
to watch the ugly jerk make a mess here.

581
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,945
I love this kisaeng house.

582
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,613
Do not meddle in again.

583
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,532
I cannot promise that.

584
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,659
You disappeared after leaving a will,

585
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,411
so how can I not meddle in?

586
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,830
I almost had a heart attack.

587
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,707
Did you not care

588
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,542
how worried I would be?

589
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,712
You promised that you would not get
in my way. Do you not remember that?

590
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,966
Am I not allowed to worry about you?

591
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,260
I am going to leave this place
if you keep meddling in life.

592
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,221
Fine, I will stop.

593
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,932
You do not ever lose, do you?

594
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,103
Bye.

595
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,574
What do you think you are doing?

596
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,284
Are you stealing my stuff?

597
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,164
-Give me that.
-Do not touch me.

598
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,082
-Show me!
-Stop it!

599
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,001
My goodness.

600
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:39,716
I am sorry.

601
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,968
Why did you go through my stuff?

602
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,178
You are the one

603
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:48,600
who groped my chest.

604
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,936
You touched my belongings
without my permission!

605
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,939
Did you see everything inside?

606
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,232
No.

607
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,239
Why are you in my room?

608
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,492
Madam Chun told me that I can stay here.

609
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,037
I hate sharing a room with someone.

610
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,333
You think I like being here?

611
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,002
I guess she had no choice
since I am the only one

612
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,504
who uses a room alone.

613
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,008
You can make yourself at home,

614
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,802
but if you touch my stuff
without my permission--

615
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,345
I will not.

616
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,389
I will not lay a single finger
on anything!

617
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:02,716
You!

618
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,593
I lost him because of you!

619
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:10,765
You are no ordinary person either.

620
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,022
I am not following you around.

621
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:25,405
What a beautiful flower you are.
You soothe my loneliness.

622
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,909
Vice-Curator Yeon,
what are you doing here?

623
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:34,164
But I will take the loneliness
as an honor.

624
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,667
If that is what it takes to see
a woman so fair, a Hera of Troy.

625
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,754
You mean Helen of Troy.

626
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:48,470
Are you making fun of me
because of my hair?

627
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:58,396
I knew from the first sight
that you are the one I am looking for.

628
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,273
What?

629
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,567
Me?

630
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,987
What about her?

631
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,827
Enjoy your date.

632
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,204
-What?
-Sure.

633
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,081
-You are the new widow
-Hold on.

634
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,332
at the widow village, right?

635
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,958
-I am fine.
-Hear me out.

636
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:23,505
I was of a very high position in Hanyang,

637
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,007
but the King trusted me so much

638
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,051
that he ordered me
to manage the widow village.

639
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,552
I am a vice-curator of the ninth rank

640
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,678
of the Yeon family.

641
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,764
My name is Geun.

642
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:35,141
What an useless position that is.

643
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,351
Wait.

644
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,020
Excuse my contact.

645
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,815
Although I am not allowed to enter,

646
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,275
I manage everything
that happens in the village,

647
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,944
-so let me know--
-No thanks!

648
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,867
You manage the village, you say?

649
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,666
Thank you so much.

650
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,418
It will be of great help
for me to get to know the widows.

651
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,462
I would also like to get
to know you very well.

652
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,886
No need to be so shy.

653
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,876
It is not going to end
just by defeating a few.

654
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:43,960
So,

655
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,713
follow after them to find their boss.

656
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:53,011
BREWERY

657
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,430
I found her.

658
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,390
I found you.

659
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,444
We have been looking for you

660
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:13,114
to have an honest conversation with you.

661
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,783
No, thanks. I am not much of a talker.

662
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,327
You must be exhausted.

663
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,579
Come with us.

664
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,039
Where?

665
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:24,459
Nothing brings women closer
than taking a bath together.

666
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:27,545
A bath? What are you saying?

667
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,048
How can women bathe together?

668
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,888
I am just shy.

669
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,851
-We used to be shy, too.
-That is right.

670
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,271
It is okay. We are all women.

671
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,773
-Let us go!
-Let us go!

672
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,067
-Let us go!
-Let me go!

673
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,985
You are loving it.

674
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,446
Let me go! I do not want to.

675
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,448
We are neighbors now.

676
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,408
Hey!

677
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,910
I have been looking for you.

678
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,119
Remember how we were

679
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,830
supposed to go to that place?

680
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:04,999
You know.

681
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,335
Where were you two planning to go?

682
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,586
What?

683
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,755
I was going to go and take a bath

684
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,340
because my short hair is bothering me.

685
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,975
-Well then.
-Gosh, no.

686
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,351
Let us go!

687
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:26,646
No! Please!

688
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,273
Let us go!

689
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,818
No, please let me go.

690
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,444
Please.

691
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,863
Namo Amitabhaya

692
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,075
I think I should get going.

693
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,159
Goodness!

694
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,369
No!

695
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,746
Seriously, I...

696
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:50,128
I cannot do this.

697
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,339
-Why not?
-Because I have

698
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:57,093
a skin disease.

699
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,095
This water is medicinal.

700
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,930
This will heal your disease.

701
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,932
Let us get in!

702
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:07,020
Well...

703
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,522
I have a trauma of water.
I almost drowned as a kid.

704
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,858
That is what weak people say.

705
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,527
-Wait.
-Just fight it out.

706
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:19,073
Just come in, the water is not that deep.

707
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,326
The thing is...

708
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,914
Why are you so shy? We are all women.

709
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,293
No.

710
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,134
Wait.

711
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,719
I do not think I can--

712
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,304
No!

713
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,735
It is nice in here.

714
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,403
I knew you would like it.

715
01:00:58,988 --> 01:00:59,947
Come here.

716
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,071
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE HO-JAE,
PARK CHUL-MIN, AND JUNG YI-RANG

717
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,864
FOR MAKING A GUEST APPEARANCE

718
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:58,798
So...

719
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,175
"Really?" "No way."

720
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,844
There is something
you cannot say yourself,

721
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,888
so you want someone else
to say it for you.

722
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,765
Are you not Jung Yun-jeo?

723
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,767
Jung Yun-jeo. I am sure it was him.

724
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:11,728
Remember the day Yun-jeo died?

725
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:15,440
You said that he died
after he buried his son, right?

726
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,943
It started itching
because I could not get changed.

727
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,447
A little lower than that.

728
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,002
