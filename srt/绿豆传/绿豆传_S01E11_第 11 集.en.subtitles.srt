1
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,920
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,881
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,949
-Why?
-What?

4
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,077
What is it?

5
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,455
Why are you avoiding my eyes?
Why are you so restless?

6
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,999
Well...

7
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,002
I am just nervous.

8
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,672
After all we have been through?

9
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,799
You are right.

10
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,095
This is weird. Why am I nervous?

11
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,847
I am acting weird, am I not?

12
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,224
You are such a coward.

13
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,812
Do you not feel nervous at all?

14
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,107
I feel like...

15
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,526
As if my heart is about to...

16
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,654
I am totally fine.

17
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,992
-Really?
-Yes.

18
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,217
Dong-ju!

19
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,724
We deserve to die, Your Majesty.

20
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,853
We had no idea that we had committed
such a big crime.

21
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,813
When you were burying the corpses,

22
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,817
did you also bury the bodies
of Yoo Yeon-gyeong and his family?

23
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,782
I think I just saw the young mistress
who we used to serve.

24
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,330
Yes, they were all dead.
Every single one of them.

25
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,916
From the mistress who ran away

26
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:31,628
to the young mistress,

27
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:36,090
we watched everyone die
and buried them ourselves.

28
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes.

29
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,385
Is that right?

30
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:40,720
Okay.

31
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,681
Where did you bury them?

32
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,240
I checked the kisaeng house
that Hwa-su is staying.

33
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,952
She did not visit there, either.

34
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,955
-Shall I search outside the city--
-It is fine. Take a seat.

35
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,582
Sorry?

36
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,918
Seeing how we cannot find her
after all this effort,

37
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,128
she must really hate me.

38
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,508
Maybe I should take comfort in knowing
that she did not go to him.

39
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,807
We cannot go in like this.
What if someone sees?

40
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,226
Did you not hear? You must rest.

41
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,936
Nobody will see us.

42
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,230
Who is going to be in the yard this early?

43
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,482
Whatever, just put me down.

44
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,985
-Stay still!
-Gosh.

45
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,862
See? There is nobody...

46
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,908
-Let me down.
-I guess I was wrong.

47
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,454
Dong-ju?

48
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,379
He came from the palace to see you.

49
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,589
From the palace?

50
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:05,096
I do not mind having one more servant,

51
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,683
-but why are you...
-Asking you for such a favor?

52
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,438
She is the one who gave advice
to His Majesty

53
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,858
on how to cure his insomnia
when even the royal doctor gave up.

54
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,361
Please do me a favor.

55
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,448
Yes, Your Highness.

56
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,387
What matters is
that we are together right now.

57
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,389
So why can you not

58
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,476
just follow your heart?

59
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,020
You see,

60
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,064
I just...

61
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,153
I just like everything about you.

62
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,877
-I hear you summoned me.
-I have a task for you.

63
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,254
I will provide you with some men.

64
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,050
Yes, what is it?

65
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,037
Let them in.

66
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,243
I do not think they remember where it is.

67
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,079
We cannot search the whole mountain.

68
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,714
There was a rule,

69
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,884
that we had to stay indoors
when we heard bells rattle.

70
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,970
When we stayed indoors,

71
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,640
Chancellor Heo secretly visited
a remote house in the widow village.

72
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,933
A remote house?

73
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,897
You said you were not allowed
to go outside. How did you find out?

74
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,358
Chancellor Heo killed my mate

75
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,070
who saw things that she should not have.

76
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,448
What do you mean?

77
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,825
Tell us what the dead widow saw.

78
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,119
There was a young man, she said.

79
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,956
A man of great importance in the future.

80
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,543
-Who is that?
-Your Majesty.

81
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,421
Your Majesty, I have something to tell you
about that man.

82
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,300
That man will testify.

83
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,932
Everyone may leave, except for these two.

84
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,733
You do not seem to remember anything,
so let us go back.

85
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,776
-Yes.
-Yes.

86
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,118
Whose graves are you looking for?

87
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,286
Sorry?

88
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,375
Well...

89
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,169
It is Lord Yoo's graveyard.

90
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,631
His family members were executed
for treason,

91
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:13,135
but we had no idea that burying them was
this great of a sin.

92
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:19,433
As you have said, we cannot remember
where we buried them.

93
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,688
Why is His Majesty trying to dig up
the graves now?

94
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,523
Well...

95
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,149
Everyone died.

96
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,529
Every single one of them died,
but he does not believe us.

97
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,783
Even Eun-seo died.

98
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,743
I mean it.

99
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,621
I understand. You may go.

100
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,707
Let us go.

101
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,754
He is your son, Your Majesty.

102
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,925
The man who the Chancellor was hiding.

103
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,803
That is why he had to kill and burn

104
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,014
to get rid of his every trace.

105
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,682
No, Your Majesty.

106
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,560
He is lying to you!

107
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,438
When I lived on the island,

108
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,733
my brother once said
that he will rise to the top.

109
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,527
I remember him saying that.

110
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,113
-What did you just say?
-Your Majesty.

111
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,867
I thought he meant that he wanted
to become a general...

112
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,994
But the Chancellor was trying

113
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,662
to enthrone...

114
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,247
Enough!

115
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,126
I worked so hard to get rid of him.

116
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,754
How dare you let him live,

117
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,923
and try to dethrone me?

118
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,135
How could you do this to me?

119
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,929
What are you so afraid of, Your Majesty?

120
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:45,478
Yes. I believed that
you no longer deserve the throne.

121
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,772
-What did you say?
-You cannot be the King

122
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,068
just by killing off your subjects
and enemies.

123
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,529
How do you not know that the King
must be a wise politician

124
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,867
who guards his people
and is protected by his people?

125
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,911
Shut your mouth!

126
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,121
You have forsaken your people,

127
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,582
your old friend,

128
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,920
and even your newborn son...

129
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,631
For what?

130
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,734
I told you to shut your mouth.

131
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,197
Your Majesty...

132
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,877
What have I done?

133
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,090
No...

134
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,800
No, this cannot be!

135
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,727
20 YEARS AGO
DURING THE JAPANESE INVASION

136
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,366
I learned that every choice
has a consequence.

137
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,954
But where are those who must bear
the consequences?

138
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,292
Why must the innocent and the powerless
who cannot choose their country or King

139
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,545
meet such a wrongful death?

140
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,505
Your Highness...

141
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,028
I will be different.

142
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,198
Even if they cannot choose,

143
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,243
I will make sure everyone is happy
to be my people

144
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,748
That is the world that I will build.

145
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,183
Your Majesty, for a very long time,

146
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,854
I have adored those tears.

147
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,609
Yun...

148
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,737
I wished

149
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,950
to create that world with you.

150
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,788
Do not speak.

151
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,041
Call the royal doctor!

152
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,920
No, you must not die! No!

153
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,931
No!

154
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,684
Yun!

155
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,353
No! Yun!

156
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,564
This cannot be!

157
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,191
Yun...

158
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,694
Yun...

159
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,738
Yun...

160
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,425
What are you going to do?

161
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,136
I must see Her Majesty.

162
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,346
How will you do that?

163
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,599
You should talk to your son instead...

164
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,183
Nok-du

165
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,103
must not know the truth until the end.

166
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,691
Her Majesty is the only one
who can protect him until the end.

167
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,195
I will find a way.

168
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,741
No, I will take care of it.
You should get going.

169
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,244
Lord Heo ordered me to protect you
until the very end.

170
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,835
Officer Baek.

171
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,882
Are you hurt?

172
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,176
No, I am fine.

173
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,762
Did you find the graves?

174
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,264
They do not remember the location.

175
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,850
-It was a long time ago and--
-Send them back now.

176
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,228
The graves are no longer important.

177
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,772
What do you mean?

178
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,607
Well...

179
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,822
Send them back and come to me.
I will go and wash up.

180
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,916
-Thank you, my lord.
-Thank you.

181
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,043
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

182
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,462
It is not me. His Majesty
must have ordered to let you go.

183
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,130
So...

184
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,675
Thank you so much, my lord.

185
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,612
I am sorry.

186
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,866
-Let us get going.
-Yes, thank you.

187
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:34,660
Thank you.

188
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,090
Why did you start working as a servant
when you are still unwell?

189
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,426
Why start today?

190
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:51,969
Gosh.

191
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,598
Just give it to me. I will do it.

192
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,061
You can go sit and rest.
Or, you can watch me.

193
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,439
Gosh.

194
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,650
What brought you to the palace?

195
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,318
To see you.

196
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,154
And snatch you up after work.

197
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,614
What are we going to do after work?

198
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,242
Well...

199
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,537
You have no plans.

200
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,165
No, I just have too many.

201
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,876
I am trying to think
of what we should do first.

202
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,756
Should we go on the swing?

203
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,133
Sure.

204
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,718
And tomorrow,

205
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,679
there will be a wrestling match
at the market.

206
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,181
Let us go watch that.

207
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,766
The day after tomorrow, we will...

208
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,149
Why?

209
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,902
Nothing.

210
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,074
Sure, let us do everything that we can.

211
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,118
Sounds good.

212
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,037
See you at the back door.
I will wait for you there.

213
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,333
Go back before someone sees you.

214
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,459
Fine.

215
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,214
I am leaving now.

216
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,097
Perfect.

217
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,934
What is this?

218
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,687
I picked it up on my way here.

219
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,982
That is what Master Hwang told me to say.

220
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,860
But to be honest, they were so pretty
and I thought of you.

221
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,211
I should go now.

222
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,547
Go.

223
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,426
I am leaving now.

224
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,095
Officer Yeon.

225
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,979
Your Majesty.

226
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,909
Why are you looking at me like that?

227
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,830
Now that I think of it,

228
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,541
you have never looked at ease,

229
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,962
from the moment I first met you until now.

230
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,635
And that is considering the fact that

231
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,222
I felt the most at ease

232
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,226
when I went out in disguise and met you.

233
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,571
Did you hear about what I have done today?

234
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,326
Yes, Your Majesty.

235
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,703
I see.

236
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,332
Is it because of the man
Officer Baek and I are after?

237
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,084
-Is it because he hid that man, or--
-It is not.

238
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,378
It is all because of me.

239
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,047
Everything is.

240
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,300
That day...

241
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,721
That was when it all went wrong.

242
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,724
Since that day...

243
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,685
If you are aware of that,

244
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,314
then there must be a solution.

245
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,116
I dream about that day

246
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,078
over and over again.

247
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,540
It is absolutely terrifying.

248
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,630
But do you know what scares me the most?

249
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,426
Even if I were to go back to that day,

250
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,054
I...

251
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,768
do not have the courage to make
a different choice.

252
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,606
Your Majesty...

253
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,528
In your memory of that day, do you...

254
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,906
Your Majesty!

255
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,005
In your memory of that terrifying day,

256
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,510
am I...

257
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,055
a part of it?

258
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,708
Open the door!

259
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,169
Is anybody there?

260
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,381
The power of the King is coming down
from above.

261
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,725
Repeat what you have said.

262
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,146
The son of the King born on November 19

263
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,274
will become the next King.

264
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,235
What did you just say?

265
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,779
What is that nonsense?

266
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,573
I am right here,

267
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,411
fighting in the war for Father.

268
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,246
I am breathing right here

269
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:02,167
and you are saying that the son born
in a few days will be the next King?

270
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:10,258
Sure, that is what His Majesty wanted.

271
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,718
Had it not been for the war,

272
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,221
I would not have become the Crown Prince.

273
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,974
But I have become the Crown Prince.

274
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,602
I have at last become the Crown Prince!

275
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,564
So, cut the nonsense and tell me.

276
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,858
What should I do?

277
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,693
What must I do?

278
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,323
You cannot change

279
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,286
nor stop God's plan,

280
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,121
Your Highness.

281
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,791
Do you understand

282
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,961
the weight of your own words?

283
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,839
I cannot lie about God's will

284
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:57,889
to save my own life, can I?

285
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,559
I will change it.

286
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,520
I will stop it!

287
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,939
I will become

288
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,693
the King of this country!

289
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,761
Your Majesty!

290
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,223
Shall I call the royal doctor,
or the royal chef?

291
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,194
Why

292
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,281
are you crying?

293
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,123
No, I am not crying.

294
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,840
Your Highness,

295
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,427
he is the Prince.

296
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,849
He is your son.

297
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,024
I wish

298
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,406
that you will never find out

299
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,368
what kind of person I am.

300
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,405
You must have all heard
what happened to Chancellor Heo.

301
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,698
Yes.

302
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,743
It is good that you have gotten involved
at the right timing.

303
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,122
Otherwise, we would have all been
in danger.

304
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,877
The revolt will take place
on the 15th next month.

305
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,546
We will invade the palace,
where His Majesty will be absent

306
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,089
and away to visit the royal graves.

307
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,801
I will take an army from Changuimun Gate
at 10 p.m. to the palace,

308
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,178
so keep the North Gate open.

309
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,597
Yes, I will take care of that.

310
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,142
Chief Secretary, take the Royal Seal,
arrest the King, and return to the palace.

311
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,145
Deputy Chief, take the Queen Dowager
and receive her orders.

312
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,022
Everything will go smoothly, then.

313
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,983
Yes. He committed a heinous crime of
killing his younger brother

314
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,360
and imprisoning his mother

315
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,070
so we will not face much opposition.

316
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,364
We have enough reasons to revolt.

317
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,575
I could add something else,

318
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,995
something even worse than all of that.

319
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,998
Because I know one more.

320
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,460
That was all Prince Neungyang?

321
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,755
He burnt down the widow village for sure.

322
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,256
As for Madam Chun,

323
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,759
we do not have any evidence.

324
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:06,054
But seeing how he tried to remove
Chancellor Heo by forcing you to lie...

325
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,098
What do we do?

326
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,603
Chancellor Heo died because of us.

327
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,772
We must kill Prince Neungyang!

328
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,191
If we make rash decisions out of anger,

329
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,651
our efforts will go in vain.

330
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,571
The three of us cannot defeat Dan-ho.

331
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,742
Lie low until we find a way.

332
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,327
I will keep in touch with you.

333
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,221
Dong-ju!

334
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,227
-Nok-du!
-Hey!

335
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,367
Why did you scare me from the back
like that?

336
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,037
I wanted to see you surprised. Happy now?

337
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,874
Gosh.

338
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,709
Is it not amazing?

339
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,420
I am injured, but I still look amazing,
do I not?

340
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:22,922
Yes.

341
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,719
You look so handsome.

342
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,721
But also beautiful.

343
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,725
When you pretended to be a widow,
you were prettier than a woman.

344
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,021
Why are you suddenly being so kind?

345
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,067
You cannot even take a compliment,
so why do you keep showing off?

346
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,862
Come. We have lots of things to do.

347
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,217
This one looks the prettiest.

348
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,261
This mirror?

349
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,764
No, this.

350
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,183
Stop it! Gosh...

351
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,768
She does not realize how beautiful she is.

352
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,311
How much is this?

353
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,772
Come and get some fireworks!

354
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,650
I have imported these from Ming myself.

355
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,859
Here you go.

356
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,616
Let us buy the whole basket.

357
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,744
Please give us the whole basket.

358
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,329
-This whole basket?
-Yes.

359
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,040
-Could you give us these sweets as well?
-Yes.

360
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,757
Here you go.

361
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,428
You were adorable
when you had these before.

362
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,846
You look like a bunny!

363
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,183
Buy me a pair!

364
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,103
-No.
-Why not?

365
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,481
No!

366
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,401
Why? These are pretty. Buy me a pair.

367
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,529
You are going to run away in them,
are you not?

368
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,198
-No.
-Why would I run away?

369
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,158
Just buy me a pair.

370
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,203
I will buy you everything
other than shoes.

371
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,122
Just not shoes.

372
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,250
I can make those as well.

373
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,502
Come and take a look.

374
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,546
Why would you buy what you can make?

375
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,798
-Be quiet!
-Come to think of it,

376
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,342
I think I spent way more money than you.

377
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,178
They are

378
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,974
such a beautiful couple. Darn it.

379
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,978
My goodness! What was that?

380
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,106
You...

381
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,608
Vice-Curator Yeon!

382
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,570
What do you think? I will make you
a robe with it.

383
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,197
I am very crafty, as you know.

384
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:55,658
Bok-nyeo?

385
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,664
Bok-nyeo?

386
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,292
Hey!

387
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,297
-Ladies!
-Lady Kim!

388
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,509
What brings you all here?

389
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,139
Have some of this.

390
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,350
Goodness.

391
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,066
I only gave lotus roots for side dish!

392
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,486
You are so mean!

393
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,113
Sorry, that was mean of me.

394
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,372
It must have been hard for you.

395
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,209
You had to stay in the well for two days.

396
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,505
Not at all. You ladies must have
gone through a lot, too.

397
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,673
Do not get me started.

398
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,469
Two days?

399
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,680
You did not eat anything for two days?

400
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,517
For two whole days?

401
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,145
Yes, that is why I am starving now.

402
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,358
Have some food!

403
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,193
Nok-du,

404
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,947
why are you serving food all of a sudden?

405
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,325
You worked so hard to cook all of this.

406
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,494
Is that right?

407
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,164
-Enjoy.
-Yes.

408
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,333
Have a seat.

409
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,420
This is nice.

410
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,551
Stop!

411
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,020
Put your spoon down.

412
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,439
What is wrong, Aeng-du? You should eat.

413
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,154
Yolk!

414
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,872
Gosh.

415
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,542
A fried egg.

416
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,335
This is a fried egg!

417
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,297
There was just one left...

418
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,091
The doctor told me to feed her well.

419
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,010
-You jerk.
-You have to eat lots of eggs and meat.

420
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,261
Dig in.

421
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,772
-You can have it.
-No!

422
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,524
You have to eat it.

423
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,776
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

424
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,195
Gosh.

425
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,614
-I cannot watch this.
-This is too much.

426
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,075
You are making us widows very sad.

427
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,412
Where are your manners when we are
having a family dinner?

428
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,168
Look at you.

429
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,841
What a sweet meal we are having.

430
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,302
Very sweet, indeed

431
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,846
Very, very sweet.

432
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,312
I forgot!

433
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,148
I will bring the scorched rice tea now.

434
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,780
I know how to eat fried eggs, too.

435
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,448
I will make some for you next time.

436
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,201
Aeng-du, have some meat instead.

437
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,953
Eat a lot of it.

438
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,121
Yes, go ahead.

439
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:32,959
Let us keep eating.

440
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,217
I may be able to get inside,

441
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,928
but I do not think I can see her myself.

442
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,389
Just delivering the note will be enough.

443
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,355
Please give it to me.

444
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,116
Thank you.

445
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,368
Please be careful.

446
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,788
By the way,

447
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,040
when you are in the palace,

448
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,419
do you think you will be able to find out
what happened to Lord Heo?

449
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,924
I was meaning to tell you...

450
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,724
You cannot sleep here
when there are so many eyes on us!

451
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,726
-Are you insane?
-Yes, I am.

452
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,561
Can I go over?

453
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,314
What if someone opens the door?

454
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,525
Who will open your door
this late at night?

455
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,735
You are crazy.

456
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,572
I am speechless.

457
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,992
That is because you know I am right.

458
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,119
I am going over.

459
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,378
I am tired, so do not try to chat
and just go to sleep.

460
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,172
Fine.

461
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,437
Good night.

462
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,685
You really are asleep.

463
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,440
You really listen well, do you not?

464
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,557
You are not sleeping?

465
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,393
Are you an idiot? How can I sleep?

466
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,898
-Why not?
-Do you really need to ask?

467
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,900
Seriously?

468
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,569
You can sleep, I do not see why not.

469
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,998
When I see you, I forget about everything.

470
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,668
I am struggling,

471
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,922
and I cannot smile, but you make me smile.

472
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,133
Weird, is it not?

473
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,680
I guess so.

474
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,268
Why do I love a scamp like you?

475
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,361
I had my eyes closed.

476
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,489
You woke me up.

477
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:21,932
The widows all have
terrible sleeping habits.

478
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,227
I could not sleep at all.

479
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,902
Hey, Aeng-du.

480
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,240
-Did you see?
-See what?

481
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,952
How you two were stuck together
like glue and kissing each other?

482
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:47,207
Or rolling away from each other
as if you were caught on fire?

483
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,876
Which one?

484
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,837
You saw everything.

485
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,383
I have given it some thought,

486
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,345
and I do not think you can be my husband.

487
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,516
What use is a man who has no principles?

488
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,083
A dungeon?

489
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,293
He practically lives there.

490
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,546
His robe is always stained with blood.

491
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,714
Goodness!

492
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,385
I hear that someone died there yesterday.

493
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,762
I hear that it was a man of high rank.

494
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,098
That is what it is for, anyway.

495
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,852
What are you doing?

496
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,188
Right.

497
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,211
Why do you look so sunken?

498
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,964
A man died

499
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,258
because I lied.

500
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:22,302
Did you think that it would be
a smooth ride?

501
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,888
-That is not what I meant--
-If you are

502
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,099
going to be like this in front
of His Majesty, do not come.

503
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,308
I will meet him alone.

504
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,829
You do not have work to do?

505
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,748
I am here to do something.

506
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,959
I am sleeping at the palace from today.

507
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,420
-Why?
-I have to. It is for work.

508
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,838
You do not have to.

509
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,174
It is better that way.
I am just giving you a heads-up.

510
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,187
What do you think you are doing?

511
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,063
Let me go. We will talk after you let go.

512
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,817
Please let her go, Prince Neungyang.

513
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,744
Are you out of your mind?

514
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,205
Please excuse him, my lord.

515
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,248
I do not know what happened,

516
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,918
but there are many eyes on you here.

517
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,557
Do you know how hard I searched for you?

518
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,060
And you are at the palace?
Why are you here?

519
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,770
It is complicated.

520
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,147
You think you can change things
by working in the palace?

521
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,067
-Follow me.
-No!

522
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,151
Dong-ju!

523
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:05,739
Here comes Her Majesty!

524
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:20,212
I came to see who was making
such loud noises in the palace.

525
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,756
Was it you, Prince Neungyang?

526
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,299
I apologize.

527
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,929
You must be Dong-ju, who works for
Court Lady Kim.

528
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,932
Yes, Your Highness.

529
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,018
I do not know what is going on,

530
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,104
but she works for my subordinate,

531
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,648
which means she is one of my people.

532
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,775
Please do not mistreat her like that.

533
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,238
You are excused.

534
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,751
You may go as well, Prince Neungyang.

535
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,766
I wish to talk to you for a moment.

536
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,687
Yes, Your Highness.

537
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,222
Look at you! Why do you look so sunken?

538
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,433
-Mind your own business.
-How can I?

539
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,228
You can stop now. Then I will--

540
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,773
No, there is no going back.

541
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,900
I have come too far.

542
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,736
So stop wasting your time.

543
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,780
What do you mean?

544
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:15,160
Is he blackmailing you?

545
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,874
No, he is not.

546
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,043
Just do not follow me.

547
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,352
-We are out of tea.
-I will get some.

548
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,188
Get the best kind as it will be served
to Her Majesty.

549
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,459
A revolt?

550
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,170
-Chancellor Heo?
-Yes.

551
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:11,633
That is why he was jailed and died there.

552
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,470
How can His Majesty's closest friend
do such a thing?

553
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,472
Is there any proof?

554
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,934
Who was with him?
Who were they trying to enthrone?

555
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,103
I was told to keep it confidential.

556
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,772
I am sorry, Your Highness.

557
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,026
That day,

558
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,947
he certainly had something to tell me.

559
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:35,991
Sorry?

560
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,245
Nothing. You are excused now.

561
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,650
Your Majesty,

562
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:16,031
Chancellor Heo's corpse
is still in the palace.

563
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,992
We cannot find his family, either.

564
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,286
So we do not know what we should do.

565
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,748
Throw the body out
through the door for the dead.

566
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,625
Sorry?

567
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:29,711
Yun...

568
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,715
abandoned me long ago.

569
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,720
I will abandon him, too.

570
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,098
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

571
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,986
How is your wrist?

572
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,072
You must have been scared.

573
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,825
I wish I could knock him out.

574
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,409
I am fine.

575
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,621
Nok-du.

576
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,540
Yes?

577
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,171
I cannot go home from today.

578
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,007
Why do you keep repeating such bad news?

579
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,885
It is fine, I can come visit you.

580
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,762
Head inside and get some rest.

581
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,430
Yes.

582
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,516
I will be back. See you tomorrow.

583
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,379
-Excuse...
-Goodness!

584
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,592
Are you going to keep startling me
like this every time?

585
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,468
I apologize.

586
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,932
You have heard what happened
to Chancellor Heo, right?

587
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,479
Will you leave Prince Neungyang to be?

588
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,647
No.

589
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,318
I am thinking about what I should do.

590
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,662
How about we help each other out?

591
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,629
Not only did His Majesty kill Lord Heo,

592
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,590
he just threw the corpse out.

593
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,052
How could he possibly do that?

594
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,014
I must go see Yun.

595
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,685
You must go and meet Her Majesty.

596
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,439
I will take care of Lord Heo.

597
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,483
Then let us go together.

598
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,401
You know that it will be dangerous.

599
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,986
Is it any less dangerous for you?

600
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:01,905
Let us go.

601
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,953
I almost died of a fever as a child.

602
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,959
I was a nobody
that even my mother gave up on.

603
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,755
But Lord Heo brought me to the doctor
and saved my life.

604
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,761
Lord Heo cried and begged his father
to save me.

605
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,641
Back then,

606
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,937
I was not only cured of fever,

607
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,732
but became

608
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,114
human for the first time in my life.

609
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:52,247
I must go, as I became human
thanks to My Lord.

610
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,046
I apologize for not protecting you
until the very end.

611
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,360
Your Majesty,

612
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:27,157
would you like me to call Officer Yeon
to join you?

613
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,705
I must look pathetic to you.

614
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,832
It is not that.

615
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,042
Sure.

616
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:38,918
Call him.

617
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,880
Where is Jung Yun-jeo?

618
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,591
He ran far away. Do not look for him.

619
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,185
I will cut your head off next.

620
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,813
Answer me quickly.

621
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,859
You will cut my head off
even if I do answer.

622
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,114
I do not need to live,

623
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,409
for my master is right here.

624
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,542
What I am saying is

625
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,045
that I will never do anything
you want me to.

626
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,513
I came here

627
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:59,100
to walk with My Lord to death, anyway.

628
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,405
You were alive all along?

629
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,413
Your Highness.

630
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,375
20 years ago,

631
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,295
do you remember

632
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,965
how I buried His Majesty's son?

633
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,098
Yes, and then you fell--

634
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,392
I did not die then.

635
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:27,272
And I am not the only one who survived.

636
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,774
What do you mean?

637
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,320
His Majesty's son

638
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,867
is still alive, Your Highness.

639
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:01,931
Please protect the child.

640
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,852
What do you mean, protect him?

641
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,688
Where is he?

642
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,444
Where is he now?

643
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,076
You must protect him

644
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,954
from His Majesty.

645
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,832
I asked where he is!

646
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,630
I will protect him with all I have.

647
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:37,675
Tell me.

648
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:40,887
Please.

649
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,890
Your Majesty!

650
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,828
Who is there?

651
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:10,685
My lord.

652
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,415
Your Majesty!

653
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,126
Your Majesty!

654
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,148
You were right. There was an oath.

655
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:40,858
How can we steal that?

656
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,778
I am Lady Kim,
who stole Lord Park's elephant statue.

657
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,281
You are going to stop the revolt?

658
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:48,741
Are you okay, my lord?

659
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,578
-And you will bring Hwang-tae back?
-You must help me.

660
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,001
Here comes the Prince.

661
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,462
There is no point in doing this.

662
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:04,590
It will be all over
for Prince Neungyang tonight.

663
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,219
