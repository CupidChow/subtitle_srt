1
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,564
Who are you?

2
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,050
What are you doing here?

3
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,802
Are you trying to sabotage my plan?

4
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,970
What do you mean?

5
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,681
I am here to help you out
because I heard you were caught.

6
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,893
That was part of my plan.

7
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,187
They say beard the lion in his den, right?

8
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,773
Besides, you were going to use your sword
dressed like that?

9
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,191
Excuse me.

10
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,318
Who are you?

11
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,654
-How dare you!
-Sorry?

12
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,197
How dare you interrupt?

13
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,491
-I just--
-And who are you?

14
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,077
How dare you ask me who I am?

15
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,664
She is my friend. Get out of the way!

16
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,879
Go.

17
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,923
Go!

18
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,925
-Go?
-Off you go!

19
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,024
You!

20
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,110
How dare you peek inside?

21
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,117
You bitch!

22
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,424
Who are you?

23
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,384
Excuse me.

24
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,637
I am a friend of...

25
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,432
You mean, Lady Kim?

26
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,392
Yes.

27
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,936
I am her friend.

28
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,689
She is in danger right now.

29
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,780
We are here. Do not worry.

30
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,658
Thank you for helping me out.

31
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,827
But the police bureau

32
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,121
has been colluding with her father-in-law
for a long time.

33
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,873
So this is not going to work.

34
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,338
You should have come inside quietly.

35
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,882
How dare you make a big scene out here?

36
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,385
How dare you humiliate me?

37
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,225
Who is this?

38
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,602
Are you not the woman
from the widow village?

39
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,479
The beautiful behind?

40
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,566
Why do we keep crossing paths?

41
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,527
Why do you not tell me?
How dare you be so rude to me again?

42
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,409
Open the palanquin!

43
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,494
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

44
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,746
How dare you?

45
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,164
-Stop it!
-Should I beat you more?

46
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,833
-Do not move!
-Have you not yet learned your lesson?

47
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,342
Who is this?

48
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,143
These two are not her.

49
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,813
Where in the world is my daughter-in-law?

50
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,693
Arrest these two right now!

51
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,111
Yes, my lord.

52
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,824
You two better explain
when and how you switched places with her!

53
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,591
Stop!

54
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,439
What is with the big fuss?

55
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,236
My lord, please disregard this.
It is a mere family matter.

56
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,866
These men are all armed.
You call this a mere family matter?

57
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,534
Arrest all of them!

58
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,744
-Yes!
-Yes!

59
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,163
-Let's go!
-Come on.

60
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,706
-No!
-Please.

61
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,958
-Follow me.
-I did not do anything.

62
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,919
Do not touch me!

63
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,713
Follow me.

64
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,593
-Hey!
-Follow me.

65
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,332
Oh my goodness!

66
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,293
My goodness.

67
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,003
My goodness.

68
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,513
I owe you an apology
for many things, my lord.

69
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,056
No need to apologize.

70
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,558
She is your mother, after all.
I ought to help her.

71
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,104
They look very close.

72
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,732
Yes.

73
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,235
I heard that they are very close.

74
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,155
Did he really buy it?

75
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,283
Yes. I never left the house
after getting married.

76
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,160
So there is no way
he could recognize my face.

77
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,075
Gosh!

78
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,443
Why did you not go with your mistress?

79
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,654
You could have run away, just like that.

80
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,493
What were you doing there?

81
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,538
What?

82
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,457
What were you doing with Cha Yul-mu
at that house?

83
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,666
Why do you ask?

84
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,086
You finally met your mistress

85
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,838
and almost died trying to save her.

86
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,217
And yet, you are curious
about what we were doing?

87
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,719
Why do you ask?

88
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,931
Because I am curious.

89
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,517
What?

90
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,357
Am I not allowed to be curious?

91
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,781
You scamp.

92
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,096
You little devil! Let me go!

93
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:19,892
We have come so far.
We cannot just leave without him.

94
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,312
Look around! Hanyang is huge.

95
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,731
How can we possibly find Nok-du here?

96
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,735
Where there is a will, there is a way.

97
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,406
Hey! Cut it out!

98
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,201
ASEOWON
THE HANYANG BASE OF THE MUWOL CORPS

99
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,938
I got out of the island
and followed after the assassin.

100
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,942
And I saw the assassin
entering a widow village.

101
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,069
A widow village?

102
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,863
Oh, dear.

103
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,906
But

104
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,076
-who are--
-Yes, a widow village.

105
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,202
Thank you.

106
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,954
I chased her inside,

107
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,166
and I got beaten up for entering
a village where men are forbidden.

108
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:29,253
I fought a widow and ended up
with this scar on my face.

109
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,339
That is too bad.

110
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,259
That is why I am back in Hanyang.

111
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,887
I am going to find another way.

112
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:46,312
Do you know about a killer corps
only made of women?

113
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,022
Women?

114
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,734
But women--

115
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,235
Excuse me, I need to go to the bathroom.

116
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,863
But women do not like me.

117
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,698
Hey! Where are you going?

118
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,548
It is better for me to look for Nok-du
than his father.

119
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,551
I wonder if they are doing okay.

120
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,969
Aeng-du--

121
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,055
Where did she go?

122
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,640
Aeng-du!

123
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,809
Hwang Aeng-du!

124
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,727
I am here!

125
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,855
Hey!

126
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,276
What are you eating now?

127
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,321
If you are that busy eating,
how will we find Nok-du?

128
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,117
It will not be long.

129
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,660
What do you mean?

130
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,127
I am sure it was him.

131
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,379
He still has the scar
from the fight in Mudamgol,

132
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,755
so you just need to find the scar.

133
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,591
We do not have enough manpower
to provide backup.

134
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,778
Mudamgol, you say?

135
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,156
-I told you.
-Yes.

136
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,715
General Hwang is taking so long
in Hanyang.

137
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,051
Maybe he ran into Nok-du by chance.

138
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,512
I hope so.

139
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,746
Father, run.

140
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,379
Be careful.

141
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,676
Father!

142
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,596
Go this way. I will go that way.

143
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,847
What do you mean?

144
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,558
This path leads to the cave
General Hwang told us.

145
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,852
-I will meet you there.
-No, let us go together.

146
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,395
-Let us go.
-No, Father.

147
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,273
This path is better for me.

148
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,442
We will both be in danger
if we move together.

149
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,985
I will lure them.

150
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,487
Let us meet at the cave.

151
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,032
-You must be careful.
-Yes, Father.

152
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,224
Run...

153
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,956
His Majesty is coming!

154
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,471
-Your Majesty.
-Get out of my way!

155
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,599
Your Majesty.

156
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,435
I am sure that the Queen Dowager did this.

157
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,561
How dare you?

158
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,606
Can you be responsible for your words?

159
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,109
Excuse my words, but rumors say

160
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:07,072
that shamans are secretly
visiting her chamber these days.

161
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,700
Why do you think

162
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,704
someone left a dead pig
under Grand Prince Yeongchang's tree,

163
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,706
an animal that represents your birth year?

164
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,791
Find the truth.

165
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,586
Who did this and why?

166
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,233
He appeared in Hanyang?

167
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,362
Yes, I received a message earlier.

168
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,531
Had I known, I would have stayed longer.

169
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,284
Did Deul-re go after him, too?

170
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,121
Then she would have gone to Aseowon,
but she did not.

171
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,540
Everyone!

172
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,713
Vice-Curator Yeon would like
to see you all in the kisaeng house.

173
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,678
Lady Kim, I would like to say--

174
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,720
Lady Kim!

175
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,223
Lady Kim!

176
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,269
Everyone, focus.

177
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,523
Prepare everything like a mother
making food for her children.

178
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,191
Put the meat pancakes right there.

179
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,734
Lady Kim will love those.

180
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,613
No, that belongs over there.

181
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,241
I thought we were guests at the party.

182
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,451
You are just slaving us around!

183
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,288
Right.

184
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,000
Too bad that Lady Kim is
at her parent's house and she cannot...

185
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,669
Right.

186
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,796
She might not come.

187
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,715
What are you talking about?

188
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,341
She said she will be back today!

189
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,803
Lady Kim does not lie!

190
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,848
Yes, sure.

191
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,934
Go catch a calf
and make some grilled ribs.

192
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,765
I will just walk.

193
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,558
I am on my way to the kisaeng house,

194
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,976
so just hop on.

195
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,774
How can a mature lady
ride a horse with a man?

196
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,193
Come here.

197
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,945
I let you ride your own
because you are experienced,

198
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,363
but it would not be safe to--

199
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,865
I am lighter,

200
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,909
so it will be easier
for her to ride with me.

201
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,495
Hop on, my daughter.

202
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,372
Here, Dong-ju.

203
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,754
Daughter, come on.

204
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,305
Hey...

205
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,766
Mother, are you okay?

206
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,395
-Are you injured?
-I got distracted.

207
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,320
I think I sprained my ankle.

208
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,734
Everyone,

209
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,653
please do not eat too much.

210
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,322
-Just wait a little more, okay?
-Yes, my lord.

211
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,909
When will she come?

212
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,221
What?

213
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,097
What in the...

214
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,032
Lady Kim.

215
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,351
No!

216
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,507
My lord, here you go.

217
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,552
Look at that.

218
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,686
I told you not to give her any alcohol.

219
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,979
No, I am drinking today.

220
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,565
-Please do not.
-Whatever.

221
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,282
It must have been nice
to visit your parents.

222
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:10,287
Did your parents give you anything good?

223
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,164
Yes.

224
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,294
They gave me about 2,000 nyang
to settle in.

225
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,435
You cannot hold your liquor, can you?

226
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,021
I have never drunk before.

227
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,358
It is impressive that you decided
to get caught on purpose.

228
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,446
What a relief. I thought
I may have ruined your plan.

229
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,824
But how did you do it?

230
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,328
That is a secret.

231
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,956
Good work.

232
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,626
I am going to report to the boss
and get you officially initiated.

233
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,296
That means that I can join you, right?

234
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,714
Of course.

235
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,301
There is no reason why you cannot,
unless you are a fake widow.

236
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,722
Right.

237
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,159
Let us ask her since she is here.

238
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,579
What do you mean?

239
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,667
Why do you keep hitting on Lord Cha?

240
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,377
What?

241
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,170
Because she loves him!

242
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,466
I know everything.

243
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,803
I, Vice-Curator Yeon,

244
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,014
love Lady Kim.

245
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:58,103
But why? Why do you love a man
who looks like a stray cat?

246
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,689
-What are you doing?
-Why you...

247
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,316
How could I love Lord Cha?

248
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,527
Why does everyone think so?

249
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,322
It is not what you think!

250
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,203
Hey!

251
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,080
Are you okay?

252
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,960
Are you okay? You should stop drinking.

253
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,628
Goodness.

254
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,090
Like mother like daughter. What a mess.

255
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,303
I told you not to give her drinks.

256
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,471
She becomes a mess when she gets drunk.

257
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,934
What happens when she gets drunk?

258
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,022
She tells what is on her mind

259
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,316
and blows all the secrets she knows.

260
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,943
That is right.

261
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:51,072
I told everyone that you have smelly feet.

262
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,240
-Did I not?
-Hey!

263
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,658
Stop it!

264
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:55,994
Darn it.

265
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,172
Sweetheart,

266
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,175
I think we should head home.

267
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,468
No.

268
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,012
Keep talking.

269
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,473
What do you think of our Lord Cha?

270
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,060
It is only natural for a woman
to love him,

271
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,187
but you are a widow!

272
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,064
-No, I--
-That is right.

273
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,899
My mother

274
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,861
is in love, indeed.

275
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,203
Daughter!

276
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,589
My daughter is drunk,
so she is just spewing nonsense.

277
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,384
We should get going.

278
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,427
Dong-ju never talks nonsense
even when she is drunk.

279
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,055
-Let us hear it.
-Yes, let us.

280
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,598
Who is she in love with?

281
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,184
Is it Lord Cha or not?

282
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,318
My mother is in love with--

283
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,528
My husband!

284
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,823
-My late--
-Honey!

285
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,960
-"Honey"?
-Mistress?

286
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,594
-Are you sure he is here?
-Yes!

287
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,306
Of course.

288
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,350
There is no reason why you cannot,
unless you are a fake widow.

289
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,813
It is only natural for a woman
to love him...

290
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,524
I do not think it is him.

291
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,030
I will tell you

292
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,282
who I love.

293
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,704
I know I should not.

294
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,292
I do not know why,

295
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,295
but I am in love with Lord Cha.

296
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,755
Oh, no.

297
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,762
You are a true man.

298
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,472
And I...

299
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,767
I am just a helpless woman.

300
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,730
Lady Kim?

301
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,526
I am so sorry, my lord.

302
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,236
-Oh, my!
-Oh, dear!

303
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,404
Oh, no!

304
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,918
How can this be?

305
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,357
I like you!

306
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,900
I said, I like you!

307
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,757
I like you!

308
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,259
I said, I like you!

309
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,267
Gosh.

310
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,854
What a crazy dream.

311
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,982
Of course, that was a dream.

312
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,442
What else could it be?

313
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,246
No, this cannot be.

314
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,874
No way.

315
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,188
She is the daughter
of the depraved mother.

316
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,397
I heard about it, too.

317
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,150
A daughter and a mother fought
over a man at the kisaeng house.

318
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,779
I heard it was a total mess.

319
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,739
Really?

320
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,498
Repeat after me one more time.

321
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,542
-Sister.
-Sister.

322
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,836
Good.

323
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,298
You must call me that here, okay?

324
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,592
Of course. Don't you worry.

325
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,970
Brother, do you have any more of this?

326
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,933
No! You cannot call me that!

327
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,601
Again.

328
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,937
What do you have to call me?
I just taught you.

329
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,396
Then...

330
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,523
Honey?

331
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,399
No!

332
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,778
I told you, call me Sister!

333
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:25,615
Why should I call you Sister?

334
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,078
I told you that I have something to do
outside the island.

335
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,872
Oh, my. Was that becoming a sister?

336
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,666
No...

337
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,046
Aeng-du, if people here find out
that I am a man,

338
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,298
I will get executed immediately.

339
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,343
No! You cannot die.

340
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,513
Exactly! That is why you need to help me.

341
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,806
-Yes.
-All right.

342
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,307
Repeat after me one more time.

343
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,517
Sister.

344
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,437
Sister.

345
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,190
Nonsense.

346
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,942
Seriously.

347
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,988
You are crazy.

348
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,656
Stop it.

349
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,825
I had no other choice.

350
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,828
So, this is where their boss is?

351
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,663
In this village full of widows?

352
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,792
Yes, so I cannot go back right now.

353
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,295
Look at you.
You are wearing women's clothes.

354
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,798
There is no way I am going back
before I beat up their boss.

355
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,468
What about Father and Hwang-tae?

356
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,305
How many times do I need to tell you?

357
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,308
They are well. Hwang-tae is recovering.

358
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,269
And I even sent them a message,

359
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,187
saying that I will return safely with you.

360
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,439
So, do not worry.

361
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,441
And you say,

362
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,655
your "daughter" knows that you are a man?

363
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,951
Yesterday, she said, "I like you!"

364
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,705
Was she talking about you
or that man who looks like a stray cat?

365
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,459
What do you think?

366
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,754
If it was for you,

367
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,799
that girl has a terrible taste in men.

368
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,259
Seriously?

369
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,512
She was just drunk-talking.

370
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,014
Sure.

371
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,271
Master, please wait.

372
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,274
My lord!

373
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,446
My lord! Wait for me!

374
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,157
How could it be?

375
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,751
My lord!

376
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,129
-How?
-Wait!

377
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,593
My lord!

378
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,180
Why?

379
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,058
Why not me?

380
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,733
That woman is insane.

381
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:12,865
My lord!

382
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,742
Please come here.

383
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,536
My lord.

384
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,123
Please, just come here.

385
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,215
Lord Cha.

386
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,717
Was it when I gave you

387
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,845
the persimmon shaved ice?

388
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,346
Pardon?

389
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,141
Was it when I gave you the sweets?
Or was it...

390
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,852
when we rode the horse together?

391
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,564
It does not matter
when you fell in love with me.

392
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:30,985
You know very well who I am in love with.

393
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,988
-In love?
-Yes.

394
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:38,284
To me, you are a friend,

395
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,537
no, the mother of the woman I love.

396
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,291
So please, see me as nothing more
than that.

397
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,711
What do you love so much about Dong-ju?

398
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,631
Sorry? Well...

399
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,133
I am in love,
so I love everything about her.

400
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,011
It is not simply one thing about her
that made me fall in love with her.

401
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:04,769
Then how can you tell
when you are in love?

402
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,233
How can you not know?

403
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,194
You miss them when they are not around,
and you are happy to see them.

404
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,988
You worry about everything
when it comes to them.

405
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:20,868
Love is like a cough.
You cannot hold it back.

406
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,413
-Like a cough?
-Yes.

407
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,418
You kissed me on the lips
in front of everyone.

408
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:36,467
You did that because you could not hold in
the love you have for me.

409
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:40,429
Right, sure.

410
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,183
How can you act as if
you have never loved someone?

411
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,352
What? What do you mean?

412
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,021
I have! Many times.

413
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,481
Sure.

414
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,650
Anyway,

415
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,027
your feelings for me--

416
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,404
I will give up on you.

417
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,990
Sorry?

418
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:02,160
I sincerely apologize for everything.

419
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,203
Please do not mind me from now on.

420
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,924
Like a cough?

421
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,900
My gosh. Seriously?

422
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,933
I was wondering where you were.

423
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,396
Did you just laugh?

424
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,567
I just...

425
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,990
Have you had dinner?

426
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,035
You have no idea
how people are treating me!

427
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,287
How can you laugh and ask
if I have had my dinner?

428
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,083
You just look like you starved all day.

429
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,210
Why did you kiss him there?

430
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,004
Are you insane? Was that the only way?

431
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,924
You could have flipped the table over
or stopped the kid from talking.

432
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,926
Or, you could have smacked me.

433
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,056
And what is up with that kid?

434
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,892
Why did she call you, "Honey"?

435
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,936
Well,

436
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,357
she used to live next door
and she thinks we are engaged.

437
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,111
That is obviously not true,
but it is complicated.

438
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,865
Engaged?

439
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,660
You have a mistress and you are engaged?

440
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,954
What a man.

441
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,832
Why are you looking at me like that?

442
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,128
-Let me ask you a question.
-What?

443
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,381
Who is it? The man you are in love with.

444
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,431
They say you cannot hide your feelings.

445
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,725
Either I am too dumb or you are too smart.

446
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,560
I cannot read your mind at all.

447
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,980
But I am really curious.

448
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,607
You lunatic.

449
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,235
That was just me drunk-talking.

450
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,903
I know your drinking habit already.

451
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,282
Who do you think it is?

452
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,284
You think I would have feelings

453
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,661
for a scamp who has a mistress
and is engaged?

454
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,296
You are right.

455
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,096
Okay. Let us head back.

456
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,890
You go. I am not going with you.

457
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,281
Why is he curious?

458
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,376
My goodness!

459
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,384
Right. There is no way
it could have been me.

460
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,719
Of course not.

461
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,138
It is not like I asked
because I had feelings for her.

462
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,309
I just wanted to know
why she said weird stuff.

463
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,144
How ridiculous.

464
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,189
Brother... No.

465
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,150
Sister?

466
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,864
What are you doing, muttering to yourself
this early in the morning?

467
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,534
What?

468
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,494
Morning?

469
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,458
She stayed out all night?

470
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,377
All night?

471
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,850
My back is so sore.

472
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,074
Why am I even doing this?

473
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,451
I am being nice, honey.

474
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,954
How loving.

475
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,749
Aeng-du, what did I say will happen
if you call me that?

476
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,543
You die.

477
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,589
Kid, do you even know
what getting married means?

478
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,840
Of course.

479
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,927
You eat three meals a day together,
play together,

480
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,845
and stay together all the time.

481
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,555
Precisely.

482
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,557
It is a lifelong commitment,

483
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,144
so you must meet a warm
and kindhearted man in the future.

484
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,145
When you grow up!

485
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,482
You cannot marry some scamp.

486
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,402
This one here is not too bad.

487
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,404
Why you little...

488
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,657
Aeng-du, here.

489
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,076
-Enjoy.
-Okay.

490
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,949
Is she not coming home tonight again?

491
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,162
Let me go! How dare you!

492
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,205
-Let me go!
-My Queen!

493
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,713
I do not know these people.

494
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,257
Curse His Majesty?

495
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,759
Revolt against His Majesty?

496
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,469
Let me go!

497
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,429
I am the Queen Dowager of this country.

498
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,514
His Majesty ordered us
to escort you to the West Palace.

499
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,599
Go!

500
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,268
I want to see the Grand Prince.

501
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,438
My child!

502
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,946
No!

503
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,783
Please allow me to see His Majesty.

504
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,077
I am begging you!

505
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,704
Your Majesty!

506
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,248
Mother!

507
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,043
Mother!

508
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,628
Will this be okay?

509
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:38,384
People against this
will come after you, my lord.

510
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,178
Every decision has its consequences.

511
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,974
I will take care of it, so do not worry.

512
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:53,834
Darn.

513
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,044
It hurts.

514
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,381
I cannot sleep like this anymore.

515
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,717
Right.

516
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,094
Why should I sleep outside
when I have a room?

517
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,156
How could this happen
while you were absent?

518
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,700
His Majesty purposely waited
until I was gone.

519
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,495
He is suspecting me
because of what happened on the island.

520
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,456
Island?

521
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,003
I will get going first.

522
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,297
You go and borrow a horse
from the kisaeng house and follow me.

523
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:41,924
Yes, my lord.

524
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,891
Then, was he the one who tried to kill us?

525
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,393
But His Majesty?

526
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,438
Why is His Majesty involved
in what happened to us?

527
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,783
20 YEARS AGO
A SMALL TOWN IN GYEONGGI PROVINCE

528
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,035
Why did you have to be born

529
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,745
on the 19th of November?

530
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,957
Why does it have to be today?

531
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,640
Your Majesty,

532
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,934
how can this tragedy happen?

533
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,769
What happened today

534
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,147
never happened.

535
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,943
The dead prince was

536
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,321
carried by Jung Yun-jeo.

537
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,451
The two of them never existed.

538
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,422
Leave.

539
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,674
I will say the baby died,
and you buried him.

540
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:10,095
And that you fell into the water
after I stabbed you.

541
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,764
So live like you do not exist.

542
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,559
Like you do not exist.

543
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,394
Mom.

544
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,564
Dad will soon be here with the medicine.

545
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,982
Hang in there just a little longer.

546
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,651
-Excuse me. Where is the drugstore?
-Go that way.

547
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,239
Are you not Jung Yun-jeo?

548
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,575
You were probably mistaken.

549
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,369
Yun-jeo died during the war.

550
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,789
His Majesty actually seemed very happy
to hear about him.

551
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,796
Go visit the Muwol Corps.

552
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,715
There is someone I must kill
as soon as possible.

553
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,426
-Sorry?
-His Majesty will make a move.

554
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:53,388
We must get on it before he does.

555
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,140
Yes, my lord.

556
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,686
If he finds out first,

557
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,522
our plan is over.

558
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,820
Who is he

559
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:10,906
and why is His Majesty involved?

560
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,325
What is happening?

561
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:04,584
I can light the candles for you.
I am sure it would be fine.

562
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,169
No.

563
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,880
We must obey the rules here.

564
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:14,052
Why are you so scared of the dark?

565
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,221
I never said I was afraid.

566
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,061
I told you not to.

567
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,773
It is fine as long as they cannot see
from the outside.

568
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,399
What do you think?

569
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,777
Even ghosts with good eyes
will pass by our house.

570
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,989
Now, stop whimpering and go to sleep.
You are so loud.

571
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,246
What? Why?

572
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,748
Go to sleep.

573
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,876
Stop being nice to me.

574
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,799
Why not?

575
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,426
-This is--
-Can only lovers do this to each other?

576
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,682
Only those who care and worry
about each other?

577
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,062
Right.

578
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,815
Like you and your mistress.

579
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,282
I cannot hide it anymore.

580
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:02,369
-I actually do not--
-I am going to sleep.

581
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:30,730
Love is like a cough.
You cannot hold it back.

582
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,693
I am in trouble.

583
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,894
I told myself
I would not do anything pointless.

584
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,274
I am not going to.

585
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,153
I cannot.

586
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,801
-Goodness.
-How do I look?

587
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,054
Here it goes!

588
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,059
Is it done?

589
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,147
-It looks good.
-Does it?

590
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,732
You look beautiful.

591
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,364
Is today a special day?

592
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,698
How do you not know?

593
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,450
It is Dano today.

594
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,787
It is Dano!

595
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:10,914
Dano?

596
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,416
What do you do on Dano here?

597
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,502
It is all the same.

598
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,836
We pick mugwort and motherwort.

599
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,963
-We pick.
-We pick.

600
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,631
We wash our hair with calamus water.

601
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:20,840
-We wash.
-We wash.

602
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,969
And young men and women have a blast

603
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,096
-at the market!
-At the market!

604
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,976
-They have a blast?
-You know,

605
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,062
men and women fall in love by the swings

606
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,730
and share their feelings.

607
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,443
That is completely irrelevant
to us, though.

608
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,071
I see.

609
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,614
Still...

610
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:48,910
-Dano, today is Dano!
-Dano, today is Dano!

611
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:49,869
Aeng-du!

612
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:50,912
-It is Dano!
-It is Dano!

613
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,630
I hear that it is Dano today.

614
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:03,967
Yes, I know.

615
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,011
Let us go to the market
and ride the swing later.

616
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,846
I have something to tell you.

617
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,729
I do not want to hear it.

618
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,359
Why not?

619
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,486
Because it is pointless.

620
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:29,534
Do you know what I am going to say to you?

621
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,120
I do. It is obvious.

622
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:35,915
But

623
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,378
you do not want to hear it

624
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,382
because of Cha Yul-mu?

625
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,554
Yes.

626
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,371
Here.

627
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,960
Make sure you eat it slowly.

628
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,480
You can eat more?

629
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,234
I am far from being full.

630
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:28,945
Sure.

631
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,031
Eat until you are full. Here.

632
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,494
Can you pack some for me?

633
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,998
My brother loves this.

634
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,668
-Your brother?
-Yes, my brother.

635
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,087
I mean, my sister!

636
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,591
Your sister?

637
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,136
Yes, my sister.

638
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,066
Do not be so heartbroken.

639
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,527
It is not over yet.

640
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,197
-You still have a chance.
-Is it

641
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,950
-really not over yet?
-Of course.

642
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,745
Otherwise, we would not drink with you.

643
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:22,123
Are you giving up
when nothing has been confirmed yet?

644
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,750
You are right.

645
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,463
Nothing has been confirmed yet.

646
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,256
But if I give up just because
I am told not to,

647
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,549
what good is that?

648
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,975
What is she saying?

649
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,228
Get up, everyone.

650
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,813
Let us go wash our hair
with calamus water.

651
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:49,025
No, I should go home.

652
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,276
Come with us.

653
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,196
Nobody is here
since everyone is in the hills.

654
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,991
BREWERY

655
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,370
Walk straight.

656
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,122
I am walking straight!

657
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,167
What is she doing?

658
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:07,919
Watch me.

659
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,837
I can walk straight.

660
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,389
I swear I was walking straight.

661
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,237
What happened to you?

662
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,406
I fell.

663
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,825
I am going to take a bath.

664
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,145
Who are you?

665
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,981
I am sorry about that.

666
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,649
Lady Kim!

667
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,027
He is giving these to you

668
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,446
as your birthday gift.

669
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,437
Can you go alone from here?

670
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,648
I cannot enter because I am a man.

671
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,566
You too?

672
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:58,154
Why do they not let men in?

673
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,991
It makes sense
as it is a village for widows.

674
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:06,663
That is why I can barely see my father

675
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,750
and my brother has become my sister...

676
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:25,431
I do not have a mistress whom I love.

677
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,645
What? Then the mistress you mentioned...

678
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,484
You lied to me?

679
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,405
-Yes.
-Then why are you telling the truth now?

680
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,326
Because I love you. That is why.

681
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,916
I told you.

682
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,334
I...

683
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,216
You do not like that man.

684
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,343
You say that you do,

685
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,970
and it makes sense that you do.

686
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:06,723
But I do not believe it.

687
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:09,475
What?

688
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,396
One cannot hide love.

689
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:16,566
Indeed, I could not hide it.

690
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,778
But you never coughed in front of him.

691
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,616
-What are you saying?
-He looks at you,

692
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,745
but you do not look at him.

693
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,456
You look at me.

694
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,709
Am I wrong?

695
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:40,840
I do not want to answer.

696
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,635
Why do you keep asking me
weird questions like that?

697
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,637
You have no idea.

698
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,643
You are right. I do not know anything.

699
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:54,979
So...

700
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,048
So, you answer me.

701
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,736
Are you going somewhere far away?

702
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,698
-Someone is having a 60th birthday party.
-We are going to make a scene.

703
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:32,493
But he will never expect them to be
the working ladies there.

704
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,120
It is urgent.

705
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,455
Find Ssuk and tell her
we fell into a trap.

706
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,381
-It is hot!
-Lady Kim?

707
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:46,883
Our boss sent me here.

708
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,720
You must be up to something again.

709
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:52,805
It has been a while.

710
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,309
I can leave now.

711
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,477
Do not go, please!

712
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,938
-I told you not to be so clingy.
-I am going to be clingy.

713
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:03,065
So please, do not go.

714
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,985
