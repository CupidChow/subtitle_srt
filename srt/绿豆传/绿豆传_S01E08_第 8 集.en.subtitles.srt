1
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,962
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,964
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,478
Dong-ju.

4
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,022
Stop!

5
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,482
Stop that right now!

6
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,116
Nok-du.

7
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,687
I will take Dong-ju.

8
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,527
These punks...

9
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,987
seem to know you.

10
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,405
That is why

11
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,659
it will be safe for her to leave with me.

12
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,244
Cut the crap and get out of my way.

13
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,871
Unless you want to die.

14
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,081
If I leave, Dong-ju will die.

15
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,417
Is that what you want?

16
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,878
What is going on?

17
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,964
What...

18
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,098
Kill the widows!

19
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,434
Capture the kisaengs alive!

20
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,146
Let us go!

21
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,109
Over there! Let us go!

22
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,914
My gosh, ladies.

23
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,835
I want you to get lost!

24
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,253
Go!

25
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,588
My goodness.

26
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,967
I would appreciate it if you guys left.

27
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,511
Goodness.

28
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,515
I threw it by accident.

29
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,907
No.

30
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,960
Come here!

31
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,472
Go! Run!

32
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,643
You bitch!

33
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,288
Hwa-su!

34
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,125
Madam...

35
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,004
Are you okay?

36
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,634
You should go to the widow village.

37
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,809
You are okay now.

38
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,956
Dong-ju.

39
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,951
I will bring a doctor.

40
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,129
My goodness.

41
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,133
Oh, gosh.

42
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,012
I caught you.

43
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,478
What is going on? My goodness.

44
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,647
This place is a complete mess.

45
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,649
Can you take her for a moment?

46
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,986
You will get hurt, so wait over there.

47
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,070
He is so drunk.

48
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,199
You will get hurt. Leave it to me.

49
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,993
No way. I will fight them.

50
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,833
This old man must be too drunk.
He cannot think properly.

51
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,677
My gosh.

52
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,013
Watch your head!

53
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,774
Go get him!

54
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,779
My goodness.

55
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,698
I am dizzy now that
I have used some strength.

56
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,701
By the way, where is Nok...

57
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,913
Where is Nok-sun?

58
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,416
Nok-sun?

59
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,553
Get up, Mal-nyeon.

60
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,133
These women are very brave.

61
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,594
Okay then.

62
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,764
Whom should I fight first?

63
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,147
Me.

64
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,234
What? Is he here alone?

65
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,377
Start with me first.

66
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,674
Who is this jerk?

67
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,209
My goodness, look at this mess.

68
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,012
Are you okay?

69
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,354
Thank you for helping us.

70
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,567
-But--
-You seem very familiar.

71
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,655
My goodness, brother...

72
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,324
Sister!

73
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,620
Did you get caught?

74
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,581
Did they find out
you pretended to be a woman?

75
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,126
He just got caught because of you.
You are such a fool.

76
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,003
Aeng-du, stop.

77
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,299
Even so, how could you
beat him up like this?

78
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,220
You are so mean! You are one scary woman!

79
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,388
My goodness. Aeng-du.

80
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,599
Come this way.

81
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,359
You are Lady Kim.

82
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,778
Are you not?

83
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,543
No way.

84
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,337
That cannot be.

85
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,506
A man?

86
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,343
Lady Kim cannot be a man! My...

87
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:13,269
So you are a man
who pretended to be a woman?

88
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,272
Unbelievable. We even bathed together.

89
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,819
But does he not look like the man
who trespassed our village last time?

90
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:29,118
Why did you disguise yourself as a woman
and approach us?

91
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,497
My family and I lived on an island,
and we were attacked there.

92
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:38,794
I needed to know why they wanted us dead.

93
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,843
I apologize for the trouble I have caused.

94
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,469
Nok-du!

95
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,431
Nok-du!

96
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,449
I am sorry.

97
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,826
You went through the trouble
because of me.

98
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,662
I thought you were dead.

99
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,457
I was so worried you might be dead.

100
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,792
Why would I be dead?

101
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,128
Look at me.

102
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,172
I am...

103
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,218
Nok-du.

104
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,388
-My goodness.
-Nok-du!

105
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,393
His Majesty will not be able
to find anything in the village.

106
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,312
Everything burned in the fire.

107
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,522
And the surviving widows all ran away.

108
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,484
She disappeared without a word

109
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,486
while I went to get medicine?

110
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,572
I apologize.
I should have gotten there earlier.

111
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,157
No.

112
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,661
I was the one who said
neither of us should be seen.

113
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,830
Dan-ho.

114
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,041
About that guy...

115
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,296
I cannot let him live anymore.

116
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,174
I understand. I will find and kill him.

117
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,928
Before you do,

118
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,598
there is one more thing
we need to take care of.

119
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,538
If you keep going this way,

120
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,499
you will be able to reach the ferry
without being seen.

121
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,336
Once you get there,
you will need to move individually.

122
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,547
We have nowhere to go.

123
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,133
The bandits are all dead.

124
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,301
And we can always build a new village.

125
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,012
So do not tell us to leave.

126
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,640
You need to go as far as you can.

127
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,352
We will escort the widows.

128
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,985
I wanted to help you live in a world

129
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,696
where you do not have to hide

130
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,950
or be scared just because you are women.

131
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,996
I am sorry

132
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,792
that I cannot stay with you
to keep that promise.

133
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,632
We are only saying goodbye
for a short moment.

134
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,386
We can always meet again
and create a better world.

135
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,391
Yes.

136
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,353
I am sure someone
will make that happen one day.

137
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,482
Do not lose hope.

138
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,027
Please stay alive until the very end.

139
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,696
We will.

140
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,283
I hope we meet again, Madam Chun.

141
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,291
You must go now.

142
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,168
Go.

143
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,216
Go on.

144
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,818
I took all the kisaengs
to the government office.

145
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,778
Okay.

146
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,572
They are all beautiful and talented.

147
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,491
So they will do well wherever they go.

148
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,119
Lady Kim...

149
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,830
I mean, that man...

150
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,583
-What happened to--
-He is resting in Songchugol.

151
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,585
He is...

152
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,462
severely wounded.

153
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,632
I am furious that he fooled us
by pretending to be a woman,

154
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,093
but had he not risk his life
to save the village--

155
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,011
He must have grown on you.

156
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:02,975
I have never seen you
take anyone's side like this.

157
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,063
-No, it is just that--
-At this point,

158
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:13,068
I no longer have the power
to do anything to anyone.

159
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,781
Where are you planning to go?

160
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,953
I will do whatever I can
until the very end.

161
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,291
I will go to Hanyang and meet Lord Heo.

162
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,502
So you should hurry up
and go with the others.

163
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,545
I swore

164
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,007
to always be by your side.

165
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,970
Wait here. I will bring a horse.

166
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,858
I do not know
where the surviving widows went.

167
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,861
And he could have killed me last night.

168
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,614
But he told me he will let me go
as a warning.

169
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,574
Prince Neungyang, that little...

170
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,077
His Majesty will soon hear
about the widow village.

171
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,828
So please hold your anger for now.

172
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,002
You should go get some rest.

173
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,963
Yes, my lord.

174
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,720
Why did you try to kill my family?

175
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,806
Who am I?

176
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,642
He might be

177
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,436
our new solution to the problem.

178
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,265
It will be useless to keep running away.

179
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,516
Just jump off the cliff.

180
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,103
Then we will say you killed yourself
to keep your chastity.

181
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,303
Why did you look down the cliff?

182
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,514
Your life is what you should protect,
not your chastity.

183
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,896
Come with me. And keep your chin up.

184
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,122
Who was that?

185
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,083
-Catch him!
-Yes, master!

186
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,336
This way.

187
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,744
Madam Chun.

188
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,130
I did not want her to have
a lonely funeral,

189
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,924
so I called you here
despite your bad condition.

190
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,595
Was it the bandits' doing?

191
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,016
How... How could she just die like this?

192
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,061
Madam Chun!

193
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,647
Whoever it was,

194
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,108
I will find and kill him

195
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,485
at all costs.

196
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,621
I thought you left.

197
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,500
I had a dream

198
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,712
-where you left me all alone--
-What a silly dream.

199
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,133
I am not going anywhere,
so get some more sleep.

200
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,469
No.

201
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,588
You should not be moving yet.

202
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,009
You punk.

203
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,928
What in the world...

204
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,432
-Where is Dong-ju?
-What?

205
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,602
Well, the thing is...

206
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,981
My gosh.

207
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,651
You really should not be moving.

208
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,656
That punk.

209
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,575
You have been coming out here for days.
You are not well yet.

210
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,120
She will not come back.
She was determined to leave.

211
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,376
I am not waiting for her.

212
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,253
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

213
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,840
It looks like you are crying.

214
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,429
It is because the air is cold.

215
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,767
It is always hard
to get over your first love.

216
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,561
How could she leave without a word?

217
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,481
She said she was worried
I might have died.

218
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,608
But she just left.

219
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,198
By the way, about Madam Chun...

220
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,785
What about her?

221
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,037
While she was running away,

222
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,957
she got attacked.

223
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,460
My goodness.

224
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,005
She was properly buried.

225
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,593
The vice-curator asked me
to keep it a secret until you got better.

226
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,470
Are you okay?

227
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,100
I need to go.

228
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,935
Yes, it is cold. Let us go back.

229
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,312
-Hanyang.
-What? "Hanyang"?

230
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,357
You still need to rest.

231
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,067
There is something
I have not told her yet.

232
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,782
My goodness.

233
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,411
I am going to leave.

234
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,496
What are you talking about?

235
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,249
You did not sleep properly
for the past couple of days.

236
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,917
I need to leave.

237
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,170
That is why

238
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,756
I am staying by his side until I do.

239
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,633
I will see him as much as I want

240
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,802
and stay right next to him.

241
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,890
Nok-du will not know.

242
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,517
I will be gone soon.

243
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,519
You are going to leave him

244
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,563
when he is lying sick in bed?

245
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,732
I will not be able to leave

246
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,693
once he wakes up.

247
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,613
My goodness.

248
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,615
Please do not tell him

249
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,326
that I had a hard time leaving.

250
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,747
Just tell him

251
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,249
that I left without hesitation.

252
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,169
My gosh.

253
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,682
Is he hurt because he does not know?

254
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,478
Will it hurt him even more if I tell him?

255
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,183
They are gone?

256
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,435
You could not find those bandits
who attacked the village.

257
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,979
You could not find any survivors.

258
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,731
Then the witness I had
ordered you to bring got killed.

259
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,150
But you could not even find
who killed her?

260
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,949
What do you know?

261
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,118
What can you do?

262
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,911
Tell me! What am I supposed to do?

263
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:12,954
Well...

264
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,124
The thing is, the madam who got killed
was at Lord Heo's place

265
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,917
the day the village was attacked.

266
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,512
Was it Yun again?

267
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,194
Have you still not heard about Dong-ju?

268
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,197
No, but I am doing my best to find her.

269
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,950
You must find her no matter what.

270
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,369
If she refuses to follow you,

271
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,623
do what you can to make her listen.

272
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,420
And if he happens to be with her,
just kill him.

273
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,380
Okay, my lord.

274
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,428
She is so good at this.

275
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,680
Her brushstrokes already feel different.

276
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,227
How much is this?

277
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,939
You can have it for just one nyang.

278
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,065
Really?

279
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,985
But how will you make a living
if you sell things at such a low price?

280
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,404
Well...

281
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,491
I could use a little bit of help
from you ladies.

282
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,702
By any chance, would there be
a job for me in the palace?

283
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,723
What?

284
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,852
Until when do you plan to follow us?

285
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,022
He is right.
You offered to come with us to Hanyang.

286
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,691
But you can go now.

287
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,736
Do you have a place to stay?

288
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,864
We will find a place.

289
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,700
You may leave now.

290
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,414
Why is he

291
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:23,126
still looking at you
with such affection in his eyes?

292
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,460
What?

293
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,212
I know, right?

294
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:30,091
He even sat right next to you last night
while you were asleep.

295
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,843
"No.

296
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,095
It cannot be true."

297
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,182
-He kept saying that.
-That is nonsense.

298
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,809
He knows I am a man now.

299
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,148
What do you want?

300
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:59,287
So you want to help us settle in Hanyang?

301
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,664
What?

302
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,916
Do you think I am doing this for you?

303
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,168
Not at all.

304
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,878
It is because I am worried

305
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,630
about this old man and his young daughter.

306
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,510
Right? We are pretty close now.
Do you not agree?

307
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,138
I think of you as my family.

308
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,600
From now on,
I will think of you as my brother.

309
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,435
Okay.

310
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,939
That would be too much.

311
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,983
You may be interrogated

312
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,195
for what happened in the widow village.

313
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,780
Well...

314
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,575
I am ready to face anything.

315
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,660
You think I am scared of punishment?

316
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,705
A true man should not be afraid
if that is what he deserves.

317
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,711
Anyway, Hanyang is no easy place
to live in.

318
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,256
I am worried newbies like you
might get into trouble.

319
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,925
I mean, I am not exactly worried.

320
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,386
But just do as I say.

321
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,014
I will make you pay for everything
including the interest.

322
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,351
Now, let us go.

323
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,521
-Go where?
-To get you a place to live.

324
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,730
Actually, never mind.

325
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,025
Your clothes are so tacky.
Let us get you some nice clothes first.

326
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,072
Are you not done yet?

327
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,242
This is so nice and slippery.
Even a fly would slip on this.

328
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,870
I am getting tired of waiting.

329
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,272
You are still very beautiful.

330
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,107
-Beautiful.
-What?

331
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,568
I mean, your overall appearance.

332
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,655
It means you finally look like a person
who lives in Hanyang.

333
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,781
But not quite enough.

334
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,950
But is it okay for you to spend so much--

335
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,910
I am great in many ways,

336
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,621
but I am especially very rich.
I have a lot of money.

337
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,582
-So do not worry.
-Is that so?

338
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,878
My goodness. You have such a homely face.

339
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,462
So I had no idea.

340
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,299
But I do not need to wear

341
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,593
something so fancy.

342
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,054
You are now my cousin
who left Hanyang a very long time ago.

343
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,764
You moved to the countryside

344
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,142
before you turned ten
because you were not very healthy.

345
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,269
And after that, we both lost touch.

346
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,521
Let us say you finally came back.

347
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,148
What do you say?

348
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,109
You were hiding at the widow village
disguised as a woman,

349
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,111
so I guess you cannot be honest
about your identity.

350
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,614
Will this not be troubling you?

351
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,618
If it had not been for you people,
I would have died at the widow village.

352
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,994
This is nothing compared to that.

353
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:51,125
From now on, your name is Yeon Su,
a member of the Yeon family.

354
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,128
"Yeon Su."

355
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,048
Okay then. Let us get you a place to live.

356
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:32,875
That heartless...

357
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,689
Until when are you going to be
on that swing?

358
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,326
-What did you say?
-I have been waiting.

359
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,287
For the swing?

360
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,414
Yes.

361
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,169
You want to go on the swing?

362
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,762
I only just sat down.

363
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,268
Well then...

364
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,062
I will just wait a bit longer.

365
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,196
Something seems to be on your mind.

366
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,034
Yes, there is.

367
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,121
May I ask you what it is?

368
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,626
There is something I must find out

369
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,962
but do not wish to find out
at the same time.

370
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,840
And I am scared I might actually find out.

371
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,220
The same thing worries me.

372
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,849
So are you going to run away?

373
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,984
No, I should go and face it.

374
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:25,946
By any chance,

375
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,326
have we ever met before?

376
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,413
I am not sure.

377
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,710
I hope we meet again.

378
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,129
If our fate allows it.

379
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,937
He seems oddly familiar.

380
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,181
I am here for the answer
I did not get to hear last time.

381
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,268
Follow me.

382
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,162
-Father.
-Nok-du.

383
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,497
Nok-du.

384
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,041
-Father.
-Nok-du.

385
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,312
You must have gone through a lot.

386
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,231
Father.

387
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,276
What are you doing here?

388
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,903
Were you locked up here?

389
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,698
No, Yun is an old friend of mine.

390
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,452
He will no longer try to harm us,
so do not worry.

391
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,371
"An old friend"?

392
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,585
Why did your friend try to kill us?

393
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,422
And why is he suddenly
not going to harm us anymore?

394
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:50,966
By any chance,

395
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,054
am I...

396
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,183
Do not say anything. Do not ask anything.

397
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,978
I hated Mom so much.

398
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,107
She only cared about Hwang-tae
no matter what I did.

399
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,363
Come with me.
Let us find your brother and leave.

400
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,406
She always seemed so empty inside.

401
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,909
Then she passed away
without even getting treated.

402
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,955
So how could you expect me
not to ask any questions? How?

403
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,503
Who am I?

404
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,298
Who am I?

405
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,182
No, I should go and face it.

406
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:44,895
Am I...

407
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,440
His Majesty's...

408
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,485
son?

409
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,781
Whatever you were told is not true.

410
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,157
You are...

411
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,577
You are my son.

412
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,214
No one is going to tell me

413
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,175
the real truth, right?

414
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,886
You

415
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,431
nor your old friend.

416
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,975
-Nok-du.
-I will come back.

417
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,518
Where are you going?

418
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,604
I am going to set things right.

419
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,231
And I am going to make sure

420
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,026
you and Hwang-tae can live honorably.

421
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,529
I hope you stay healthy.

422
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,489
Do not go, Nok-du.

423
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,825
-Nok-du, please.
-Let me go!

424
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,785
Nok-du!

425
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,920
You cannot go anywhere.

426
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,548
I advise you to quietly follow me.

427
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:55,924
No.

428
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,779
How much does Nok-du know?

429
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,823
How much do you know?

430
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,868
Why do you think His Majesty

431
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,497
wanted to get rid of his son so badly
20 years ago?

432
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,417
Why do you think he even abandoned you,
his friend?

433
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:32,020
INN

434
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,720
Your Majesty.

435
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:35,292
Your Majesty!

436
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:47,095
Your Majesty!

437
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,770
My goodness.

438
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:07,866
My gosh.

439
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,702
-You startled me, you punk.
-Master.

440
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,996
I must enter the palace.

441
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,542
I must find out myself.

442
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,683
Were you the only one
who survived that night?

443
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,367
I was the only one
who was still alive that night.

444
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,037
Therefore, I was the only one

445
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,542
who survived that night.

446
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,801
If this turns out to be a lie,

447
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,053
I will find you

448
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,432
and kill you myself.

449
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,738
Keep an eye on both of them,
and make sure they do not go anywhere.

450
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:28,864
Yes, Your Majesty.

451
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,851
You guys do not like the nest either,
do you?

452
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:02,064
The one Dong-ju made
was a lot more sturdy.

453
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,901
So what if she has good craftsmanship?

454
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,487
She has no sense of responsibility.
That heartless...

455
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,030
Yes, of course.

456
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,449
These are very hard to get.

457
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,285
But I should keep my word
since I made you a promise.

458
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,623
I heard you can have porcelain skin
by washing your face with this.

459
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,751
Here. You ladies should try it.

460
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,545
Thank you.

461
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,508
If you are bribing us
to get a job in the palace--

462
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:31,385
Yes, that is exactly what I am doing.

463
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,011
So can you please...

464
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,055
I should go.

465
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,350
No, wait. I can do anything you ask.

466
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,937
Thank you very much.

467
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,068
My gosh, those brats.

468
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,987
It will be faster
to climb over the palace walls.

469
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,864
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

470
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,159
Hello, my lord. How can I help you?

471
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,620
I am going to take
the military service exam,

472
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,455
and I need a bow to practice with.

473
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,542
I also need different types of arrowheads.

474
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,669
Okay, my lord. Let me see.

475
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,130
This will be an adequate bow for practice.

476
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:12,342
And as for the arrowheads,
there are bakdujeon, yukryangjeon--

477
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:16,555
By the way, do you remember the man
who came here to buy magnetite?

478
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,058
He was short, petite, and had fair skin.

479
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,435
Magnetite?

480
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,438
Oh, the pretty-looking man?

481
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,441
Yes, that is right.
Did he happen to visit recently?

482
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,776
No, that was the last time he came.

483
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,362
He comes here occasionally.

484
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,990
But he always came consistently,
so I am sure he will come back soon.

485
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,742
There.

486
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,286
-There we go.
-I think that will do

487
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,663
for today.

488
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,624
I will come back for the rest
tomorrow and the day after.

489
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,793
What? Would that not be too bothersome?

490
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,137
Should we go on the swing?

491
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,140
What are you? A kid?

492
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,142
Why? What is wrong with that?

493
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,687
We just need to go before sunset.

494
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,043
Hey.

495
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,338
Did you rent the swing?

496
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,590
The kids are waiting.

497
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,635
Right.

498
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,428
I apologize.

499
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,097
Let us go on the swing!

500
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,746
He is kind yet indifferent.

501
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,375
My goodness, gracious.

502
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:15,131
Excuse me. I wish to buy some books
for the military service exam.

503
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,092
Go around the corner.

504
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,102
It looks like fate has allowed us
to meet again.

505
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,479
What brings you here?

506
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:34,860
I needed to clear my mind,
but I figured you might be on the swing.

507
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,030
Are you preparing
for the military service exam?

508
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,074
Yes.

509
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,785
I must enter the palace.

510
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,163
I figured I would do better with this
than the civil service exam.

511
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,834
The palace?

512
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,252
Why must you enter?

513
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,548
I wish to meet His Majesty.

514
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,049
His Majesty?

515
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,970
I am guessing it is not for a good cause.

516
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,807
I need to meet him

517
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:12,272
in order to succeed.
I want to be acknowledged by him.

518
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,779
What is your name?

519
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,286
My name is Su from the Yeon family.

520
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,166
Your grandfather used to be
the Chief Royal Secretary.

521
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,669
Yes, that is correct.

522
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,634
Then I should give you something
to wish you good luck.

523
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:44,179
Let us meet again at around 2 p.m.
in five days.

524
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,141
What? Wait.

525
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,329
Are you dumb?
You should have dried your feet first.

526
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,247
I am fine. Let us just go.

527
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,416
You will catch a cold
if your feet are cold.

528
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,960
Do not try to put me through the trouble.

529
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,136
Do not try to put me through the trouble.

530
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,080
I do not even deserve to cry.

531
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:07,679
You told me you can do anything, right?

532
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,472
Pardon?

533
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,935
You want me to find a man?

534
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,147
I waited there every time I go outside,

535
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,482
but I never once saw him.

536
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,194
I know I belong to His Majesty.

537
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,156
But I just wish to talk to him a little.

538
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,743
I mean, he saved me from getting hurt.

539
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,786
So I wish to give him a token of thanks.

540
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:33,830
Right.

541
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:39,335
But this is...
This is practically impossible.

542
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,921
I fired one of the assistants.

543
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,050
What does he look like?

544
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,894
He was wearing a beautiful pink robe

545
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,189
and a luxurious hat string
that was made with amethysts.

546
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,484
He had a chiseled jawline.

547
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,737
And his skin was fairer than most women.

548
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,697
That is not all.

549
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,741
Those sparkling eyes.

550
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,328
His eyes were filled with so much sadness.

551
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,417
My gosh.

552
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,754
He does not even look human.

553
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,672
SPARKLING EYES, SHARP NOSE,
FULL LIPS, SHARP JAWLINE

554
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,007
I can come out again in three days.

555
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,635
Tell him to meet me
by the swing that night.

556
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,804
Of all the things
she could have asked for...

557
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,143
He could be wearing a different robe.

558
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,521
But people rarely change
their hat strings.

559
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,527
This is driving me crazy.
She is coming out tonight.

560
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,279
I need to find him no matter what.

561
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,757
My lord!

562
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,928
My lord, wait.

563
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,434
May I help you?

564
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:22,355
Sparkling eyes. A chiseled jawline.

565
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,816
And he has pretty fair skin.

566
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,277
I think he might be the one.

567
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,822
And pink amethysts.

568
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,450
Are you done observing me?

569
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,619
I apologize.

570
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,124
By any chance, have you visited
the nearby swing a few days ago?

571
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,544
Have I visited the nearby swing
a few days ago?

572
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,964
Yes, I have.

573
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,344
Excuse me, my lord,

574
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,639
but can you wait by the swing
at around 10 p.m. tonight?

575
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,267
A woman wishes to meet you.

576
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,060
Me?

577
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,897
Yes. She means no harm.
She just wants to pay...

578
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,233
She just wishes to talk to you.

579
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,111
-With me?
-Yes.

580
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,281
Can you please wait there?

581
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,991
Please show up at 10 p.m.

582
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,662
I will take that as a yes.

583
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,039
You promised, okay?

584
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,336
My goodness.

585
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,888
I am sorry I kept you waiting.

586
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,519
By the way, your robe...

587
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:47,649
Not only do we have a strong connection,
but we must also have the same taste.

588
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,861
Here. Take this.

589
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:57,242
-What is this?
-Taffy.

590
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,994
I hope you pass the exam.

591
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,665
Thank you, my lord.

592
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,500
I do not know how I am going to repay you.

593
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,168
Repay me by passing the exam.

594
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,547
And do not ignore me once you pass.

595
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,673
Of course.

596
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,679
You should go now. I am sure you are busy
getting ready for the exam.

597
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,055
Okay.

598
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,068
How is Yun doing?

599
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,945
He is as quiet as a mouse.

600
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:38,283
And about Yeon Seok-jeong's grandson
you asked me to look into...

601
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,702
I heard he was very weak.

602
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,205
And therefore, his entire family
moved to the countryside.

603
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,457
And after a while, the family lost touch.

604
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,918
They lost touch?

605
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,169
Yes.

606
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,978
My gosh, I told you to take it easy.

607
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,397
Okay.

608
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:12,900
-What is that?
-This?

609
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,737
They are bellflower roots.
You asked for them.

610
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,448
They are everywhere on the island,
but they are hard to get in Hanyang.

611
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,119
They remind me of your father.

612
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:26,497
He ate them around this time of year
because of his cough. Remember?

613
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,834
But what do you need these for?

614
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,150
Who are you?

615
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,452
Quietly follow me.

616
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,461
Nok-du.

617
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,898
He is wearing a black robe
and has a ripped sleeve.

618
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,775
-Go after him!
-Yes, my lord!

619
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,552
He is coming.

620
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,144
My goodness. Are you serious?

621
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,354
You must be crazy.

622
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,235
No, but... My goodness.

623
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,282
I thought she wanted to meet me.
Why did she just leave?

624
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:25,616
Pardon?

625
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,786
I think I was mistaken.

626
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,539
I do not think you are the man
I was looking for.

627
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,374
Who were you looking for?

628
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,209
Well...

629
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:39,839
It is regarding a woman's affection
toward a man.

630
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,591
So I cannot tell you anything in detail.

631
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,469
Anyway, I am truly sorry.

632
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:47,138
I should go now. I am sorry.

633
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,973
No, wait.

634
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:52,935
-My goodness.
-Your Majesty.

635
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,857
An unknown man came to see Jung Yun-jeo
but ended up running away.

636
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,401
-Did you see his face?
-No, I did not.

637
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,614
But his sleeve got ripped,
and Jung Yun-jeo called him "Nok-du."

638
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,533
-"Nok-du"?
-Yes.

639
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,621
You must catch him no matter what.

640
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,290
-Catch him at all costs.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

641
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,137
Over here!

642
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,685
A strange man ran over there.

643
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,562
-Hurry up and catch him.
-Yes, my lord.

644
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:11,866
You...

645
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,831
-I should go.
-No.

646
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:21,626
You cannot go.

647
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,006
I will try my best to lure them away.

648
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,883
-You should hide here.
-No.

649
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,677
I will not let you leave.

650
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,262
Never again.

651
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:05,920
CERAMICS

652
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,095
Did you just say it was Chancellor Heo?

653
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,930
I will help you take revenge.

654
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:42,433
What do you think
about dethroning His Majesty

655
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,853
and enthroning his son?

656
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,898
You came here on your own will,
but that is not how can you leave.

657
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,777
People in Hanyang
have no sense of morality.

658
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,028
She is mine.

659
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:55,738
She needs to pay me back first.

660
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,823
Are you going to run away again?

661
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,992
He just wants to keep her
right next to him.

662
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,661
They are pretending to be awkward
around each other.

663
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,288
You will be entering the palace?

664
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:05,873
