1
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,745
I am Dong-ju from Yeonhwa House.

2
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,461
You look happy to see me.

3
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,881
And you look appalled at the same time.

4
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,428
How did you get here?

5
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,180
I have something to tell you.

6
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,808
Right now?

7
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,268
Yes.

8
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,896
It is perfect timing.

9
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,440
What is it?

10
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,402
Well,

11
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,864
from today,

12
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,372
I will be

13
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,376
your mother.

14
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,254
You are my...

15
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,255
What?

16
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,055
Mother.

17
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,311
Did I startle you?

18
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,731
Obviously.

19
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,484
I understand.

20
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,237
I look very handsome
in this expensive robe, do I not?

21
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,947
I bet I look extremely charming.

22
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,491
Are you sick? Did you drink?

23
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,119
Why would you be my mother?

24
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,038
And handsome, my foot.

25
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,040
What is going on?

26
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,417
Can you not tell?

27
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,211
You do not need to be a kisaeng anymore.
I know you do not want to.

28
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,173
You do not need to be one.

29
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,850
I guess that is the fate of a kisaeng.

30
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,738
Is there a shortcut to the annex?

31
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,823
Pardon?

32
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,299
I will be her family.

33
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,803
You wish to adopt Dong-ju?

34
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,100
But I do not even know you very well.

35
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,852
How can I trust
that you will take good care of her?

36
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,522
I get why you are worried.

37
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:37,902
So how about I live with Dong-ju
at the widow village?

38
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,822
We will stay near you.

39
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,410
Why are you doing this for her?

40
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,039
I am not sure.

41
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,878
She must have grown on me.

42
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,382
I want to help her
so that she does not need to do

43
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,385
what she does not want to do.

44
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,615
Hey, be my daughter.

45
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,118
My daughter, you are here.

46
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,328
Hey, Dong-ju.

47
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,164
From today, I will be...

48
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,459
I will be...

49
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,176
What is this?

50
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,678
I look too much like a mother.

51
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,529
Why are you doing this for me?

52
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,907
Well...

53
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,203
I need to stay in the widow village.

54
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,039
But you keep trying to kick me out.

55
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,459
That is it?

56
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,586
That is why you paid
that much money to help me?

57
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:22,465
Well, yes. What other reason
would there be?

58
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,804
I need to meet my mistress.

59
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,183
What?

60
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:37,355
Are you worried that I might be a pervert?

61
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,734
If you were a pervert,
you would have used that money on women.

62
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:49,700
Then are you worried I might get caught
and end up in trouble?

63
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,954
Yes, I am worried.

64
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,664
What?

65
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,460
What would they think of me
if you get caught?

66
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,256
They will think I am a crazy woman
who helped an obnoxious jerk.

67
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,674
I will not get caught.

68
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,884
And I will leave as soon as I can.

69
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,928
-So just relax.
-I cannot relax.

70
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,597
This is still weird,
and I still have so many questions.

71
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,686
But...

72
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,234
You helped me quit being a kisaeng,
so I will help you not get caught.

73
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,153
That is enough, right?

74
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,369
No, there is one more thing.

75
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,084
What is it?

76
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,757
DONG DONG-JU, JEON NOK-DU

77
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,801
You need to pay me back.

78
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,267
A promissory note?

79
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,479
The interest is 70 percent?

80
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,940
Hey, you could get arrested
for demanding such a high interest rate.

81
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,195
You should have said that
before you stamped your thumbprint.

82
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,529
Cut the bullshit. Hey.

83
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,031
That contract is invalid.

84
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,532
-It is invalid.
-"Bullshit"?

85
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,575
-Give me that.
-How dare you

86
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,743
talk that way to your mother?

87
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,370
-Cut the nonsense.
-You should have read it thoroughly.

88
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,622
-Gosh, give me that.
-Dong-ju.

89
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,706
Hey, wait.

90
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,918
Dong-ju.

91
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,719
My lord, what brings you here?

92
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,517
You look beautiful.

93
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,437
Why are you here?

94
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,445
Did I startle you?

95
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,697
I am here to take you home.

96
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,950
As for that impudent man...

97
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,593
Lady Kim?

98
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,142
I was wondering where that man had gone.

99
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,435
But I guess he was the one...

100
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,106
Was he not just a jobless bum?

101
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,651
How would I know?

102
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,362
Is he a high ranking government official?

103
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,698
Or is he from a powerful family?

104
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,660
Forget it. It does not matter.

105
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,079
Why does it not matter?

106
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,832
Because I am better looking than him.

107
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,798
Hey, you should go home first.

108
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,842
I need to take care of something.

109
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,635
Take care of what?

110
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,680
Being a mother is not a simple task.

111
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,098
Go on.

112
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,503
I was right. You followed me.

113
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,213
Why did you quit your mission?

114
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,591
I did not quit.
I just postponed it a little.

115
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,136
I figured saving someone
should come before killing someone.

116
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,764
What?

117
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,141
I know it is important
to punish a corrupt aristocrat.

118
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,603
I could not turn a blind eye
on a powerless woman

119
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,313
who was being threatened.

120
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,819
But that was not what you promised us.

121
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,573
So you should have nothing to say
even if I kill you for it.

122
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,327
I saved an innocent life,
so I do not regret it.

123
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,624
You must think I will spare your life.

124
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,502
To be honest,

125
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,879
yes.

126
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,507
What makes you think that?

127
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,717
You are curious about me.

128
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,928
And it would be a waste to just kill me.

129
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,805
Am I wrong?

130
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,812
I guess I will find out with time.

131
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,524
But

132
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,027
if you do anything suspicious,
I will kill you on the spot.

133
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,408
Killing a person like you
is a piece of cake.

134
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,247
Okay. I will keep that in mind.

135
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,960
Did you hate being a kisaeng that much?

136
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,337
I apologize, Madam Chun.

137
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,133
I am so jealous.
You have got yourself a nice mother.

138
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,802
Yes, a nice mother.

139
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,262
I am thrilled.

140
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,101
I even need to write down
who my in-laws are?

141
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,563
It is just a formality.
Just in case anything happens.

142
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,315
You can write it down
right next to your name, Kim Nok-sun.

143
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,198
You are the daughter-in-law
of Lord Park Jong-chil?

144
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,953
No wonder you look so refined and elegant.

145
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,707
My lady, do not forget that I, Geun,

146
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,418
will always be there
right outside these walls.

147
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,171
My daughter, let us get going.

148
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,342
Madam Chun, I will be off now.
I hope you stay healthy.

149
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,179
Thank you.
You did great while you were here.

150
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,268
-Come over often, okay?
-Okay.

151
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,228
Bye.

152
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,735
Feel free to think of me as your father.

153
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,071
I will care for you
like you are my own daughter.

154
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,326
If anything happens to your mother,
let me know, okay?

155
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,287
Make sure to greet me every morning.

156
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,457
Are you kidding me?

157
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,169
That is the only time
you can enter my room.

158
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,755
My gosh, I do not want you
to enter my room either.

159
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,257
Let us just mind our own business.

160
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,760
But where is our house?

161
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,066
Are we supposed to live together
in this tiny room?

162
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,694
And we will share this house
with you three?

163
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,073
Yes. You get to stay close together.

164
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,867
And we live right in front of you,
so you can rest assured.

165
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,078
This is great, is it not?

166
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:53,916
But Madam Chun promised
that she would get us a separate place.

167
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,877
Madam Chun asked us herself.

168
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,380
She thought you might feel awkward
and nervous around here,

169
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,590
so she asked us to help you settle in.

170
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,926
"Awkward and nervous"? That is nonsense.

171
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,304
I feel so relaxed
as if I am in my hometown.

172
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,181
Yes.

173
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,725
I will take good care of my mother,

174
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,310
so any empty house will do.

175
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,688
There are no empty houses.

176
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,690
Go on inside.

177
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,568
No.

178
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,530
No, wait. No, I cannot. Wait.

179
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,698
Make yourself at home.

180
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,796
Why do we not tell her now?

181
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,298
Let us not drag it on.

182
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,925
Does that mean the Virtuous Women Corps
will consist of four members?

183
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,427
There is no need to rush.

184
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,513
She needs to unpack,
and she probably has a lot to do.

185
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,099
So let us take our time.

186
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,485
Where in the world is Deul-re?

187
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,195
She did not leave a note.

188
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,239
There is no sign of her
packing up and leaving.

189
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,074
Do you think something happened to her?

190
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,784
Do you think that guy...

191
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,079
Let us keep looking.
She might be searching for him on her own.

192
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,542
By the way,
what are you going to do with Lady Kim?

193
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,046
I like how she was bold enough

194
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,256
to save her friend first
when her life was on the line.

195
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,800
No, she should have stuck to the rules.

196
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,178
We told her she will die if she fails.

197
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,639
Let us kill her at the right time.

198
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,226
I think it is a waste to kill her.

199
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:43,150
It will be easy for you to greet me
since I will be right behind you.

200
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,653
Are you kidding me?

201
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,405
How are we going to live
in this tiny room?

202
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,990
Just bear with it.

203
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,451
This is not going to last forever.

204
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,245
Just until your mistress arrives?

205
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,374
Yes, at least for me that is.

206
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,001
But what about you?
You said you have nowhere to go.

207
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,253
That is nonsense.
I do have somewhere to go.

208
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,131
I also plan to leave
when the time is right.

209
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,677
-Where to?
-Do not worry.

210
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,345
I will leave after I pay you back.

211
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,056
That is a given.
But where do you plan to go?

212
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,225
Why do you want to know? It is a secret.

213
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,146
I only just started raising a child,
but I already understand

214
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,773
why people say raising a child is useless.

215
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,694
I saved your life,
but you keep secrets from me.

216
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,820
Where are you going?

217
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,823
We need to buy plates
so we can cook and eat.

218
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,533
And there is only one blanket.

219
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,368
-Let me go with you.
-No.

220
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,954
Hey, let me go with you.

221
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,250
Sweetheart, what if someone hears you?
You cannot call me "Hey."

222
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,293
You should call me "Mother."

223
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,172
Really? Do you really want me
to call you that?

224
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,177
-My goodness.
-My goodness, I just got the creeps.

225
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,762
-Forget it.
-Hurry up and get going.

226
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,103
Here you go.

227
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,650
You have already bought enough, Mother.

228
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,278
Okay, my daughter.

229
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,697
I need that.

230
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,073
-Here.
-What?

231
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,243
Where are you...

232
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,622
Where are you going, Mother?

233
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,254
Get my permission before you buy anything.

234
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,465
You spend so much for someone
who used to be a servant.

235
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,384
Fine. You can take care of our finances.
I will cut firewood.

236
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,011
I hate doing the dishes.

237
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,597
Then I will do it. You cook.

238
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,849
I will clean, you do the laundry.

239
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,018
-Deal.
-Sounds good?

240
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,439
What do you think about this?

241
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,410
Should I buy you one?

242
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,872
No, it is okay.

243
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,928
Let us get two chicks.

244
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,014
-No.
-Why?

245
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,810
I do not want them to grow on me.

246
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,687
We should go now.

247
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,091
What is it? Do you want to ride the swing?

248
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,970
No, forget it.

249
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,249
"Suicide"?

250
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,628
We will make it seem like one.

251
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,130
No, wait.

252
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,508
I have a daughter to support now.

253
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,635
I am all she has.

254
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,220
That is your problem.

255
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,140
You broke your promise,
but you saved someone else's life,

256
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,142
so I guess the trust is still there.

257
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,978
How about we give her a second chance?

258
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,230
-I agree.
-What will you ask her to do?

259
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,232
How can we trust her?

260
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,734
Anything.

261
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,903
I will do anything.

262
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,780
Do not give her a real mission,
but let us give her a very difficult task.

263
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,702
It cannot cause us any harm
even if she fails.

264
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,420
Your father-in-law is
Lord Park Jong-chil, right?

265
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,260
Where is he? We have tons of work to do.

266
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,932
Gosh, you startled me.

267
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,434
What took you so long? I am starving.

268
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,354
I brought someone.

269
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,398
Who?

270
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,652
Here.

271
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,822
So what if they grow on you?
You should raise them if you want to.

272
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,783
Here.

273
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,886
I told you to ask before you buy anything.

274
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,221
I even named them.

275
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,516
What are their names?

276
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,977
This one is Dong-dong,

277
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,312
and this one is Dong-ju.

278
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,275
Are you crazy?

279
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,361
Take good care of them while I am gone.

280
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,239
Going somewhere?

281
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,825
To see my mistress in Hanyang.

282
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,244
I got a chance to see her from afar.

283
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,496
Tell the others
that I went to visit my parents.

284
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,125
What a hopeless romantic you are.

285
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,545
Where in Hanyang do you plan to see her?

286
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,382
There is an inn

287
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,302
right next to the police bureau
in Hanyang.

288
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,886
That is where I will see her.

289
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,354
I want to go there, too.

290
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,067
Hanyang.

291
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,279
Nok-du is probably in Hanyang right now.

292
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,282
You must miss him.

293
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,368
-Is it far away?
-Where?

294
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,414
Hanyang. Is it far away from here?

295
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,917
How long will it take
if I run really fast?

296
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,677
KIM NOK-SUN, JUNE 12, 4 P.M., HANYANG

297
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,805
You are coming back, right?

298
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,768
How many times do I need to tell you?
I will be back tomorrow.

299
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,562
I will throw a big party
to celebrate your return.

300
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,606
-So do not be late.
-No.

301
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,191
Do not throw a party.

302
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,945
I will wait for you!

303
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,703
It is so nice to be alone.

304
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,831
It is perfect.

305
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,271
My gosh.

306
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,067
He is going all the way to Hanyang
just to see her from afar?

307
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,944
Gosh, he is overreacting.

308
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:27,280
BRAT

309
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,036
I need a hinge to put this together.

310
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,084
Hanyang has the best iron hardware stores.

311
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,337
Blacksmiths in Hanyang
use the best techniques.

312
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,005
That is right.

313
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,259
I do not want to go, but I have no choice.

314
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,138
There is no other option.

315
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,558
The techniques they use in Hanyang
are sophisticated.

316
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,394
Gosh, I really do not want to go.

317
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,154
INN

318
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,865
Hello.

319
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,242
Are you here to stay the night?

320
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,911
May I ask you something?

321
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,623
Did you happen to see
a person with sassy eyes,

322
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,751
a sharp nose, and plump lips?

323
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,587
I am looking for a man...

324
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,965
I mean, a widow who came here by herself.

325
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,426
I remember!

326
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,304
She unpacked her stuff in that room
and went outside a while ago.

327
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,098
-But why do you ask?
-My mother...

328
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,393
She is my sister.

329
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,030
Where did he go?

330
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,783
He must be excited to see his love.

331
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,706
I wonder if they have already met.

332
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,794
So what? That has nothing to do with me.

333
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,285
From what I know, your father-in-law
owns a very valuable treasure.

334
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,995
Something that is made of iron.

335
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,164
I heard that he loves it so much

336
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,291
that he always sleeps with it in his arms.

337
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,752
I heard it came from Ming

338
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,836
and is called elephant.

339
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,631
-You know what it is, right?
-An elephant...

340
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,093
Yes, of course. I know what it is.

341
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,427
You have three days.

342
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,305
Bring that to us.
You can use whatever method you wish.

343
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,141
If you fail, they will kill you.

344
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,851
If you run away,
we will find and kill you.

345
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,730
Your parents in Jinhae
will not be safe either.

346
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,607
I want you to prove

347
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,610
that you are worthy enough
to join the Muwol Corps.

348
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,155
What if I fail and die there?

349
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,366
How will you find out?

350
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,912
A restaurant named Aseowon
on Yukjo Street is our base.

351
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,915
If you die, people there
will bury your dead body.

352
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,166
So do not worry too much.

353
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,630
They are so tenacious.

354
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,719
Bury my body, my foot.

355
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,970
I am not going to die tonight.

356
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,520
But does anyone actually live here?

357
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,227
Just for a while.

358
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,272
Let me see for just a short while.

359
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,581
Let us go!

360
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,690
Focus, Eun-seo.

361
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,401
Eun-seo, stay focused!

362
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,323
Eun-seo.

363
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,077
Mother.

364
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,496
I am okay. I am fine.

365
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,379
Mother!

366
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,673
Mother.

367
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,185
Dong-ju?

368
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,733
Hey, what are you doing here?

369
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,990
I did not follow you here.

370
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,201
I had business here.

371
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,495
Why...

372
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,248
Why are you crying?

373
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,338
I did not cry.

374
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,590
Yes, you did.

375
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,008
Why?

376
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,720
Hey, something is wrong?

377
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,310
Hey, are you sure
you did not follow me here?

378
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,354
You also came to this inn by coincidence?

379
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,106
No, I did not follow you.

380
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,358
I am here to buy some iron hardware.

381
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,069
And I did not even know
this was the inn you told me about.

382
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:06,072
Why? Because I have
no interest in you whatsoever.

383
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,907
Sure, whatever.

384
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,119
But what did you say to Madam Chun?

385
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,831
-Well--
-I can already guess.

386
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,917
I bet you told her
we are going to my parents' place.

387
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,262
By the way,
what were you doing in that house?

388
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,765
Are you not going to tell me?

389
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,353
It was an empty house.

390
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,188
I wanted to ask for a glass of water.

391
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,901
-It was empty?
-Yes.

392
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,405
But seriously, why were you crying there?

393
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,573
Just go to sleep.

394
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,992
What a rude girl.

395
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,162
How dare you
cut your mother off like that?

396
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,872
My gosh.

397
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,336
Give me back my pillow.

398
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,421
You should not have thrown it.

399
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,051
Just go to bed.

400
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,764
How dare you hit your mother
in the forehead?

401
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,807
My goodness.

402
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,771
Why is this so heavy today?

403
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,081
My lord, we brought your stuff.

404
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,627
There is no need for that.

405
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,805
What happened to those two?

406
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,598
I told them to hurry,

407
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,308
so they will arrive tomorrow evening.

408
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,310
She has been hiding with Ddolbok

409
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,646
in Ungcheon, Jinhae.

410
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,147
How ungrateful of them.

411
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,067
Make sure they never run away again.

412
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,361
Yes. People think they are
coming back from a Buddhist temple,

413
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,904
so we cannot cause a big scene.

414
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,366
But I hired palanquin bearers
who are very good with their swords.

415
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,618
Being ready is a given.

416
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,663
-Do not make any mistakes.
-Of course.

417
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,751
Our family will finally have
a monument for virtuous women.

418
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,171
Are you happy, too?

419
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,674
A monument for virtuous women.

420
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,095
How am I going to steal that?

421
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,806
And why did they get caught again?

422
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,684
Gosh, whatever.

423
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,734
Here is what I experienced
when I went outside in disguise.

424
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,194
As I was walking by,

425
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,197
I saw a little boy

426
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:57,035
squashing a tiny insect egg.

427
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,078
So this is what I asked him.

428
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,539
"That is just an egg.

429
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:06,169
Do you not think it is too cruel
to squash it like this?"

430
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,254
And this is what he told me.

431
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,214
What did he say, Your Majesty?

432
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,761
"Does this look like
an insect egg to you, my lord?

433
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,514
To me, it looks like a loathsome rice worm

434
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:23,603
that will hatch overnight
and eat up all our rice.

435
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,857
How could you be so naive?"

436
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:40,828
I cannot believe that boy.
How could he not recognize you?

437
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,164
That does not matter.

438
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,501
Thanks to him,
I learned that I should destroy anything

439
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,755
that could harm me later on
regardless of how insignificant it may be.

440
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,050
He taught me a very valuable lesson.

441
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,888
Do you not agree?

442
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,433
Bok-sil!

443
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,143
Bok-sil!

444
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,353
Bok-sil!

445
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,819
You are not allowed in here.

446
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,488
I apologize, Your Majesty.

447
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,349
I should be busy stealing that treasure
or whatever that darn thing is.

448
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:50,106
Does that mean His Majesty
will no longer be visiting?

449
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,067
Did you think His Majesty visits
every now and then?

450
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,612
And think of what happened last time.
Even I would not want to come back.

451
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,367
-What is this?
-Do you need anything else?

452
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,202
No, this will do.

453
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,790
Gosh, it rains every other day.

454
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,625
What is this?

455
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,755
-It is magnetite.
-What?

456
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,341
It is used to make iron.

457
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,802
And it sticks to other materials
made of iron.

458
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,306
So everything made of iron
sticks to this rock?

459
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,516
How do you know this?

460
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:30,062
I may not be the best dancer,
but I told you I have great craftsmanship.

461
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,731
-This is nothing.
-My gosh.

462
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,901
Wait.

463
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,822
Oh, dear. Things made of iron
tend to get rusty if they get wet.

464
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,991
Hey, wait.

465
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,785
Can you help me?

466
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,748
Here. What do you think?

467
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,459
Can you do it? Can you make it?

468
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,629
Let me see.

469
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,214
BAMBOO STICK

470
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,008
BAMBOO STICK, BOW

471
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,509
MAGNETITE, ARROW

472
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,678
I thought you were just a scamp.

473
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,640
-But you even steal?
-No.

474
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,475
Do you not trust your mother?

475
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:13,731
The thing is, I was only
going to see my mistress from afar,

476
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,733
but I figured I should at least

477
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,693
send her a letter saying I am okay.

478
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,863
-Please.
-Did you write a letter on an iron plate?

479
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,032
-Do you think I am a fool?
-No.

480
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,535
That is not it.
I have something to give her.

481
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,704
And this is the only way
to give it to her from far away.

482
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,998
My gosh, forget it.

483
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,339
I will give you a discount on your debt.

484
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,592
How much?

485
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,185
I got it!

486
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,775
Where in the world did he go?

487
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,237
My goodness.

488
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,197
Oh, gosh.

489
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,744
Use the stick. Support it with the stick.

490
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:56,292
My goodness, your cough will worsen
if you walk out in the cold.

491
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,669
I cannot just sleep and eat here for free.

492
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,756
You do not even get enough sleep
because you are so worried about Nok-du.

493
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,093
You are right.
That is why I must go to Hanyang.

494
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,013
I have to help him resolve whatever it is

495
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,098
that is on his mind.

496
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,393
Fine, I get what you mean.
Let us eat first, okay?

497
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,900
Aeng-du! Hwang-tae! Let us eat!

498
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,568
Come on!

499
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,697
Did you not see Aeng-du?

500
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,949
I thought she went to the kitchen earlier.

501
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,201
What?

502
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,787
That girl would never miss a meal.

503
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,330
It is impossible.

504
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,459
Oh, my goodness!

505
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,878
Aeng-du! Damn it!

506
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,172
You darn brat!

507
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,966
Aeng-du!

508
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,264
Aeng-du! That darn brat!

509
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,809
Hey, get off the boat this instant!

510
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,312
Father, I am going to Hanyang!
Do not stop me!

511
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,855
What did you just say? That little brat!

512
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,238
Hey, stop! Stop right there!

513
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:11,992
My goodness.

514
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,370
Oh, gosh. My goodness.

515
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,997
My gosh.

516
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,125
Oh, my gosh.

517
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,960
You darn brat.

518
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,138
My lord.

519
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,392
We found out where they are hiding.

520
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,519
What should we do?

521
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,691
What did you just say?

522
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,152
-Lady Kim got caught?
-Yes.

523
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:50,865
Lord Park told the neighbors
that his daughter-in-law went to a temple

524
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,324
and that she will be back tonight.

525
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,744
People are saying she will die
for having gotten caught.

526
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,539
Does that mean she got caught
while she was hiding?

527
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:02,126
He will make her kill herself and put up
a monument for her chastity.

528
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,463
We cannot let him do that.

529
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,173
No, we cannot.

530
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,966
I will be off now.

531
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,389
Why do you keep following me?

532
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,476
I made what you asked for.
Should you not be seeing your mistress?

533
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,854
That is not up to me.
I need a little bit of luck.

534
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,371
You should go on the swing.

535
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,250
No, I do not want to go on the swing.

536
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,921
Well, I do.

537
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,183
He knows nothing about embarrassment.

538
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,604
The breeze is so nice and cool.

539
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,402
Hey, you should try it, too.
I will push you from behind.

540
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,987
No, I do not want to.

541
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,782
What is the matter with you?

542
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,243
You are always refusing things

543
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,411
when that is not how you actually feel.

544
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,248
That is not true.
You do not know anything.

545
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,046
-Yes, I do.
-What do you know?

546
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,716
That you will get sick
if you keep suppressing your desires.

547
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,886
And that the breeze feels nice
if you go on that swing.

548
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,745
Do everything you want.

549
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,706
Do not let anyone talk you out of it.

550
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,958
Just follow your heart.

551
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:08,836
That is right.

552
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,270
Just get on the swing.

553
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,148
It is not a big deal.
The world will not come to an end.

554
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,941
Sit down.

555
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,610
There.

556
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:35,988
Ready?

557
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,333
How does it feel?
The breeze is nice, right?

558
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,940
You are good.

559
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,650
I never said I was not good.

560
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,864
It is raining.
You should go meet your mistress.

561
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,950
Right. Yes, I should go.

562
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,369
You should go straight to the inn.

563
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,622
I will be right there, okay?

564
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,556
Whose nose is bigger? Yours or mine?

565
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,770
Why is it raining so much?
I do not want this to get rusty.

566
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,164
You must use your nose as your hand.

567
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,587
Hey!

568
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,798
Hey!

569
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,717
There is a hole in the ceiling.

570
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,219
How did that happen?

571
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,096
Go up there right now!

572
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,722
-Yes, my lord.
-Hurry!

573
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,601
-Get going!
-Hurry!

574
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,978
How is there a hole in the ceiling?

575
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,522
You are all wet.

576
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:49,199
What if this precious thing gets rusty?

577
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:54,830
It got me.

578
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,719
Catch...

579
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,345
Catch that thief!

580
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,639
Catch him! Go!

581
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,516
Catch that thief!

582
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,393
Where is that thief?

583
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,237
-Hey!
-Get him!

584
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,616
-Stop right there!
-Stop!

585
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,334
-Stop!
-Hey!

586
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,604
It was an empty house.

587
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,982
What is the matter with you?

588
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,693
You are always refusing things

589
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,820
when that is not how you actually feel.

590
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,200
That you will get sick
if you keep suppressing your desires.

591
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,296
I am nothing without that elephant!
I am nothing without it!

592
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,548
-My elephant!
-My goodness.

593
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,966
-My lord.
-Are you okay?

594
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,136
-My elephant! Find it!
-My goodness. Careful.

595
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,305
My elephant!

596
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,016
Lady Kim should arrive any minute.

597
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,274
What is she doing here?

598
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,954
Do you have to dress that way

599
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,331
because you are living
in the widow village?

600
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,046
Something happened,
so I borrowed my mother's dress.

601
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,010
But what are you doing here, my lord?

602
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,305
Well...

603
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,934
I did not want anyone else to live here.

604
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,061
I did not want this place
to be abandoned, either.

605
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,813
Just in case you came here one day.

606
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,400
My efforts were not fruitless.

607
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,155
When our parents were
discussing our marriage,

608
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:41,867
I secretly came here to see you.

609
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,872
I was going to ask my parents
to cancel the wedding if you were ugly.

610
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:51,209
But after I saw you,
I went home and begged my father

611
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,546
to let me marry you as soon as possible.

612
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,603
If you want, this house

613
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,690
will always be yours.

614
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,322
This is all useless.

615
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,285
My lady.

616
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,333
I have always wanted
to call you that here.

617
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,670
Even if it may be useless.

618
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,840
Please stop.

619
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,761
You do not need to make it worse.

620
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,764
Now that I have come here,

621
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,976
I miss the past even more.

622
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,940
I apologize.

623
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,536
This place still looks so beautiful
thanks to you.

624
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,748
Thank you, my lord.

625
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,003
But

626
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,006
I am never going to come here again.

627
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:24,636
So please keep your promise
and continue to treat me

628
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,347
as a kisaeng.

629
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,028
I will be off now.

630
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,365
It is late. Let me take you back.

631
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,243
I wish to go on my own.

632
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,800
What are they doing
in an empty house at such a late hour?

633
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,219
She is unbelievable.

634
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,097
She was always so cold
back at the kisaeng house.

635
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,349
But in Hanyang,
she is completely different.

636
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,394
What? She came to go
to the blacksmith's shop?

637
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:15,937
What a joke.

638
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,545
-Who is there?
-My goodness!

639
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,470
How dare you, you punk!

640
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,014
You must have a death wish!

641
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,767
How will you kill me holding that?

642
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,562
Hurry up and come at me.

643
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,355
I feel

644
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,983
very unpleasant right now.

645
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,469
It is me.

646
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,977
How did you know I would be here?

647
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:23,982
Are you okay?

648
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,067
You must have gone through so much.

649
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,945
I am okay, but Ddolbok...

650
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:32,740
Ddolbok got severely injured
while trying to stop these men.

651
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,409
I wonder if he is okay.

652
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:40,290
I am sure he is okay,
so calm down for now.

653
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:51,342
Stop crying. You should escape...

654
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,636
Is that his mistress?

655
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,199
He must be so happy.

656
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,212
Lady Kim?

657
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,089
Lady Kim.

658
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,133
You need to escape.

659
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,469
Hey! Go!

660
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:36,846
What is wrong with her?

661
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,350
It is Ssuk. Ssuk.

662
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,684
What?

663
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,019
-"Ssuk"?
-Yes. Hurry.

664
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,105
Hurry! Let us go this way.

665
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,492
But she saw me.

666
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,035
-I think she mistook me for you.
-What?

667
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,538
She will be suspicious of me
if I run away.

668
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,751
-My goodness.
-Oh, gosh.

669
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:09,963
Lady Kim?

670
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,675
I want you to run away first.

671
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,593
I will try my best to deal with this.

672
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,887
What are you doing? Run.

673
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,389
-Go inside.
-Why?

674
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,890
-Just go inside.
-What are you doing?

675
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,850
-Get in there.
-Hey, wait.

676
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:40,952
Lady Kim.

677
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,413
Hey.

678
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,170
We have no choice.

679
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:56,259
-Ouch!
-No. Please. Stay still.

680
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:07,395
Lady Kim.

681
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,064
Do not move.

682
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,037
Lady Kim, are you inside?

683
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,853
Who are you?

684
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,524
CHAOS

685
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:40,113
How dare you interrupt?

686
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:44,867
DESTRUCTION

687
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,543
Honey!

688
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:58,589
My lord! My lord, wait!

689
01:01:58,673 --> 01:01:59,549
OBLIVIOUS

690
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,262
My lord.

691
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,143
Gosh, what a crazy dream.

692
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,148
