1
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,004
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,964
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,286
Who are you?

4
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,560
Officer...

5
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,620
Your Majesty!

6
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:04,916
Your Majesty.

7
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,378
-I want you to leave.
-It is not true, right?

8
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,797
Tell me it is not true, Your Majesty.

9
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,132
I told you to leave.

10
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,552
Then tell me that it is not true.

11
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:20,557
Tell me that all those horrible things
I have heard are all not true.

12
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,558
Enough.

13
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,060
There is nothing for you to know.

14
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,562
So I want you to leave...

15
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,522
I must...

16
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,905
I must hear the rest.

17
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,533
Where is he?

18
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,118
Hurry up and take him away.

19
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,747
And do not let anyone inside his cell
other than myself.

20
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,207
Yes, Your Majesty.

21
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,834
Your Highness.

22
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,591
No! I must hear what happened!

23
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,093
What are you doing?
Take her back to her chamber now.

24
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,219
Yes, Your Majesty.

25
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,267
No, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,145
Your Majesty! Let me go!

27
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,314
Your Majesty!

28
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:13,026
Your Majesty!

29
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,156
Get up.

30
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,283
Who are you?

31
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,957
I heard you asked for me, Your Majesty.

32
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,923
Let her go. I know her.

33
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,886
Are you lost?

34
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,558
She looks startled.
You should take her out of here.

35
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,102
-I will call you again.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

36
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:00,782
What is this?

37
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,539
It is...

38
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,544
Open it.

39
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,523
Return it to her.

40
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,371
Dong-ju.

41
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,730
Are you okay?

42
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,857
He was the King,

43
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,069
not an officer.

44
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,406
-The King.
-Were you shocked?

45
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,534
I should have told you.

46
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,203
When did you find out?

47
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,080
At the certificate ceremony.

48
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,793
His Majesty told me not to tell you
because you might feel uneasy.

49
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:37,920
Sorry.

50
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,883
We ate together.

51
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,471
We talked.

52
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,766
We laughed.

53
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,603
My goodness.

54
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,522
No, it is okay.

55
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,025
He will not do anything to you

56
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,651
just because you ate and talked to him.

57
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,196
What kind of person is he?

58
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,991
What kind of person is the King?

59
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,331
You must find Jung Yun-jeo.

60
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,000
If you must,

61
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,336
you can kill him.

62
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,963
Just bring me his body.

63
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,761
I wish that you will never find out

64
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,973
what kind of person I am.

65
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,104
He is fearful,

66
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,356
has a lot of worries,

67
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,359
and is pitiful.

68
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,452
I get to listen to his concerns
because I work for him.

69
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,997
But you will surely be fine.

70
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,335
His Majesty cares about you very much.

71
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,588
He would never get the wrong idea
because of what happened. Do not worry.

72
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,221
You get scared so easily.

73
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,811
But what were you doing there
at such a late hour?

74
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,397
Is there something wrong?

75
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,651
No.

76
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,697
It is nothing.

77
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,700
Nothing.

78
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,621
Okay.

79
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,554
You know where he is,
but you are not going to tell me?

80
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,934
You are not going to tell me
where you hid him?

81
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,436
I am very well aware

82
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,814
that it will be difficult
to make you talk.

83
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,483
Which one would be more difficult?

84
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,403
Making me talk

85
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,698
or forcing yourself to escape
from that hideous fear you have

86
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,409
and stop what you are doing?

87
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,827
"Fear"?

88
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,914
-"Hideous"?
-Yes.

89
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,918
You were foolish enough
to believe that Yun tried to use my son

90
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,545
to dethrone you.

91
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,089
What is it that you are so afraid of?

92
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,344
Should I teach you
what you should really be afraid of?

93
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,387
Yes, go ahead.

94
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,683
Why do you not throw my dead body out
through the door for the dead?

95
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,164
If my death can make you wake up
from your delusions,

96
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,459
I will gladly sacrifice my life for you.

97
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,589
How dare you try to betray me as well?

98
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,467
Okay, fine. I will kill you as you wish.

99
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,136
You and your old friend, Yun,

100
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,097
can reunite in the afterlife.

101
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,242
Your Majesty!

102
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,536
-Call the royal doctor.
-Yes, my lord.

103
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,204
Your Majesty.

104
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,582
How is His Majesty?

105
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,126
Is the royal doctor inside?

106
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:50,089
He is stable now,
but I do not think you can meet him.

107
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,884
He wanted you to join him for a drink.

108
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,678
But tonight will be...

109
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,556
Yes. I understand.

110
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,476
But what happened earlier?

111
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,563
That is not something I can tell you.

112
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,690
Okay.

113
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,152
I will be off now.

114
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,592
His Majesty cares about you very much.

115
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,054
He would never get the wrong idea
because of what happened. Do not worry.

116
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,610
I am not allowed inside?

117
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,237
It is the royal command.

118
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,031
I need to return something
to Her Highness.

119
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,326
-It will not take long.
-You should go.

120
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,751
Do you finally understand
how dangerous your plan is?

121
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,503
I already knew that.

122
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,379
You could have died last night.

123
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,590
I was more than ready to die.

124
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,802
How can I expect to stay alive
when I plan to take someone's life?

125
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,766
Does he know anything about this?

126
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,561
I am sick and tired of telling you
to mind your own business.

127
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,108
Do not do anything until next month.

128
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,820
Do not ask me why. Just do as I say.

129
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,949
What do you plan to do next month?

130
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,660
You are not going to harm Nok-du--

131
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,163
Must you talk about him
when I am concerned about you?

132
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,292
If you want to know,
stay alive until next month.

133
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,461
My lord.

134
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,308
I wonder if you will

135
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,729
still feel the same about him
even after you find out who he really is.

136
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,635
It looks like Her Majesty

137
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,972
was waiting for him outside the palace.

138
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,225
That means they had exchanged letters.

139
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,936
Jung Yun-jeo no longer has any connections

140
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,354
to Her Majesty's side.

141
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,607
So who do you think helped him?

142
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,526
Should I look into it?

143
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,615
It is more important to find out
how much Her Majesty knows.

144
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,450
Have you heard anything else?

145
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,536
No, nothing more.

146
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,915
Stay alert for new movements
or additional news.

147
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,416
Okay, my lord.

148
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,716
It looks like you have something to say.

149
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,261
The revolt is coming up.

150
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,555
And I just want to know

151
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,850
if you will really protect the Muwol Corps
when you start a new kingdom.

152
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,104
Of course. I will keep my word,
so do not worry.

153
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,484
I need some kind of evidence to assure
that you will keep your word.

154
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,611
How about we help each other out?

155
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,825
I am sure he has something ready
to keep everyone on his side.

156
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,619
So that they cannot betray him.

157
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,789
-You think he has something?
-Yes.

158
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,668
And they probably do not trust
Prince Neungyang wholeheartedly either.

159
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,127
So they would have needed evidence.

160
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,506
For example,

161
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,510
a piece of paper
with the names of the people involved?

162
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,345
To them, it is an oath.

163
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,514
But if I manage to get it,
it will be their Achilles' heel.

164
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,184
Conclusive evidence to prove
that they are plotting treason.

165
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,396
Therefore, I am going to take that
from them.

166
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,524
"Evidence"?

167
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,154
Fine.

168
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,658
I will take that as your oath of loyalty.

169
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,337
I will call you back. Wait outside.

170
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,257
Okay, my lord.

171
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,139
-Let us drink some more.
-Sure.

172
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,106
You were right.

173
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,774
They had written an oath.

174
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,777
Have you found out where he keeps it?

175
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,160
KIM SSUK

176
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,622
OATH

177
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,745
A lock?

178
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,414
I am sure he has the key with him
at all times.

179
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,792
How are we going to take that from him?

180
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,543
Let us think of a way.

181
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:11,256
I am Lady Kim,
who stole Lord Park's elephant statue.

182
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,929
We close at 2:00 a.m.,
so come to Aseowon by then.

183
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,556
You should take a look
at the surroundings yourself.

184
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,018
It will be even better
if you come up with a way before then.

185
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,978
Okay, I will see you later.

186
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:44,039
We were right. It is really her.

187
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,749
Yes.

188
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,545
How did she end up working at the palace?

189
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,296
If she gets caught, she will die.

190
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,674
And not only her. We will die, too.

191
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,718
Thank you.

192
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,304
MEDICINE

193
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,825
I bet this is all you do
to have fun in Hanyang.

194
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,827
You are like a country girl.

195
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,872
Look who is talking.
You are from an island.

196
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,707
Diving was all you did there.

197
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,000
"Diving"?

198
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,336
That is too boring.

199
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,171
Then what did you do?

200
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,839
Do you know how to ride waves?

201
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,092
You should have seen me ride a wave
that was as big as a house.

202
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,846
Stop bluffing.
How can a wave be as big as a house?

203
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,390
And even if that were true,
how can you ride a wave that big?

204
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,725
Are you a fish or something?

205
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,813
It is a pity that I cannot show you.

206
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,277
Should we go to the beach right now?

207
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,154
What?

208
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,032
Is it too far away?

209
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,869
It is either one of the two.

210
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,997
You either do not know how to ride waves
or your affection for me has faded.

211
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,166
What are you talking about?

212
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,419
Both are not true. It is because
I need to do something important.

213
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,383
Yes, I am sure
it is more important than me.

214
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,344
No, that is not it.

215
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,348
I am kidding.
I know how far away the beach is.

216
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,308
And I really need to head back now.

217
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,104
You are late already,
so let us go and eat with my family.

218
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,150
I promise I will take you
to the beach next time.

219
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,239
Let us go eat.

220
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,659
-Hey!
-Come on.

221
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,536
My gosh, people are watching.

222
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,037
-Put me down.
-Oh, wait.

223
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,667
Gosh, this fell.

224
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,587
Is that ornament yours?

225
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,049
-Yes.
-But why do you only have half?

226
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,387
I am not sure.

227
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,973
I do not know why. Let us go.

228
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,683
I know why.

229
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,562
-What?
-That is a token of love.

230
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,399
Who has the other half?
You actually had a lover, did you not?

231
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,276
Stop talking nonsense.

232
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,944
No, I did not. Now, let us go.

233
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,613
Why are you acting weird?
Did you really have a lover?

234
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,742
He must have had a lover.

235
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,785
It is not true.

236
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,204
What in the world...

237
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,632
My goodness.

238
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,844
Goodness.

239
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,229
Let me...

240
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,736
You do not have a fever.

241
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,784
And your eyes look fine.

242
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,994
I know it is hard to believe.

243
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,457
You are going to stop the revolt?

244
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,667
And you will bring Hwang-tae back?

245
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,003
And you are the son?

246
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,130
Are you really telling me

247
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,925
that you are the son of His Majesty?
You are the Crown Prince? You?

248
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,845
I think so.

249
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,557
My goodness.

250
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,268
This cannot be.

251
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,395
-Wait--
-No, no.

252
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,690
You are not the type of guy...

253
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,276
I mean, you are not the type of person
to joke about this.

254
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,112
But are you really the son of...

255
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,115
This is crazy.

256
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,742
-Master, do not be like this.
-I do not want to be like this.

257
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,286
I cannot help but show you respect.

258
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,581
Master.

259
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,377
-You need to help me.
-Yes, of course...

260
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,170
Actually...

261
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,339
Yes, I should help.

262
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,300
I should help as your master.

263
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,112
You should keep it warm and turn it...

264
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,116
Do not look.

265
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,285
Aeng-du, what are you doing?

266
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,955
Now that you are here,

267
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,916
Nok-du will hide a fried egg
beneath your rice again.

268
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,671
And this time, I will not get fooled.

269
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,424
My goodness, you are unbelievable.

270
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,301
My gosh.

271
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,265
-I will walk you home.
-Fine. Go ahead.

272
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,850
Can I carry you on my back?

273
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,186
No.

274
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,105
My gosh, stop it! No!

275
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,982
My goodness!

276
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,074
-What happened?
-What is wrong?

277
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,826
-What happened?
-Bok-nyeo worked so hard

278
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,954
to ferment this soybean lump,
but Aeng-du tried to eat it.

279
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,458
We also worked hard to ferment it too.

280
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,627
It is okay.

281
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,670
She is just a little kid.

282
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,548
But look how ugly it looks.

283
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,050
You worked so hard to make this.

284
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,011
My goodness, you brat.
You will end up eating everything you see.

285
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,348
Why would you go into
that stinky room to eat that?

286
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,892
I know, right?
What were you doing in there?

287
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,269
Bok-nyeo? Lord Yeon?

288
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,356
Were you in the room together?

289
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,027
I was eating that lump
of fermented soybeans,

290
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,905
and they suddenly came in and held hands--

291
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,531
Okay, that is enough.

292
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,408
You must have been hungry.

293
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,826
You should have told me. Enough.

294
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,953
Enough, okay?

295
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,123
You two are unbelievable.
What did you do in front of a kid?

296
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,541
We did not do anything.

297
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,210
I personally think

298
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,921
what you and Dong-ju did last time--

299
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,298
My goodness. Eat this.

300
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,384
Have a bit more.

301
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,348
My gosh, she is talking nonsense.

302
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,102
-My goodness.
-Aeng-du, I will give you food.

303
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,228
Come with me.

304
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,232
What... What is the matter?
What are you doing?

305
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,608
Do not get the wrong idea.

306
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,610
It is a misunderstanding!
A misunderstanding!

307
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,071
What are you doing? How dare you?

308
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,800
Did anything happen between you
and Prince Neungyang after that day?

309
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,430
Why would you bring him up?
We just had a nice meal.

310
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,058
I just want you to be careful.
He is a dangerous man.

311
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,561
He talked as if he had plans to harm you.

312
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,689
-I do not want you to--
-I will not get hurt.

313
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,775
You are not responsible
for what he does to me.

314
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,363
And I am planning to make a move first,
so do not worry.

315
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,115
What are you planning to do?

316
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,368
Something that must be done.

317
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,663
It is nothing dangerous, so do not worry.

318
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,627
If you are going to keep
staring at me like that,

319
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,130
you should give me a kiss.

320
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,890
Your Highness!

321
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,143
You cannot come outside.

322
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,603
-Your Highness.
-Move.

323
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,773
My ornament is gone.

324
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,401
I must have dropped it that day.
I must find it.

325
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,528
-It is the royal command, Your Highness.
-How dare you?

326
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,655
Get out of my way right now.

327
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,366
If I end up losing it,

328
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,869
I will never forgive you.

329
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,746
Get out of my way
if you do not want to die!

330
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,165
Your Highness, please do not do this.

331
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,542
Court Lady Kim.

332
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,420
My ornament...

333
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,593
My ornament...

334
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,316
Is she not the servant I met last time?

335
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,026
I apologize, Your Highness.

336
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,778
I apologize, Your Highness.

337
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,155
I am not allowed to leave the palace.

338
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,034
So I asked her to bring me medicine
and some extra clothes.

339
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,079
Good idea.

340
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,126
You are free to come and go.

341
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,547
So can you find something for me?

342
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,049
Pardon?

343
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,524
It is an ornament broken in half.

344
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,568
You will easily be able to find it.

345
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,111
It is very dear to me.

346
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,613
So please find it for me.

347
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,705
How will I find something so tiny?

348
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,667
Come to think of it...

349
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,796
Is that ornament yours?

350
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,674
What were you saying?

351
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,637
-What are you looking for?
-No, it is nothing.

352
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,891
By the way, that ornament you had earlier.

353
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,893
Where did you get it?

354
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,811
What?

355
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,355
Why do you ask?

356
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,275
By any chance,
did you find it in the palace?

357
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,360
No.

358
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,071
I got it from my mother.

359
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,741
I see.

360
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,161
But what are you doing here?

361
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,874
Meet me by the swing at around 10 p.m.

362
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,751
I came to tell you that.

363
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,961
-Why?
-You said you wanted to go to the beach.

364
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,881
-So let us go.
-You are talking nonsense again.

365
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,965
Let us go.

366
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,843
If we travel all night,
we will be able to see the sunrise.

367
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,553
It is very beautiful.

368
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,395
Meet me there so we can go together.

369
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,481
Okay?

370
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,984
Okay.

371
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,363
You must meet me there, okay?

372
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,786
I should go now. See you later.

373
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,841
What did you just say?

374
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,845
He is His Majesty's son
who was abandoned as a baby.

375
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,472
How could he do something so evil
to keep the throne?

376
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,224
How could he do that to his own son?

377
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,269
He could have succeeded the throne
to his son.

378
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,063
Because he was not the king
during the Japanese invasion.

379
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,941
But that is none of our concern.

380
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:04,028
What is important is that he tried to kill
his newborn son

381
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,655
and that the son managed to stay alive.

382
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,242
On top of that,
he is in close proximity to His Majesty.

383
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:14,163
So I guess this is what you plan to use
to justify the revolt.

384
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,458
His Majesty is looking for his son
without knowing that he works for him.

385
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,086
He still wishes to kill his son.

386
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,589
It is a terrible sin

387
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,050
even though brothers and sons
can be a threat to the throne.

388
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,177
If people find out about this,

389
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,847
it will severely harm
His Majesty's reputation.

390
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,725
Have you come up with a good idea?

391
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,478
I have an idea.

392
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,982
You found a way?

393
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,609
Yes.

394
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,528
Here.

395
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,164
Is it not possible?

396
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,417
Did you say the lock looks like
an upside-down wooden bowl?

397
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,501
Yes.

398
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,795
I will make it work. Let me give it a try.

399
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,590
You became an officer
after practicing with our tools.

400
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,510
-Can you do it for me?
-Yes, of course.

401
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,683
But are you going to stamp it
on this block of fermented soybeans?

402
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,686
I wish to fill it up with fine soil.

403
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,105
There is a pottery kiln
at the far end of the alley.

404
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,315
You should go there.

405
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,237
He will soon come out after the meeting.

406
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,864
We must do it right away.

407
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,784
I have everything set in place.

408
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,161
Are you really sure about this?

409
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,248
I was going to quit working for
Prince Neungyang anyway

410
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,042
after I found out about his true colors.

411
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,002
If you need a place to hide--

412
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,921
We will find a place, so do not worry.

413
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,340
Just do what needs to be done.

414
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,180
Of course.

415
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,559
I will take him to His Majesty tomorrow.

416
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,035
Imagine how shocked His Majesty will be

417
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,788
once he finds out that the son
he had been looking for

418
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,249
was actually right under his nose
all along.

419
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,045
But he will also be very happy.

420
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,506
Because he will finally

421
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,512
get a chance to kill him properly.

422
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,608
What do you think?

423
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,988
An evil king who killed his son twice
because he was blinded by greed.

424
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,283
No one will be able to take his side.

425
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,660
Then...

426
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,539
how do you plan to catch him?

427
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,543
Everyone has a weakness.

428
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,715
Hello.

429
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,137
Catch the little girl
and her father right now.

430
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,139
-Okay, my lord.
-My goodness.

431
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,726
My lord, your horse ran away.

432
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,270
-What?
-I am sure I tied it up tightly.

433
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,647
But the lead came undone, and it ran away.

434
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,484
Wait here, my lord.

435
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,608
She likes me more!

436
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,280
You are no match for me!

437
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,865
You punk.

438
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,701
I am no match for you?

439
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,829
Yes you are!

440
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,498
You should know your place.
How dare you covet my love?

441
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,458
What? Your love?

442
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,169
You darn punk! Get lost!

443
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,755
-You little...
-You darn punk.

444
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,966
What do you think you are doing?

445
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,843
-You punk!
-My goodness.

446
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,807
My goodness!

447
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,059
My gosh, are you okay?

448
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,272
-Oh, gosh.
-My lord, are you okay?

449
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,233
I will prepare a bucket of water
and a new set of clothes.

450
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,442
Come inside.

451
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,549
I can change on my own.
Get me some cold water.

452
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,092
Okay.

453
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,590
My lord, you can wash now.

454
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,940
What... What is the matter?

455
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,870
Were you the only one here?

456
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,872
Pardon?

457
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,793
Are you asking if it was just me and you?

458
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,468
No one else came in this room.

459
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,595
I wonder why it ran away.
It was a well-behaved horse.

460
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,847
And why did the lead come undone?

461
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,214
-You are here.
-Who are you?

462
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,216
Do you not know?

463
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,888
Do you really not know who he is?

464
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,600
-Who may I ask are you?
-I am Vice...

465
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,436
What? So you do not know.

466
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,147
I guess you really do not know.
Then forget the introduction.

467
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,734
I will cut to the chase.
We are here to talk to the punk

468
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,070
who has chalky skin
and also looks extremely impolite.

469
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,030
Tell him to come outside.

470
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,824
-My goodness!
-Hey!

471
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,784
-How dare you?
-I asked to talk to a man,

472
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,994
-not your sword.
-There was a party today.

473
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,163
-He had a lot to drink.
-Do you want to fight?

474
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,624
-Stop it.
-Are you trying to start a fight?

475
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,462
Everyone, calm down.

476
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,720
You darn punk!

477
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,014
Look at me properly.

478
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,933
Yes, it is you.

479
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,936
You were at the palace a few days ago,
were you not?

480
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,480
Well, yes.
But I have never met you before.

481
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,900
Cut the nonsense. What was it again?
Yes, you were on your horse.

482
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,237
And your horse stepped on
my precious amethyst ring.

483
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,406
Then you just ran away.

484
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,908
You have no idea
how hard it was for me to find you.

485
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,328
Do you know how precious
that hat string was to me?

486
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,998
What? "Hat string"?

487
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,333
I thought it was a ring.

488
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,461
What?

489
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,755
-You said it was a ring.
-A ring...

490
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,470
My gosh, that darn fool.

491
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,728
What just happened?

492
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,610
I can do this.

493
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,155
One more time.

494
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,407
What in the world...

495
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,328
Why am I bleeding so much?

496
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,539
I am bleeding!

497
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,209
Call the police bureau!

498
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,710
I am bleeding!

499
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,687
No one is inside.

500
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,856
No one is home?

501
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,945
Dan-ho, let us go to the annex.

502
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,339
My gosh, what is taking him so long?

503
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,890
There he is. The prince is here.

504
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,395
No, you cannot go. Oh, gosh.

505
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,109
There is no need to be startled.
I am okay.

506
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,987
We got a report about a commotion.

507
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,491
My nose! I am bleeding!

508
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,119
He broke my precious belonging
and ran away.

509
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,704
So I came back to confront him,

510
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,498
but he beat me up instead of apologizing.

511
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,250
Arrest him right now.

512
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,671
This annex belongs to Prince Neungyang.

513
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,215
And this man is his close friend.

514
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,510
-"Prince Neungyang"?
-That is correct.

515
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,432
So what?

516
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,227
That does not give him the right

517
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,479
to be exempted from his sins.

518
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,066
-Arrest him.
-Yes, my lord!

519
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,891
I told you that it is too late.

520
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,727
-You cannot change anything.
-This will not last long.

521
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,146
You are safest in here.

522
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,982
-What?
-Tonight,

523
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,943
Prince Neungyang will be done for.

524
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,821
Nok-du, what have you done?

525
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,115
You will get released tomorrow.

526
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,327
Lie low for a while
and leave once things die down.

527
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,455
I will go now.

528
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,448
How is the Queen?

529
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:05,369
Her Majesty seems to be doing fine.

530
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,082
And nothing happened in particular?

531
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,542
No, Your Majesty.

532
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:18,090
But the young officer
frequently came by to visit.

533
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,801
You mean Officer Yeon?

534
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,803
Yes, Your Majesty.

535
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,180
Did he have something to report?

536
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,183
No, not exactly.

537
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,538
Am I here too early?

538
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,876
I should go and scare him.

539
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,766
He came because he was worried?

540
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,769
Yes. He asked if you were sick,

541
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,773
if you got better,
and if you had your meals.

542
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,984
He asked me that every time he came.

543
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,659
I know it is late,
but will you call him for me?

544
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,497
Tell him to come see me
as soon as he comes to the palace.

545
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,248
Yes, Your Majesty.

546
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,756
How is the prisoner doing?

547
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,716
He is refusing to eat

548
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:46,303
and is not drinking
a single drop of water.

549
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,058
He must be trying to die
without my permission

550
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,520
while I am not well.

551
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,648
I will not let him do that.

552
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,526
I should go see him right now.

553
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,831
Here you go. You must hurry.

554
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,470
OATH

555
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,778
JUNG I-HYEONG

556
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,113
KIM SSUK

557
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,122
Go on.

558
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,562
Dong-ju.

559
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,564
What brings you here?

560
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,858
What about you?

561
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,865
Are you here to meet Nok-du?

562
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,582
He has disappeared along with his family.

563
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,085
Do you really not know where he is?

564
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:26,963
I do not know.

565
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,550
But why are you looking for his family?

566
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:31,885
You do not need to know.

567
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,847
What are you trying to do?

568
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,477
-Are you that worried?
-Yes.

569
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,856
I am worried
because you are always so violent.

570
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,319
"Violent"?

571
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:54,574
Please do not get Nok-du involved
in the matters between you and me.

572
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,369
To me, he is...

573
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,874
Please, my lord.

574
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,341
What is he to you?

575
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:13,885
What?

576
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:15,679
Should I tell you?

577
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,566
OATH

578
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,627
I want all of you to stay outside.

579
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,421
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

580
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,100
You must be upset.

581
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,562
I came before you could die.

582
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,025
You have not changed at all.

583
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,153
I still see no fear in your eyes.

584
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,784
Do you remember when we had to form

585
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,996
a secondary constituent 20 years ago
after the Japanese invasion?

586
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,791
You were smart

587
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,376
and brave.

588
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,171
I had to be.

589
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,758
I was sick of being the son
who was never loved.

590
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,636
After the invasion,

591
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:41,097
I finally became the Crown Prince,
but I was still at risk.

592
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,643
To be honest, I was scared.

593
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,646
You were always calm. But unlike you,

594
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,357
I was extremely scared.

595
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:52,943
That fear is

596
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,613
what helped me endure

597
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,991
the horrific war.

598
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,122
I was scared I might not become the king.

599
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,167
But the throne is yours now.

600
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,461
Why are you still...

601
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,588
I am still
in the middle of the battlefield

602
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,383
where arrows are pouring in
and blood is everywhere.

603
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:22,430
The late king who did not want me
to succeed the throne until the very end.

604
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,394
The subjects who always tried
to bring me down.

605
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,481
The people of this country
who were full of complaints.

606
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,317
And I was also

607
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,571
betrayed by

608
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:40,991
you and Yun.

609
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,618
Your Majesty.

610
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,162
Yun-jeo.

611
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,292
Do you think

612
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,962
I will be able to die as a king?

613
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,140
I heard he wanted to see me.

614
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,560
I also have something to tell His Majesty.

615
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,520
So please let me inside.

616
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,743
Therefore,

617
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,412
I must kill

618
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,457
that boy.

619
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,376
Your Majesty.

620
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,212
He is your son.

621
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,966
You already tried to kill him once,
but he survived!

622
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,344
He is your son, Your Majesty!

623
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:45,388
He should not have lived!
He should not have survived!

624
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,724
Your Majesty!

625
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,936
I do not care that he is my son
and my bloodline.

626
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,563
That is how cruel and tormenting it is

627
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,609
to keep the throne!

628
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,407
Where is he?

629
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:08,870
I will not let you die

630
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,581
until you tell me.

631
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,587
OATH

632
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,779
What...

633
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,032
did you just say?

634
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,744
Nok-du is whom?

635
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,206
The person who killed your family

636
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,461
and completely ruined your life.

637
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,546
The darn king

638
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:04,342
whom you loathe
and desperately wish to kill!

639
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,262
He is...

640
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,687
He is the King's son.

641
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,443
Gosh, this fell.

642
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,030
It is an ornament broken in half.

643
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,073
You will easily be able to find it.

644
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,368
It is very dear to me.
So please find it for me.

645
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,831
That ornament you had earlier.
Where did you get it?

646
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,751
I got it from my mother.

647
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,797
Tell me.

648
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,093
Are you still worried about him?

649
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,138
Do you still love him?

650
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,433
Answer me!

651
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,677
I asked a man to find
a decent place for him to hide.

652
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,014
I will stay here and bring him to you
once he gets released.

653
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:35,892
But

654
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,271
why did he lock his brother up
just to have him released tomorrow?

655
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,108
It is just for one night.

656
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,438
What do you think?

657
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,899
Even ghosts with good eyes
will pass by our house.

658
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,400
What are you doing?

659
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,068
If you have cold feet,
you will catch a cold.

660
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,820
Do not try to put me through trouble.

661
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:21,080
There. All done.

662
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,209
I will not ask you to like me.

663
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,920
Go ahead and use me. I do not care.

664
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:28,922
So...

665
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,176
just do not disappear.

666
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,908
Why are you so fearless?

667
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,245
We can never predict the future.

668
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,456
That is exactly why

669
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,167
I want to be honest about my feelings.

670
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,879
And I am walking you home
because I want to.

671
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:18,721
Why are you crying here?

672
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,555
I am going to save Dad.

673
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,224
Will you beg your real father for mercy?

674
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,767
What are you trying to do?

675
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,602
I will make him shed tears of regret.

676
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,938
He is your father.

677
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,274
You had to go through so much.

678
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,567
You must leave.

679
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:39,654
We will all die if he finds out
that you are still alive.

680
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,030
I will not run away.

681
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,741
I appoint you as my royal guard.

682
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,284
A royal guard?

683
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,578
That is a soldier
who guards His Majesty right by his side.

684
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,879
