1
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,379
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,381
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,813
-My lord, it is not what you think.
-Come outside.

4
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,773
Let me explain.

5
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,858
Come outside right now!

6
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,276
That feels nice.

7
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,112
I feel refreshed
now that my hair is clean.

8
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,822
-I feel great.
-My gosh.

9
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,660
That was nice, was it not?

10
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,662
Yes, it was.

11
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,583
Lady Kim.

12
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,169
Yes.

13
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,339
I was just about to go to bed.

14
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,924
-Come out for a moment.
-Is he nuts?

15
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,217
We need to give you something.

16
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,927
My goodness, we are practically a family.

17
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,220
-I will kill him.
-We can just

18
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,513
go inside ourselves.

19
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,473
You are right. Let us go inside.

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,517
Lady Kim, we are going in.

21
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:28,356
No, I will be right out. Just a minute.

22
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,365
Did Dong-ju come home?

23
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,325
She was outside all day.

24
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,327
Yes, she came home. She is sleeping.

25
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,037
We brought you some calamus.

26
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,083
You and Dong-ju should
wash each other's hair tomorrow

27
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,919
-and make up with each other.
-Okay, we will.

28
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,379
Why fight over a man?

29
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,340
It is all useless, Lady Kim.

30
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,675
I apologize for what happened.

31
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,219
You must all be tired.
You should get some sleep.

32
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,139
What? No, we are not tired at all.

33
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,099
No, you should go.
Go to your rooms and sleep.

34
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,893
-We are fine.
-My goodness.

35
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,811
-Dong-ju is fast asleep.
-But...

36
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,021
My goodness.

37
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,329
So that is why you let him hide the fact
that he is a man?

38
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,039
Yes.

39
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,459
He will be gone soon,
so please do not tell anyone.

40
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,877
Do us a favor.

41
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,546
Then why...

42
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,594
-Why were you two--
-It was an accident.

43
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,931
-He slipped.
-You expect me to believe that?

44
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,683
-I trust you, but not him.
-It was not an accident.

45
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,101
Be quiet.

46
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,773
I know you think him
as a reckless and shameless fool.

47
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,191
-Hey.
-But

48
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,860
he does not mean any harm,
so do not worry.

49
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,947
Are you worried about him?

50
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,034
If people find out he is a man,

51
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,119
I will also get in trouble
for helping him.

52
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,205
I am worried about myself.

53
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,375
So please do not tell anyone
and just leave.

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,335
If you stay, it will put us in danger.

55
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,588
I resent you.

56
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,133
You know very well
I cannot say "no" to you.

57
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,225
-Follow me.
-What are you doing?

58
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,894
Then are you going to sleep with her
in the same room?

59
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,730
That is up to us to decide.

60
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,232
Stop it.

61
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,776
I will sleep at the kisaeng house tonight.

62
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,528
-Wait a second.
-Darn it.

63
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,447
Wear this.

64
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,782
Hurry.

65
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,229
He does not have a mistress whom he loves?

66
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,411
Gosh, whatever.

67
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,127
How can we sleep with the lights on?

68
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,788
My goodness, you startled me.

69
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,635
-About--
-I will kill you if you mention the kiss.

70
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,138
-Then who--
-And do not ask me whom I like.

71
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,391
-Then what--
-And stop asking about the cough.

72
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,185
You keep saying things
I do not understand.

73
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,104
Will you please let me talk?

74
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,314
Why are you not asking me anything?

75
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,274
I told you I do not have a mistress
whom I love.

76
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,318
I lied to you.
The woman I met in Hanyang--

77
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,320
Forget it. I am not curious.

78
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,282
Why not? Why are you not curious?

79
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:53,454
Because unlike what you think,
I do not have feelings for you.

80
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,126
-You are lying.
-No, I am not.

81
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,962
Hey.

82
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,258
Are you angry that I kissed you
without your consent?

83
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,259
No.

84
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,345
That is no big deal. It was just a kiss.

85
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,057
You are being so harsh.

86
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,102
I felt it. I bet you also felt--

87
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:20,314
You have never dated anyone
in your entire life, have you?

88
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,984
What?

89
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,237
Yes, I have. You are wrong.

90
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,240
I have dated tons of women
back in my hometown.

91
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,366
What are you talking about?

92
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,535
Yes, I am sure you have dated
a lot of women.

93
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,830
-In your dreams.
-You little...

94
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,624
It explains why you are
being delusional and absurd.

95
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,836
"Delusional and absurd"?

96
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,548
Yes. Now, if you got the message,
stop bothering me.

97
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,302
I came to tell you this.

98
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,141
She thinks I am a bother?

99
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,833
Please!

100
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,045
Let me see my mother!

101
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,464
Let me see my mother!

102
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,844
Once I exit that gate, I will never
be able to see my mother again!

103
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,639
So please...

104
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,934
Mother!

105
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,188
Mother.

106
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,482
-Mother!
-Your Highness!

107
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,276
Your Highness!

108
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,112
No!

109
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,949
Your Highness!

110
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,917
Did he not cry a lot?

111
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,171
He became calm after passing the gate.

112
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,802
I heard many people wailed

113
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,388
for my poor brother.

114
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,852
I wonder if they did the same
when I went through all those hardships.

115
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,523
I wailed for you, Your Majesty.

116
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,236
Yes, you were the only one.

117
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,907
Even my own father
did not acknowledge me as worthy.

118
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:40,204
And he even left behind a brutal will.

119
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,377
If you had not
gotten rid of it beforehand,

120
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,508
the throne would not have been mine.

121
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,720
Therefore,

122
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,556
you are the one person

123
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,310
I trust unconditionally.

124
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,940
Do you know that, Yun?

125
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,276
I am

126
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,738
extremely grateful, Your Majesty.

127
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,335
A secret letter written by the late king.

128
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,379
So the rumors were true.

129
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,383
They why did you not make a move earlier?

130
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,301
6 YEARS AGO

131
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,554
His Majesty took the throne
very unexpectedly,

132
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,223
and the Grand Prince was too young.

133
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,310
So we were waiting for the right moment.

134
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,230
However, you were one step ahead of us.

135
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,692
You will get punished for treason.

136
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,780
There will come a day
when you utterly regret

137
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,200
taking that letter from me.

138
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,864
You are...

139
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,200
He is His Majesty's firstborn son.

140
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,286
He is growing up to be
a smart and honest man.

141
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,248
Now that His Majesty has taken the throne,

142
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,127
it is time to take him back
to where he belongs.

143
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,421
-No, that cannot happen.
-Why?

144
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,215
He has become the King.

145
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,884
So there is no reason for His Majesty
to be nervous anymore.

146
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,564
DETHRONE THE CROWN PRINCE

147
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:16,026
AND MAKE GRAND PRINCE YEONGCHANG
THE NEW CROWN PRINCE

148
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,156
What is this?

149
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,701
Today, I punished the man
who hid this letter.

150
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,537
So what do you think?

151
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,331
Do you think His Majesty does not need
to be worried anymore?

152
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,168
I cannot believe this.

153
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:36,380
And we do not know why His Majesty
made such a decision that day.

154
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,299
His Majesty may have taken the throne,

155
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,551
but what if that does not solve anything?

156
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,139
Then you, me, and that kid

157
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,767
might end up dead.

158
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,940
So do not get your hopes up
and just go back to your hideout.

159
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,443
If you show up before me one more time,

160
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,447
I will not be able to show mercy.

161
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,719
My lord.

162
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,431
What do you mean Yun-jeo disappeared?

163
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,225
The Muwol Corps standing guard
are all dead.

164
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,893
Find him. Find him no matter what.

165
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,233
Did you bring the dead bodies
of the Muwol Corps that were there?

166
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,234
No.

167
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,861
The dead body inside
was found at the widow village.

168
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,993
There were signs of torture.

169
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,371
The man who hid near the widow village

170
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,790
probably killed her
and ran away to Hanyang.

171
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,168
What if he found something
by torturing her?

172
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,923
I want you to quietly find the boy
and gather the Muwol Corps.

173
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,594
Let us get rid of the local functionary

174
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,389
and bring back the Grand Prince.

175
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,309
Yes, my lord.

176
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,082
You found the boss?

177
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,587
Not exactly, but I think I can guess
who the boss is.

178
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,798
Then wait until the boss shows up
and beat the living soul out of him.

179
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,384
It is not that simple.

180
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,469
He talked about the island,
so it has to be him.

181
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,554
Yes?

182
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,933
But I think he is getting orders
from someone else.

183
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,311
Who is that darn fellow?

184
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,979
Let us teach that guy a lesson, too.

185
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,858
-The King.
-What?

186
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,737
"The King"?

187
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,363
The King of Joseon?

188
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:07,990
His Majesty?

189
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,409
-Yes.
-Watch what you say!

190
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,415
I know it is difficult to stay here
dressed like a woman.

191
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:20,294
But do not talk nonsense
with a straight face like that.

192
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,839
It hurts me to see you go crazy.

193
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,674
I know it does not make sense.

194
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:27,968
But

195
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,014
what if my father is
actually acquainted with His Majesty?

196
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,017
What if he is an aristocrat?

197
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,270
What if he was living on that island
because he did something bad?

198
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,773
And what if I am only stirring things up?

199
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:41,857
Something bad?

200
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:42,942
Treason?

201
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,238
"Treason"? My father?

202
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,324
No.

203
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,702
No, it cannot be.

204
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,163
My mother told me

205
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,000
that it was because of me.

206
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,044
No, you are probably mistaken.

207
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,881
Your father would never plot treason.
He is the most honest man alive.

208
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,007
He would never.

209
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,096
Anyway, I should not do anything rash.

210
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,847
So I will look into it more.

211
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,142
Yes, it is important to be sure.

212
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,020
By the way,

213
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,564
your eyes are swollen.

214
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,485
You look like a guy who got heartbroken
and cried all night.

215
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,947
-My gosh, that is nonsense.
-Let me see.

216
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,325
Master, where is Aeng-du?
I have not seen her since last night.

217
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,410
Aeng-du?

218
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,622
She keeps saying things I do not get
and will not stop crying.

219
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,626
I forgot to call him my sister.
I totally forgot.

220
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,545
I should have called him my sister.

221
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:53,554
He is my sister! He is my older sister!

222
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,348
-Yesterday, I was--
-That is enough.

223
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,351
Did you beat him?

224
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,478
Did you beat him already?

225
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,274
Is my brother dead?

226
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,736
Then beat me, too! Do the same to me!

227
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,321
Are you sure?

228
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,324
Okay, fine. Let us go now.

229
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,495
Oh, my goodness! Father!

230
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,623
Father, I am going to die! Father!

231
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,876
Father!

232
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,211
Where in the world is Aeng-du?

233
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,797
She is nowhere to be seen.

234
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,105
Where are you going?

235
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,692
-Off to work.
-To do laundry?

236
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,653
I guess not.

237
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,032
I will be working in the kitchen
at the kisaeng house starting today.

238
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,746
Father.

239
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,597
Are you not going to beat me?

240
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,433
If you are gone,
who will be here to taste my food?

241
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,020
Then what about my brother...

242
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,439
I mean, my sister?

243
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,566
There are two ladies
whom he is trying to protect.

244
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,151
So I decided not to beat him up for now.

245
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:35,114
Instead, will you do me a favor?

246
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,748
First, go ahead and fill your stomach.

247
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,209
I will ask you once you are full.

248
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,479
Gosh.

249
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,815
Do not go.

250
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,775
You know nothing
about working in the kitchen.

251
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,863
Do you not know why he wants you
to work in the kitchen? It is obvious.

252
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,865
You are so naive.

253
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,741
So he could separate the two of us.

254
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,119
I guess you know.

255
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,204
So do not go.

256
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,914
I need to pay you back my debt.

257
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,917
I will give you a discount. Do not go.

258
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,629
I told you to stop being so clingy!

259
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,895
No, I am going to be clingy.

260
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,106
-What?
-You said you do not like me.

261
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,650
And I am fine with that.

262
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:54,902
But you see,

263
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,154
I will make you like me.

264
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,492
So do not go to him.

265
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,503
How are you going to do that?

266
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,976
Hey!

267
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,328
What is the matter with you?

268
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,206
You are making me feel very uncomfortable,
so just go.

269
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,874
Go on.

270
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,974
I will do as you asked

271
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,851
and act like I do not know anything
for your sake.

272
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,230
But are you going to keep

273
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,440
sleeping in the same room?

274
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,485
What do you take me for?

275
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,697
The little kid is staying with us,
so stop asking me that.

276
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,323
You are worried for nothing.

277
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,159
Okay.

278
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,916
But I have a question.

279
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,795
You said you like someone.

280
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,840
I heard you loud and clear.

281
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,763
So tell me.

282
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,058
Is it him that you like?

283
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,447
Of course not. I have eyes, too.

284
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,407
Yes, of course.

285
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,826
He is not a likable fellow.

286
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,126
Then...

287
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,298
Is it...

288
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,008
Is it me?

289
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,593
No.

290
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,928
I just got drunk
and said something I did not mean.

291
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:35,312
You did not have to deny it so strongly.

292
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,820
Gosh.

293
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,948
I might as well just beat that weasel up.

294
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,200
Darn it.

295
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,786
Hey, sister. What are you doing?

296
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,746
Gosh, you startled me.

297
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,541
Were you badmouthing my sweet Lord Cha?

298
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,876
What?

299
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,546
"My sweet Lord Cha"?

300
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,466
I am sorry about how things turned out.

301
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,302
I really could not help myself.

302
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,428
Aeng-du.

303
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,764
What are you talking about?

304
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,974
I thought about it.

305
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,434
When you get married,

306
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,395
you have to eat with your spouse
three times a day until death do you part.

307
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:23,485
And if that is the case,
I figured he would be a better choice.

308
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,237
I apologize.

309
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,988
Hey, Aeng-du.

310
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:31,743
He is well-built, so kind.

311
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,163
He is always smiling at me.

312
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:39,543
He exactly is the kind of man
that Dong-ju told me I would find.

313
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,920
There is no doubt about it.

314
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,005
Gosh, that little...

315
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,098
My gosh, Lord Yeon.

316
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,308
My goodness.

317
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,686
No, wait.

318
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,274
-That is sweet.
-Let me pour you another glass.

319
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,405
So are you telling me

320
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,409
that you are like a father to Lady Kim?

321
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,743
Yes, of course.

322
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:17,873
I practically raised her myself.

323
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,333
Master. I mean, Father.

324
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,669
Will you please help me?

325
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,088
I am willing to do anything

326
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,133
to win Lady Kim's heart.

327
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,385
My goodness, really?

328
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,220
Let me go first.

329
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,474
I am a professional
when it comes to wooing women.

330
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,935
But of course,

331
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,898
that is only the case
when the other person is a woman.

332
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,442
Anyway,

333
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,696
the secret to winning a woman's heart...

334
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,239
-The secret?
-What is it?

335
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,241
What is the secret? Oh, gosh.

336
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,077
This is embarrassing.

337
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,930
You need to be indifferent
but kind at the same time.

338
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,432
That is the secret. Let me explain.

339
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,643
For example, when you help her
with something,

340
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,810
say, "You cannot even do this?

341
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,854
You might as well
just go and kill yourself!"

342
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,774
And then,

343
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:30,195
help her as if you have no other choice.

344
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,790
My goodness.

345
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,293
Just go kill yourself
if you cannot carry this yourself!

346
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,795
What?

347
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,516
Gosh, it is okay. What are you doing?

348
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,184
I will do it myself.

349
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,606
I am helping
because I have no other choice.

350
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,532
My goodness. Hey!

351
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,159
-Who taught you this nonsense?
-It is not nonsense.

352
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,036
It will make you think of me at night.

353
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,622
I am indifferent yet kind.
You will find me attractive.

354
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,374
-Goodness.
-My gosh.

355
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,932
What is with that look?
You said you do not like me.

356
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,521
What? How did I look at you?

357
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,409
Like this.

358
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,502
Where are you going?

359
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,546
It is none of your business.

360
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,010
Do not be late.
Come home for dinner, okay?

361
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,554
Do you hear me?

362
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:24,059
My goodness,
she never listens to her mother.

363
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,690
You think we should use
the magistrate of Ganghwa Island?

364
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,568
Will the people not oppose?

365
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,155
Many people still care
about the Grand Prince.

366
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,283
We will not give them a reason to rebel.

367
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,619
So do not worry, Your Majesty.

368
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,662
And

369
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,208
it will be better for us
if people cause a fuss.

370
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,296
It will be a chance for me to find out

371
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,965
who could possibly betray me.

372
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,121
Lee In-woo, the local functionary,

373
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,415
is the one who sent
the Grand Prince into exile.

374
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,292
Tomorrow, his father is having
his 60th birthday party.

375
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,337
I heard he only invited
family and close relatives.

376
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,964
He must have been worried

377
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,341
that there might be killers
among the guests.

378
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,095
But he will never expect them to be
the working ladies there.

379
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,889
A total of seven including me
and Jeong-suk will head to Hanyang.

380
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,808
And once we are done,

381
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,186
we will ask around about Deul-re.

382
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,606
Okay. Then should I follow the rest
to Ganghwa Island?

383
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,651
Please let the others know.

384
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,236
Okay.

385
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,158
My goodness, the entire Muwol Corps
will be out of the village.

386
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,952
He is a better choice?

387
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,078
I cannot believe...

388
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,079
Cha Yul-mu, that jerk.

389
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,789
She likes food better than me.

390
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,715
Are you going somewhere far away?

391
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,804
Someone is holding
a huge 60th birthday party in Hanyang.

392
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,266
And we are going to make a scene.

393
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,645
Hanyang? Let me help you ladies.

394
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,606
No, it is an important and dangerous task.

395
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,608
Hanyang is in a mess right now.

396
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,110
His Majesty apparently sent
to Ganghwa Island--

397
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,654
You brat. You talk too much.

398
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,699
What did His Majesty do?

399
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,203
You do not need to know.

400
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,706
Take care.

401
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,215
Have a safe trip.

402
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,011
Ganghwa Island and his Majesty?

403
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,144
I got a letter saying the Muwol Corps
are on their way.

404
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,772
Is everything ready?

405
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,232
Yes, my lord.

406
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,567
Lord Lee's family is busy
getting ready for the party,

407
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,319
so it will not be hard to blend in.

408
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:23,780
Okay.

409
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,471
You must be up to something again.

410
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,231
Long time no see.

411
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,525
You...

412
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,206
Your Majesty, what brings you here
all of a sudden?

413
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,960
I told you to call me "Lord"
outside the palace.

414
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,671
Is he inside?

415
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,132
Yes, he is taking a rest.

416
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,258
Is that so?

417
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,677
Then

418
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,722
let me surprise him.

419
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,896
Where are my sons?

420
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,023
That is what I want to ask you.

421
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,191
Where is your son?

422
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,862
I mean, where is His Majesty's son?

423
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,363
What is up with you all of a sudden?

424
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,866
We lived like we did not exist,
just as you asked.

425
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,789
Then you never should have
caught anyone's eye.

426
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,838
-My lord.
-Is he not alone?

427
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,893
Your Majesty.

428
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,135
How about a game of chess?

429
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,641
Sure, Your Majesty.

430
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,868
All the entrances are blocked.

431
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,495
Follow me.

432
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,136
Mother.

433
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,111
I finished making it.

434
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,448
I can finally leave now.

435
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,368
Yes, I should leave.

436
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,039
I was going to leave
as soon as I finished making this anyway.

437
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,087
Gosh, the rice is getting cold.
Why is she not coming home?

438
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,132
Do you really think she would
come home for this food?

439
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,550
What do you mean?

440
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,220
Lord Cha already fed her
all sorts of good food.

441
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,767
Today, he made rice cakes
and ginger cookies.

442
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,144
What did I tell you?

443
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,562
If a woman has to choose a husband,

444
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,691
he is a much better candidate
than you are.

445
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,278
Gosh, I might as well just...

446
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,252
Are you not going to eat?

447
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,046
I already ate.

448
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,597
It is your loss if you do not eat.

449
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,487
What goes through your mind
when you cook in the kitchen?

450
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,907
Normally, nothing is on my mind.

451
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,035
But I was very happy when I made this.

452
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,579
Why is that?

453
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,333
Because I was with the woman I love.

454
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,045
Is she a kisaeng?

455
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,593
Yes, she is, Your Majesty.

456
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,143
You have a lot of free time.

457
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,604
I envy your life, my cousin.

458
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,482
Do not try to covet it.

459
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,943
I also enjoy my life very much,
Your Majesty.

460
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,001
Did you see anyone suspicious?

461
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,380
We checked everyone,
but no one seemed suspicious.

462
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,424
Do not let your guard down.

463
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,552
Check every single man
who enters this house.

464
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,095
Yes, my lord.

465
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,926
I will get going first.

466
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,261
You go and borrow a horse
from the kisaeng house and follow me.

467
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,096
Yes, my lord.

468
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,244
Hello.

469
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,622
Is this the famous Yeonhwa House?

470
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,166
Yes, welcome.

471
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,752
-Is this your first time?
-Yes.

472
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,797
I am the magistrate of Ganghwa Island.

473
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,174
And I was on my way to Hanyang
for a party.

474
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,176
But I was told this place is famous,

475
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,303
-"Ganghwa Island"?
-so I dropped by.

476
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,348
Thank you for stopping by.
Please come this way.

477
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,767
-This way.
-By the way,

478
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,853
I heard there is a kisaeng
named Mae Hwa-su.

479
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,614
Yes.

480
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,450
His Majesty banished his little brother.

481
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,954
And he ended up in Ganghwa Island.

482
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,623
His Majesty is so cruel.

483
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,376
My goodness, do not say that.

484
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,004
Thanks to that,

485
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,674
I got the chance to be promoted.

486
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,093
What does His Majesty's brother
living in exile

487
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,012
have anything to do with your promotion?

488
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,432
You see, there is a party in Hanyang...

489
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,813
Never mind.

490
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,985
Just know that something great
is going to happen.

491
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,779
What does he mean?

492
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,536
This way?

493
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,877
My goodness, I am so tired.

494
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,313
Are you going to start a business?

495
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,939
There are already merchants

496
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,150
who have long been delivering items
to the court ladies.

497
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,401
So it will not be easy.

498
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,070
No.

499
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,531
I only asked
because someone wanted to know.

500
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,621
My goodness.

501
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,798
Gosh, that feels nice.

502
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,553
Who are you?

503
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,348
You need to talk
about that party in Hanyang.

504
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,849
I cannot tell you.

505
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:54,809
Never.

506
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,143
Even if your life is at risk?

507
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,561
Mother.

508
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,107
Mother?

509
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,319
My goodness!

510
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,947
He is a pervert! Gather some people!

511
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,031
Oh, okay.

512
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,953
My goodness. Oh, gosh!

513
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,331
My gosh.

514
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,671
Madam Chun! I am the magistrate
of Ganghwa Island.

515
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,298
And this widow is trying to kill me.

516
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,592
He put a knife to my throat.

517
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,387
I was just...

518
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,390
Well...

519
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,939
Tell me why you are going to Hanyang.

520
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,691
Spare no details.

521
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,746
I cannot believe he called
the magistrate of Ganghwa Island

522
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,291
to kill his little brother in exile.

523
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,714
So you are the boss?
The boss of Muwol Corps?

524
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,424
I will explain after you come back.

525
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,551
This is very urgent.

526
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,305
Once you find Ssuk,
have her withdraw everyone

527
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,682
and tell her to go to the temple
where Lord Lee is hiding.

528
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,559
Tell her we fell into a trap.

529
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,769
Okay, do not worry.

530
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,677
There needs to be some noise
to get the job done.

531
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,221
But why is it so quiet?

532
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,847
Something feels wrong.

533
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,643
-We should withdraw.
-What are you talking about?

534
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,811
No way.

535
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,586
The women are the killers! Arrest them!

536
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,664
Kill everyone who saw us.

537
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,351
It is hot!

538
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,438
-Lady Kim?
-Madam Chun sent me here.

539
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,273
She did? Why?

540
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,817
She wanted me to warn you
that this will happen.

541
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,414
Lord Lee is hiding at a temple
in Inwang Mountain.

542
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,540
What?

543
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,460
-Can you find the way?
-Me?

544
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,138
I cannot leave you here.

545
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,973
This place is too dangerous for you.

546
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,267
We will go as soon as we are done,
so try to keep him there.

547
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,352
Okay.

548
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,409
It will be no fun to just buy time.

549
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,171
My goodness.

550
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,340
You should go back.

551
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,717
This is a restricted area.

552
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,886
If that is the case,

553
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,098
then you should have been more careful.

554
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,808
What?

555
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,073
Did we kill everyone?

556
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,367
I did not see anyone escape.

557
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,829
Let us go. We do not know
how long Lady Kim can stall.

558
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,972
Why do you do this?

559
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,557
What?

560
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,934
Why do you do something so dangerous

561
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,519
when you are free to live a normal life?

562
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,397
Do you all need money like me?

563
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,736
Most of us live by ourselves in hiding,
so why would we need money?

564
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,738
Then what for?

565
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,200
Because we are the only ones
who can live such comfortable lives.

566
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,327
What?

567
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,676
My in-laws punished me
for not dying after my husband.

568
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,347
He died three days after we got married.

569
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,600
If I had not escape back then,

570
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:56,230
I would have died after a husband
whom I just married.

571
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,691
But this is nothing
compared to the others.

572
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,866
Are you okay?

573
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:12,788
We are able to live comfortable lives
thanks to Madam Chun.

574
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,123
But widows outside the village
still are treated very harshly.

575
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,292
You surely know that yourself.

576
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,337
-Yes.
-We started out

577
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,006
by secretly helping widows in need.

578
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,718
Because no one else would step up

579
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,513
to help a widow who lost her husband.

580
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,727
Then did you kill Lord Lee
because he harmed the widows?

581
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,273
No.

582
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,277
But we did it to make a better world

583
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,363
for people who have no power like us.

584
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,242
That is what I believe.

585
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,503
We made sure Lee In-woo was dead

586
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,088
and made it seem like he died from a fall.

587
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,132
You did great.

588
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:06,967
We would not have succeeded...

589
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,555
if it were not for Lady Kim.

590
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:14,975
I made you a promise,

591
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:18,228
so I guess we can no longer
delay your admittance.

592
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,940
Welcome to the Muwol Corps, Lady Kim.

593
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,946
Jeong-suk is waiting for you outside.

594
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,073
She will explain in detail.

595
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,077
Meanwhile, the two of us
need to talk in private.

596
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,748
Okay, I will leave then.

597
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,308
Is there a problem?

598
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,114
He is not just some homeless scamp.

599
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,033
He is the magistrate of Ganghwa Island.

600
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,118
He cannot be a pervert.

601
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,788
Besides, those two are
nowhere to be found.

602
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,051
He did not come home?

603
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,594
No.

604
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:37,599
So there is nothing to tell you
about Nok-du and Dong-ju.

605
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,606
But why are you so tired?

606
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:46,608
My goodness.

607
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,069
Dong-ju kept wandering around all night

608
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,780
instead of going to bed.

609
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,783
So I could not sleep properly either.

610
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,786
Dong-ju did?

611
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,832
Yes. She constantly sighed,

612
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,751
opened the door to check outside,

613
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:10,006
and walked around out in the yard.
Then she kept saying this.

614
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,843
"How dare he sleep outside?

615
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,803
How dare he not come home
without even telling me?"

616
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,119
That is right.

617
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,830
We make wine here

618
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,331
and sell it to the kisaeng house.

619
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,250
And the money we make from that

620
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:49,921
is used for the Muwol Corps
and the widows.

621
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,007
It is a very beautiful story.

622
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,903
You did great today. You can go.

623
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,655
Let her stand guard with us tonight.

624
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,073
No, not tonight.

625
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,205
It is too early to overwork yourself.
Get some rest.

626
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:24,956
Okay.

627
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,938
Oh my goodness.

628
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,653
Is it you?

629
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,036
Dong-ju.

630
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,247
My lord.

631
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,586
-You cannot come in here.
-Yes, I can.

632
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,964
I am allowed to.

633
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,466
Pardon?

634
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,694
We got rid of Lee In-woo,
but this is just the beginning.

635
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,362
His Majesty might be thinking

636
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,657
that there are people who are in support
of the Grand Prince.

637
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,118
Do you think His Highness will be safe?

638
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,162
I sent someone to bring His Highness here.

639
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,998
-Are you saying--
-Tomorrow.

640
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,043
We will carry out our mission tomorrow.

641
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,727
WIDOW VILLAGE, MEN FORBIDDEN

642
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,092
We are prepared for everything.

643
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:44,346
But His Majesty is very insecure
right now. Must we do it now?

644
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,472
What if we keep delaying it

645
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,183
and end up failing to accomplish
our mission?

646
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,184
You are right.

647
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,270
It might be the perfect timing
when there are plenty of distractions.

648
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,273
-There is no need to wait. Let us hurry--
-Do not bother.

649
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,442
There is no need to hurry.

650
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,654
-What in the world--
-Oh, right.

651
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,783
I also took care of what was urgent.

652
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:08,471
Once I exit that gate, I will never
be able to see my mother again!

653
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,473
So please...

654
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,810
-Is there no one outside?
-There are people outside.

655
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,687
But they are all my people.

656
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:18,398
What do you say?
Should I ask them to come inside?

657
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,775
What have you done to the Grand Prince?

658
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,282
I killed him.

659
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,132
Are you really

660
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,385
going to keep your promise?

661
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,012
Of course.

662
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,306
Your job...

663
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,646
begins now.

664
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,171
Mother.

665
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,633
Mother.

666
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,189
How dare you!

667
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,222
-It is me.
-Hey.

668
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,600
Do you know how long I waited for you?

669
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,656
Let us go outside.

670
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,252
Hey.

671
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,464
Why are you not looking at me?

672
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,258
What are you talking about?

673
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,552
Go on. Stay somewhere bright.

674
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,970
Why are you not coming with me?

675
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,515
I will explain that next time.

676
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,059
The guest at the kisaeng house...

677
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,186
He was not a pervert, was he?

678
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,731
Where did you suddenly disappear to?

679
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,819
Why did you come...

680
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,364
to the widow village?

681
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,410
I will also explain that next time.

682
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,107
I really do not want to cause a fuss.

683
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,567
Prince Neungyang!

684
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:38,658
PRINCE NEUNGYANG,
LATER ON BECOMES KING INJO

685
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,819
There is no need to complicate things.

686
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:19,616
Instead of the young and foolish
Grand Prince Yeongchang,

687
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,160
you can use me instead.

688
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,206
Make me become the king.

689
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,251
That is the only thing that has changed.

690
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,629
Did you think I would feel threatened
by some cheap blackmail?

691
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,631
My goodness, that is not what this is.

692
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,342
If I wanted to threaten you,

693
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,224
I would have done a lot more.

694
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,393
Today,

695
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,396
I just came to say hello.

696
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,447
You say you want to become the king.

697
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,243
But do you think you have what it takes?

698
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:08,242
A kisaeng house
that financially supports a widow village?

699
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:10,703
Bring me the madam

700
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:14,373
and all the widows who are close to her.

701
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,376
If I were the King's son,
I at least would not have gotten upset

702
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,879
that I had to stay hidden
throughout my entire life.

703
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,173
I heard you joined the Muwol Corps.

704
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,091
And I heard you are planning treason.

705
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:25,927
THE WAR

706
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:29,472
Everyone in the Muwol Corps must
leave the village tomorrow night.

707
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,392
Then would it not matter if I kill him?

708
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,436
BEGINS

709
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:39,899
I will not ask you to like me.

710
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:41,901
Just do not disappear.

711
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:43,861
Please.

712
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,322
