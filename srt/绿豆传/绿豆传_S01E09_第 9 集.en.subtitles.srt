1
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,962
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,881
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,270
His sleeve was torn?

4
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,813
Yes, your Majesty.

5
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,993
You there! Step out--

6
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,080
My gosh, what is happening?

7
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,999
It is all right.

8
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,849
-Hold on--
-Stop.

9
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,393
I know him.

10
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,353
He is not the one you are looking for.

11
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,063
Sorry?

12
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,483
My apologies.

13
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,736
I will look elsewhere.

14
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,451
CERAMICS

15
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,536
Let us go.

16
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,959
Were you the chief police officer?

17
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,880
Yes, I am currently undercover
in search of someone.

18
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:55,967
But

19
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:01,431
are you two going to stay here?

20
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,141
Sorry?

21
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,771
No, my lord.

22
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,401
By the way, do you know this man's name?

23
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,446
Have you gotten to know him first
before going on a date?

24
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,952
Why should I know his name?

25
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,122
I fell in love at first sight
at the market and went up to him.

26
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,751
We will get to know each other in time.

27
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,551
What a bold woman you are.

28
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,017
I hear that it has been a while
since you last visited Hanyang

29
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,311
after moving to the countryside
a long time ago.

30
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,397
Yes, I wanted to become successful,

31
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,650
so I moved to Hanyang
despite my parents' disapproval.

32
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,527
You are from a family
of civil servants for generations.

33
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,197
And you are weak.
No wonder your parents were worried

34
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,907
about you taking
the military service exam.

35
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,328
But if you are determined, keep trying.

36
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,747
Yes, I plan on doing that.

37
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,052
I have interrupted you two for too long.

38
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,096
I will get going now.

39
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,057
-But we are--
-Good night.

40
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,858
You two look great together.

41
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,529
Thank you.

42
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,831
Are you planning on staying with him
all night? Just make up an excuse.

43
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,671
I will get going now that it is done.

44
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,256
Bye.

45
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,385
I told you earlier.

46
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,053
I will not let you leave.

47
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,142
I have something to do here.

48
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,852
Is that why you left me?

49
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,645
What is it that you have to do?

50
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,898
-I cannot say.
-Why not?

51
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,484
Just like how you cannot tell me
why you dressed like a woman

52
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,571
to get into the widow village
and why you are here with a fake name.

53
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,198
I have my reasons, okay?

54
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,412
Fine. Do as you please.

55
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,748
But keep the promise.

56
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,127
-You stamped your thumbprint on this.
-What is this?

57
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,466
Is this the promissory note?

58
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,551
I have finally found you
after you ran off with my money,

59
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,011
so why would I let you go?

60
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,430
You are not going anywhere
until you pay me back,

61
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,182
including the interest. Understood?

62
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,772
-Go.
-Hey!

63
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,443
He is your son?

64
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,531
Yes, Your Majesty.

65
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,535
Remember how I had a son back then?

66
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,790
20 years ago, when I made it out alive,
I came home

67
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,419
and fled with my wife and my son.

68
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,842
Nok-du was not your son's name
as far as I remember.

69
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,430
How could I have kept his birth name
when we lived in hiding?

70
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,433
Is that right?

71
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,061
I must see your son.

72
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,438
Where is he?

73
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,775
I am sorry. But I do not know that myself.

74
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,486
He thinks that I am trapped in this place,

75
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,114
and he hid.

76
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,807
I want my own room.

77
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,312
I do not trust you.

78
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,690
Follow me and do not complain.

79
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,447
Are you keeping an eye on me?

80
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,950
Why? Are you going to run away
when you have the chance?

81
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,167
How is your wound?

82
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,835
Do you really care?

83
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,716
How could you just leave?

84
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,302
I was unconscious.
We could have never met again.

85
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,642
What does that have
anything to do with me?

86
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,979
Do you really...

87
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,094
Fine.

88
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,972
Never mind about me.
Just pay back what you owe.

89
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,975
-Okay?
-All right.

90
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,603
You do not mind me, either.

91
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,023
Who says I will?
I have no feelings for you anymore.

92
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,359
I never had any to begin with.

93
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,792
-This is scorching hot!
-Do not run!

94
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,380
This looks scrumptious.

95
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,673
That is hot!

96
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,592
One chicken would have been enough.

97
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,594
Do you not think this is too much?

98
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,554
Are you not proud of him?

99
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,848
He passed his first exam
despite his condition.

100
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,434
Once he passes the palace examination,
he can work in the palace.

101
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,602
He needs to eat well, indeed.

102
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,271
Keep your stomach full
before taking an exam, right?

103
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,148
You cannot be stingy with food.

104
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,900
Exactly. Food goes bad if you do not
eat it right away.

105
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,528
Still, we are a small family of four.

106
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,572
Do you not think having two chickens
for a meal--

107
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,407
Stop it!

108
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,993
Why are you always nagging?

109
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,496
Well, I just...

110
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,841
Breakfast is ready.

111
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,052
I am going to open the door.

112
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,432
My goodness!

113
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,517
What is wrong?

114
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,736
Look at that scamp.

115
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:11,545
You see, she has terrible sleeping habits.

116
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,090
We were definitely far apart
when we fell asleep.

117
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,384
We are just telling you in case you get
the wrong idea.

118
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,427
She ran away with my money--

119
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,097
Yes, he caught me by coincidence.

120
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,725
Our relationship is that of a creditor
and a debtor.

121
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,519
Indeed. The interest is
a whopping 70 percent,

122
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,354
He is such a mean moneylender.

123
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,148
-We have no feelings for each other.
-That is true.

124
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,406
Now that you are here, maybe Nok-du will
stop crying every night.

125
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,118
Aeng-du!

126
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,621
I cried because the wound hurt,
not because of her.

127
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,333
Sure, sure. Let us just eat.

128
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,085
Anyway, welcome.

129
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,462
It is so nice to see you again.
You are beautiful.

130
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,177
Have you all been well?

131
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,347
Did you get to eat a lot of good food
in Hanyang?

132
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,310
I am only eating to survive. That is all.

133
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,896
That is not true.

134
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:16,152
I miss the meat pancake
and the Korean kebab.

135
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,863
Yul-mu...

136
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,115
Here, have some of this.

137
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,242
Stop talking nonsense!

138
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,661
What do you think will happen
if he comes here?

139
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:26,787
Think before you talk!

140
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,957
By the way,
how did you end up with them here?

141
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,333
How?

142
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,252
How?

143
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:40,134
I am just worried about this innocent man
not being able to adjust in Hanyang.

144
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,512
Although...

145
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,684
I could not care less about him.

146
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,479
I am just here out of kindness.

147
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,900
Let us just leave it at that

148
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,402
-and just eat.
-Yes.

149
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,612
Let us eat.

150
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,327
Gee.

151
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,998
You guys.

152
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,834
This is too much love to handle
so early in the morning.

153
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:18,589
She needs to eat well to work hard
to pay me back.

154
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,971
I am heading to work now.

155
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,307
I have somewhere to head to as well.

156
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,143
Gee.

157
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,562
Bye now.

158
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,859
What is this nonsense?

159
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,111
I am taking this, too.

160
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,936
The government troops and Prince Neungyang

161
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,146
are all keeping a close watch on
Chancellor Heo and Father.

162
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,190
Is this all because of me?

163
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,734
What is at the bottom of all of this?

164
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,912
I heard that you are not sleeping well.

165
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,791
Please have some of this.
This is good for insomnia.

166
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,210
Thank you.

167
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,296
But

168
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,842
is it really okay for me to just stay here
and do nothing?

169
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,470
"Do nothing"?

170
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,600
You are diligently getting prepared
to help me out in the future.

171
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,352
When the time comes,

172
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,439
I will give you back everything
he took from you.

173
00:14:58,981 --> 00:14:59,982
Yes.

174
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,902
I will also do my best to be of help.

175
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,969
I do not know what you did wrong.

176
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,596
But every time she hears your name,

177
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,724
she gets mad, saying that you fooled her.

178
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,811
We are obliged to follow her orders.

179
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,563
I hope you understand.

180
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,482
Yes, I do.

181
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,401
I will not tell anyone
that I met you today.

182
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,404
I think you should just give up--

183
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,447
No, I cannot.

184
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,117
Can you please help me out?

185
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,078
Anything would be fine. Please.

186
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,830
I do not know...

187
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,377
I think there is something you can do,
actually.

188
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,040
What happened?
What do you mean Madam Chun is dead?

189
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,501
I should have protected her.

190
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,670
I do not know what to say.

191
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,883
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

192
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,803
What about the widows from the village?

193
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,974
We brought them to a safe place.

194
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,978
Anyway, who on earth shot the arrow?

195
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,063
Did you see his face?

196
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,734
He was wearing a mask and was fast.

197
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,111
The government troops
were surrounding her,

198
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,738
yet he boldly shot his arrow and ran away.

199
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,323
Who did this and why?

200
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,200
I will find him and kill him at all costs.

201
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,703
Whoever it is.

202
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,040
Do you still not know?

203
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,348
Did you just say it was Chancellor Heo?

204
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,602
Think about who ordered to move the base

205
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,145
and who would be angry

206
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,814
at Madam Chun taking my side.

207
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,318
I need more information than that.

208
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,029
Chancellor Heo is locked up in his house.

209
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,865
His Majesty is rightfully suspicious
but has lost the evidence.

210
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,451
So he has locked him in
for the time being.

211
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,952
Does that mean

212
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,998
that Madam Chun was the evidence?

213
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,710
Had Madam Chun been alive,

214
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,463
Chancellor Heo would have died by now.

215
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,431
Do you think it is a coincidence
that Deul-re disappeared?

216
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,686
Her body was found
at Chancellor Heo's place.

217
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,152
I will help you get revenge on him.

218
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,364
What do you say?

219
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,951
You can become the new leader
of the Muwol Corps, get your revenge,

220
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,162
and build a new world with me.

221
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,128
Why are you hesitating?

222
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,088
This is what you must do.

223
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,014
The Muwol Corps
will create a new base here.

224
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,766
And since our soldiers are ready,

225
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,101
we should get ready for--

226
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,062
But Chancellor Heo
has not made his mind up yet.

227
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,900
I believe that we do not need more people
to carry out our plan.

228
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,112
-Do you not agree?
-I do agree.

229
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,823
Indeed.

230
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,618
Before we revolt,

231
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,288
what do you say
to taking an oath together?

232
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,040
To promise to stay together

233
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,334
and to share responsibility
for whatever may happen.

234
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,382
We trust you, Prince Neungyang.

235
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,635
But I think we should keep a record,
just to be sure.

236
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,937
Fine, then.

237
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,151
Let us begin by taking an oath together.

238
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,406
I am here to see Park.

239
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,832
Great!

240
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,769
He is a brother of a court lady
that I know of.

241
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,814
He gets paid to introduce
servants to his sister.

242
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,441
But she is such a nasty woman that

243
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,235
she always fires and replaces
her servants.

244
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,074
I think the siblings may be scammers.

245
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,678
I would like to become a servant.

246
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,938
Even though it is a servant position,

247
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,275
do you really think getting
into the palace is this easy?

248
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,652
Is this not enough?

249
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,365
Not even close.

250
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,244
But there is a way.

251
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,543
Sign this.

252
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,631
You will have a stable income
in the palace,

253
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,717
so three months should be enough
to pay me back.

254
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,189
-Hold on.
-What?

255
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,239
YOU WILL PAY BACK 1,000 NYANG

256
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,868
"Three months"?

257
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,329
30 years would not be enough.

258
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,206
Gee.

259
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,335
There are quick ones like you at times.

260
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,337
But what good is that?

261
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,466
You may walk in as you wish,
but cannot get out as you wish.

262
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,094
Let me go!

263
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,720
Stay still, you have to sign this anyway.

264
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,183
Hey!

265
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,227
Gosh.

266
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,819
People in Hanyang
have no sense of morality.

267
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,487
She is mine.

268
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,739
She needs to pay me back first.

269
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,284
Do you have a death wish?

270
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,453
Kill them!

271
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,605
Are you okay?

272
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,607
Of course I am.

273
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,442
Just to make it clear,

274
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,154
had I been healthy now, I would have
defeated them--

275
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,822
You are bleeding.

276
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,078
I am not bleeding
because I have been beaten up.

277
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,540
-I just bumped into--
-No, you are bleeding here!

278
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,588
This?

279
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,678
It ruptured because I used
the muscle too much.

280
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,805
-It will be fine.
-What do you mean?

281
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,849
Whatever caused it, you are bleeding!

282
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,102
Where is the doctor?

283
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,812
Follow me.

284
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:52,365
Were you the only one
who survived that night?

285
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,287
I was the only one who was
still alive that night, Your Majesty.

286
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,889
What brings you here so late at night?

287
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,892
You never visit me anymore,

288
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:23,855
so I wanted to come here to see you,
although it may be improper of me.

289
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,483
I am sorry.

290
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,153
What brings you here?

291
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,033
-Chancellor Heo--
-I do not want to talk about that.

292
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,328
This is not your business.

293
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,038
Not my business?

294
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,624
I am just concerned.

295
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,503
I am just worried that your old friend is
not being loyal to you

296
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,923
and may have caused you distress.

297
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,305
Do you realize that you have changed
so quickly?

298
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,186
When I first came to the palace
as Crown Princess,

299
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,106
you had been so kind and warm.

300
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,943
-But after that day--
-After what day?

301
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,196
I do not believe that I took no part
in the loss of the Prince, but--

302
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,281
Queen!

303
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,909
I warned you multiple times to never
bring this up again.

304
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,122
I did not know that he did so wrong

305
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,292
that his death could not be spoken about
for the past 20 years

306
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,544
and undeserving of his father's mourning.

307
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,921
Yes, that is the kind of a father I am,

308
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,425
so you should stop worrying
about pointless things, too.

309
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,866
The bleeding will not stop. Is that okay?

310
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,952
Of course not.

311
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,080
If he keeps bleeding, he will die.

312
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,332
What?

313
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,836
Goodness.

314
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,505
Please wait a minute.

315
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,305
Grab that and wipe some blood off him.

316
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,557
Look at how much your husband is bleeding!

317
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,642
-She is not my wife.
-He is not my husband.

318
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,769
-What?
-Well...

319
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,194
Let me see...

320
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,039
I can wipe it myself.

321
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,542
Gosh, you are right.

322
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,505
Why?

323
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,216
You said that you do not care
whatever happens to me,

324
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,843
so why are you worried about me?

325
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,428
Who says I am?

326
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,848
I just feel bad because you got hurt
because of me.

327
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,225
Your face says otherwise.

328
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,645
You look like you are worried sick
and feel terrible about it.

329
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,400
I am tired of denying it.

330
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,819
Think however you please.

331
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,084
About the gambling house...

332
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,505
Why has the police not arrested
everyone there yet?

333
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:03,426
The police always raid
with a huge group of officers,

334
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,428
so they just sneak out the back door

335
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,222
when they hear the officers coming.

336
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,060
Why did you go there
when you knew how dangerous it would be?

337
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,025
No, never mind.

338
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,652
Hey,

339
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,863
are you not hungry?

340
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,744
Would you like to go and get some gukbap?

341
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,997
That is what you are thinking of
right now?

342
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:42,799
Did you steal all their money
while all that was happening?

343
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,634
Whatever.

344
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,053
-Give it to me. Pay me back.
-Nonsense.

345
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,013
-This is my money.
-You owe me. Pay me back.

346
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,640
I took this. What are you talking about?

347
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,184
I was the one who took it.

348
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,644
Fine, do not pay me back.

349
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,440
You had no part in stealing this.

350
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,984
Then let us trade.

351
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,152
-Nonsense.
-I saved you,

352
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,196
-so this is fair.
-No.

353
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,323
-Give it to me.
-I told you that I will pay you back.

354
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,408
Are you two

355
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,119
having a lovers' quarrel?

356
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,261
What is up with you?

357
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,263
You keep looking back.

358
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,475
I definitely think I am right.

359
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,643
About what?

360
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,647
I think I just saw the young mistress
who we used to serve.

361
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,732
What?

362
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,821
You mean Eun-seo?

363
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,072
Yes.

364
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,283
She surely looked like Eun-seo.

365
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,162
Had she been alive,
she would be around that age.

366
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,373
What are you talking about?
We took care of everything back then.

367
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,876
Do you not remember?

368
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,170
We dug up the whole ground

369
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,964
and still could not find her corpse.

370
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,219
INN

371
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,722
Is it okay for me to join

372
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,516
your date like this?

373
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,102
It is completely fine.

374
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,569
Remember how you two were so busy
trying to kick me out?

375
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,030
You have changed.

376
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,324
Yes.

377
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,869
Now that I have gotten to know him,
I realize that he is nothing special.

378
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,456
Look who is talking!

379
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,170
Are you undercover again?

380
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:48,257
What happened to the man you were after?

381
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,135
I did not get him.

382
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,639
I am not working today.

383
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,768
I just could not sleep, so I thought
I would go on the swing like you.

384
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,104
Swing?

385
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:13,449
We met at the swing over there.

386
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,787
He said he wanted to ride the swing
with the saddest eyes.

387
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,624
So, you have not been able to sleep well?

388
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,126
Sleep is...

389
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,336
Everyone needs good sleep.

390
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,256
You must be exhausted.

391
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,428
But thanks to my insomnia, I met you.

392
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,597
And you brightened up my day,
so I am good.

393
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,603
Well,

394
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,273
would you like me to tell you a way?

395
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,526
What?

396
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,777
What do you mean, a way?

397
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,990
A way to protect that child
from His Majesty.

398
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,701
Is there such a way?

399
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,412
It is for him to become the King.

400
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,291
-What?
-You said that he is wise and intelligent.

401
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,626
He looks like it, indeed. Your son,

402
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,921
I mean, His Majesty's son.

403
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,257
What do you think
about dethroning His Majesty

404
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,511
and enthroning his son?

405
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,813
Keep up!

406
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,774
Go slower!

407
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,822
I thought he said he knows
how to fight off my insomnia.

408
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,202
I promise you that I will!

409
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,497
Goodness!

410
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,835
-Come on, let us go.
-Gosh.

411
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,880
Fine, I will go.

412
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,508
Hey!

413
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,843
His Majesty is nothing but a lunatic
who blocks everyone out

414
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,805
and kills everyone and anyone in his way.

415
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,890
And who gave him that power?

416
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,059
Who made him block everyone out?

417
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,686
Should I not,
the one who gave him the power,

418
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,439
be the one to take it away?

419
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,690
Do not play games with me.

420
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,319
You can just replace the King
if he is not worthy?

421
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,364
Then, if the next one does not
live up to your expectations,

422
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,865
will you replace him too?

423
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,659
That is not what I mean!

424
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:23,412
Do not be arrogant
and do what you are supposed to do.

425
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,125
There are people who still follow me.

426
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,461
-Hand over the boy to me and...
-That is enough.

427
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,132
You want him to dethrone his father
and enthrone himself?

428
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,261
I will never let Nok-du do such a thing,

429
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:42,014
and you have no right
to dethrone the King.

430
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,975
Stop dreaming.

431
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,041
What do you think?

432
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,836
I do feel refreshed, indeed.

433
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:16,215
You will sleep well tonight, too,
since your body is tired.

434
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,387
Live each day to the fullest,
running around nonstop.

435
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,057
You will be absolutely beat by sunset.

436
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,686
Do not order your men around
just because you are in charge,

437
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,815
but try catching thieves
and do interrogations yourself, too.

438
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,866
There must be many people who cannot sleep

439
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,785
because of the incompetent King.

440
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,084
Well,

441
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:57,673
people talk behind the King's back
when he is not present, do they not?

442
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,551
Sure.

443
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:10,061
Have you ever met the King yourself?

444
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,856
No.

445
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,652
I am just an old officer.

446
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,489
You seem

447
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,992
like you are very interested in the King.

448
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,827
-Not at all.
-Not at all.

449
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,871
What?

450
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,748
Well,

451
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,585
I thought you were asking me.
No, I am completely uninterested.

452
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,129
I see.

453
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,800
Right.

454
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,018
If I may, may I ask you a question?

455
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,730
You usually sleep alone at night, right?

456
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,527
Yes, why do you ask?

457
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:04,282
I used to have trouble
falling asleep alone.

458
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,993
But

459
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,537
it helped.

460
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,665
What helped?

461
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,836
Having someone beside me.

462
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,052
What do you think?

463
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,388
Even the smartest ghosts would
pass right by.

464
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,361
Someone who cares and worries for me.

465
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,668
I do not know your story,

466
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,005
but if you have trouble falling asleep
for the same reasons as me,

467
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,051
you should try asking
any family member for help.

468
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,762
Ask to stay with you for the night.

469
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,439
You were badmouthing me, right?

470
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,317
No, she...

471
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,362
I hate how quick-witted you are.

472
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,741
I knew it. What did you say?

473
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,535
-You know.
-What?

474
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,747
I told you to not talk about that!

475
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,749
That? What do you mean?

476
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,292
Then what did you say?

477
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,263
Are you not going in?

478
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,808
I have somewhere to go. You go in first.

479
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,059
Where?

480
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,980
Right, I promised not to ask.

481
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,028
It is fine for you to hide whatever
you would like to

482
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,738
and to push me away,

483
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,033
but just do not put yourself in danger.

484
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,455
Just promise me that.

485
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,125
And then I will stop worrying about you.

486
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,718
I will not make you worry.

487
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,074
I will never cause any harm
to Lord Jung Yun-jeo.

488
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:56,871
Rather, this is a way to protect him.

489
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,000
You will keep the promise

490
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,461
to find and protect my father,
will you not?

491
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,004
I will.

492
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,883
This is the proof of my promise.

493
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:16,891
OATH

494
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,590
He finally took the bait.

495
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,134
I guess I will soon meet

496
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,263
the King's son.

497
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,939
You grew so much without me.

498
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,112
Now that I met him,

499
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,863
I realized how much I have missed him.

500
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,618
I should not be like this, right?

501
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,499
Here.

502
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,797
Life never goes as planned.

503
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,928
These chicks must have grown on me.

504
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,430
Let us just say so.

505
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,351
Let us head inside. Nok-du has prepared
a room for you.

506
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,145
I mean, he stole it for you.

507
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,191
Come inside.

508
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,827
I am sorry to ask you at this hour.

509
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,787
But the room at the end is the biggest--

510
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,290
Then why can you not just give Dong-ju
that big room?

511
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,208
But that room has a draft...

512
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,046
And it is fine for me to freeze to death?

513
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,672
I am fine with any room.

514
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,134
Please, my lord.

515
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,597
This is truly upsetting. You know that?

516
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,811
-He is coming out. Move, Aeng-du.
-Why is the threshold so high up?

517
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,023
Come in, quick.

518
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,277
Why did you make such a big scene?
I can sleep anywhere.

519
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,946
He just wants to keep her
right next to him.

520
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,033
Since the two rooms are connected
with a window in between.

521
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,453
You little brat! Why would you say that?

522
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,538
You did not have to point that out.

523
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,750
They are pretending to be awkward
around each other.

524
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,460
Stop making it awkward for them.

525
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,879
Do not mind us.

526
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,131
And since your exam is tomorrow,

527
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,967
you have to get a good night's sleep.

528
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,261
-What exam?
-Just ignore them.

529
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,390
-Let us go.
-Go to sleep.

530
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:47,726
What?

531
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,149
"Having someone beside me...

532
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,819
someone who cares and worries for me."

533
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:24,865
Your Majesty,

534
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,118
shall I inform Her Majesty
that you are here?

535
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,500
No.

536
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,960
Let us just go.

537
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,723
Here!

538
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:53,227
How was the exam? You did well, right?

539
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:55,437
Here.

540
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,106
Master, you should not be out like this,
especially with Aeng-du.

541
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,109
He just could not wait
for you to come home.

542
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,903
It should be fine. It is just for a while.

543
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,988
Anyway, son,

544
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,242
you are going to become a general!

545
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,998
It is all thanks to your great Master.

546
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,876
Let us now go home and eat some meat.

547
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,005
This idiot butchered a whole pig.

548
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:27,553
I keep saying that I have a lot of things,

549
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,680
-but money is what I have the most.
-Well...

550
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,266
You can eat first.
I have to head somewhere.

551
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,725
-No--
-Aeng-du,

552
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,310
-you can eat my share, okay?
-Okay!

553
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,313
Do not worry at all.

554
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,274
Hey!

555
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:50,867
Well...

556
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,371
I need a few books.

557
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,456
Tell me which ones
and I will get them for you.

558
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,793
I would like to see them myself.
I will be right back.

559
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,298
Sure.

560
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,967
I will be waiting at the annex. Be safe.

561
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:08,677
Yes.

562
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,679
I will see you there.

563
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,824
I am here to see Park.

564
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,513
He can just hide in the annex.

565
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,932
Why did he call for a meeting here?

566
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:43,397
-Arrest them!
-Arrest them!

567
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,481
Where are you going?

568
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,442
Stay still!

569
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,652
You are under arrest.

570
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,071
Stop!

571
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,824
-Go!
-Stop them!

572
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,617
Hey!

573
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,373
Stop right there!

574
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,960
Do not move!

575
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,057
I thought it could be you,

576
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,601
but it was you, indeed.

577
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,229
I missed you. How have you been?

578
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,402
What do you think you are doing?

579
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,571
-How dare you?
-Why?

580
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,990
You can do it, but I cannot?

581
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,577
Backstabbing is fun.

582
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:43,248
It is no pocket money.
It is illegal gambling for sure.

583
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,292
Not only that, but they also fool people

584
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,627
into signing ridiculous loans.
They are the worst of the worst.

585
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,547
We know,

586
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,507
but it is not easy
to catch them red-handed.

587
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,260
You idiot, that is because you go there
dressed like this.

588
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,596
The man in charge of this place
knows much better.

589
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,307
He changes into normal clothes
and goes undercover.

590
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,308
The man in charge?

591
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,727
I know the man in charge very well.

592
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,688
Anyway, is it not beneficial
for you to arrest them?

593
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,691
I will plan the arrest.

594
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,152
Arrest them!

595
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,488
-Arrest them!
-Arrest them!

596
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,739
Where are you going?

597
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,544
If you are going to kill me,
cut to the chase.

598
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,884
I can let you go alive
if you answer me right.

599
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,763
Why did you drag my brother into this?

600
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:44,392
I did not. It was a coincidence.

601
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,645
He said he had nowhere to stay...

602
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,899
I will ask you once again.

603
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,401
What do you know about me?

604
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,779
What has my brother told you?

605
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,325
I have nothing I need to know about you,

606
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,453
so I did not hear nor question anything.

607
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,540
Why are you so curious?

608
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,211
That is not the answer I wanted to hear.

609
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,590
I do not know what you are talking about,

610
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,801
but I know this.

611
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,136
You will kill me

612
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,639
whatever I say.

613
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,268
You are unnecessarily quick-witted.

614
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,773
Do you think you will not pay for
what you have done to me?

615
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,610
Did you think you could get away
with what you have done?

616
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,904
To all those innocent women?

617
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,491
Committing a crime comes with a price...

618
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,285
for everyone.

619
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,265
Hwang-tae!

620
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,687
Was it Nok-du's plan?

621
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,148
-What?
-He said he had something to tell me.

622
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,776
I would not have come
if this was what it was.

623
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,569
-I will get going now.
-Wait.

624
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,698
We finally saved you
from that devil of a man.

625
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,325
I was not held hostage.

626
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,452
So please, never do this again.

627
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,121
And tell Nok-du to never visit me.

628
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,957
-Hwang-tae...
-Please!

629
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,795
Just leave me alone.

630
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,196
-Next time.
-What?

631
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,741
-I will fight you next time.
-You lunatic!

632
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,203
If I hold up my sword again,

633
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:34,998
you will die.

634
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:53,641
Hwang-tae went back?

635
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,143
Yes.

636
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,688
I should have smacked him in the head
and made him stay,

637
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,107
but he was so cold.

638
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:04,527
He said that he is not held hostage
and wants you to leave him alone.

639
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,029
Such nonsense.

640
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,865
Anyway, what should we do?

641
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,117
He is not just any man, he is the Prince.

642
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,080
The police bureau will come and get you.

643
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,748
We should flee.

644
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,334
No, I have to get into the palace.

645
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,463
He cannot tell on me,

646
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,298
since I know about his plan to revolt.

647
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,010
And he knows nothing?

648
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,179
I cannot tell whether
he is telling the truth

649
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,681
or just hiding it from me.

650
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,852
This is so complicated.

651
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,438
My goodness.

652
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,281
I apologize. This was all because of me.

653
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,284
I really had no idea.

654
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,245
Had I known that it was Nok-du--

655
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,496
It is fine.

656
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,126
At least you are back.

657
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,796
I learned something interesting today,

658
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,008
that he is His Majesty's son.

659
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,760
Sorry?

660
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,973
-You know Nok-du?
-I know him very well.

661
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,476
I have been looking for him
for a long while

662
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,563
to kill him.

663
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,568
When the time comes,

664
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,156
you must help me.

665
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:34,993
Do you understand?

666
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,165
Of course.

667
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,126
I have already promised you.

668
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,556

SUCCESSFUL MILITARY EXAM CANDIDATE YEON SU

671
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,950
You will be entering the palace?

672
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,123
You? The palace?

673
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,709
Yes, I passed the exam.

674
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,506
-Will you get to meet His Majesty?
-Yes.

675
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,641
You can see the King, you say?

676
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,771
Why? Do you want to go?

677
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,731
Apparently, family members can visit.

678
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,192
Although you are not my family,

679
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,569
you can pretend to be one and visit me.

680
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,366
No, why would I do that?

681
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,162
Fine, be that way.

682
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,862
His Majesty called me here.

683
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,364
Yes.

684
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:39,409
His Majesty is
at the Certificate-Awarding Ceremony.

685
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,827
Please wait for a little while.

686
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:53,191
First place in the civil servant exam,
Kim Yeong-jun.

687
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,861
And first place in the military exam,
Yeon Su.

688
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,196
Step forward!

689
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,615
Although you are not my family,

690
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,826
you can pretend to be one and visit me.

691
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,812
The first place
of the military service exam

692
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,522
goes to Yeon Su.

693
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:17,525
Congratulations.

694
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,580
FIRST PLACE OF THE MILITARY SERVICE EXAM

695
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,511
Are you not going to take the certificate?

696
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,061
It is all because of you.

697
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,857
This is all because you are

698
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,318
the son of His Majesty

699
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,814
Show your respect to Her Majesty.

700
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:41,359
But you look like you are lost.

701
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:43,945
What did you just say?

702
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:46,531
Your Majesty, your son is still alive.

703
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:51,702
Are you not curious?
What do you think I said to His Majesty?

704
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:55,414
Have you lived your whole life as Nok-du?

705
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:59,418
Approach His Majesty, get on the good side
of him when he comes out in disguise.

706
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,212
He comes out in disguise?

707
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,974
