1
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,295
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,713
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,635
If there are hundreds of soldiers,
it is basically a war.

4
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,930
It is incomparable to just fighting off
a dozen bandits.

5
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,891
What did I tell you is more important

6
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,642
than your fighting skills?

7
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,102
Perseverance.

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,772
Good, you remember it.

9
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,859
-Master,
-Yes?

10
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,863
you must be careful, okay?

11
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,656
Who do you think I am?

12
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,034
I am General Hwang.

13
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,540
I know you must have a lot of thoughts
on your mind, but get it together

14
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,168
and be careful, okay?

15
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,766
Do not worry,
I will not do anything dangerous.

16
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,812
I know I do not deserve to say this,

17
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,276
but I do not care whose son you are.

18
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,321
I do not care who I am.

19
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,741
Nothing matters.

20
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,412
I just want to live a happy life with you.

21
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,167
I am tired of hating someone

22
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,920
or feeling bad for who I am.

23
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,383
And I am scared of being alone
in the dark.

24
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,011
And...

25
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,558
I can no longer live without you.

26
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,352
So, please...

27
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,735
Can I do that?

28
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,072
Of course.

29
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,374
Okay, then.

30
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,752
Have a safe trip. I will wait for you.

31
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,560
Everyone is apparently waiting
at the back door, so I am going that way.

32
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,937
Once again, you must be careful.

33
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,272
We are outnumbered.

34
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,649
I will not die, no matter what happens.

35
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,571
She said that she will wait for me
to live together happily ever after.

36
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:17,864
So,

37
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,366
I must come back alive.

38
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,912
That is the spirit.

39
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,123
Okay, go.

40
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,983
Good work.

41
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,799
What do you think you are doing?

42
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,012
I am here to get rid of all the traitors.

43
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,390
Whoever regrets your choice,
come forward now.

44
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,725
I promise I will show you mercy.

45
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,020
No one?

46
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,273
Well then, so be it.

47
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,317
Come inside.

48
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,045
Minister,

49
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,881
how did you end up joining his side?

50
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,177
He was in for the revolt with me
up until yesterday.

51
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,930
So is it not suspicious of him to side
with His Majesty all of a sudden?

52
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,809
Perhaps he has an ulterior motive.

53
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,187
Perhaps he is getting me to fight you

54
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,023
-and is planning on taking the throne.
-That is nonsense!

55
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,998
There is no need.

56
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,711
What do you mean, Your Highness?

57
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,510
His Majesty had an accident
during the trip

58
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,096
and has passed away.

59
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,890
What?

60
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,395
What do you mean?

61
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,606
He has no reason

62
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,858
to revolt to take the throne.

63
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,444
After all, he is the one and only

64
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,615
rightful heir to the throne.

65
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,788
He shall be the King
after following proper procedures,

66
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,334
so watch what you say, Prince Neungyang.

67
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,592
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

68
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,220
I would like to know why you are

69
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,682
trying to kill your son
since I may be the one to kill him.

70
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,645
He is destined to be the King.

71
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,673
Proper procedures?

72
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,804
-Based on what evidence?
-He is my son

73
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,642
whom I gave birth to 20 years ago.

74
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,485
I thought he was dead.

75
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,280
Can you prove it?

76
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,865
That is right.

77
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,201
How can you prove that?

78
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,915
I can...

79
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,544
testify for this.

80
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,174
Minister of Military Affairs. Commandant.

81
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,468
You must remember who I am.

82
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,303
I am Jung Yun-jeo,

83
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,389
who served His Majesty 20 years ago

84
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,850
when he was Crown Prince.

85
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,563
His Majesty ordered me to bury his son.

86
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,483
I thought he had died,

87
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,528
but right before I buried him,
he began to breathe again.

88
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,614
Hence, I took him in and raised him.

89
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,075
I raised His Majesty's rightful heir.

90
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,701
No.

91
00:08:55,868 --> 00:09:00,748
How can a criminal who was imprisoned
until a few days ago be a testifier?

92
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,999
That is right.

93
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,045
Who knows if you have just brought
a random man in and made the story up?

94
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,755
Then what about this?

95
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,267
I gave the other half to my son.

96
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,813
For the past 20 years,

97
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,191
every single one of you

98
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,988
has witnessed me carrying

99
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,284
this old ornament that is broken in half.

100
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,852
Her Majesty and I could not have

101
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:08,608
planned this out together
for the past 20 years.

102
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:13,779
Is this good enough evidence for you?

103
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,903
If I had never found out

104
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,946
and had lived

105
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,324
with my son

106
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,412
growing fond of each other...

107
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,981
It is not your fault, Nok-du.

108
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,363
That is what I wanted to say.

109
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,824
And all along, I had no idea.

110
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,411
I am sorry for having left you.

111
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,622
I was scared.

112
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,126
I was not sure how you would see me

113
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,920
if you were to find out who I am.

114
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,840
I was not sure what we would become.

115
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,342
I was not sure of anything.

116
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,853
I am sorry for leaving you to bear
everything alone.

117
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,690
And I am sorry about what happened
to your family.

118
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:13,941
I told you.

119
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,570
None of the tragic things
that happened to us

120
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,947
are your fault.

121
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,785
There was nothing that we could do.

122
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,203
So,

123
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,799
do not do anything
that would break your heart.

124
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,595
I hope that you will...

125
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,894
never have to live
through the hell I had to live through.

126
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,730
I mean it.

127
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,979
I told you to go get some sleep.
Why are you still here?

128
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,732
Are you coming back from somewhere?

129
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,359
Well...

130
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,113
I went out because I had a bad feeling.

131
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,577
I think something is going on
at the palace.

132
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,585
Then,

133
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,966
why did you flee with His Majesty's son
who Her Majesty loves so much?

134
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,552
If you saw him breathing again,

135
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,387
you should have taken him back
to His Majesty.

136
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,390
Why did you raise him in hiding?

137
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,102
Right!

138
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,774
Is it because the rumor is true
and His Majesty...

139
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,235
He wanted me dead.

140
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,445
Exactly.

141
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,824
So, you want the people
to accept him as the King

142
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,660
when he was abandoned
by His Majesty at birth?

143
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,412
How can they serve a king
with an unknown past?

144
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,250
Do you really think
you qualify as the King?

145
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,669
Did you not spend most of your time
at the kisaeng house?

146
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,046
-I am--
-You are what?

147
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,633
Have you coveted the throne
ever since you were young

148
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,178
and dreamed of becoming a wise king?

149
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,144
A successor does not need to be loved
by the preceding King

150
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,022
to become enthroned.

151
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,108
Although I have a long way to go,

152
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,403
I have the wise ministers at the palace
to guide me.

153
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,783
And there is a peaceful and lawful way
to sort this out,

154
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,995
so is a bloody revolt

155
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,040
so necessary?

156
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,746
Do you think I will let you have your way?

157
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,335
Protect Her Majesty!

158
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,429
Get them!

159
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,205
We outnumber them by two to one!

160
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,124
Do not retreat and fight them!

161
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,639
You must not miss them.

162
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,238
Her Majesty used to stay here
a long time ago.

163
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,365
It is very isolated
and currently not being used,

164
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,200
so they will not be
able to find this place easily.

165
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,577
Thank you.

166
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,262
I am sorry.

167
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,350
I had no idea
that you were alive all along.

168
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,105
I cannot imagine
how hard your life has been

169
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,942
and how much pain you must have endured.

170
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,201
Mother...

171
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,043
Could you...

172
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,379
call me that once more?

173
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,676
Yes, Mother.

174
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,474
I will never lose you again.

175
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,685
Never again.

176
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,138
What are you doing? Are you--

177
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,722
I must go and see my father.

178
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,518
He is still in there!

179
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,865
No, you cannot go!

180
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,579
I did not say all that

181
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,374
just to improvise.

182
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,752
I am talking about you becoming the King.

183
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,380
By chance,

184
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,134
if His Majesty cannot return,

185
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,596
you must become the next King.

186
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,807
So, how can you go back
and put yourself in such danger?

187
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,894
Mother,

188
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,522
I am not fit to become King.

189
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,691
I understand.

190
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,777
There will be opposition.

191
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,988
You will feel cut off.

192
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,073
Indeed, it will be difficult.

193
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,283
-But--
-No.

194
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,160
To be honest,

195
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,331
I am just scared.

196
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,877
All along, I wished that His Majesty
abandoned me

197
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,380
for something else other than the throne.

198
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,592
If he had greater reasons
or had no other choice

199
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,680
but to abandon me,
it would have been less painful.

200
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,684
I cannot stop thinking about this.

201
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,102
My baby,

202
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,355
His Majesty...

203
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,400
I do not want to become like him.

204
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,113
I do not want to become enthroned.

205
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,866
And...

206
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,785
I do not care who I am.

207
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,412
Nothing matters.

208
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,125
I just want to live a happy life with you.

209
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,712
I no longer want to live without you.

210
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,551
Forgive me, Mother.

211
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,107
Go.

212
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,943
But...

213
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,240
can you promise me
that you will not get hurt?

214
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,829
Yes, I promise.

215
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,922
Please take good care of Mother.

216
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,621
-Give me the bow.
-Sorry?

217
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,583
I will find him and Her Majesty.

218
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,935
I am getting rusty.

219
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:58,627
I hear that you are the best swordsman
of Joseon.

220
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,214
But what use is a sword
in a mess like this?

221
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,925
The key here is

222
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,927
perseverance.

223
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,071
Wait right there.

224
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,620
Damn it.

225
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,123
I am a busy man.

226
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,541
Fine.

227
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,836
Let the fight begin.

228
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,390
Did you get hurt?

229
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,309
-Why are you alone?
-I am fine.

230
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,687
I was looking for you.

231
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,815
I should have found you sooner.

232
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,984
Let us get out of the palace first.

233
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,861
-If we stay here--
-Because me being here

234
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,864
would put Nok-du in danger?

235
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,034
I am worried that you might get hurt.

236
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,036
How could you say that?

237
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,583
You and Nok-du are both my precious sons.

238
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,625
Then please,

239
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,128
just trust me this once,

240
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,297
so that I can get everything back.

241
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,300
I do not want to live
in hiding anymore, Father.

242
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,427
Hwang-tae...

243
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,220
I am Jung I-hyeong.

244
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,473
That is what Grandfather named me.

245
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,939
I know I have no right to stop you,

246
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,818
but how do you not realize
that this is wrong?

247
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,570
I do.

248
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,990
But what good came from doing
the right thing?

249
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,701
Mother passed away,

250
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,454
and everything I had believed in came
crumbling down.

251
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,543
I am going back to Prince Neungyang.

252
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,880
What did he promise you?

253
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,385
Did he offer to compensate you
for your life and give you a title?

254
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,221
Yes.

255
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,682
-He promised me.
-Why?

256
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,726
Why would he do that?

257
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,853
Based on what?

258
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,953
Why would he have promised you
such things without asking for anything?

259
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,412
To get Nok-du!

260
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,083
Because I am the perfect bait.

261
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,170
No matter how much I keep yelling
at him and running away,

262
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,258
and even if he had to risk his life,
he would never let me go.

263
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,731
Your heart is already broken

264
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,776
and you are still going to do that?

265
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,071
Are you?

266
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,540
Father!

267
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,632
Father!

268
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,759
Are you okay?

269
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,928
It is too dangerous here.

270
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,222
Run away as fast as you can.

271
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,976
Father!

272
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,390
Father, stay here.

273
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,727
Do not let that man see you, okay?

274
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,146
Hwang-tae,

275
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,482
do not...

276
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,234
I will be back. I promise.

277
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,695
So please, hold on.

278
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,718
What are you doing here?

279
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,390
Why did you run away?

280
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,478
I just fled the scene
to avoid getting caught.

281
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,482
Thank goodness you found me.

282
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,707
We must search the whole palace
and find him.

283
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,757
Take that away!

284
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,968
What are you doing?

285
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,305
-Go after them!
-Yes!

286
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,362
Are you okay?

287
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,114
I am fine.

288
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,283
How is your arm?

289
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,577
It is fine.

290
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,955
We are too outnumbered

291
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,458
to keep fighting
until reinforcements come.

292
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,720
It is almost midday.

293
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,851
What do you think you are doing?

294
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,395
You could have died had I aimed wrong.

295
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,898
Are you going to kill Nok-du and revolt?

296
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,692
-Is this what you wanted?
-Yes.

297
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,362
And I could have fulfilled your wish.

298
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,407
You know that I do not want
anything from you.

299
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,368
Why not?

300
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,996
Why do you not want anything from me?

301
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,666
I could give everything you want,

302
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,792
so why not?

303
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,004
If you had given me just one thing,

304
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,134
your heart, I would have...

305
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,429
My lord,

306
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,349
I am not fond of you. You scare me.

307
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,564
What did you say?

308
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,941
I believe that you deserve to be punished.

309
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,444
However,

310
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,823
I feel bad for you.

311
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,700
That is why...

312
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,579
I know I have no right to say this.

313
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,209
But please stop

314
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,378
all of this dangerous work.

315
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,882
I am telling you with utmost sincerity.

316
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,550
-Please--
-No.

317
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,387
I will not stop.

318
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,976
I am going to take the throne
and have you.

319
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,565
You cannot give your heart to me?

320
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,404
I do not care if you cannot.

321
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,159
You may wither away,
but you will never get away from me.

322
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,539
There is no way he can have you.

323
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,293
I will kill him,

324
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,216
no matter what.

325
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,982
-Take her.
-Yes, my lord.

326
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,920
-Everyone, this way!
-Pull back!

327
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,756
-Come this way!
-This way!

328
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,183
Make sure that you get
every single one of--

329
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,802
He will never know that you came here
or that you saved his life.

330
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,973
What were you two going to do, anyway?

331
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,851
Were you two thinking of eloping?

332
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,895
You tried to kill his birth father

333
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,189
and he is the son of the man
who killed your whole family.

334
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,819
You two might be fine now,
but you will end up destroying each other.

335
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,988
Am I wrong?

336
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,327
-Take her.
-Yes, my lord.

337
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,507
Keep an eye on her
as it is still dangerous outside.

338
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,925
Yes, sir.

339
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,196
So,

340
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,949
were you just busy being scared inside
while they ran away?

341
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,078
I did not know what was happening
to the Commandant.

342
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,581
Since we certainly outnumber them,

343
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,750
even if they are to strike again...

344
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,295
So, you just want to wait
until they attack us again?

345
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,797
That is not what I meant.

346
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:01,015
I saw the soldiers run off to hide
at the Hall of Convenience.

347
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,601
-The Hall of Convenience?
-Yes.

348
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,813
I just saw every one of them head inside.

349
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,024
It is even better that they are gathered
in one place.

350
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,860
Muster the remaining forces and attack.

351
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,071
Get ready.

352
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,878
I thought you ran off to your brother.

353
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,132
Why would I do that?

354
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,554
Come to the Hall of Convenience with me.

355
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,640
You have to watch his downfall.

356
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,692
I have to go to the bathroom.
Will you be fine alone?

357
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:38,070
It is just a woman. Take your time.

358
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,986
You brought everyone, I see.

359
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,197
Thanks.

360
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,236
We are too outnumbered

361
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,156
to keep fighting
until reinforcements come.

362
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,123
It is almost midday.

363
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,804
Lady Kim, sorry we are a little late.

364
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,263
Lady Kim?

365
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,370
Go after him!

366
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,258
Are you insane?

367
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,677
Why on earth would you come here?

368
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,970
I will follow wherever you go

369
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,097
even if it is a battlefield
or a fiery pit.

370
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,976
I told you that I cannot live without you.

371
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,734
You just realized?

372
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,445
Of course, you cannot live without me.

373
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,156
I cannot live without you, either.

374
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,622
So, do not worry.

375
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,304
I will be back. Stay hidden, okay?

376
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,684
Do not worry about me.
Promise me that you will return.

377
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,062
I promise.

378
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,328
-You are laughing?
-It is as fun as I anticipated it to be,

379
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,289
to fight you.

380
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,834
You crazy lunatic.

381
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,370
Stop.

382
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,663
Stop it right here.

383
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,184
My lord, be careful!

384
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,215
Dan-ho...

385
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,510
Forgive me,

386
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,637
my lord.

387
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,353
Dan-ho...

388
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,321
Dan-ho!

389
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,908
I will take revenge for Madam Chun, may I?

390
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,704
Go ahead.

391
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,463
Everyone, stop!

392
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,115
Put down your weapons.

393
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,486
What?

394
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,003
You mean, the rumor was true?

395
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,048
He abandoned his son?

396
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:29,925
Yes.

397
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,761
I cannot believe that His Majesty died
so suddenly.

398
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,514
He should have had a more painful death.

399
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,849
So,

400
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,477
what are you going to do
with Prince Neungyang now?

401
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,523
You cannot let him become the new King.

402
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,775
Queen Dowager!

403
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,236
What is it?

404
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,322
His Majesty...

405
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,532
is alive.

406
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,701
What do you mean?

407
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,328
Did you not say that he died?

408
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,789
Her Majesty certainly said...

409
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:05,752
I saw him and his troops enter the palace
with my own eyes.

410
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,464
Queen Dowager, you should move
to the West Palace.

411
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,466
I must meet His Majesty.

412
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,665
The sound is coming from
the Hall of Convenience.

413
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,587
Your Majesty!

414
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,383
You should be at the West Palace.

415
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,261
-What brings you here?
-I was dragged here.

416
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,680
He came to the West Palace

417
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,808
and threatened me to allow his revolt.

418
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,018
Who was it?

419
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,536
Seems like I have interrupted you

420
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,290
from your moment of victory.

421
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:57,030
I asked, who came to threaten you
to help with his revolt?

422
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,159
I have never seen him before.

423
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,162
Absurdly enough,

424
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,666
he claimed that he is your son.

425
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,359
You asked if I have forsaken you

426
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,153
just because of some prophecy, yes?

427
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,740
Yes, I did.

428
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,993
Not only that,

429
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,120
I killed the shaman who made the prophecy,

430
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,831
and ordered to kill Yun-jeo, too.

431
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,753
Do not look at me like that.

432
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,548
I did what I had to do.

433
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,092
See?

434
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:02,053
The prophecy has come true.
You are trying to steal my throne

435
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,975
and you made me a dead person.

436
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,527
You want to deny it, do you not?

437
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,488
Then explain.

438
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,991
If you were not planning to revolt,

439
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,411
why have you lied and stayed by my side?

440
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,997
Why have you made me trust you,

441
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,502
and made me tell you everything?

442
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,088
You must hate me to death.

443
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,634
I am the man who abandoned you,

444
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,221
and who tried to kill you your whole life.

445
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,017
Am I wrong?

446
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,818
I asked, am I wrong?

447
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,198
Yes, you are right.

448
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:05,867
I detest you.

449
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,745
I resent you to death.

450
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:13,625
Of course, you would.

451
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,669
And that is why

452
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,880
you caused all of this mess.

453
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,061
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

454
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,401
I tried to stop all of this
when I found out.

455
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,319
But he...

456
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:47,075
even created the unspeakable rumor
that you have passed away.

457
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,243
He is lying!

458
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:52,414
Prince Neungyang planned the revolt!

459
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,918
Nok-du, my brother,
was just trying to stop him from--

460
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,086
Do not trust him.

461
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,381
He tricked me and helped his brother
plan the revolt.

462
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:06,428
You deceived me to take revenge on me.

463
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,644
You came a long way, indeed.

464
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,069
What can I possibly say
to make you believe me?

465
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,367
Kill anyone who may cause trouble later.

466
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,286
Make sure the rest stay silent.

467
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,663
Are you sure this is going to work?

468
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:37,459
His Majesty will not trust his son.

469
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,628
If anybody sides with his son,

470
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,631
that will be considered treason as well.

471
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,093
So, who would risk his life
to tell the truth?

472
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,892
He is nothing but an abandoned son.

473
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,906
Would you believe me if I said

474
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,283
that I was trying to stop
Prince Neungyang from revolting?

475
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,329
Would you believe me if I told you

476
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,165
that I was terrified yet so happy

477
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:22,754
the whole time I was with you,
not knowing how you thought of me?

478
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,930
You would not believe anything
but that I tried to dethrone you.

479
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,605
Did you truly plan

480
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,275
to take over my throne?

481
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,320
Are you heartbroken?

482
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,784
What did you say?

483
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,375
Are you heartbroken

484
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:05,380
that I hid the fact that I am your son
and tried to dethrone you?

485
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:07,674
Are you

486
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:10,510
trying to deceive me

487
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,596
again?

488
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,224
Are you disgusted

489
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,354
at yourself

490
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,398
for blindly giving me trust?

491
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:28,111
Is your heart broken by betrayal?

492
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,405
Does it hurt?

493
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,617
-How dare you...
-Just like how I felt

494
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,664
when you abandoned me?

495
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,594
If so,

496
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,598
then I will answer as you wish.

497
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,684
Yes, I planned on dethroning you

498
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,644
and killing you

499
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:06,149
with my own hands.

500
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,195
Are you satisfied now, Your Majesty?

501
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,452
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

502
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,544
Since he confessed to his crime,

503
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,631
arrest him immediately!

504
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:31,674
Arrest him!

505
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:32,926
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

506
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,694
Protect His Majesty!

507
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:52,862
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

508
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,072
Come with me, Your Majesty.

509
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,282
Be careful.

510
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,625
Take him while I distract them.

511
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,585
We will follow you, so do not worry.

512
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,754
I am also crazy about you!

513
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,275
Do you know...

514
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,736
who I am?

515
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,457
It is not your fault, Nok-du.

516
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,588
