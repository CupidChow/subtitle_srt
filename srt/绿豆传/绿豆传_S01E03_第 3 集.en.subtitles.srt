1
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,253
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,838
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,224
Let us begin.

4
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,187
-I will go look into it.
-No.

5
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,606
I will go myself.

6
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,091
Oh, my!

7
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,176
Ouch!

8
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,055
No, well...

9
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,019
-I mean--
-Come here, you!

10
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,479
Wait.

11
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,231
You little...

12
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,655
Be quiet!

13
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,147
Hold on...

14
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,693
Dong-ju,

15
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,154
what are you doing here?

16
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,449
Well...

17
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,873
I was just getting my hair trimmed.

18
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,169
Yes, I was trimming her hair.

19
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,131
You did not trim it. It looks to me
that you just ruined her hair.

20
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,804
Lady Kim, what is wrong with your face?

21
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:48,436
Dong-ju said
that she will put on makeup...

22
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,740
We heard a man's scream coming from here.

23
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,325
Is it...

24
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,004
Sorry, I accidentally poked her
with the scissors.

25
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,882
Was that you, Dong-ju?

26
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,218
It really hurt.

27
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,012
I am so sorry, Dong-ju.

28
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,015
How about I take you to our room
and put some ointment on it?

29
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,853
Sure, why not?

30
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,564
Please excuse us.

31
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,862
Oh, my.

32
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,852
Let me go!

33
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,023
Follow me.

34
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,566
Hold on.

35
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,779
Darn.

36
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,242
Do you not remember me?

37
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,910
I saved you when we were in Hanyang.

38
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,537
You were cross-dressed, too.

39
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,164
What will Madam Chun say when she hears?

40
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,876
Did you follow me all the way here
from Hanyang?

41
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,545
No, it is just a coincidence.

42
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,505
I was just as surprised.

43
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,300
I did not expect to see a man's robe
and a headband in a kisaeng's room.

44
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,843
And I have seen them before.

45
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,553
You said you did not go through my stuff!

46
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,221
I did not!

47
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,474
It saw them by accident.

48
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,851
-Why you little...
-Stop.

49
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,481
Dong-ju?

50
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,400
Have a great evening.

51
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,946
-Gosh.
-Hey.

52
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,449
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

53
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,578
Are you sure you checked
all the nearby islands?

54
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,913
Yes, Your Majesty.

55
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,583
We searched once again,
but found no such man.

56
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:20,213
You could not find anything peculiar?

57
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,217
We did find something odd.

58
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,681
There was an island where only women live.

59
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,392
Only women?

60
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,201
It is quite chilly.

61
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,620
Are you out on a night stroll?

62
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,040
It is not that cold for a walk yet.

63
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,628
But it may be cold
for our young Grand Prince Yeongchang.

64
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,842
Are you not cold, my little brother?

65
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,012
I am not cold,

66
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,764
Your Majesty.

67
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,017
You have to be careful at all times.

68
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,646
You do not want to catch a cold, do you?

69
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,859
Unfortunate events are bound

70
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,238
to occur without a warning.

71
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,532
Let us go.

72
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,965
Are you sure you saw a man here?

73
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,510
He was wearing a black mask,
so we could not see him properly.

74
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,306
We would be in serious trouble
if he saw anything.

75
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,183
I doubt he saw anything

76
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,018
because he cannot enter the shrine.

77
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,188
He may try to sneak in again,
so stay extra vigilant.

78
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,023
Yes, my lord.

79
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,702
Is something wrong?

80
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,455
No, not at all. Let us begin.

81
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,250
His Majesty is growing insecure
because of Grand Prince Yeongchang.

82
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,418
Yes.

83
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,421
Ever since His Highness' passing,
the crown prince title is up for grabs,

84
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,797
so no wonder he is so insecure.

85
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,094
His Majesty is killing everyone
around the Grand Prince for treason.

86
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,681
One of us could be next.

87
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,767
Before the crowning--

88
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,229
I wanted to wait
until the Grand Prince is older,

89
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,855
but we are running out of time.

90
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,316
What are you going to do, then?

91
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,197
We are going to move up our revolt.

92
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,670
You are supposed to meet
your beloved mistress here?

93
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,838
-Yes.
-I see.

94
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,924
Looking like this?

95
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,426
You had to cross-dress?

96
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,805
When my mistress' husband passed away,

97
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,891
the family forced her to kill herself
to build a monument to her chastity.

98
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,685
So, we ran away together.

99
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,604
But we were being chased
and ended up going separate ways.

100
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,731
Still, there are so many people after me

101
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,942
that I had no choice.

102
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,491
When is your mistress coming?

103
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,494
Soon. In a couple of days.

104
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,246
In just a few days. I promise.

105
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,498
I am going to leave as soon as I meet her.

106
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,791
Indeed.

107
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,754
How could I have even thought

108
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,423
of being sisters with this scamp?

109
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,259
I told you I cannot be your older sister.

110
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,971
But calling me a scamp
is a little mean, do you think not?

111
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,807
I did take good care of you all along.

112
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,058
You took care of me?

113
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,188
Yes, perfect.

114
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,565
Oh, my.

115
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,985
You touched my back!

116
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,029
Hey! You asked me to scratch it.

117
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,405
You should have said no!

118
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,365
-You touched my--
-Your what?

119
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,248
See? The more we talk about it,
the more awkward it gets.

120
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:28,336
So, let us just not talk about it
and hold on for a few days.

121
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,005
I will disappear like the wind.

122
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,340
I promise you.

123
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,553
I am sorry for everything.

124
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,600
That being said,
I will sleep outside tonight.

125
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,311
Absolutely not. You cannot go out.

126
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,271
Stay here.

127
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,609
I told you that I love my mistress.

128
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,902
Are you out of your mind?

129
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,112
What are you going to do?
People think you are a woman.

130
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,530
What do you mean?

131
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,366
Stop treating me like I am crazy.

132
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,118
While you are here,

133
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,246
do not dare to think
about leaving my sight, okay?

134
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,710
You are saying,
we are going to share the same room?

135
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,127
Lady Kim.

136
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,045
You keep denying it,

137
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,674
but you sure act like a scamp,
do you think not?

138
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,178
I am on my way to the bathroom.

139
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,684
Okay, I will go back inside.

140
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,653
Damn it, I have to go back.

141
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,011
Do you ever sleep?

142
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,680
No, I do not.

143
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,765
I am going to watch you all night.

144
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,930
Men who secretly enter a village of women?

145
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,682
They are behind all of this

146
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,018
and one of them ordered
to attack my family?

147
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,101
Are they planning a revolt or something?

148
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,020
But why would they attack my family?

149
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,983
She is right. It was very unlikely of us.

150
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,986
Who gave us such orders?

151
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,782
Only our boss knows the answer to that.

152
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,577
They receive orders from their boss,

153
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,829
but they do not know anything in detail.

154
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,000
How unnecessarily organized they are.

155
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,502
BREWERY

156
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,716
In order to figure out who they are,

157
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,761
I have no choice
but to approach those women.

158
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,639
Last night, that pervert

159
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,642
was in fear of getting caught

160
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,645
so he ended up entering our kisaeng house.

161
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,105
To our kisaeng house?

162
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,065
Oh, my.

163
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,610
Do you really think
he would have done anything bad?

164
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,777
I mean it.

165
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,821
The man entered the village a few days ago

166
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,573
and got beaten to a pulp and kicked out.

167
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,742
But that didn't knock some sense into him.

168
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,121
What a despicable scamp.

169
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,457
That is why Madam Chun
and Vice-Curator Yeon

170
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,542
are going to distribute
a composite sketch of the man.

171
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,587
-A composite sketch?
-So, do not worry too much.

172
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,173
We will catch him in no time
with everyone's cooperation.

173
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,010
That is great.

174
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,554
What are you doing here?

175
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,764
You have not heard, have you?

176
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,432
-About the man--
-Later.

177
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,143
-Let's go, Lady Kim.
-What?

178
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,812
She prepared breakfast for me.

179
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,856
She is very caring, as you can see.

180
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,824
I told you not to go anywhere!

181
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,494
You really cooked breakfast for me?

182
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,914
Do not get excited. I did not cook that.

183
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,376
But what is this seaweed soup?

184
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,920
There is no way you knew
that today is my birthday.

185
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,131
-It is your birthday?
-Yes.

186
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,260
The only thing Father told me about me was

187
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,762
the day I was born.

188
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,224
Wait.

189
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,686
-Are you not going to drink it?
-I do not like seaweed soup.

190
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,736
But not enough to give it to you.

191
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,365
They say, a soft word turns away wrath,

192
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,450
but your words make wrath.

193
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,537
Wrath? No way.

194
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,247
You never know.

195
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,082
Look at me.

196
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,750
-I am--
-Exactly.

197
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,086
A man in a woman's clothes,

198
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,421
hitting on kisaengs.

199
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,215
-Hitting on them?
-Are you really denying it?

200
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,135
Then what were you doing with them
so early in the morning?

201
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,097
Does your mistress know
how perverted you are?

202
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,974
Perverted?

203
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,768
I was just talking to them!
Why can I not just talk to them?

204
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,939
Your mistress will surely believe you
when you say that.

205
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,067
Luckily, my mistress is not twisted
like someone in this room!

206
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,236
Dong-ju!

207
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,912
Enjoy your meal!

208
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,164
You, too.

209
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,832
Dong-ju.

210
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,419
Our dance practice is about to start.
Madam Chun wants you to come now.

211
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,879
Okay.

212
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,974
Need any help?
I am great at giving haircuts.

213
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,608
Can you not just go alone?

214
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,486
-I am busy.
-Busy, my ass.

215
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,571
I told you. Do not do anything--

216
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,031
Do not go anywhere,

217
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,742
and never leave your sight.
I hear your plea, but--

218
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,035
Do not put it that way.

219
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,747
Just trust me this once.

220
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,377
All right, let us go. I am on my way.

221
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,717
Dong-ju!

222
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,678
Stop.

223
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,896
Try it again. Extend your arm all the way.

224
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,191
More.

225
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,111
So this is the despicable scamp
who is causing a stir

226
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,364
at the widow village
and the kisaeng house?

227
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,574
Yes.

228
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,619
Does he not look familiar?

229
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,333
I am not sure. Maybe he snuck in
as a customer before.

230
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,793
That is gross.

231
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,725
I will go look over the hills there.

232
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,851
-You...
-My goodness!

233
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,478
So, the pervert has been found?

234
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,608
Apparently, a widow ran into him.

235
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,776
-Let us go see his face.
-Hurry.

236
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,028
Let us go.

237
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,040
My goodness!

238
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,959
Where did you run into him?

239
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,252
Did you fight him off?

240
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,921
Is that how you got injured?

241
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,089
Tell us exactly what happened.

242
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,135
I cannot bring myself to do that.

243
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,095
-Come on.
-Come on.

244
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,597
Calm down.

245
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,518
Did he assault you in any way?

246
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,521
No. It happened just now.

247
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,274
I was out for a walk in the hills

248
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,527
and the man was running to me,

249
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,820
so I ended up...

250
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,327
You flipped him over?

251
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,705
Then he took out his knife to fight me.

252
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,313
-Oh, my!
-Are you serious?

253
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,360
I am really embarrassed
as I am saying this,

254
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,238
but I thought I should tell you,
the Virtuous Women Corps.

255
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,073
Where did he run off?

256
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,659
He ran away to the town beside ours.

257
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,204
Is this the man you saw?

258
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,543
That is him.

259
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,045
He was wearing a dark indigo robe

260
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,964
-and a hat.
-And a hat.

261
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,258
It is the same man.

262
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:43,927
That pervert.

263
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:49,850
But he was much better-looking
than that composite sketch.

264
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,146
No, I mean,

265
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,691
can I have some ink and a brush?

266
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,489
How dare he run away?

267
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,201
Well, I do not have any other time
to check the hills.

268
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,286
Dong-ju!

269
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,790
Here is the thing you asked for.

270
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,668
Why collect good brushes and makeup

271
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,004
when you do not even know
how to use them properly?

272
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,922
-And you are broke.
-Mind your own business.

273
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,425
This was hard to get, you say?

274
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,302
Of course. I doubt
women in Hanyang have that.

275
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,513
Even the court ladies in the palace
would not have that.

276
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,642
-What is it for?
-None of your business.

277
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:33,852
Tell me!

278
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,745
Since he has a scar on his face now,
this must be how he really looks now.

279
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,040
Yes, the scar is very noticeable,

280
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,043
so you will be able
to identify him anywhere.

281
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,504
Thank you. This will be very helpful.

282
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,714
Now,

283
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,426
we are going to visit
the neighboring village.

284
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,761
We will go with you.

285
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,096
No!

286
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,889
It is dangerous, so stay here.

287
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,808
Just trust us.

288
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,358
I was right about you.

289
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:26,363
Let us discuss your future
after I come back.

290
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,449
What do you mean, my place?

291
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,951
Join the Virtuous Women Corps

292
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,870
and protect the village with us!

293
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,665
No, I am good.

294
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,460
-Good luck!
-You can do it!

295
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,004
-Get that man!
-Good luck.

296
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,048
-Stay safe.
-I like where I am right now.

297
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,383
Good luck!

298
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,093
I am really fine!

299
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,764
That is so funny.

300
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,225
How did you beat up a man like that?

301
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,978
A lot of my relatives were generals.

302
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,354
I was always scolded

303
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,690
for playing with wooden swords
with my brothers when I was young.

304
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,277
I am not good at sewing, but I prefer
working with my physical strength.

305
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,322
Are you heading somewhere?

306
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,324
We are going to get that pervert--

307
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,201
We are on our way to get some firewood.

308
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,370
You should go see a doctor now.

309
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,583
It is fine.
I can just put some saliva on it.

310
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,502
I am quite good at axing.

311
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,338
Why do I not help you? Do I go that way?

312
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,257
-Let us go.
-No, wait!

313
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,593
What?

314
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,053
Are we really getting firewood?

315
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,848
We cannot flock over
to the next village now

316
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,183
and we do need some firewood.

317
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,769
Then I will go to catch the pervert.

318
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,981
It is daytime, so a lot of people
will be watching. Be careful.

319
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,029
I have so much work to do.
Can I not go today?

320
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,614
I am exhausted.

321
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,368
I do not think
I will have such a chance again.

322
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,538
Is there another way?

323
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,268
Do not just stand there and watch.
Let us get to work.

324
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,146
The trees there look good,
so I will be over there.

325
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,314
Sure.

326
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,904
She is something else, is she not?

327
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,948
Do not be so rash.

328
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,659
We do need more people,

329
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,911
but it is not all about being strong.

330
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,081
Let us focus on
what we should do tomorrow.

331
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,709
-Come to the brewery by 10 p.m. tomorrow.
-Okay.

332
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,385
They are going
to do something tomorrow night?

333
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,429
There is no way I am missing that.

334
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,645
What just happened?

335
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,787
I think this should be enough.

336
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,665
I will go and bring Lady Kim.

337
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,125
Sure.

338
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,586
We will wrap things up here.

339
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,896
All right.

340
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,982
My goodness.

341
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,318
Lady Kim?

342
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,819
Where are you?

343
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,868
Dong-ju!

344
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,705
Please help me out here.

345
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,416
It just keeps getting worse.

346
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,085
Why are your clothes off? Disgusting.

347
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,379
I did not take them off,
I was just chopping some wood...

348
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,714
Hey, give me your clothes.

349
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,341
Are you out of your mind?

350
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,009
Do not get the wrong idea.

351
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,553
Help me out this one time, please.

352
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,930
I am begging you.

353
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,973
That is not how you beg.

354
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,643
Call me, Sister.

355
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,354
Sister, please.

356
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,440
Lady Kim, let us go back now.

357
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,275
-What do we do?
-What is happening?

358
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,819
What is happening? Go that way.

359
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,072
Lady Kim, let us go!

360
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:20,949
Hey!

361
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,660
Let us go that way.

362
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,122
Lady Kim?

363
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,333
Lady Kim!

364
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,704
Hello, there.

365
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,831
What are you doing here?

366
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:14,294
I was here for dance practice,
but it got too hot,

367
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:17,213
so I asked Lady Kim
to take a bath with me.

368
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,508
You two are bathing together?

369
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,845
Yes, we have even scrubbed
each other's backs many times.

370
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,016
She is so good at it.

371
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,561
That is right. She is so strong.

372
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,355
Would you ladies like to join us?

373
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,940
What?

374
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,069
Yes, come and join us.

375
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,115
No, thanks.

376
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,035
We have to head to the brewery,
so take your time.

377
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,329
Okay. See you later!

378
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,263
Here is yours.

379
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,641
You put it on.
I do not want to see you topless.

380
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,656
So,

381
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,116
you came here for dance practice?

382
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,576
What?

383
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,371
Right.

384
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,790
Why else would I be here?

385
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,793
I see.

386
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,214
Right. I guess you need to practice.

387
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:42,882
A lot.

388
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,551
A whole lot.

389
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:52,058
Is this really so difficult?

390
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,395
It looks easy, does it not?

391
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,980
Try it. It is harder than it looks.

392
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,900
Fine.

393
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,445
Look at you.

394
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,116
If you just get one move right,
I will be your daughter.

395
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,821
Hey there, my daughter.

396
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,284
What was that? Did you learn how to dance?

397
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,995
No, I watched you practice.

398
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,122
You can dance like that
after watching it once?

399
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,875
Yes, is that not how everyone learns?

400
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,963
I hated him, but now I hate him even more.

401
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,176
Do you want me to teach you?

402
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,803
-Are you hitting on me?
-Stand up!

403
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,141
Stand here.

404
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,893
Watch me.

405
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,687
Give it a flick

406
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,315
from outside to inside.

407
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,400
Try it.

408
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,868
Yes, that is good.

409
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,495
Now,

410
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,706
let the fan rest on your arm.

411
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,000
And keep your left arm straight.

412
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:45,505
And take the fan inside.

413
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,299
Let it glide over your face.

414
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,343
Make a big circle

415
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,555
and bring it down to the side.

416
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,727
Turn to the left.

417
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,231
As you turn, raise your fan upward

418
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,526
and bring it to the side.

419
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,864
That is it.

420
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,164
Do not count the beats.
That will only confuse you.

421
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,834
Try to remember your breathing instead.

422
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,544
Now,

423
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,922
breathe in as you put your left foot up.

424
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,926
Turn to the left.

425
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,234
Hey.

426
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,820
Hear me out.

427
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,746
You should really consider another career.

428
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,122
What are you talking about?

429
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,085
I do not think you should be a kisaeng.

430
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,380
You cannot become anything you want
just because you want to.

431
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,923
Who says I want to?

432
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,342
I am not doing this because I want to.

433
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,344
I do not want to become a kisaeng.

434
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,057
I mean...

435
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,184
I cannot become anything I want
just because I want to?

436
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,978
No.

437
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,814
You have to do some things
you do not want to.

438
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,399
That is life.

439
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,240
Sorry, that was rude of me.

440
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,910
It is fine.

441
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,745
Maybe your mistress was such a good person

442
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,955
that she never forced you to do anything
you did not want to.

443
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,751
I could not do anything

444
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,544
including things I wanted to do

445
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,296
and things I did not want to do.

446
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,176
But I am not going
to live like that anymore.

447
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,722
I am going to do whatever I want,
and whatever I have to,

448
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,599
just like everyone else.

449
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,394
Just like everyone else?

450
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,688
You must have had a hard time

451
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,066
only doing things you did not want to do.

452
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,538
What? Are you amazed by how I look?

453
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,914
It is a work of art, is it not?

454
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,545
What?

455
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,131
I thought you would beat me up
or something.

456
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,300
Work of art, my ass.

457
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,512
Your clothes are all dry now. Let us go.

458
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,524
Wait for me!

459
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,615
Were you at the widow village?

460
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,057
She fell in the water while dancing?

461
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,437
Then, you must have watched her dance.

462
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,064
Yes, I had no choice.

463
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,108
-It was truly--
-Adorable, was it not?

464
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,780
Sure, you could say that.

465
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,950
You should have given her your coat.

466
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,661
She gets cold easily.

467
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,623
I fell in the water, too!

468
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,042
I hate being cold too.

469
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,879
I am sorry. Would you like some of this?

470
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,012
Do not bother. I am not cold.

471
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,434
Do not bother. I will not take it.

472
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,354
You are so quick.

473
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,154
These are really delicious,

474
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:21,989
so go ahead and hide it.

475
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,075
Do not share it, okay?

476
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,125
Lady Kim!

477
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,754
Did you just call me?

478
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,925
He is giving these to you
as your birthday gift.

479
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,680
Happy birthday.

480
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,349
I am not a kid, you know.

481
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,775
Come to think of it, today is...

482
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,945
Why? Is it someone else's birthday?

483
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,572
No, it is nothing.

484
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,106
What are you doing here?

485
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,154
Only when I left the palace
with Your Majesty during the war,

486
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,948
did I realize that I was conceived.

487
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,535
I could not eat anything,

488
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,705
except for these sweets

489
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,292
that Court Lady Kim brought me.

490
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,670
Your Majesty, do you remember?

491
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,632
You talk about it every year,

492
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,218
how could I forget?

493
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,556
Had the child lived,

494
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,934
do you think he would have loved
these sweets, too?

495
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,065
He is dead. He is long gone.

496
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,485
Let us stop.

497
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,987
He was our child who had to die
the moment he was born.

498
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,324
Why can I not miss him?

499
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,285
Why are you so against it?

500
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,524
What is her name?

501
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,734
Her name is Dong-ju.

502
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,822
She is definitely over 12.

503
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,626
Hey, wait!

504
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,754
Let me go.

505
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,548
It is pitch-dark outside.

506
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,134
Where do you think you are going?

507
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,803
Everyone is safe now.

508
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,138
I should look for Nokdu.

509
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,473
Do you think you can convince him?

510
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,392
Did you not see his face when he left?

511
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,686
I do not know what came over him,

512
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,397
but he is definitely not going to let go.

513
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,149
But it is too dangerous.

514
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,942
It will be even worse if he finds out--

515
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,694
He can protect himself.

516
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:50,573
And if you go out right now,
you will be eaten alive by a tiger

517
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,658
twice the size of you
before you reach Hanyang.

518
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,456
So, let us head inside.

519
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,208
Unless you want to be eaten alive.

520
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,838
Let us head inside.

521
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:21,145
You would not even notice
if I untied this and ran away.

522
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,355
You are so clueless when you fall asleep.

523
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,525
What did you do when I was asleep?

524
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,742
Whatever.

525
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,665
I really have no interest in other women.

526
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,086
I should not,
and I have no time for that either.

527
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,134
Do you love your mistress that much?

528
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,852
Yes.

529
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,064
I miss her

530
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,233
and want to meet her.

531
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,491
What I am trying to say is
that you don't need to worry.

532
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,246
Sure.

533
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,958
Thank you for telling me your love story
that I did not even ask for.

534
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,295
Hey,

535
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,882
turn the candles off before you go to bed.
Stop wasting.

536
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,871
I am at the brewery, extracting malt.

537
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,457
What is this man?

538
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,710
Who are you talking about?

539
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,878
Nothing.

540
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,840
Did you see anyone suspicious?

541
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,883
Not at all.

542
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,305
What brings you here?

543
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,768
Is Lady Kim inside?

544
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,023
No, she is at the widow village.

545
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,279
It is dangerous for her
to be out and about alone like that.

546
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:36,822
Sorry?

547
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,455
Where should I put this?

548
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,459
There is a storage right out that way.

549
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,585
Okay.

550
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,485
Why are you in this room?

551
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,071
Is this the wrong room?

552
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,077
Go that way and you will find a small door
that leads to the backyard.

553
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:26,246
Right, I found it weird
that you stored pots in a room.

554
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,463
Do I really get paid for this?

555
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,382
Of course.

556
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:38,884
Okay, then.

557
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,750
He was beaten up when he went inside
the village once,

558
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,503
but he obviously did not learn his lesson
and came back.

559
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,964
Apparently, he is quite perverted.

560
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:21,802
He does not care
whether it is a widow or a kisaeng.

561
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,853
Oh, my!

562
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,276
Are you okay?

563
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,279
How did you know that I was falling?

564
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,573
My goodness,

565
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,825
-my heart fluttered.
-Oh, my.

566
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,786
Had you been a man, I would have just...

567
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,037
Please.

568
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,081
-Stop it!
-Why?

569
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,167
-Follow me.
-Wait...

570
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,337
She is just lonely, so do not mind her.

571
00:45:58,797 --> 00:45:59,965
Get your mind together!

572
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,967
-Get ahold of yourself!
-Did you not see that?

573
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,469
Stop it!

574
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,818
Excuse me, where is Dong-ju's room?

575
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,362
That one.

576
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,239
It is that one over there.

577
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,626
I know what you are thinking,

578
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,420
but can we talk about it later?

579
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,048
You are the man who sneaked
into the widow village,

580
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,342
are you not?

581
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,762
Well...

582
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,306
And you are still wandering around?

583
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,017
You should be hiding
until your mistress comes.

584
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,101
Well...

585
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,270
I just...

586
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,945
I heard all about it. Get out.

587
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,532
You try to tempt any women,
whether it be a widow or a kisaeng?

588
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,244
Hey.

589
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,582
Is that really

590
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,086
-how you think of me?
-Why does how I think matter?

591
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,963
The villagers think you are a pervert,

592
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,798
and you will die if you get caught.

593
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,553
Okay.

594
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,179
I will leave.

595
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,154
Who are you? Why are you here?

596
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,164
I cannot do this alone.

597
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:10,596
Where are you heading?

598
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,181
Why do you care?

599
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,396
Do not do anything dangerous
and just hide.

600
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:20,731
When your mistress comes, I will--

601
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,983
If anything happens to me,
just pretend that you did not know.

602
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,485
I will say so myself.

603
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,699
Hey, hold on.

604
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,081
What are you doing?

605
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,565
Bye.

606
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,823
Why is Deul-re not here yet?

607
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,742
I do not know. She said
that she had to check on something.

608
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,331
Let us start first.

609
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:09,339
This is the man
we are going to kill tonight.

610
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,639
It is the heart of Hanyang,
so we cannot make a scene.

611
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,183
I want one of us to go and kill him.

612
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,102
What a jerk.

613
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,479
Why is he trying
to honor-kill his daughter-in-law

614
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:25,689
who gave birth to his grandson?

615
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,900
-I will go.
-Are you leaving right now?

616
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,819
There is no need to wait.

617
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,321
-Where do we keep the suits?
-Over there.

618
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,934
Dong-ju!

619
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,955
-Are you talking about Dong-ju?
-Yes.

620
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,542
The one who courageously cut her hair.

621
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,337
I hear

622
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,590
that she is well past the age
to become a kisaeng.

623
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,344
I would like to repent
for what I have done

624
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,515
and make a choice
that does not go against the law.

625
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,475
Is there anything wrong with that?

626
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,188
My lord,

627
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,191
she may be of age, but she is still...

628
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,653
Hey!

629
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,572
I am the one who gets to decide, not you.

630
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,202
I am a nobleman,
but you are just lowly kisaengs.

631
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,454
If I want a woman to be mine,
then you should help me.

632
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,374
How dare you question my choice
and talk about laws?

633
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,167
Then

634
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,921
-give us some time.
-No.

635
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,465
Are you going to bring someone
and make me a fool again?

636
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,926
I am going to take her right now.

637
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:20,262
Did you not see? I even brought
a flower-adorned palanquin.

638
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,722
What will you do

639
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,892
-if I say that you cannot?
-What will I do?

640
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,853
This place will have to shut down,

641
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,856
and all of you will become slaves.

642
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,110
I will make sure to send you off to Jeju
where the scenery is nice.

643
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:37,988
But I heard

644
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,907
most people die on their way there
because of the dangerous boat ride.

645
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,336
Lady Kim?

646
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,463
What are you doing here?

647
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:00,343
I saw a ring in this room earlier,

648
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,512
and I thought I could make good money
out of it.

649
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,347
I am so sorry.

650
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,142
-How much have you heard?
-Sorry?

651
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,104
You mean, you are planning
to kill someone?

652
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,647
You heard everything.

653
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:15,567
How unfortunate.

654
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,611
Will you kill me?

655
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,158
What if

656
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,243
I do it for you?

657
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,080
You came so fast.

658
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,667
I did not know you would be
so happy to see me.

659
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,129
How dare you?

660
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,094
Get out. Stay in your room!

661
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,763
No.

662
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,182
What difference will it make
if I avoid him now?

663
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,767
Listen to me, please!

664
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:52,979
Madam Chun,

665
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:55,190
I could never say this to you
because I was embarrassed,

666
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,608
but you know how grateful I am, right?

667
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,779
Ever since the day you saved me
from the hole when I was a little girl,

668
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,198
I have been thankful to you
every single day.

669
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:12,916
Will you choose to come with me

670
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:14,918
or to die here?

671
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,677
I cannot go.

672
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,807
You cannot?

673
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,935
Yes, I cannot go just like this.

674
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,855
What woman becomes a kisaeng like this?

675
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,691
-Dong-ju!
-Is that right?

676
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,109
That would be improper of me.

677
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,069
I will come back to greet you

678
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,487
after I get myself prepared.

679
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,365
You will not trick with me this time?

680
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,159
The fate of this kisaeng house
is in your hands,

681
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,078
so how can I?

682
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,998
I knew that you were something else.

683
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,875
And I like the way you behave.

684
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,962
Send her to my annex by 10 p.m.

685
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,484
-Let us hear her out.
-No, we should not.

686
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,030
It is not a bad idea.

687
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,921
You must be out of your mind.

688
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,175
Will you go and kill him?

689
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,638
I cannot live off of doing chores
at the brewery.

690
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:54,684
I will get paid more
if I kill someone, right?

691
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,440
And you will not use this chance
to run away?

692
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,777
It is not like you will let me.

693
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,279
What is your true identity?

694
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,824
Have you ever killed a person?

695
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,454
I have watched a lot of them die.

696
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,499
I am the only one who
can support my ill parents.

697
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,751
As long as I can earn enough money,

698
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,878
killing someone will not be a big deal.

699
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,094
Sure, give it a try.

700
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,139
We needed a new member anyway,

701
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,516
so we have nothing to lose.

702
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,603
It will be another mess to clean up
if we kill her here.

703
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,853
Stop making that face.

704
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,064
What face?

705
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,484
As if you are seeing me

706
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,572
-for the last time ever in this life.
-How can you say that?

707
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,578
Here.

708
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,622
I will not die easily. Do not worry.

709
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,836
Hwa-su, I am leaving now.

710
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:47,630
Does Lady Kim know?

711
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:54,762
She left.

712
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,639
She left?

713
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,726
At this late hour? Where did she go?

714
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:02,770
You are right.

715
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,150
I let her go at this late hour.

716
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,217
If you really kill this son of a bitch,

717
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,635
you will not only get paid,

718
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,678
we will also let you work with us.

719
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,847
But if you fail,

720
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,475
die right there.

721
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,828
I need to get in the palanquin now.

722
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,956
so go back, you two.

723
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,333
That bastard!

724
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,546
Why did he ask you to come
to such an eerie place?

725
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,297
Stop crying.

726
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,174
Mae-hyang

727
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,219
came back dead!

728
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,597
What if you...

729
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,810
I am not going to die. I cannot die yet.

730
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,315
I will give my hair to you,
if that is what you want.

731
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,151
Hair cannot be more important
than the little girl.

732
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,320
Hair always grows back.

733
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,948
Who says I want to?

734
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:38,908
I am not doing this because I want to.

735
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,827
I do not want to become a kisaeng.

736
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,648
I am Dong-ju from Yeonhwa House.

737
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,785
You look happy to see me,

738
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,414
and you look appalled at the same time.

739
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,044
How did you get here?

740
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:38,796
I have something to tell you.

741
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,507
Right now?

742
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:42,800
Yes.

743
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,512
It is perfect timing.

744
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:49,015
What is it?

745
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:51,893
Well,

746
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,354
from today,

747
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,030
I will be

748
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:07,992
your mother.

749
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:10,828
You are my...

750
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:11,954
What?

751
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:20,713
Mother.

752
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,037
Make sure to greet me every morning.

753
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,498
Sweetheart, what if someone hears you?
You cannot call me "Hey."

754
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,083
You should call me "Mother."

755
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,168
Do you really want me to call you that?

756
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,628
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

757
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:02,839
-I hate doing the dishes.
-Then I will do it. You cook.

758
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,465
I will clean, you do the laundry.

759
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:05,716
-Deal.
-Sounds good?

760
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,677
I could not just turn away.

761
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,054
But that was not what you promised us.

762
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:12,098
You want me to steal
my father-in-law's jewelry?

763
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,642
I will give you three days to get it done
however you would like.

764
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,602
-Going somewhere?
-To see my mistress in Hanyang.

765
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,979
What a hopeless romantic you are.

766
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:20,189
It is so nice to be alone.

767
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,941
It is perfect.

768
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,444
Did you happen to see a widow

769
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,239
who has sassy eyes, a sharp nose,
and plump lips?

770
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:30,825
