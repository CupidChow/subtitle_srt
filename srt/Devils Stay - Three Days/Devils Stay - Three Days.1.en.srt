It's very strange.

133
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,915
Usually, they stretch and relax the stiff parts of the deceased.

134
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,082
So they can proceed to the next step.

135
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,707
Judging by the time of death,

136
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,374
they should be in rigor mortis by now.

137
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,499
Other parts are not stiffened,

138
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,874
only the right hand.

139
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,708
It's stiff.

140
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,499
What is that?

141
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,208
Polaris.

142
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,124
How could that be Polaris?

143
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,707
Look closely, it is Polaris.

144
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,707
So beautiful.

145
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,915

00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,583

155
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,832
I'll call him.

156
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,166

Didn't they say the surgery was perfect? What's going on?

160
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,540
Perfect, then why did the child die?

161
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,707
Every day, only believing in their own abilities and picky.

162
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,665
It's going to be a long surgery.

163
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,707
Get a good sleep.

164
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,082
When I say Sumi has woken up, then you have to wake up immediately.

165
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:01,708
I understand.

166
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,082
Just think of Dad as the North Star.

167
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,499
You'll never lose your way.

168
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,665
But what if.

169
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,582
What if I don't wake up?

170
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,708
That won't happen.

171
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,333
Don't you believe in Dad?

172
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:24,582
I've never made a mistake.

173
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,707
Dad only trusts the heart.

174
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,707
Then I'll trust Dad.

175
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,082
Nurse Jung says she became strange after the surgery.

176
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,707
Said she developed delusions.

177

178
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:41,833

Possessed by a ghost, a ghost.

180
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,207
Because we are doctors, we can't openly say it.

181

If that's delusion, what use are the doctors?

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,582
Baliar!

194
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,208
Miletus.

195
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,207
45:12

196
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,915
15:36 Baliar 45:12

197
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,083
Miletus.

198
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,332
Say your name.

199
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,540
Baliar.

200
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,250
Miletus.

201
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,833
Haixin.

202
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,541
But teacher,

203
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,582
Sumi must have gone to a good place, right?

204
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,082
You're really funny.

205
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,208
Kim Mi-young.

206
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:36,415
What's wrong?

207
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,083
That's right.

208
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,915
You all saw it too.

209
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,332
That day, Cha Sumi pushed him, that's why it happened.

210
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,666
Don't you remember?

211
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,499
Are you all senile?- Hey.

212
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,750
Be quiet.

213
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,832
Sorry, Sumi.

214
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,875
It's alright.

215
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,374
In a few days, you can have the cast removed.

216
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,415
Our Sumi is really sorry.

217
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,707
She feels it's because of her that it happened.

218
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,707
It doesn't seem like it was Sumi's doing.

219
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,416
That day.

220
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,332
Auntie, Sumi seemed a bit.

221
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,749
Strange.

222
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,332
What do you mean?

223
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,666
I know.

224
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,875
That day.

225
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,915
It wasn't Sumi.

226
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,915
Die, die, die.

227
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,582
Die, die, die.

228
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,249
Auntie, you know, right?

229
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,249
V Sumi became very strange after the surgery.

230
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,249
What happened?

231
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,875
Sumi, Sumi.

232
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:02,916
Let me go.

233
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,082
Sumi, Sumi, let me go.

234
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,708
Sumi.

235
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:08,540
Let me go.

236
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,915
Why is Sumi like this?

237
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:10,582
Let me go.

238
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,415
I'm going to kill her.

239
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,208
You damned doctor.

240
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,415
Only help if you get paid, huh?

241
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,082
Sumi, Sumi.

242
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,415
People who only care about money.

243
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,708
Let me go
- Sumi-Let me go.

244
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,583
Sumi.

245
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,832
Sumi, Sumi, it's okay now.

246
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,416
Sumi, it's okay now.

247
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,374
Dad.

248
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,665
No, no.

249
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,208
What's wrong?

250
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,208
- Student, student,

251
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:37,999
Are you okay?

252
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,415
Is that okay? Is that okay?

253
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,041
What should we do?

254
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:46,915
Is it okay? Is it okay?

255
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:53,916
Breathe quickly.

256
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:55,833
Exhale.

257
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,416
Breathe quickly.

258
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:00,708
What is happening?

259
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,583
Are you okay?

260
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,582
Can you breathe?

261
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,207
how so

262
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,750
Is that hair?

263
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,874


264
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:14,374
Che Sumei Lucia

265
00:25:56,708 --> 00:26:00,082
May the eternal light shine upon you. Gwangjin Catholic Church Purgatory

266
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
I am a father

267
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,208
Simple beauty

268
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:48,416
I am a father

269
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:53,041
dad

270
00:26:58,708 --> 00:26:59,749
I'm so cold

271
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,749
Who did it?

272
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
He Gu Ren Fu Fu Hao

273
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:25,874
I told you not to put it in.

274
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,999
But what if it goes bad?

275
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,416
Really

276
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,166
This won't work.

277
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,874
I told you not to put it in.

278
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,082
I will be responsible, please don't put it in

279
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,415
Wait a minute, no, really no.

280
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,915
- I'll take responsibility. - No, no, no

281
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:45,165
Can't wait

282
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,083
I won't stop you anymore

283
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,207
I'll give you some time.

284
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,915
Say goodbye to your daughter.

285
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,125
I need to give you a flashlight, a flashlight

286
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,915
The coffin was placed on the second day of the funeral

287
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,165
This is not a case that can be simply ignored.

288
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:27,832
The organization also said that they will not give up this time.

289
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:30,915
What did I say before?

290
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:32,415
Because of that kid

291
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,832
Didn't Mikael become like that?

292
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:41,415
Father Pan, that kid

293
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,582
You have to resolve your own pain first.

294
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,082
People who have been possessed by demons

295
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,582
During the exorcism, I will also suffer a lot.

296
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:55,707
How did that kid get the courage to become an exorcist?

297
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,832
If you're curious, ask him yourself.

298
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,332
Where on earth did he get the courage to become an exorcist?

299
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:29,832
stop

300
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,665
Don't worry

301
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:50,374
To become an animal or a human being

302
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:52,374
It's your decision.

303
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:53,708
I don't care

304
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,083
Only demons

305
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:05,082
I went to that kid's funeral today.

306
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:12,540
The devil's name is clear

307
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:15,332
And clearly used the prayer of expulsion

308
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,415
Drive the devil away

309
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:22,333
Hisense

310
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:26,915
That child has gone into the arms of the Lord.

311
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,540
I understand your feelings.

312
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,832
But now is the time to let that kid go

313
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,208
Excuse me

314
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,207
Do you know the saying that we are one?

315
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:46,207
It's Russian and means we are one.

316
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:49,207
The exorcism must have been successful.

317
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,249
But there's something else

318
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:54,416
What's wrong

319
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:55,541
Hisense

320
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:58,207
Don't worry about this anymore.

321
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,707
I will formally apply to the organization

322
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,915
No, I'll handle it this time.

323
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:06,207
This is not a guy you can handle.

324
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,582
There really isn't only Barel in there, right?

325
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,207
Please tell me what that guy is.

326
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:12,165
What is it?

327
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,415
Why does it remain in the body of the deceased?

328
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,499
Didn't I tell you to leave it alone?

329
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,165
Fr.

330
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:18,040
Have I lost you yet?

331
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:25,582
Our destiny is not exorcism

332
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:28,415
But to save those who are possessed by demons

333
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:33,540
But you don't care about those people at all now

334
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:35,707
I don't have

335
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,749
Just because I saw

336
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:44,082
Because I saw how Mikael died

337
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,874
Because I saw how painful Sumei was at that time

338
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,165
So I can't ignore it

339
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:55,249
I will exorcise the devil no matter what method I use.

340
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,249
Seoul Central Hospital

341
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:09,915
elder sister

342
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,249
Family members can come in.

343
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,415
what to do

344
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:58,790
Although the old friend has closed his eyes and mouth

345
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:04,165
But the ears are the last to close

346
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:09,332
Finally, if you have anything to say

347
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:12,415
Please tell her what you want.

348
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:15,040
Simple beauty

349
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:19,415
Mom also woke up in a daze this morning.

350
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:23,040
I am worried that our Sumei will be late for school.

351
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,582
Looked at the watch

352
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,415
But I found this is not home

353
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,707
Simple beauty

354
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,582
My daughter Sumei

355
00:35:57,708 --> 00:36:00,665
- Get out of the way, what's wrong?

356
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:05,624
Sumei, open your eyes.

357
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:09,040
-Sumei-Husband, what are you doing?

358
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,582
Sumei just spoke - Don't be like this

359
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:17,582
-Get out of the way of Sumei Sumei's husband

360
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:26,499
She is crying. Sumei is crying.

361
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,665
Don't be like this, bro.

362
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,999
Sumei's dad is here

363
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,332
I know you are sad

364
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,249
But sometimes enemies will shed tears

365
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,915
Sumei Sumei, please calm down

366
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:42,999
Be Cool

367
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,415
Lve ex CC The Virgin of Nazareth

368
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:53,332
Conjoined twins were born

369
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,999
The boss's name is Baril

370
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,832
The second child didn't even have a name when he was born

371
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,915
The demon resurrected in the bodies of twins

372
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,332
Confusing Humanity

373
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:12,207
Let them kill each other

374
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:20,999
Evil deeds against twins

375
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,082
The messengers of the Orthodox Church who are really unbearable to watch

376
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:27,540
Seal the second one in the heart of the eldest one, Baril

377
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:33,249
This is to stop the evil from happening again.

378
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,040
Sealed Heart

379
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:11,582
It looks like practice will be delayed.

380
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,374
Let's get started quickly

381
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,707
The others haven't arrived yet.

382
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,582
Gotta start fast

383
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,374
If you want to suppress that guy's power

384
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,874
Why did you catch me? Let me go

385
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:37,207
Let me go, let me go

386
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:42,207
Grace and peace from the Lord and Jesus Christ

387
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:45,415
May you all be blessed

388
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:47,999
May the messenger be blessed

389
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,040
Let me go

390
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,707
Rest in peace

391
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:09,374
Eternal rest

392
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:20,707
Restricted area

393
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:28,582
Eternal rest

394
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,874
Please grant

395
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,665
Eternal

396
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:53,665
Sumi, we breathe

397
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,332
The day departed from the world

398
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,375
Sumi

399
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,207
Sumi, open your eyes

400
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:22,833
Sumi

401
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,082
Sumi, wake up

402
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:28,749
- Father, oh my

403
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,040
Oh my, why is it like this

404
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:36,541
Sumi

405
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:43,999
Sumi, it's Daddy, Sumi

406
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:45,665
Sumi

407
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:55,040
Daddy is here, Sumi

408
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:03,040
Why did it happen

409
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,249
Sumi, open your eyes, Sumi

410
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:18,707
Hurry, hurry, hurry

411
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:19,915
Daddy is here

412
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:22,375
Sumi, open your eyes

413
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:25,082
Professor, professor

414
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,499
What's wrong with you, Father

415
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,250
Father

416
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:41,832
Sumi

417
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,582
- Still won't let go of me, Sumi - Calm down

418
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:46,707
Let go of me

419
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:49,249
Calm down - Sumi

420
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,374
- Father, are you okay? - Father

421
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,582
Father

422
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:56,583
Seoul Central Hospital Funeral Hall, Father

423
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,582
Wake up, Father

424
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:01,583
Father

425
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:03,208
Emergency Medical Center

426
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:05,041
What happened

427
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:08,707
- The Father, he - Hae-Sin

428
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:10,707
Yes

429
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:12,874
If you chase demons

430
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,749
You will only see demons

431
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:24,249
Go let them know that demons cannot defeat us

432
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,250
Father

433
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,374
No matter how much you struggle

434
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,540
You can't defeat us

435
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,540
What's really going on

436
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:56,040
Professor, calm down, why like this - I beg you

437
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:58,249
- Don't be like this - Let go, let go of me

438
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,915
Husband, what is wrong with you, are you crazy

439
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:02,332
I have to go, need to find Sumi - Why are you like this

440
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:05,915
- Why are you like this, husband - Sumi is speaking to me

441
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,249
I have to go

442
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:11,582
SECURITY

443
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:13,041
Enough

444
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:15,707
Look at me

445
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:22,541
Husband

446
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:26,332
Sumi is dead

447
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:28,415
Dead

448
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:30,499
Already dead

449
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:38,540
What is going on, making fun of people

450
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:39,749
Is this some kind of lunatic

451
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,749
Pulling off a stunt like this here

452
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,582
Made it this way, once everything is sorted

453
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,665
At that time, they come running

454
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,375
Who are you

455
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:58,374
You, this is not a place where just anyone can enter

456
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:02,249
Ah, you look like a priest

457
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,915
Please leave

458
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:06,999
I'll call someone

459
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:08,416
As you wish

460
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:12,499
Aren't you going to call someone

461
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,165
Go ahead

462
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:36,915
This isn't a place anyone can enter casually

463
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:40,166
Is he dead

464
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:41,832
Clearly, he's not dead

465
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:44,040
How can he do this

466
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:48,082
Why is today like this

467
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:57,415
What are you doing

468
00:44:57,416 --> 00:45:00,082
Who are you really, always lurking around here

469
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:03,582
Oh, you, let go, let go, we can talk it out

470
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,207
Husband, what's going on

471
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:10,582
Sumi, why like this

472
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:21,665
What's happening

473
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,082
The deceased's body reacted to holy water

474
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:29,707
It means the demon still remains in Sumi's body

475
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,665
The heart transplanted to Sumi

476
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,415
Where did it come from

477
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:40,165
Only by knowing that

478
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:42,415
Can we find the demon possessing that heart

479
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:46,999
If not, the demon will awaken using Sumi's body

480
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:51,874
And will take the lives of family members first

481
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:55,915
What does that mean

482
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:57,832
Just like Jesus awakened in three days

483
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,915
The demon left in Sumi's body as well

484
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:04,207
After three seals since Sumi's death

485
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:05,915
Will our Sumi come back to life

486
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:09,165
The demon resurrects using Sumi's body

487
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,499
To eliminate the demon

488
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,082
We must immediately cremate Sumi's body

489
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:42,915
Dad

490
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:44,541
I'm going to die

491
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:50,582
Sumi is already dead

492
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:52,833
Shut up

493
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:57,415
Stop bothering Sumi

494
00:46:57,916 --> 00:46:59,207
Or I will kill you

495
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:02,082
Get lost

496
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:06,082
Get this guy out

497
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:08,708
Husband

498
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:23,874
Found the heart

499
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:25,541
Really

500
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:29,040
Found a beautiful heart for you

501
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,041
Oh my

502
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:31,999
That's fantastic

503
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,082
Are you going to take out the heart of someone still alive

504
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,665
Are you giving Sumi some unidentified illegal heart

505
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:42,874
You bastard

506
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:45,249
You lunatic, shut up

507
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,707
The surgery is done by you

508
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:53,332
No one will know

509
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,540
Why make it so complicated

510
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:10,582
What are you doing

511
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,374
Aren't you going to save your daughter

512
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:17,915
The heart transplanted to Sumi

513
00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:19,499
Where did it come from

514
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:20,749
Only by knowing that

515
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,165
Can we find the demon possessing that heart

516
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:26,915
If not, the demon will awaken using Sumi's body

517
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:42,082
What is the matter with Sumi's heart

518
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:44,165
Speak, you bastard

519
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:45,582
What did you do

520
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,207
Speak

521
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:50,332
Cha Seung-do

522
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,499
It's spreading in the hospital that you've gone mad.

523
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,249
Stop now.

524
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:58,665
I'm not clear on the exact situation.

525
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:00,582
Funeral home

526
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:05,415
History and Culture

527
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:08,415
The donor is a Russian girl.

528
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:10,707
Said to have illegally stayed with her mother.

529
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,582
It's a gathering place for Russians.

530
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:29,582
Go there to find the lady.

531
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:32,207
That's all I know.

532
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,165
Hey, who are you?

533
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,208
Where is the lady?

534
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,540
How does he know the lady?

535
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:29,832
Rejoice, Mary full of grace.

536
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:33,040
The Lord is with you, blessed among women.

537
00:50:33,041 --> 00:50:36,082
Blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.

538
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:39,332
Please forgive the sinners.

539
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,499
Amen

540
00:50:56,416 --> 00:50:58,415
Why are you only coming now?

541
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:05,207
Still think you can save it, huh?

542
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:12,707
The more you struggle,

543
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:16,540
The stronger they'll become.

544
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:22,082
To awaken the one in slumber

545
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,915
and resurrect them.

546
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:26,333
To avoid the Russian Orthodox Church,

547
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,207
We've come here.

548
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:46,415
The one will awaken and resurrect after three days of death.

549
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:53,040
Will plunge the world into bloodshed and darkness.

550
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:05,707
Baryer's heart begins to beat in my daughter.

551
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:12,832
Finally able to serve the one.

552
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:21,499
But the Russian Orthodox Church keeps hindering me.

553
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:25,915
So we need a new vessel.

554
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:32,832
What's happening? Who are you?

555
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:01,375
Who are you Wen?

556
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:19,499
Why my daughter, Sumi?

557
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,415
Tell me quickly.

558
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:24,499
Why?

559
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:26,832
It's all because of you.

560
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:30,999
You would do anything to save your daughter.

561
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,832
The one knows that.

562
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:47,582
You might think it's the heart you found,

563
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:49,415
But it wasn't.

564
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:52,874
We found the vessel.

565
00:53:57,583 --> 00:53:59,415
A bunch of demons.

566
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:02,082
Tell me quickly.

567
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,874
How can we drive the demon out of Sumi?

568
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,874
How can we save Sumi?

569
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,915
Say it quickly.

570
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:29,499
This is as far as you can go.

571
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,540
You disappear,

572
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:35,832
Your daughter can let go of everything.

573
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:40,749
Attain eternal life in the one’s body.

574
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,207
Aren't you happy?

575
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:46,665
Your daughter can be resurrected.

576
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:51,707
Person, Satan, retreat! Invoke!

577
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,249
Holy Belmmatochka!

578
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:58,832
Holy peace be our light!

579
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:02,499
Don't let the devil rule us!

580
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:06,332
Person, Satan, retreat! Invoke!

581
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,499
By the will of God,

582
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:44,082
Speak the name of the demon you serve.

583
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:11,915
Igamari!

584
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:46,874
What are you going to do?

585
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:49,332
Wake up.

586
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,082
That demon wants to use you to resurrect.

587
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,083
Step aside.

588
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:57,499
It must be burned.

589
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:59,415
That person is not Sumi but a demon.

590
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:24,499
Haishin.

591
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:30,582
The Lord said,

592
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:33,082
The light will illuminate the darkness.

593
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:35,665
Darkness cannot overcome the light.

594
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:39,874
Igamari.

595
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:48,040
Must kill.

596
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:56,874
My Father,

597
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,374
Please protect the flock from Satan's poison.

598
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:03,082
Give us the Lord's endless mercy.

599
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:07,040
Offer our prayers to the highest!

600
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:13,249
No horns!!

601
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:19,249
Capture the evil dragon and old serpent.

602
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:30,083
Tempting the masses.

603
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:34,208
Amen

604
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:45,207
What swayed you wasn't the demon,

605
00:58:45,416 --> 00:58:47,874
But your thoughts on Mikel.

606
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:52,915
Allowed the demon an opportunity.

607
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,874
Lord forgives the world's sins from the flock.

608
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,749
Please grant us great mercy.

609
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:19,082
The Lord forgave the world's sins from the flock.

610
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:21,874
Please bring peace.

611
00:59:24,541 --> 00:59:26,415
Haishin.

612
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:37,874
I will never give up on you.

613
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:40,165
So you mustn't give up either.

614
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:43,707
No.

615
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:53,582
I won't be afraid.

616
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:57,540
I am with the Lord.

617
00:59:57,916 --> 00:59:59,874
I won't be afraid.

618
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:20,332
What if you got lost when you were little?

619
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:22,457
Stand still.

620
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:27,207
Stand still until Dad finds Sumi.

621
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,415
Understand? Keep the promise.

622
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:30,833
Agreed.

623
01:00:53,041 --> 01:00:55,374
Please, family members, mourn.

624
01:00:56,583 --> 01:00:57,583
Observe silence.

625
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,707
Funeral, third day send-off.

626
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:16,832
What time is it now?

627
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:18,708
Grandma.

628
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:20,832
I'm sorry.

629
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:23,999
The cremation appointment is due.

630
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:25,999
Can't delay it anymore.

631
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:28,749
We need to go now.

632
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:30,583
Not Mom.

633
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:34,207
At this rate, we can't all attend the funeral.

634
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:37,415
His child is leaving.

635
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:40,165
Should watch it, right?

636
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,415
Farewell.

637
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:05,707
What's wrong?

638
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:07,083
Did you fall?

639
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:07,707
No.

640
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:08,874
Lift it together.

What are you doing?

644
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:36,916
It moved.

645
01:02:40,916 --> 01:02:42,374

Let's go.

Got it, let's go, let's go.

Wait a moment, let's go.

I made an appointment with my dad.

If I can't find my dad

693
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:22,749
Just don't move

694
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,707

01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,832

Please save me

715
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,250
It is the words of the priest

716
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:47,249
If you're a priest, you should know what to do.

717
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
if

718
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,707
Su Mei is still persisting in there and has not given up

719
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,832
There won't be much time left.

01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:03,415
We need to rescue Sumei quickly.

721
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:11,040
Now we will start the exorcism prayer

722
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:12,915
I can't do this by myself.

723
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:15,082
I need someone to chant prayers with me.

724
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,707
No matter what happens, stick to it until the end

725
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:24,082

Please use this holy water to wash away your sins

01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,915
Exorcising the Devil

729
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,082

Don't be deceived

733
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:54,665
Use your unyielding faith to drive them back

734
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:01,540
The Lord has said

735
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,207
Light is the light in the darkness

736
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:06,499
So darkness cannot defeat light

737
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:17,499
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit

738
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:39,207

Arriving at the Lord's side

756
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:44,999
From now on, the devil will be even more furious

757
01:13:45,416 --> 01:13:47,040
Can't give it space

758
01:13:57,583 --> 01:13:58,749

Pray to the Lord

762
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:50,249
Because we are together

763
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:03,040
Simple beauty

01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:07,582
Please let me not be afraid of the devil

Please give me strength

Please give me the strength to fight off the devil.

768
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:33,415
Your daughter is dead anyway.

769
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:37,374
Save our Sumei

770
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:39,582
Save her!

771
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:44,082
-Sumei-Go to hell

772
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:45,415
Die

-Go to hell. -No.

775
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,249
Please protect us who are fighting

776
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:00,707
Please protect us from the evil and coercion of the devil

777

I command you in the name of Satan

778
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,040
Evil demons!

779
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:13,707
Let this child go.

780
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:16,165
Follow the devil away

781
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:17,332
It hurts so much

782
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:20,249
Please throw this girl into the lake of hellfire

783
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:23,665
Please save us from all the traps of evil spirits

784
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:27,582
We will not fear your witchcraft

785
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,040
Wake up

786
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:31,707

Do you want to save your daughter

Then prove it to me

808
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:34,416
Anyway, you are just a selfish person

809
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:39,582
You killed that poor child to save your daughter

810
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:47,457
Deeply penetrate this heart

811
01:19:50,208 --> 01:19:51,208
In that way

812
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:53,582
You and I will become one

Breathing, temperature, and heartbeats are normal

It's the first time we've encountered this situation

828

Keep calm for now

829
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:04,915

Suspected shoulder blade fracture, please prepare for CT

01:23:45,833 --> 01:23:49,582
Demons are born when they kill the person they once loved the most

833
01:23:50,541 --> 01:23:51,874
And that's how they start to emerge

834
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:54,415
And first of all

Though not entirely

852
01:27:55,666 --> 01:27:56,915
I can remember some things

853
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:02,040
I was very scared

854
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,582
But saw a faint light

855
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:08,874
And then I heard dad's voice

856
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:15,332
So I stood still waiting

857
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,374
Because I made a promise with dad

858
01:28:21,541 --> 01:28:22,541
Are you okay

859
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:25,999
I feel like I shouldn't be okay

860
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:28,875
Because

861
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:32,582
It seems like dad died because of me

862
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:36,332
I, who survived replacing dad

863
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:40,165
Really hate myself

864
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,165
It's not like that

865
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:48,915
Because of that, you should become better

866
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:54,499
Your dad is probably watching you

867
01:28:57,166 --> 01:28:59,082
The world he gave you

868
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:01,374
