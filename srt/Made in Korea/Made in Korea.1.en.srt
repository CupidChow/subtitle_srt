[person, in Japanese] Take
the first flight out to Fukuoka tomorrow.

00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,319
When you get there,
someone will be waiting for you.

4
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,658
[Kenji] And who would that be?

5
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,371
[person] I want you to meet Ikeda Yuji
and hand over this briefcase.

6
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,129
[Kenji] Ikeda Yuji?

7
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,882
[person] Your business partner.

8
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,220
The moment you
fall out of favor with Ikeda,

9
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,514
the deal's over.

My name is Matsuda Kenji,

00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,035
a businessman on a work trip to Fukuoka.

16
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,584
My job is to deliver this briefcase safely
to Ikeda Yuji.

17
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,970
[parent, in Japanese]
Hey, are you not feeling well? [chuckles]

18
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,763
Are you scared to fly?

19
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,890
-[child] I'm not scared.
-[parent] Hmm?

20
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,268
It's just my first time.

21
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:45,355
[parent] Everyone feels that way
their first time flying.

22
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:50,277
During takeoff,
your ears might pop a little.

23
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,989
It helps if you chew gum.

24
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,660
What do you say?

25
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,245
Thank you.

-[in Japanese] Stop.

We're the Revolutionary Army

00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,038
Shut up!

72
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,122
[Kenji] It's okay.

73
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,751
You and your mom
will make it out of here safely.

Japan Airways Flight 351,

76
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:03,595
a Japanese airliner that
left Tokyo Haneda Airport for Fukuoka

77
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,057
with 138 passengers and crew on board,
was hijacked midair.

78
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,894
The hijackers were the Revolutionary Army,

79
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,355
a radical leftist offshoot
of the Japanese Communist League,

80
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,482
calling themselves
the "Army for Revolutionary War."

81
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,985
They returned to Japan
after military training in North Korea,

82
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:24,074
and hijacked a civilian airliner,
intent on launching a revolutionary war.

83
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,910
Heads down! Down!

We're assessing the situation,

VICE-MINISTER OF TRANSPORT
NATSUME JUNJI

97
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,457
We should probably report this
to the Cabinet first.

98
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,583
Right.

99
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,170
Then let's draft a report right away.

100
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,671
[♪ foreboding music]

101
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,716
[Kenji] The Revolutionary Army boarded
the plane with loads of guns and knives

102
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,468
with no trouble at all.

103
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,013
[in Japanese] Before that,
how about we notify the police first, sir?

104
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,349
That's a good point too.

105
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:18,271
But I'm not sure who we should call first,
Tokyo or Fukuoka police…

106
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,441
[Kenji, in Korean] Back then, there were
no security checks before boarding.

107
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,526
A manual for hijackings?

108
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,945
[in Japanese] Guess we'll have to check
for precedent first, huh?

109
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,323
[Kenji scoffs, speaks in Korean]
There was no such thing.

110
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,950
[in Japanese] Well,
the report should probably be addressed

111
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,702
to the Prime Minister, right?

112
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,372
That's another thing we'll need to check.

113
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,873
Good point.

114
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,376
But…

115
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,005
are we sure
there's been an actual hijacking?

116
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,091
[employee] Yes, sir. It's confirmed.

117

00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,141
Drop your hands, and you're done for!

120
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,810
Keep your heads down!

121
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,894
[alarm beeping]

122
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,479
[captain, in English] Turbulence.

123
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,314
[copilot, in Japanese]
We could go into a stall!

124
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,859
-Should we change course?
-What are you up to?

125
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,570
The weather's getting worse,
and the aircraft is unstable.

126
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,324
If we don't act fast, we may have
to make an emergency landing.

127
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,617
[hijacker 2] Then do something!

128
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,911
[Kenji, in Korean]
A hijacking and turbulence.

129
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,915
In the middle of the total chaos,
the only relief was that

130
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,877
Captain Honda Kunihiko was a veteran pilot

131
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,337
with over 10,000 flight hours.

132
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,214
[copilot, in Japanese]
The aircraft has stabilized.

133
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,675
This was supposed to be a domestic flight.

134
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,593
We can't make it all the way to Pyongyang.

135
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,680
Without more fuel,
we'll run out and crash halfway.

136
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,852
Yes, the captain is right.

137
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,731
For now, why don't we land
at Itazuke Airport as planned

138
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,108
and request refueling there?

139
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,946
They're heading to Itazuke?

140
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,489
[employee] Yes, sir.

141
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,491
[Yoshiro]
I thought they were headed to North Korea.

142
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,160
Why are they flying to Itazuke?

143
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,204
[Junji] Ah. Why indeed?

144
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,332
Well, we should take measures.

145
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,625
What kind of measures?

146
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,046
I mean…

147
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,797
[Junji inhales sharply]

148
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,761
-Eh?
-[Kenji] Just as the captain intended,

149
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,805
the plane landed safely at
its original destination, Itazuke Airport.

ITAZUKE AIRPORT, FUKUOKA, JAPAN

151
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,435
For a moment, it gave
the passengers some sort of hope

152
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,395
that this nightmare might soon be over.

153
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,773
[Yoshiro, in Japanese] At this point,
nothing has been confirmed.

154
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:29,527
Uh, for now, our top priority is
the safety of the passengers.

155
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,072
How many hijackers are on board?

156
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,365
Have any passengers
been killed or injured?

157
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,700
[reporter]
When was the last communication?

158
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,035
[reporter 2] Are the hijackers armed?

159
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,747
-Is it true they're backed by someone?
-Are all the passengers unharmed?

160
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,457
[reporters clamoring]

161
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,045
Like I said,

162
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,965
our top priority right now is
the safety of the passengers.

163
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,884
We want you

164
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,054
to fill the tanks,

165
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,724
clear the runway,
and bring us the flight charts right now.

166
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,811
If you don't give us what we want,

167
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,772
we'll start killing
the passengers one by one!

168
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,608
How long would it take
to fill up the tanks?

169
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,611
[ATC] Actually, if they're trying
to get to Pyongyang,

170
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,488
the fuel on board should be enough.

171
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,157
What are you talking about?
That's not the point.

172
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,327
If we want to negotiate,
we need to buy as much time as possible.

173
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,004
Please don't shoot.

174
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,257
I brought the flight charts you asked for.

175
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,633
Here they are.

176
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,093
Move!

177
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,681
[flight attendant yelps]

178
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,059
[hijacker] Damn it.

179
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,519
You think we're idiots?

180
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,355
No. There wasn't much time,
so we had to prepare them in a rush.

181
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,857
What about the fuel?

182
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,734
We're working on it now.
If you could give us a little more time…

183
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,319
[plane whirring in distance]

184
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,370
[hijacker] One passenger every hour.

185
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,873
If you ignore our demands,

186
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,875
we will kill them.

187
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,376
Go on.

188
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,009
[hijacker] Go!

189
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,510
[hijacker 2] Yes, sir.

190
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,222
Hey, just drag one out first.

191
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,100
[quietly] What are you doing?
Not without Mr. Yamada's orders.

192
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,269
The second-in-command gave the go-ahead.

193
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,313
We agreed to avoid unnecessary bloodshed!

194
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,649
If the passengers start panicking,
it'll be hard to control them.

195
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,318
That's the kind of thing

196
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,279
only weak, college-graduate types
like you worry about.

197
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,823
What are you standing around for?

198
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,243
Hey, you. Come here.

199
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,245
-No, wait! Please don't kill me!
-[hijacker] Come on!

200
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,788
[passengers screaming]

201
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,457
Yamagata!

202
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,210
Somebody help me!

203
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,341
[passengers screaming]

204
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,845
Shut up!

205
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,931
You want to die in his place?

206
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,142
Takashi, do it!

207
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,769
Do it!

208
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,647
-[♪ suspenseful music plays]
-[yells]

209
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,191
[hijacker] Who the hell are you?

210
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,321
[screaming]

211
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,574
You need to treat the hostages carefully
until the negotiations are over.

212
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,202
Since their lives are tied to yours.

213
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,332
[counselor panting]

214
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,049
[hijacker] Who the hell are you?
What do you think you're doing?

215
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,054
Tell your leader I want a word with him.

216
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,325
You think you can help us?

217
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,161
How exactly?

218
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,749
First, let the women, children,
and the elderly go.

219
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,543
Why should we?

220
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,878
[Kenji]
What you want is a revolution, isn't it?

221
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:22,385
As you know, a revolution
without public support is bound to fail.

222
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,597
But terrorists who release
women and children win favor

223
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,725
with the public and the press.

224
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,854
If you make the first move,
all the criticism falls on the government.

225
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:38,109
After that, whatever you do,
it's the government that takes the blame.

226
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,030
In the end, they'll have no choice
but to let you take off.

227
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:48,077
And you'll still have
over a hundred hostages.

228
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,497
Not a bad bargain, is it?

229
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,043
And then what?

230
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,837
Once you reach Pyongyang,

231
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,298
put the remaining passengers and crew
back on the plane

232
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,758
and send them home to Japan.

233
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,262
Then the press won't call you hijackers.

234
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,141
They'll paint you as heroes
who pulled off a bold operation.

235
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,852
Well, probably.

236
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,901
We can't just send the plane back.

237
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,030
We need to make
some kind of gesture to North Korea,

238
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,116
or they won't take us in.

239
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,037
I can provide that.

240
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,881
[briefcase lock clicks open]

241
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,346
[Yamada] That's…

242
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,348
[underboss] Mr. Yamada.

243
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,934
[Kenji] I told you.

244
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,353
I could help you.

245
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,775
Take a chance and trust me.

246
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:05,029
Do as I say, and you'll get what you want
without anyone getting hurt.

247
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,293
[reporter] It's opening!

248
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,295
[reporters clamoring]

249
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,039
[Kenji, in Korean] In the end, they did
what I told them and let 23 passengers go.

250
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,041
Women, children, and the elderly.

251
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:04,463
The meth in my briefcase was worth
nearly 90 million yen on the street,

252
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,341
and word was all over Japan
that the big shots in Pyongyang

253
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,885
were crazy for the stuff.

254
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:13,723
[Kenji scoffing] To these bastards, I was
like a jackpot that fell on their laps.

255
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,641
[employee, in Japanese]
They've released 23 passengers in total.

256
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,727
Women, children, and the elderly.

257
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,103
They really let them go?

258
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,188
[employee] Yes, sir.

259
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,522
But…

260
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,734
they're saying if we don't supply fuel
and clear the runway immediately,

261
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,903
they'll kill the rest of the passengers.

262
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,779
-[Junji] What?
-Kill them?

263
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,699
-What are we going to do?
-This is a problem.

264
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,826
This is bad.

265
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,536
For now, give them what they want.

266
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,538
The passengers' safety
is our top priority.

267
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,623
What do we do?

268
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,374
[Yoshiro sighs]

269
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,006
[hijacker] They're pulling back!
The fighter jets are moving!

270
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,052
[underboss] They're letting us take off.

271
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,432
We're going to Pyongyang!

272
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,068
[hijacker] They're fueling us up!

273
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,737
-We're going to Pyongyang!
-[all cheering]

274
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,489
Let's go to North Korea!

275
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,455
Why are you helping us?

276
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,250
It's just better to handle things quietly.

277
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,045
Nothing good comes
from making a lot of noise, does it?

278
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,465
Who are you?

279
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,716
As you can see,

280
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,261
I'm just a businessman.

281
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,888
[Yamada] When you say a businessman…

282
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,226
you mean in this kind of business, huh?

283
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,395
It's the best money-maker there is.

284
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,230
Though it comes with its risks.

285
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,483
[Yamada] Are you with the yakuza?

286
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,402
[Kenji] No.

287
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,572
They're more like business partners.

288
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,156
Something like that.

289
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,622
Can I bum a cigarette?

290
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,508
[in Korean] Is that the last one?

291
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,806
[in Japanese]
We're basically in the same boat now.

292
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,058
You can spare me a cigarette, no?

293
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,612
[in Korean] Oh, boy. It's his last one.

294
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,420
They say once you get on meth,
you can never quit.

295
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,713
Have you tried it?

296
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,884
If you're curious, why don't you
go ahead and try it now?

297
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,972
We're ready to take off, sir.

298
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,734
[♪ tense music playing]

299
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:17,907
[caller] J, A, Y, 3, 5, 1.

300
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:23,329
3, 8, 1, 1, 7.

301
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:40,054
KOREA GIMPO AIRPORT RAPCON,
(UNDERGROUND CONTROL TOWER)

302
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,852
[Korean airman, in English] RAPCON is
US Air Force, no Korea!

303
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,397
[American officer] Sergeant Chae Jiseok
is going to be here soon, all right?

304
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,982
He belongs to RAPCON.
Fucking let him deal with it.

305
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,902
We're not going
to get our hands dirty here.

306
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,072
[in Korean] Sir.

307
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,327
You called for me, sir?

308
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,879
[airman] As of this moment,
US Forces Korea will vacate RAPCON

309
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,258
and take no part in any situation
that may arise going forward.

310
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,928
[Jiseok]
Wait, I'm sorry, sir. I don't understand.

311
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,472
Who's going to be in charge here then?

312
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,099
[agent] Hey.

313
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,435
Come here.

314
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,109
Are you the chief controller?

315
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,027
Yes.

316
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,779
Rank and name!

317
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,241
Yes, sir! Sergeant Chae Jiseok.

318
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,702
[phone ringing]

319
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,003
Yes, sir.

320
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,256
Yes, sir. Okay.

321
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,216
Take it.

322
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,677
Take it.

323
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,811
[director, on phone] KCIA Director here.
Are you the chief controller?

324
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:11,896
Yes, sir!

325
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,814
-[♪ plaintive music plays]
-[Kenji] The KCIA.

326
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,942
A state intelligence agency created by
the military regime that seized power

327
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,778
in a coup to keep its grip on the country.

328
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,114
Modeled after the US CIA, it operated
under the banner of anti-communism,

329
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,408
handling national security,
intelligence gathering,

330
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,785
and covert operations abroad.

331
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,037
But the reality was different.

332
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:33,209
Skirting the law, it terrorized the people
and wielded unchecked power.

333
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:37,713
The KCIA was nothing more
than the President's personal guard.

334
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,674
[director] Listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

335
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,301
These are the President's orders.

336
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,845
In a little while,
a plane will cross over to our side.

337
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:49,058
You must seize that plane
before Pyongyang does, no matter what.

338
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,186
Under no circumstances should you let it
reach Pyongyang first.

339
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,395
Understood?

340
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,522
Yes, sir. Understood.

341
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,656
[Kenji] At last,
the plane left Itazuke Airport

342
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,032
and headed for Pyongyang.

343
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,496
But it was imperative that
we never reach Pyongyang

344
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,581
as the Revolutionary Army wanted.

345
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,128
It's better to die
than to end up in Pyongyang.

346
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,723
The aircraft has entered our airspace.

347
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,352
[captain, in English]
Any station, any station.

348
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,980
This is Japan Airways 351.

349
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,898
Japan Airways 351.

350
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,067
This is Seoul Control, loud and clear.

351
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,738
Seoul Control, this is Japan Airways 351.

352
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,659
Uh, we need to land at Pyongyang Airport
in North Korea.

353
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,327
Request any information.

354
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,037
Standby one.

355
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,012
[in Japanese]
We've got fighter jets following us.

356
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,431
They're Korean Air Force.

357
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,476
[Jiseok, in English] Japan Airways 351.

358
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,896
Change frequency to 131.4.

359
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:34,580
[captain] Pyongyang Control,
this is Japan Airways 351.

360
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,873
How do you hear me?

361
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,293
We want to land at Pyongyang Airport.

362
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,794
Request information.

363
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:46,216
Pyongyang Control, Pyongyang Control,
this is Japan Airways 351.

364
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:47,885
Radio check.

365
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,680
Pyongyang Control, Pyongyang Control.

366
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,767
This is Japan Airways 351.

367
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,143
Radio check.

368
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,316
Pyongyang Control, Pyongyang Control,

369
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,152
this is Japan Airways 351.

370
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,071
Radio check.

371
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:26,215
[Jiseok] Japan Airways 351,
this is Pyongyang Control. Loud and clear.

372
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,052
We control to Pyongyang Airport.
Heading 270. Maintain.

373
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,762
[in Japanese] Pyongyang just responded.

374
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,389
Congratulations, Mr. Yamada!

375
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,685
[Kenji] A few months prior, a flight
from Gangneung to Seoul was hijacked

376
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,937
and taken to North Korea
by North Korean agents

377
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,271
disguised as passengers.

378
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:46,527
Of the 50 people abducted,
39 returned through Panmunjom.

379
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,988
But 11, including the captain
and several passengers,

380
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,739
still remain detained in North Korea.

381
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,243
Chae Jiseok had been thrown
into the invisible battlefield

382
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,619
between the two Koreas.

383
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,832
[captain, in English] Pyongyang Control,
this is Japan Airways 351.

384
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,751
Heading 270, maintain.

385
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,753
Request further clearance.

386
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:11,593
[Kenji, in Korean] And now, this plane
is being hijacked all over again.

387
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,887
[in Japanese]
The fighter jets are pulling away, sir!

388
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,148
[Jiseok, in English] Japan Airways
351, this is Pyongyang Control.

389
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,608
Turn left heading 200.

390
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,152
Roger, Pyongyang Control.

391
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,654
Heading 200.

392
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:42,124
[Kenji, in Korean] A double hijacking.
At Gimpo Airport's control tower,

393
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,085
air traffic controller Chae Jiseok
intercepted the transmission

394
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,379
bound for Pyongyang
and redirected the plane south.

395
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,549
[Jiseok, in English]
Japan Airways 351, Runway 32, right.

396
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,510
[captain] Roger, Runway 32, right.

397
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,138
[Jiseok, on radio]
Good afternoon, Japan Airways 351.

398
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,514
Continue approach.

399
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,977
GIMPO AIRPORT, KOREA

400
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,688
[in Korean] From this moment,
this is Pyongyang Airport!

401
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:09,902
Once the hijackers exit the plane,
capture them all alive.

402
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:14,907
If they resist,
you may open fire immediately.

403
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,327
[Kenji] Without them realizing,

404
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,578
the aircraft passed over Pyongyang,

405
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,123
crossed the West Sea,
and finally landed at Gimpo Airport.

406
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,687
They cobbled together
a crowd of locals, students, and soldiers

407
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,190
disguised as a North Korean
welcoming committee.

408
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:56,031
They even went so far as to hang
North Korean flags on the terminal,

409
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,283
but the whole charade was clumsy at best.

410
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,873
[in Japanese] Sir, something's not right.

411
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,168
[Yamada] Move!

412
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,591
[crowd cheering]

413
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,968
[Kenji, in Korean] As expected,

414
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,011
the Revolutionary Army
sensed something was wrong.

415
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,515
Alas, the grand operation
they had planned…

416
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,393
[in English] Hey!

417
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,230
You!

418
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,651
Here, Seoul?

419
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,320
Yes!

420
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,990
[Kenji, in Korean] …ended in failure.

421
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,577
[in Japanese] Do you want me to kill you?

422
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,786
What the hell is this?

423
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,416
Why are we in South Korea?

424
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,500
I don't know.

425
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,128
[underboss]
You don't know? I'm going to kill you!

426
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,006
[Kenji] If you kill the captain,
who's going to fly the plane?

427
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,595
What about Pyongyang?
Not going there anymore?

428
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,517
I'm going to kill you.

429
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,603
All I did was try to help you.

430
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,231
Will you make it to Pyongyang
if you kill me?

431
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,192
Don't give me that crap.
I'm going to kill you right now.

432
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,611
Calm down first.

433
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,822
There's still a way
for you to get there safely.

434
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,073
[underboss] Shut up!

435
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,952
I'm done falling for the words
of some Zainichi.

436
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,124
You think I wouldn't notice?

437
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,253
Zainichi like you reek, you know.

438
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,341
That same stench you get
from pigs and dogs.

439
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,467
[Yamada] Stop.

440
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,221
There's a way for us to get to Pyongyang?

441
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,017
You have my word.

442
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,189
I'll get you to Pyongyang safely.

443
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,233
Are you willing to bet your life on that?

444
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,528
I'll bet my life on it.

445
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,907
[Kenji, in Korean] Japan,
closely monitoring the plane's movements,

446
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,492
was thrown into complete chaos

447
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,453
and dispatched a delegation
to South Korea to assess the situation.

448
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,956
[official] I don't know how
the plane ended up landing here.

449
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,543
But now that it's in our country, there is
no way we're sending it to Pyongyang.

450
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,837
[interpreter, in Japanese] "There's no way
we're sending it to Pyongyang."

451
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,130
[mic feedback]

452
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,299
[Junji]
The mic. Mr. Jeong, the microphone switch.

453
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,801
-What about it?
-The microphone.

454
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,260
[interpreter 2] Right, sorry.

455
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:27,015
[in Japanese] Who'd want to send it
to Pyongyang? None of us wants that.

456
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,976
"Who'd want to send it to Pyongyang?"

457
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,519
But listen.

458
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,896
With the passengers' lives at stake,

459
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,692
we need to leave room for negotiation.

460
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,901
[clicks mic button]

461
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,153
[in Korean] So why did you let it
come here in the first place?

462
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,989
This should've been handled in Japan!

463
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,699
[interpreter]
"It should've been handled in Japan."

464
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,994
This really puts us
in a difficult position too,

465
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,788
but the President's stance
is absolutely firm.

466
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,832
[interpreter, in Japanese]
"…is absolutely firm."

467
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,211
[Yoshiro]
We're well aware that public opinion

468
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,671
in South Korea isn't favorable

469
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,756
because of the recent hijacking incident.

470
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,051
But there are more than a hundred lives
on the line here.

471
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:07,389
So shouldn't we approach this
from a humanitarian perspective

472
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,932
rather than a political one?

473
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,894
[in Korean] Look, it's not public opinion
we're concerned about.

474
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,480
Our priority is the safety
of the South Korean aircraft

475
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,274
and citizens still held in the North.

476
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,609
We're not saying
you can't negotiate with them.

477
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,403
We're saying sending it to Pyongyang is

478
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,488
-absolutely out of the question.
-[official] That's right…

479
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,824
-[mic feedback]
-[feedback stops]

480
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,035
-[minister] Geez, what…
-[official] That's right.

481
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:31,496
After all, if we don't start
the engines from outside,

482
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,082
-the plane can't even take off.
-[interpreter translates]

483
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,293
They're not some miracle workers,
are they?

484
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,880
In the end,
they'll have no choice but to give in.

485
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,674
The South Korean government never admitted

486
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,634
that it had deliberately
diverted the plane.

487
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,637
[Junji, in Japanese] On that plane
are our citizens.

488
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,765
Japanese citizens.

489
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:54,227
They're completely innocent people,
just like you.

490
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:58,607
We fully understand the position
of the South Korean government.

491
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,360
But right now, please put
the passengers' lives

492
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,238
and safety above all else.

493
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,492
I sincerely urge you.

494
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,327
[Kenji, in Korean]
The gap between the two sides was clear,

495
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,329
and there was little sign of compromise.

496
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:18,710
[captain, in English]
This is Japan Airways 351.

497
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,921
-We need air in the cabin.
-[passengers coughing]

498
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,423
The engines have shut down,

499
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:27,094
and all the power
and ventilation systems are down.

500
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,931
Unless we get air
into the cabin immediately,

501
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,058
it will be difficult to breathe.

502
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,227
I repeat.

503
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,730
We need air in the cabin.

504
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,691
-The engines have shut down…
-[slurping]

505
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,820
…and all the power
and ventilations are down.

506
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:48,657
Unless we get air
into the cabin immediately,

507
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,826
it will be difficult to breathe.

508
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,831
This is Seoul Approach Control.

509
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,083
Open the door.

510
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,753
Once again, open the door.

511
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,589
[Yamada, in Japanese] Like you said,

512
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,760
we pinned all the blame
on the Japanese government.

513
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:10,470
Good.

514
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,767
[clears throat] The Japanese government is
probably trying to figure out a way

515
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:19,020
to send you to Pyongyang
for the passengers' safety.

516
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,985
The problem is
the South Korean government.

517
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,616
They won't let you go that easily.

518
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,668
I owe you one.

519
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,094
So what's your plan?

520
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,639
You need a justification.

521
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,731
Let all the remaining passengers go.

522
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,775
You bastard. You think
we're going to fall for that again?

523
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,448
Hey.

524
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,868
Who the hell are you, really?

525
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,745
I told you.

526
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,331
I'm a businessman.

527
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,666
What are you playing at?

528
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,880
[clicks tongue, sighs]

529
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,303
All I want is to settle this quietly.

530
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,181
Send you to Pyongyang

531
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,558
and finish my business.

532
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,519
We're not letting any more passengers go.

533
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,274
If the South Korean government
doesn't accept our demands,

534
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,443
we're killing them all!

535
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,780
And of course,
we'll cut your head off first.

536
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,657
Fine.

537
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,911
Then let's do it another way.

538
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,957
Bring me the briefcase I gave you.

539
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,501
Inside is the answer

540
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,420
to get you to Pyongyang.

541

[hijacker breathes shakily] What was that?

553
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,659
Was that a gunshot?

554
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,036
[hijacker 2] What? We've got guns?

555
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,166

556
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,253

[in Korean] They heard a gunshot
from inside the plane.

562
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,892
[interpreter] They heard a gunshot
from inside the plane!

563
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,227
[minister] A gunshot?

564
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,354
-Good grief.
-Really?

565
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:13,857
[in Japanese] As you just saw,

566
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,445
this isn't like the toys you're holding.

567
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,489
This one can actually kill.

568
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,577
So,

569
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,747
what are you going to do to us?

570
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,915
[Kenji] From now on,

571
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:34,627
you're going to quietly follow
my orders and go to Pyongyang.

572
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,422
[Kenji, in Korean] That's right.

573
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,550
They took the passengers
hostage to seize the plane.

574
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:45,054
Now, I'll take them hostage
to get out of here.

575
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:48,808
[in Japanese] From here on,
tell them exactly what I'm about to say.

576
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,855
We want…

577
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:58,401
[Yamada] We want nothing more than that.

578
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:03,198
[airman, in Korean]
"We want nothing more than that."

579
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,868

If you don't meet our demands…

"If you don't meet our demands…"

581
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,330
[Yamada, in Japanese]
…the second it hits noon…

582
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,664
"…the second it hits noon…"

583
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:14,375
[Yamada] …we'll detonate the bomb
on this plane and blow ourselves up.

584
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,170
"…we'll detonate the bomb
on this plane and blow ourselves up."

585
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,589
[Yamada, in Japanese]
But if you do what we ask…

586
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,716
"But if you do what we ask…"

587
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,469
[Yamada, in Japanese]
…we will safely release…

588
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,970

"…we will safely release…"

589
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,055
[Yamada, in Japanese] …all the passengers.

590
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,223

"…all the passengers."

[agent scoffs]

592
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,688
[in Japanese] Thank goodness.

593
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,400
How can we trust them to keep their word?

594
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:45,073
To show good faith, they said
they'd release half the passengers now.

595
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,909
Fifty-eight in total.

596
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,414
[Yoshiro]
They're actually releasing the passengers?

597
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,458
[Kenji, in Korean] Hostage exchange.

598
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,710
-The condition I had Yamada deliver
-[♪ intriguing music]

599
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:01,172
was that a senior Japanese government
official would take the place

600
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,508
of the passengers
and become the hijackers' hostage.

601
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,886
I was a Japanese businessman
who boarded the plane with drugs.

602
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,389
To get out of the mess
without ending up in North Korea,

603
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,474
I had to find a way to settle it.

604
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,396
With a new hostage, the Revolutionary Army
secured their own safety,

605
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,275
while South Korea's justification
for grounding the plane,

606
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,236
citing passenger safety,
was no longer valid.

607
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,906
North Korea granted
the Revolutionary Army asylum,

608
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,700
and just as I expected,

609
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,035
the plane was sent back to Japan
a few days later.

610
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,290
They couldn't ignore the glare
of the international community.

611
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,252
Once repatriated, Vice-Minister Natsume
and Captain Honda were celebrated

612
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:43,423
as national heroes in Japan parlaying
that fame into politics and success.

613
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,011
But Chae Jiseok, the controller
who diverted the plane

614
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,805
and saved the passengers,
was never hailed as a hero.

615
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,058
Instead, he was pressured into silence
about what happened that day,

616
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,185
until he finally hung up
his uniform for good.

617
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,270
That's right.

618
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:02,483
That's how the President and the KCIA
keep this country running.

with the free people of the world.

625
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,919
On this occasion,

626
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:25,882
our government and our people have
once again renewed our vigilance

627
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,509
against the atrocities
of the communist forces.

628
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:34,015
[Kenji] After the incident,
Japan started airport security checks

629
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,267
and even enacted an anti-hijacking law

630
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,230
which meant the good old days
of casually boarding a plane

631
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,775
with a briefcase full of drugs were over.

632
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:52,408
Too bad about that briefcase,
but leaving it was the right call.

633
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:02,919
[in Japanese] It's a gift.

634
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,714
I doubt we'll ever see
each other again, but…

635
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,970

637

[Kenji, in Korean] And so,
I arrived in Fukuoka later than planned.

638
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,323
There'd been a bit of trouble,
but business is business.

639
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,538
Finally, I was about
to meet my business partner, Ikeda Yuji.

640
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,623
Is it a woman?

641
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,417
It's a woman.

642
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,672
I was told I had to go through her
to reach Chairman Ikeda,

643
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,967
and the moment I fell out of her favor,
the deal was over.

644
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,276
[in Japanese] I'm Ikeda Yuji.

645
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,570
I'm Matsuda Kenji.

646
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,449
You're very late.

647
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,326
Something came up.

648
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,788
The goods?

649
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,087
Can I borrow a light?

650
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,310
I left the goods on the plane.

651
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,230
I had to because of
the Revolutionary Army.

652
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,986
Are you talking about the plane
that went to Pyongyang?

653
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,448
That's the one. I was on it.

654
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,658
I'm sorry.

655
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,245
But I suppose
this is where our business ends.

656
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,247
Farewell.

657
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:04,999
It's a shame.

658
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,920
I was hoping to show Chairman Ikeda
the best there is.

659
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,763
I'll see you again.

After nerve-racking negotiations,

665
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,017

-Wow.

00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:09,188
I thought they were
just a bunch of clueless idiots.

But it looks like at least one of them

trying to turn themselves

00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,804
-into export heroes by dealing meth?
-Right.

679
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:44,140
Why do they keep getting involved
with the yakuza?
