1
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,720
VIETNAM, 1965

2
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,366
Column, halt.

3
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,004
It doesn't really matter
what the war is for.

4
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:56,348
Someone's death becomes
someone else's chance.

5
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,017
That's what war is.

6
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,540
Looks like one of the Vietcong tunnels.

7
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,731
Moving in.

8
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,477
And my role was to be that death.

9
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,648
Just cannon fodder
for someone else's rise.

10
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,583
-How did it go?
-It's been taken care of, sir.

11
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,086
And the money in the safe?

12
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,921
Baek will take it to you.

13
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,258
Clean it up right. No loose ends.

14
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,426
Yes, sir. Understood.

15
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,571
It's done.

16
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,955
Mr. Jang!

17
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,251
Man, what the hell happened here?

18
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,796
Mr. Jang, are you all right? Are you hurt?

19
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,010
-Baek Kitae didn't show, right?
-No, he never got off the ship.

20
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,433
Well, let's start by tracking down
Pyo Haksu first.

21
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,853
We were just about to call in backup
from the nearby army base.

22
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,024
Search request,
KCIA Agent Pyo Haksu.

23
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,777
-He showed up on his own.
-You can't come in here!

24
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,904
Move, asshole. I'm with the KCIA.

25
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,239
-Hey! Let him through.
-I said, move!

26
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,035
Mr. Pyo Haksu!

27
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,790
Come here, please.

28
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,292
How do you know who I am?

29
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,003
What's going on here?

30
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,506
I'm Busan District Prosecutor
Jang Geonyoung.

31
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,174
Okay. And?

32
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,385
What brings the KCIA department head here?

33
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,721
I came to pick up the director.

34
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,557
-Director Hwang?
-Yes, where is he?

35
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,850
Well, you killed him.

36
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,853
You're under arrest

37
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,440
for suspicion of Director General
Hwang Gukpyeong's murder.

38
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,192
Cuff him.

39
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,361
Don't be ridiculous.

40
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,821
-Hey, wait.
-Don't make a scene.

41
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,072
-Just hold on.
-Come on.

42
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,908
No, stop! I'll do it myself.

43
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,748
You sure you can handle this?
What do you think you're doing?

44
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,416
Quiet down. Let's go.

45
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,753
WAR OF BLOOD

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,178
Mr. Baek, you're here.

47
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:48,974
What's going on?

48
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,475
Prosecutors arrested Mr. Pyo

49
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,727
under suspicion
of murdering Director Hwang.

50
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,606
We're waiting on the autopsy to confirm
the body's really Director Hwang.

51
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,567
Silence the press first.

52
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,651
Yes, sir.

53
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,446
Wait, sir. There's blood on your…

54
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm heading up to Seoul.
Get the car ready.

55
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,914
Yes, sir.

56
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,799
Hello?

57
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,052
-Hey, Soyeong.
-Hi, Kitae.

58
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,554
-Where's Daeil now?
-Mr. Daeil?

59
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,807
He was at the lab
but left to take care of something.

60
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,351
Why do you ask?

61
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,979
-Is something wrong?
-Got it. I have to go.

62
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,233
Who was that?

63
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,236
It's Kitae. He's looking for you.

64
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,947
What for?

65
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,701
I have no idea.

66
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,580
Mr. Pyo Haksu.

67
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,167
Why did you kill him?

68
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,002
Why did you kill Hwang?

69
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,879
You keep crossing the line.

70
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,423
If you keep bulldozing ahead like that,

71
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,842
how will you handle
the consequences later?

72
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,219
Just worried about you.

73
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,515
You killed him. Didn't you?

74
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:55,934
Did you see it?

75
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,354
I saw him dead, shot through the eye.

76
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,273
I told you. I dropped him off
and went to buy cigarettes.

77
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,776
Go ask at the store.
How many times do I have to…

78
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,074
So you're saying,
while you were out buying cigarettes,

79
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,285
Hwang ended up dead?

80
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,371
What then?

81
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,124
You think I killed him

82
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,668
and then went out for cigarettes?

83
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,379
And the fire just happened to break out?

84
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,798
Come on, Mr. Jang. That doesn't add up.

85
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,342
And what motive could I have to kill him?

86
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,678
There's no motive.

87
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,388
Right.

88
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:39,853
You went to buy cigarettes,
Hwang died, and the fire broke out.

89
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,272
Baek Kitae was with you, wasn't he?

90
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,569
He was with you at the temple, right?

91
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,695
Here it is.

92
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,572
Look, that's Ikeda Yuji.

93
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,450
Tell me, what was the KCIA

94
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,328
doing with the yakuza in Osaka?

95
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,290
That's classified. I can't tell you.

96
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,542
Classified, my fucking ass.

97
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,919
Watch your language.

98
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,254
I know you and Baek Kitae went to Japan

99
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,256
and sold meth there.

100
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,259
Then, you passed the money to Hwang.

101
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,222
You did all the work,

102
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,182
but the bastard reaped the cash.

103
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,895
That's why you and Baek Kitae
killed him, isn't it?

104
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,149
Do you have proof? Do you?

105
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,194
Proof? Sure.
I'll whip up a good one for you.

106
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,029
-Wow.
-You little…

107
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,197
You do that.

108
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,281
Hey.

109
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,326
You like prison food? Huh?

110
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,290
-Jang.
-Yes?

111
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,708
A word?

112
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,669
Goodness! What is it?

113
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,129
You should go.

114
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,924
-Looks like you're in trouble. Go on.
-Have a smoke while I'm gone.

115
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,857
Geez.

116
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,737
BUSAN DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE CASE RECORDS

117
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,741
So, Baek Kitae took over

118
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,369
Jo Manjae's meth business?

119
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,121
Yes, sir.

120
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,456
With Kang Daeil backing him?

121
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,541
That's right.

122
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,295
And they killed Director Hwang?

123
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,505
He had a gunshot wound

124
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,883
to the face,

125
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,760
through the right eye.

126
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,513
They shot him dead.

127
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,433
And set the place on fire

128
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,310
to wipe out the evidence.

129
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,814
Sir.

130
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,399
I'm going to

131
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,776
issue an arrest warrant for Baek Kitae.

132
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,195
If this goes wrong,

133
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,906
the whole prosecution blows up.

134
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,866
You realize that?

135
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,368
-Yes.
-Fucking hell.

136
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,955
I'll make sure we get Pyo's confession.

137
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,378
This is the money

138
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,923
Director Hwang had been skimming off
behind your back.

139
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,720
Looks like his head wasn't the only thing
he was thinning out.

140
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,807
I believe he also had some land
and buildings in his relatives' names.

141
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,268
I'll check and report back
as soon as I can.

142
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,648
And this.

143
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,581
It's Bae Geumji's notebook.

144
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,381
Did you look?

145
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,882
Yes, sir.

146
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,717
I did.

147
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,929
And you saw my name?

148
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,639
I'm sorry, sir.

149
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,735
What do you want?

150
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,490
I came to ask you
to please reinvest this money with me.

151
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,870
If you'd let me,
I'm sure I can use this as seed money

152
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,164
and multiply the returns
by many times over.

153
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,500
So you're saying,

154
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,295
you want to do business with me?

155
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,547
The election is less than a year away.

156
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,549
I heard the President needs 70 billion won

157
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,051
to secure another term
for the good of the nation.

158
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,846
I'll raise it.

159
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,890
How can I trust you?

160
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,350
You don't have to trust me.

161
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,061
Just give me a chance
to prove what I can do.

162
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:36,190
I'll show you that even if you don't
trust me, you can trust my money.

163
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,235
I won't let you down, sir.

164
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,715
Go sit in that chair.

165
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,517
Go sit in it.

166
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,663
I heard Hwang went around
telling everyone

167
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,457
you were his pick for the next director,

168
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,376
and he took good care of you.

169
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,885
And that made a lot of people jealous.

170
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,350
Now that…

171
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,062
he's dead…

172
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,316
shouldn't you be
the one to take his place?

173
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,446
Come to think of it,

174
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,615
it's not all bad

175
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,202
for Baek Kitae that you're stuck in here.

176
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,455
Someone definitely murdered Hwang

177
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,332
with a gun and burned down the place…

178
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,045
but you were out buying cigarettes.

179
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,968
Do you trust Baek Kitae?

180
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,639
I don't know what kind of deal
you made with him,

181
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,266
but think carefully.

182
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,728
You and I both know

183
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,064
who killed Hwang.

184
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,449
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

185
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,742
STATEMENT

186
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:53,995
That day,

187
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,789
who else

188
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,542
was at that temple…

189
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,922
besides Hwang?

190
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,215
I want you to write down

191
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,343
the truth.

192
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,265
Do you want to rot in prison?

193
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,735
Baek Kitae becomes director general,

194
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,072
and you go to prison.

195
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,748
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

196
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,874
Damn it.

197
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,250
What's going on?

198
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,087
The deputy chief prosecutor ordered
the release of Pyo Haksu.

199
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,215
Please come with us, Mr. Pyo.

200
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,563
God, my legs…

201
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,738
Mr. Seo!

202
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,907
Mr. Seo!

203
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,202
How can the prosecution hand over
its investigative authority?

204
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,536
To the suspects, no less!

205
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,789
Who says you can do that?

206
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:21,958
Hey!

207
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,255
Get back inside.

208
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,048
You too. Get back inside.

209
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,552
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
PROSECUTOR SEO GIHO

210
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,803
What about you?

211
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,264
Who says they're suspects?
You have no evidence.

212
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,433
You said you didn't see Baek Kitae there.

213
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,435
I'll arrest him on meth charges first.

214
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,315
I'll get Kang Daeil to talk,
charge Baek with drug offenses,

215
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,944
and then prove the murder!

216
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,946
Now's the time to keep your head down.

217
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,823
They've even stripped our authority.

218
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,493
You've got to hold on to your job
if you want another chance later.

219
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,290
That bastard
killed his own boss just to push meth!

220
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,000
All right?

221
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,545
You know if we don't get him now,
he'll become too big to catch!

222
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,632
The order came from much higher up.

223
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,051
You understand what I'm saying?

224
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,596
Well, who the hell is this higher-up?

225
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,017
Just watch your back for a while.

226
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,023
THE BLUE HOUSE
REPUBLIC OF KOREA

227
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:40,036
Na's really getting under
Cheon's skin today, huh?

228
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,287
Tell me about it.

229
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,581
The President favors
Cheon of the Security Service

230
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,583
over the secretariat these days, so…

231
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,589
Mr. Na.

232
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,635
Why do you keep stirring up
something that's already settled?

233
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,094
Didn't you hear me?

234
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,554
It was the President's orders.

235
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,640
That's what you always say.

236
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,976
It's getting hard to believe.

237
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,355
If you don't believe me,
go ahead and check with him yourself.

238
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,819
Still, I serve him the same way you do,
so how could you do that without a word--

239
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,657
Did you ask me
before getting rid of Bae Geumji?

240
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,786
You've got to be joking.

241
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,748
-Bae Geumji? Me?
-Anyway…

242
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,126
Keep tossing people out for no reason,

243
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,671
and you might be the next one to go.

244
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,673
All right?

245
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,511
You know, I'm just saying this
for your own good.

246
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:40,930
Right, of course.

247
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,601
Since you're so concerned,
I'll bear that in mind.

248
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,978
Oh, right.

249
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,606
I heard you lost one of your subordinates.

250
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,650
You must be devastated.

251
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,819
Perhaps, it's a sign

252
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,447
you should watch your back too, Mr. Cheon.

253
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,249
Yeah,
you should always be careful too.

254
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,794
Take care of yourself.

255
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,091
As you know, I don't ask anyone…

256
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,595
before I get rid of someone.

257
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,476
It looks like there's a leak.

258
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,770
Any idea who?

259
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,984
Jang Geonyoung knew we went to Japan.

260
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,319
And what we went there for.

261
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,948
So what did you tell him?

262
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,409
Well, what else?
I said it was classified.

263
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,037
Did he say anything else?

264
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,498
He was sure you're the one
who killed Hwang.

265
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,923
How did your meeting with Cheon go?

266
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,764
How much…

267
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,267
did you tell Cheon?

268
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,102
What do you mean?

269
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,646
He looked like he knew everything.

270
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,691
I didn't tell him you killed Hwang.

271
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,986
Like we agreed,

272
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,906
I just said he died in a fire.

273
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,575
Which is true. He did die in a fire.

274
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:27,953
Well, doesn't matter.

275
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,498
He didn't really seem to care.

276
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,208
Yeah?

277
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,835
But how did Jang Geonyoung know?

278
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,550
We got a rat or what?

279
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,149
Did you find Baek Kitae?

280
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,485
He's nowhere to be found.

281
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,111
He hasn't been home,

282
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,656
and the KCIA's keeping their mouths shut.

283
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,034
What about the scene?

284
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,994
All we found were some bullet casings.

285
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,746
Everything burned to a crisp.

286
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,081
There's no evidence left.

287
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:19,046
But, sir, is it really
okay for us to keep doing this here…

288
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:23,175
I mean, there's nothing left to dig into,

289
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,678
and if the deputy chief finds out,
he'll rip into us.

290
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,012
What about Kang Daeil?

291
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,431
Any word from him?

292
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,902
When are the materials
from Japan getting here?

293
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,738
We'll never make quota with what's left.

294
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,032
Ms. Baek.

295
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,742
Come on, take a break.

296
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,369
All right.

297
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,629
Hope this tastes okay.

298
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,884
Thank you.

299
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,891
Mmm…

300
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,018
-It's good.
-Wait.

301
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,479
How are you so beautiful?

302
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,232
Oh, please!

303
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,358
Come on, stop.

304
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,499
Any word from your brother?

305
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,084
Who cares?

306
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,588
He made one lousy call
and hasn't shown his face since.

307
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,219
What's that? Didn't you say
no one else was here?

308
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,513
Who'd be here this late?

309
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,018
Sir.

310
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,606
Hi, Kitae.

311
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,108
God, speak of the devil.

312
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,069
Anyway, Kitae.

313
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,071
What are you doing here?

314
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,199
What are you two
doing here alone? It's late.

315
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,117
I had to finish up the books.

316
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,078
Kitae.

317
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,372
Gosh, this isn't what it looks like.

318
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,750
Yeah.

319
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,251
Soyeong, give us the room.

320
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,171
-Why?
-I need to talk to Daeil.

321
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,257
Okay.

322
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,726
You said you were going to Japan,
but I didn't hear from you

323
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,228
so I was worried.

324
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,854
Everything okay while I was gone?

325
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,773
Of course, sir. Everything was fine.

326
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,235
So, you need to talk to me
about something?

327
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,198
Have a seat.

328
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:53,534
Okay.

329
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,294
Daeil.

330
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,799
What do you think is the most basic virtue
a person should have?

331
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,177
I've never really thought about it.

332
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,555
Then think about it now.

333
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,934
Loyalty?

334
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,020
Sure, loyalty's important.

335
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,313
But you know what I think?

336
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:24,898
I think it's shame.

337
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:26,817
Shame?

338
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,987
The people I hate most are
the shameless ones.

339
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,866
Those who have no sense of shame at all.

340
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,661
They're the ones who stab you in the back.

341
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,998
They wag their tails in front of you,

342
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,542
acting like they'd do anything for you.

343
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,504
But when it really counts,
they betray you.

344
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,340
They do it because they have no shame.

345
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,634
But if you don't have shame,

346
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,179
how are you any different from an animal?

347
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,680
Am I right?

348
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,072
Hey.

349
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,366
You got anything to say to me?

350
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,747
You're colluding
with Jang Geonyoung, aren't you?

351
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,500
If you do this, we can't work together.

352
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,543
If you really can't trust me…

353
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,464
just shoot me.

354
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,739
Why do you look like that?

355
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,701
Is Director Hwang dead?

356
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,411
Did Baek Kitae tell you?

357
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,542
I can't do this anymore.

358
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,712
If even Hwang can be
snuffed out just like that…

359
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,299
That's why you need to do this right,

360
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,260
if you don't want Baek Kitae to kill you.

361
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,555
If he finds out you're my mole,

362
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,473
you think he'll let you get away with it?

363
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,602
This only ends when Baek Kitae's caught.

364
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,896
And that's how you stay alive.

365
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,441
This is the last time.

366
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,651
When's the deal?

367
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,656
I need your word.

368
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,450
When is it?

369
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,580
Tonight at 10:00 p.m.,

370
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,959
the Mangeum will rendezvous
in international waters

371
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,462
with a Japanese vessel
loaded with meth ingredients,

372
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,506
according to my source.

373
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,216
One team will hit the Mangeum,

374
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:01,054
and the other will raid the gang's base,
the meth lab, at the same time.

375
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,850
-Team Mangeum.
-Team Mangeum!

376
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,560
-Team Meth Lab!
-Team Meth Lab!

377
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,729
Now, Team Meth Lab.

378
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,480
This is Baek Soyeong.

379
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,817
She's a key figure
who handles the gang's accounts.

380
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:17,029
She must be arrested on site tonight.

381
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,489
-Yes, sir!
-Busan Prosecutors Narcotics Unit!

382
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,450
-We got this!
-We got this!

383
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,701
We got this!

384
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,120
-We got this!
-We got this!

385
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,013
Let's go.

386
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,265
All right, we're moving in.

387
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,642
Let's go.

388
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,245
These bastards.
They're all hiding, huh?

389
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,798
Hey, you! Over there! Don't move!

390
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,217
You bastard!

391
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,094
Get out here!

392
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,596
Hey! Get out here now!

393
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,103
-What the hell?
-Get them!

394
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,314
Mr. Jang! Are you all right?

395
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,692
What are you doing? Get in there! Go!

396
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,694
Go! Move it!

397
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,362
-You damn… Hey!
-Let's go!

398
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,739
Come here!

399
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,744
Hey, you! Come here!

400
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,705
Stand down, asshole!

401
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,206
Get back here!

402
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,095
Get back here, you bastard!

403
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,725
Got you now, you little shit.

404
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,019
You asshole,
why do you keep following me?

405
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,106
Come on, let's go! Come on!

406
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,067
Fine. Let's go, jackass.

407
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,363
Hey, man!

408
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,489
That was a blank.

409
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,907
Now it's live rounds.

410
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,162
-Kim!
-Yes, sir!

411
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,832
Round them up and find the drugs!

412
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,459
-You heard him!
-Yes, sir!

413
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,045
Search for the drugs!
Start searching for the drugs!

414
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,265
Hey, eat shit!

415
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,349
There!

416
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,524
Back off! Go!

417
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,777
Hey! Back off!

418
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,199
Back off!

419
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:08,742
Fuck.

420
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,537
Damn it, why do you keep following me?

421
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,959
Stop! Stop it!

422
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,847
KOOC, MENT, FUNKY STRIKE

423
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,224
-What?
-Sir.

424
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,683
What is this?
It's not here?

425
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,102
-No, it's not…
-It's not?

426
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,770
Check deeper inside.

427
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,898
Damn it.

428
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,858
-What about here? No?
-No.

429
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,777
Mr. Jang!

430
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,323
There's only stuff like this.

431
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,079
Is Baek Soyeong not here?

432
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,413
She's not here.

433
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,209
-Come on, open them.
-Damn it.

434
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,378
Check this one. This one.

435
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,923
Damn it. These are all just watches.

436
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,349
Where's Kang Daeil?

437
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,768
Hey! You shithead.

438
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,771
Where's Baek Soyeong?

439
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,107
Who's that?

440
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,151
I have no idea.

441
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,156
I said, where's Baek Soyeong?

442
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,240
I don't know.

443
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,076
I really don't know!

444
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,705
Damn it!

445
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,339
You don't have to give me this.

446
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,841
I'll never…

447
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,343
I won't ever cross you again, sir.

448
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,598
If you really can't trust me…

449
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,684
just shoot me.

450
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,617
I'm sorry, sir.

451
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,800
Lay low for a while.

452
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,719
Yes, sir.

453
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,189
Kang Daeil.

454
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,775
Kang Daeil.

455
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,403
Finding Kang Daeil comes first!

456
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,989
Stake out his family's homes

457
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,493
and coordinate with local precincts
to post officers at every terminal.

458
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,577
Now!

459
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,162
-Yes, sir!
-Will do!

460
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,710
We're from the Inspection Division.

461
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,671
Everyone, hands off your desks.

462
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,880
Who the hell are you?

463
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,591
We got a tip

464
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:15,178
that the investigators here
resold the drugs they seized.

465
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,972
What the hell are you talking about?

466
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,058
Look, who said that? What tip?

467
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,768
Senior Investigator Kim Jeongwon.

468
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,688
Investigator Oh Yejin, right?

469
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,482
Please come with us, the two of you.

470
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,859
Don't move an inch.

471
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,361
I'll be back in a minute.

472
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,072
Move!

473
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,616
Get everything.

474
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,035
Geez, why are you doing this?

475
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,788
PROSECUTOR SEO GIHO

476
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:45,417
You're shutting down the Narcotics Unit
because those dealers are giving you shit?

477
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,460
It's the chief's orders!

478
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:53,300
So we're going to let Baek Kitae
toy with the prosecution like this?

479
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,844
It's just until the inspection is over!

480
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,012
End of discussion!

481
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,348
Just don't come into the office,
and keep your head down for a while!

482
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,435
I'll pull your people
out of the Inspection Division somehow!

483
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,228
All right, fine!

484
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,689
I'll go pay the chief a visit

485
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,566
and talk to him myself!

486
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,859
Hey!

487
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,943
Oh!

488
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:16,948
Hey, get back inside.

489
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,992
Get back inside!

490
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,246
Hey.

491
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,290
You think I haven't tried?

492
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:29,127
The man didn't even flinch when I stood up
to him and threatened to quit!

493
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,920
What the hell do you think you can do?

494
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:35,550
Unless you want your people
to suffer more, keep your head down.

495
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,386
Those bastards are coming at us hard!

496
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,225
-But I--
-Jang.

497
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,187
Stop trying to bulldoze through.

498
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,438
Think, for God's sake.

499
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,691
Baek's got Chief Cheon backing him.

500
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:52,984
Who have you got?

501
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,571
If you're going to go after them,
you've got to match their weight at least!

502
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,531
You complete idiot.

503
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:08,958
"The Prosecution,
walking the straight path,

504
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,543
upholding principle!"

505
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,767
Hey, get back inside.

506
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,480
You too. Get back inside.

507
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,575
Hope you don't mind me
calling you in while I do this.

508
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,620
I've got to take good care
of the President,

509
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,456
but I never get time to hit the field.

510
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,291
Not at all, sir.

511
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,502
Don't worry about it.

512
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:59,092
I hear Chief Cheon's been meddling
with prosecutorial authority?

513
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,176
Yes, sir.

514
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,554
It seems he ordered the KCIA

515
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,889
to investigate
Director Hwang's case directly.

516
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,988
Go on.

517
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,364
The truth is,

518
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,450
one of our prosecutors
in the Narcotics Unit

519
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,660
was investigating Baek Kitae,

520
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,080
the KCIA department head who's in charge
of Hwang's case right now,

521
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,749
for running a meth operation.

522
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,627
I know it's presumptuous of me
to say this to you,

523
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,590
but the fact that the Chief
of the Presidential Security Service

524
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,050
-would back someone like Baek--
-Chief Cheon is

525
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,429
covering for a meth peddler?

526
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:59,444
OSAKA, JAPAN

527
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,911
Looks like I'm the last one.

528
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,622
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Father.

529
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,749
So,

530
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,585
how many factories do we have left?

531
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,508
We've still got a couple left,
but the police are watching them closely.

532
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,636
There's no telling how long they'll last.

533
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,597
Everyone says the meth trade's
finished in Japan.

534
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,059
Even the Shibazaki clan seems
to be pulling out of the business.

535
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,143
Finished? Hardly.

536
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,731
Addicts are still crawling
all over Japan looking for drugs.

537
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,944
We just need to build
a new plant in Korea,

538
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,738
and the problem's solved, Father.

539
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:48,243
In Korea, we can easily bring in
raw materials from Hong Kong or Taiwan,

540
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,119
and enforcement is weak.

541
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:55,375
It's the ideal place to produce meth.

542
00:38:55,959 --> 00:39:02,423
Look, just when is this new plant
supposed to be built?

543
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:08,221
Chasing pipe dreams like a fool
only puts the clan at risk.

544
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,183
The meth market grows every year,

545
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:15,061
and it's still
our biggest source of funds.

546
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,690
Giving that up too easily

547
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,694
is what would put the clan at risk.

548
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,447
The real foolishness, don't you think?

549
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,576
You're forgetting your place,
you Chosenjin!

550
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,744
How dare you!

551
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,257
I hope

552
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,636
you're not making a foolish choice.

553
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,016
Because giving a fool a chance is

554
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,226
just as foolish.

555
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:21,878
SEOUL, KOREA

556
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,718
Seems like you've taken
quite a liking to Baek Kitae.

557
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,137
You forgave him
for taking out Director Hwang.

558
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,057
He's the one who killed Hwang?

559
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,850
You didn't know?

560
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,727
I heard he died in a fire.

561
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,562
Am I mistaken?

562
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,731
Well, there was a fire, but…

563
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,734
You just don't care, do you?

564
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,405
The thing about greedy people is,
they're quick to get stupid.

565
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,201
Doesn't matter to me
who sits in that seat.

566
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:57,038
Apparently, you're the one
who's taken a liking to him.

567
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,583
Is it because he's good-looking?

568
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,211
What if something happens to Baek?

569
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,545
Do you have an alternative?

570
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,630
Why?

571
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,549
Do you not trust him?

572
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,510
I don't trust people.

573
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:12,971
I trust what I hold.

574
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,520
And that's why you're
the one who scares me most.

575
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,648
Baek cares a lot
about his younger siblings.

576
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,150
Especially his brother, Baek Kihyun.

577
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,737
He's a Korea Military Academy graduate,
just like you.

578
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,698
-A Military Academy graduate?
-Yes.

579
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,867
His brother is his weak spot.

580
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:37,787
That's what concerns me.

581
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,541
Move to the sides!

582
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,341
-Hey, walk straight.
-Private First Class Hong Jihwan!

583
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,801
I'm pushing you from behind.

584
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,302
Thank you. Thank you, sir!

585
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:54,637
-Really?
-I've got this, sir.

586
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,723
The hell you do, damn commie.

587
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,938
Hey!

588
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,149
What are you doing?

589
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:19,245
Hong must've twisted his ankle, sir.

590
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,914
That's why he tumbled down the hill.

591
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,458
Please don't worry about him.

592
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,086
Get up.

593
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,090
Take off your pack.

594
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:32,216
I've got this, sir.

595
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,301
Take off your pack.

596
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,178
This is an order.

597
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,739
We've got a goddamn commie
and a chickenshit.

598
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,284
-That goddamn idiot.
-What a great fucking unit.

599
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,637
Private Hong, it's not your watch yet.

600
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,473
What are you doing here so early, sir?

601
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,641
Huh?

602
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,102
I was cold.

603
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,479
Everyone's asleep, right?

604
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,564
Yes, sir. They are.

605
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,191
Good work.

606
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,316
MILITARY POLICE

607
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,414
One, two.

608
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,748
One, two.

609
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,800
Look at this little shit.
Did you just dodge?

610
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,220
Goddamn it.

611
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,264
How the hell did you let this happen?

612
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,348
I'm sorry, sir!

613
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:47,185
Both our jobs are on the line
if we don't contain this.

614
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,728
-You hear me?
-Yes, sir!

615
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,564
Keep checking on the injured
until sunrise,

616
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,942
and if anyone else dies,
report it immediately!

617
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,780
Yes, sir!

618
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,244
Damn it.

619
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:07,872
You little…

620
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,875
You fucking bastard.

621
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,336
Are you trying to screw me over?

622
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,839
I warned you, didn't I?

623
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:21,344
I told you to get that damn kid
transferred or whatever

624
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,887
to keep him out of trouble.

625
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:25,806
Hey, look at this mess.

626
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:30,686
You brought this on yourself.

627
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:32,313
Get it?

628
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,361
PERSONAL RECORD

629
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,904
- BAEK KIHYUN
- MALE

630
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,264
Baek Kihyun,

631
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:50,308
it's been a long time.

632
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,102
We haven't seen each other
since graduation?

633
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,896
Don't cut corners
just because you know me.

634
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,064
Do what you always do.

635
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,524
INVESTIGATION OFFICER
NAM SANGUK

636
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,900
Still cocky as ever, huh?

637
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,528
Because you graduated top of our class?

638
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,197
So you think everyone's beneath you?

639
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,075
You're Security Command now,
but you haven't changed.

640
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,369
Cut the smart-ass act and proceed.

641
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,913
There must be a reason they sent you.

642
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:13,998
Well…

643
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,501
I heard you testified
your company commander

644
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,129
shot down the transfer request
for Private Hong.

645
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,464
Is that true?

646
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,923
I don't make things up.

647
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,342
I said exactly what happened.

648
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,472
You know,

649
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,058
you really haven't changed
a bit, have you?

650
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,978
Still condescending as fuck
when you don't know shit.

651
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,608
Your company commander?

652
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,861
Apparently, his uncle's
the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs,

653
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,697
and his father runs
Myeongjung Construction.

654
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,824
The best way to clean up this mess

655
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:51,827
is for someone
to take responsibility and step down.

656
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,789
But it's never going to be your commander.

657
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,083
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

658
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:58,167
Get it?

659
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,421
You know what hits me hard
every single day at Security Command?

660
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,633
No matter how great you are,

661
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,470
you can't do jack on your own.

662
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:14,058
So stop acting like you're the only one
with integrity and rewrite your statement.

663
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,643
It's not too late.

664
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,646
If you cooperate now,
I can keep you in uniform.

665
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,609
Hey.

666
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,444
What are academy buddies for?

667
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,405
We should cover each other's asses, right?

668
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:31,617
So from now on,
you just need to do what I tell you.

669
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,202
All right?

670
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,957
You mean you want me to take the hit
instead of ruining my commander's career?

671
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:41,669
Hey.

672
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:47,550
I testified the way I did
because I knew you were going to do this.

673
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,218
What?

674
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,971
I don't want to ruin my own career either.

675
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,103
Tell him, if he wants to use
his uncle for an easy out,

676
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,440
he'd better rethink making me
the scapegoat and handle it properly.

677
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,942
I'm not going down alone.

678
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,543
Sir!

679
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,629
Someone's here to see you, sir.

680
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,047
He's in the visiting area.

681
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,013
How can I believe you?

682
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,517
It's hard to believe,
isn't it?

683
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,354
But you know as well as I do,
Mr. Baek Kihyun.

684
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,483
The fact that Mr. Baek Kitae has

685
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,027
that much power at his age.

686
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,322
Well, that doesn't just happen on its own.

687
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,493
Your sister.

688
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,706
Ms. Baek Soyeong is helping him
with the business.

689
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,167
If I arrest Baek Kitae,

690
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,086
your sister goes to prison,

691
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,216
and you, Mr. Baek Kihyun,
might be forced out of the army too.

692
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:17,473
Before that happens, you should talk
to her and get her to confess.

693
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:24,730
If you could have taken my brother down
so easily, you wouldn't be here right now.

694
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,525
The fact that you even had to come to me

695
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,777
means you're in a tight spot, right?

696
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,573
So bad that you, a prosecutor,
are threatening me.

697
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,873
You're a lot like your brother.

698
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,919
But there's one thing you don't know.

699
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,130
I'm never going to give up.

700
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:54,051
I'll make sure Baek Kitae faces the law
and pays for what he's done.

701
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,478
Mr. Baek Kihyun!

702
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,398
Think carefully!

703
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,237
What's your plan?

704
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,032
How long will you let
Jang Geonyoung run loose?

705
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,036
I heard from the prosecution's
Inspection Division.

706
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,914
They say they can't hold
his team much longer.

707
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,000
Okay?

708
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,837
If we go at him half-baked,
it'll be worse than doing nothing.

709
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,673
So what are you thinking?

710
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:37,720
I'll handle it.

711
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,013
Hey, you…

712
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,393
Just tell me, okay?

713
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,563
Handle it how exactly?

714
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:53,736
Come in.

715
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,490
I'm sorry to interrupt, sir.

716
00:51:58,991 --> 00:51:59,992
It's urgent.

717
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,245
What the hell are you looking at?

718
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,748
You telling me to leave?

719
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,168
Spit it out.

720
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,045
What is it? Just tell me.

721
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,257
I'm afraid there's a problem
with your brother.

722
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,427
Security Command's launched
an investigation,

723
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,762
and it's not looking good.

724
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,681
What?

725
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,601
Who's here? The KCIA? Baek's brother…

726
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,687
What are you talking about, idiot?

727
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,701
Well, who are you?

728
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,202
Stand up straight.

729
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,163
Back to your senses?

730
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,748
Yes.

731
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,417
Go get Baek Kihyun.

732
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:33,502
Yes, sir.

733
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,108
How did you hear about it?

734
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,278
Did you think I wouldn't find out
if you kept quiet?

735
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,071
I can handle this on my own.

736
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,116
Handle it how exactly?

737
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,076
I said, I'll handle it on my own!

738
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,013
I told you.

739
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,393
If you're angry at reality, get stronger.

740
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:41,528
If you don't want to be
looked down on, strike first.

741
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,698
If someone blocks your path,
get rid of them.

742
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,034
How many times have I told you

743
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,870
that guys with power
run the world at the end of the day?

744
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:55,292
If you're done, I'll be going now.

745
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:56,960
Stop.

746
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,756
You cocky little…

747
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:07,262
Your company commander will be
the one forced out, not you.

748
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:12,392
Security Command will have an opening
next month, so get ready.

749
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,187
This is power.

750
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:16,939
Got it?

751
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,652
I'm going to Vietnam next week.

752
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,072
What the hell would you go there for?

753
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,157
That "power" you always talk about.

754
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,910
I figured I'd try to earn some myself.

755
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,329
All you need to do is what I tell you!

756
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,039
I can take care of myself!

757
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,123
You little…

758
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,217
So I want you

759
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,638
to please just get your own act together.

760
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,473
PROSECUTOR JANG GEONYOUNG

761
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,684
Before you wreck my life
and Soyeong's too.

762
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:10,242
Ms. Oh.

763
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,578
What are you doing out here?

764
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:14,746
Mr. Jang, where have you been?

765
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,416
I went to see Baek Kihyun.

766
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,042
Baek Kihyun?

767
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,253
Things must've been rough.

768
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:23,589
No, it's okay.

769
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:25,966
Appreciate the effort.
Let's get inside.

770
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:29,469
Well,

771
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,473
why did you go to see Baek Kihyun, sir?

772
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,312
Thought I'd stir up Baek Kitae too.

773
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,316
We've got to hit back
just as hard as he hit us.

774
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,943
So you're not giving up?

775
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,280
Why would I give up?

776
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,699
It's my job to catch criminals.

777
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:54,077
You haven't eaten yet, right?
Let's eat first and get our strength back.

778
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,788
Where's Mr. Kim?

779
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:57,873
I'm not sure.

780
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,791
He said he'd be here soon.

781
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,252
But I think we ran out of rice.

782
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,920
Should I cook some ramyeon?

783
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,966
Shoot. We're out of ramyeon, too.

784
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,344
I'll run out and get some.

785
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,347
Oh, no. I'll go, sir.

786
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,514
I'll be right back.

787
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,527
Take care.

788
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:30,072
Oh, man.

789
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,032
It started raining.

790
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,918
I won't live as cattle.

791
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,586
I'll be the one with power.

792
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,299
I'll make the herd kneel before me,

793
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,803
drag down anyone more powerful than me,

794
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:56,223
and change the world in the end.

795
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,443
-Ms. Oh, you're here alone?
-Yes.

796
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:11,071
-Where's Mr. Jang?
-He went to get some ramyeon.

797
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,406
Hey, the water's boiling.

798
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,661
Man, I'm exhausted.

799
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,300
That's just the way it is.

800
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,344
The world has always been

801
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,722
a battlefield for the powerful.
