1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,887
It is time for the flag-lowering ceremony.

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,390
Please face the flag with respect.

3
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,100
I bet you're wondering,

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,229
"What is this, some kind of prank?"

5
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,856
This is what they called
the flag-lowering ceremony.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,150
Our dear Mr. President's own invention.

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,444
And that wasn't all.

8
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,365
After midnight, you couldn't even
be out on the streets.

9
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,201
It was to crack down on decadent trends

10
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,787
that threatened public morals
and order or whatever.

11
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,830
SEX INDUSTRY

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,125
Men were banned
from growing sideburns over their ears,

13
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:47,256
and women in miniskirts were punished
for indecent exposure.

14
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,467
Curfews.

15
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,718
No assemblies.

16
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,011
No protests.

17
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,973
No long hair and no miniskirts, either.

18
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,349
TO RESTORE SOCIAL DISCIPLINE

19
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,684
IMMEDIATE DEPORTATION

20
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,688
People were monitored, raided,
beaten, and killed.

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,233
KIM DAEJUNG RETURNED HOME

22
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,152
If they could go
after heavyweight opposition politicians,

23
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,572
imagine what they did to ordinary people.

24
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,700
We were basically treated
like cattle, like pigs.

25
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,829
But the very ones leading the crackdowns?

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,497
They lived above every ban.

27
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,624
That's right.

28
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:26,044
I'm talking about the country's
very first intelligence agency, the KCIA.

29
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,129
GLOBAL SPY RING EXPOSED

30
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,883
With immense power that
even eclipsed the Constitution,

31
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,345
the KCIA propped up
our dear Mr. President's long reign.

32
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:40,809
Just the name of it was enough
to strike fear.

33
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,644
REVOLUTIONARY UNIFICATION
PARTY SPY CASE

34
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,357
So many innocent people were dragged off,
and lost their lives.

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,027
Honestly though,

36
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,572
I never thought I'd be one of them.

37
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,453
This was the age of prohibition,
and my name says it all.

38
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,706
I'm Geumji, as in prohibition. Bae Geumji.

39
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,795
Madam, bar girl, escort, hostess.

40
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,214
Call me whatever you want.

41
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,718
What matters is that I was

42
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,804
damn good at what I did.

43
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,099
But still,

44
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,810
it's not a crime worth dying for, right?

45
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,958
GIMPO AIRPORT, KOREA

46
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,714
Passengers for boarding,
please proceed to Gate Three

47
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,634
of the International Terminal
after completing immigration.

48
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,183
Seriously?

49
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,810
No one's here?

50
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,645
Wow.

51
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,982
This is unbelievable.

52
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,567
Let's go.

53
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,409
THE AGE OF PROHIBITION

54
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,800
All right, all right.

55
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,907
When we get there,
it won't just be Mr. Cheon waiting.

56
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,243
Bae Geumji will be there too.

57
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,369
Yes, sir. Understood.

58
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,540
They were nice enough
to send her off to the States.

59
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,793
She should've stayed put
and raised her kid quietly.

60
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,587
What good did she think
would come of this?

61
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,434
I hear she's a woman with no fear.

62
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,520
Yeah, I'll give her that.

63
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,314
Using her own damn kid like that.

64
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,482
Do you know, sir?

65
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,985
Who the father is.

66
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,570
There are a lot of rumors.

67
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,740
Hey.

68
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,825
Yes, sir.

69
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,121
Just keep your eyes on the road.

70
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,707
Unless you've got a death wish.

71
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,713
Have you met Mr. Cheon before?

72
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,299
No, this is my first time in person.

73
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,472
Born into the elite and

74
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,684
top of his class at the Military Academy.

75
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,145
He caught the President's eye
during the revolution,

76
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,233
and now, he throws around
more weight than ever.

77
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,489
No.

78
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,035
Cheon Seokjung…

79
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,870
…Chief of the Presidential
Security Service.

80
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,873
Top of his class at the Military Academy,
adored by the President.

81
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,877
The President's power was
practically Cheon Seokjung's to wield,

82
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,840
and the KCIA was his loyal private army.

83
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,883
I mean, look.

84
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,844
I can't live in hiding forever anyway.

85
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,346
It's not like I'm not a criminal.

86
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,932
I've got to sort things out somehow,

87
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,894
and raise my boy Seongguk
to not come up short next to anyone.

88
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,231
You really think
his father's going to sit back and watch?

89
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,900
What kind of father can't stand to see

90
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,902
his own son succeed?

91
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,990
You know better than anyone
he's not a man to be trifled with.

92
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,035
And I'm not a woman
to be trifled with either.

93
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,619
Come on.

94
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,789
It's not like I'm asking to be his wife.

95
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,169
Hello, Mr. Cheon.

96
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,464
How have you been, sir?

97
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,049
It's been a while, Mr. Hwang.

98
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,676
Why have you been so busy?

99
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,970
Oh, no. Not at all.

100
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:19,059
Just give me a call,
and I'll come running anytime, sir.

101
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,355
Ah… You wear a toupee, huh?

102
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,661
-Let's take a walk.
-Yes, sir.

103
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,257
That's when Baek Kitae
saw with his own eyes…

104
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,844
…what real, living power looked like.

105
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,890
Ah, I got it.

106
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,020
And then he decided

107
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,231
to live a life like that man's,

108
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,484
with wealth and power great enough

109
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,112
to bring the whole world to its knees.

110
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,947
Hello, darling.

111
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,954
I'm going to the restroom.

112
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,164
Care to join me?

113
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,253
And that's how we met.

114
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,798
In the most romantic setting,
as you can see,

115
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,968
in the company of those
government idiots.

116
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,542
There's no need
to worry about wiretaps here, sir.

117
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,002
It's so loud in here.

118
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,963
Loud and perfect
for a secret investigation HQ.

119
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,966
All right, let's eat.

120
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,050
Yes, sir.

121
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,101
Let me say this again, just in case.

122
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,604
No one else can know
about this place but us.

123
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,439
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

124
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,066
How's the search for Kang Daeil going?

125
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,151
Any progress?

126
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,862
Yes,
we're tracing him through his crew.

127
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,655
We should be able to pin him down soon.

128
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,032
We have to find him.

129
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,408
Yes, sir. Understood.

130
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,288
Apparently, Jo Manjae had his hands
in every racket and made a fortune.

131
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,915
Smuggling, for starters,

132
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,709
siphoning US army supplies,
real estate speculation…

133
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,212
Even the toilet paper
in government offices

134
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,005
has to pass through his hands.

135
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,298
He ate all that up by himself?

136
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,926
Mm-mmm… He couldn't have.

137
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,803
I mean, look. We can't even
have a meal without sharing.

138
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,556
You think he can hog the whole thing? How?

139
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,724
He's got backing.

140
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,893
Mr. Jang.

141
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,645
You think that's the KCIA, right?

142
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,981
The KCIA doing business with gangsters?
That's nothing new.

143
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,107
I'm not even surprised.

144
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,568
But why do you think they took Jo Manjae?

145
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,279
I bet he pulled something shady.

146
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,156
That must be why they hauled him in.

147
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,867
They chopped off the tail.
Cut him off like this.

148
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,786
What? You think they killed him?

149
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,039
Jo Manjae paid up
massive sums to the KCIA.

150
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,417
And that money went straight
into Director Hwang's safe.

151
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,089
Some of it probably went
further up the chain too.

152
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,050
You mean there's someone above Hwang?

153
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,928
-That's right.
-And who could it be?

154
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,514
Well, I don't know that yet.

155
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,891
But the election's right
around the corner,

156
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,518
and plenty of places need funding.

157
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,105
I'm sure they'll restart his operations
by rounding up the rest of his gang.

158
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,484
To do that, they must've kept
either Jo Manjae or Kang Daeil alive.

159
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,611
And you think it's Kang Daeil, right?

160
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,699
We've got a shot
only if Kang Daeil's alive.

161
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,301
My legs…

162
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,825
I haven't seen you around before.

163
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,453
I work under Director Hwang.

164
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,418
But there's no future

165
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,754
working under Hwang.

166
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,674
Maybe under Cheon,
that would be different.

167
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,600
If you're interested,

168
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,686
I can help you.

169
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,314
What do you mean?

170
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,109
Let's meet somewhere quiet later.

171
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,736
Just the two of us.

172
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,620
-Huh?
-I had him under me for a bit

173
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,996
in the army.

174
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,081
He's pretty useful.

175
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,792
His eyes are practically dripping
with ambition.

176
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,961
Maybe it's from growing up with nothing.

177
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,631
-But he knows his place.
-I'm getting tipsy. Give me one.

178
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,342
They make quite the pair.

179
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:45,927
Not a bad pick.

180
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,012
Thank you, sir.

181
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,226
Geumji. Bae Geumji…

182
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,354
I can't get a read
on how that woman's going to play this.

183
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,773
You want me to kill her?

184
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,570
I'm sorry, sir.

185
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,823
Don't do anything stupid.

186
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,868
Just have him stick close to her for now.

187
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,663
Keep an eye on her
so she can't pull anything.

188
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,499
Yes, sir.

189
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,277
That woman's got a notebook.

190
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,865
A list of all the men she's slept with.

191
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,868
Which means the kid's father
has to be in there.

192
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,455
Now, what's the real issue?
Who the father is?

193
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,041
That's not the real issue.

194
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,504
Damn it.

195
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,681
What matters isn't who the father is.

196
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,433
It's that

197
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,061
all those men whose names are
in that notebook are losing sleep,

198
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,272
wondering if the boy is theirs.

199
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,773
That's the real problem.

200
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,943
Can we trust that information?

201
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,361
Of course.

202
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,781
The guy who gave it to me?
His name's in that notebook too.

203
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,701
You'd better keep your head straight.

204
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,953
She's the kind men fall for
at first sight.

205
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,747
You don't have to worry about me, sir.

206
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,957
Ashtray.

207
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,255
Be careful, all right?

208
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,426
You wouldn't want your name
ending up in that notebook too.

209
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,645
I swear,

210
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,357
I don't get why everyone's dying
to sink their teeth into me.

211
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,736
Did Director Hwang ask you
to get the notebook?

212
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,739
What notebook?

213
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,910
You must be curious,

214
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,455
being the only one left in the dark.

215
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,333
I'm not interested.

216
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,585
Really?

217
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,172
Because I could tell you right now

218
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,799
who the father really is.

219
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,517
But you're not interested, right?

220
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,311
Are you messing with me?

221
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,771
Oh, no.

222
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,523
You thought I was
actually going to tell you?

223
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,402
You're adorable.

224
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,283
Anyway, I'm never going back
to the States,

225
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,076
so tell them to quit dreaming.

226
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,327
I'm staying right here.

227
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,163
Maybe even date a handsome guy like you.

228
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,208
Aren't you sick of men by now?

229
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,588
Depends on who the man is.

230
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,219
Since we're here,
why don't we be straight with each other?

231
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,266
If you don't feel like talking
about dating, we can talk business.

232
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:22,727
Business?

233
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,314
I told you the other day, didn't I?

234
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,025
I could help you.

235
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,486
Help me with what?
And how exactly?

236
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,200
Hmm.

237
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,871
Look who's finally showing some interest.

238
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,049
Being the President's right-hand man
or whatever…

239
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,759
Who cares about that crap?

240
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,346
What matters is

241
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,097
how you got there.

242
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,142
You know well

243
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,479
how Hwang managed to get as far as he did,

244
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,897
don't you?

245
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,529
Now, just think how much more
Cheon must've passed up above him.

246
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,115
An endless stream of cash.

247
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:21,160
That's the real source of their power.

248
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,292
So…

249
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,420
If you had your hands on that stream,

250
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,714
who's to say

251
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,134
you couldn't get to Cheon's level,
not just Hwang's?

252
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:38,928
Am I right?

253
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,721
Mr. Baek.

254
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,182
Tell me what you want.

255
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:45,810
I'll help you.

256
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,439
I heard you've got ties
to the Japanese yakuza.

257
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:52,983
Chairman Ikeda.

258
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,903
Have you ever met him?

259
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,905
Boss!

260
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,537
No.

261
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,374
But I did catch a glimpse
of his daughter once.

262
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,000
Ikeda Yuji.

263
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,129
Real name, Choi Yuji.

264
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,588
Yes, Choi Yuji.

265
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,842
How did you know she's Korean?

266
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,677
I've met her myself once.

267
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,432
If only she weren't of Korean descent,

268
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,892
she might have even had a shot
at being his successor.

269
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,688
She's a Zainichi, but he still
took her in as his foster daughter.

270
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,150
I don't know how she won his favor,

271
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,193
but he clearly treasures her.

272
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,703
Anyway, I'm certain she's one
of the real powers in the Ikeda clan.

273
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,998
How on earth do you know all this?

274
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,878
So, what about Choi Yuji?

275
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,466
I think… …I need to see her again.

276
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,634
Hmm…

277
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:01,719
Okay.

278
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,600
Call me, Mr. Baek.

279
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:26,577
Guys, this is Lee Sunyeong.

280
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,621
She's a new member of Rose Club.

281
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,789
Say hello.

282
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,041
Hi, nice to meet you all.

283
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,419
I'm Lee Sunyeong.

284
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,589
I'm not very good with my hands though.

285
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,051
Anyway, I'm excited to be here.

286
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,012
Come on,
no one's good from the start.

287
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,514
-Welcome to the club.
-Thanks.

288
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,098
Here, try knitting this first.

289
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:50,935
Hi, Soyeong.

290
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,561
You got off work a bit late today.

291
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:53,729
Yeah.

292
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,273
Oh, I see you guys have already started.

293
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,734
Soyeong, did you get
what I asked for last time?

294
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,736
Yeah,
I brought the information sheet.

295
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:06,367
It's a three-year term
with an annual interest rate of 17.4%…

296
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,994
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much, Soyeong.

297
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,124
Are you from Seoul?

298
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,919
Sorry?

299
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,339
You don't seem to have a Busan accent.

300
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:25,094
That's because
Soyeong grew up in Japan.

301
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,346
Soyeong, say hello.

302
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,058
This is Lee Sunyeong.
She's a new member of the club.

303
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,726
Of course.

304
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,188
No wonder you've got
such great skin.

305
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:39,275
My goodness. How's your skin so smooth?

306
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,528
Oh, you're too kind.

307
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,489
Well, I was just born with it.

308
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,449
You're so lucky.

309
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,745
My uncle lives in Japan too. In Osaka.

310
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,123
No way! I lived in Osaka too!

311
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,833
Oh, my goodness.

312
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,961
What are the chances?

313
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,674
-Wow, you work at a bank?
-Oh, yeah.

314
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,052
What do you do
for a living, Sunyeong?

315
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,637
Well…

316
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,432
My parents run…
What do you call that again?

317
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,850
They run a metal shop…

318
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,769
…so I help out with my older brothers.

319
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,730
What about you, Soyeong?

320
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,106
Do you have an older brother?

321
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,816
Yeah.

322
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,445
Well, I've never told you guys,

323
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,489
but my brother could give Shin Seongil
a run for his money.

324
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,074
My brother looks like Alain Delon!

325
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,327
Really? We have so much in common!

326
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,412
Wow,
are they really that handsome?

327
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,540
-You should bring him here sometime.
-Oh, I can't do that. He's busy.

328
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,709
-Bring him.
-I've got to see with my own eyes.

329
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,086
-He must be really handsome.
-You bet.

330
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,340
The Vietnam War, huh?

331
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,633
PERSONAL RECORD
BAEK KITAE

332
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:46,842
Yes.

333
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,387
He was in the Special Warfare Command
but got dishonorably discharged there.

334
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,932
It seems like there was
some kind of incident.

335
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,561
Sir, I heard rumors
you got the Order of Military Merit,

336
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,021
but that's not true, right?

337
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,446
Well…

338
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:14,495
I mean, it was from the government,

339
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,081
so I couldn't exactly refuse.

340
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,124
Seriously?

341
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,169
There were three armed guerrillas.

342
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,089
Armed guerrillas?

343
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,007
You going to tell me you've been shot too?

344
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,092
-Here.
-Huh?

345
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,094
-Here.
-Wait.

346
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,763
Are you actually telling me
this is from a gunshot?

347
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,640
-It went in here and…
-Yeah?

348
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,726
-I'm not sure if you can see it. Here.
-Whoa, what?

349
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,894
Wait a second.

350
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,355
So it went in here and came out here?

351
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,316
Wow, so it's true!

352
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,068
You're incredible, Mr. Jang.

353
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,196
Well, they wouldn't have
given me the medal if I weren't.

354
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,284
Oh, my.

355
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,620
My goodness.

356
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,288
Oh, my…

357
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:02,251
Mr. Jang, you must work out all the time.

358
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,795
Yeah, well, I just do some push-ups.

359
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,213
Of course.

360
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,257
No wonder you look so good in your suits.

361
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,217
How many do you do?

362
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,761
A hundred? Yeah, about a hundred.

363
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,097
So, how did it go?

364
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,640
Did you meet her?

365
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,021
I'm so tired.

366
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,107
It's true they grew up in Osaka, Japan.

367
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,859
-They're Zainichi?
-Yes.

368
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,278
They came back to Korea
after their parents passed.

369
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,739
Apparently, they had a tough time
settling down here.

370
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,324
Then Baek Kitae must've had
to play the parent.

371
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,035
He did
every kind of job imaginable

372
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,828
to support his younger siblings.

373
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,539
And being Zainichi,
he went through a lot of discrimination.

374
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,249
So he became a career soldier?

375
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,710
There's actually another soldier
in the family.

376
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,379
Their younger brother, Baek Kihyun.

377
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,799
He graduated top of his class
from the Military Academy.

378
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,302
Now, he's serving up front
as a second lieutenant.

379
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:57,014
The older brother's in the KCIA,
and the younger one's from the Academy?

380
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,558
Well, talk about rising from nothing.

381
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:04,021
But it sounded like something happened
to the younger brother when he was a kid.

382
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,522
What happened?

383
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:09,860
Well, Baek Soyeong didn't go into detail,
but she seemed really worried about him.

384
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,279
Okay.

385
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,907
So, are you meeting her again?

386
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,868
Yes, we hit it off and decided
to grab a meal together sometime.

387
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,871
Also, Kang Daeil?

388
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:22,790
He's alive.

389
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,377
You've tracked him down?

390
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:31,256
Not exactly. But word is,
he's putting the gang back together.

391
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,591
He's even looking for a chemist.

392
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,594
See? I told you,
Kang Daeil, that bastard, is alive.

393
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,180
Your instincts are spot-on, sir.

394
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,765
I'm telling you,

395
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,893
Kang Daeil is tied up with the KCIA.

396
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,191
The KCIA can take down
anyone in their sights.

397
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,361
Mr. Jang, if you push too far
and things go sideways--

398
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,154
I'll take the fall.

399
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,198
If anyone loses their job,
it's going to be me.

400
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:12,089
OSAKA, JAPAN

401
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,217
You have guests from Korea.

402
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,880
Long time no see, Ms. Bae.

403
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,382
It's good to see you, Ms. Ikeda.

404
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,510
It's been a while, Mr. Matsuda.

405
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,556
Or should I call you
Mr. Baek Kitae now?

406
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,725
I'm Baek Kitae.

407
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:06,935
It's good to see you.

408
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,821
You've got
a lovely little place here.

409
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,701
How's the chairman doing?

410
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,495
I heard he hasn't been well.

411
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,457
Is your son doing well?

412
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,713
He's… just like his father.

413
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,633
That's good.

414
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,093
When are you going back to America?

415
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,803
I'm not going back.

416
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,639
I've got some things to do in Korea.

417
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,101
And I've met someone I like.

418
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,104
You haven't eaten, right?

419
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,272
Gosh, I'm starving.

420
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,900
I heard there's
a famous sushi place nearby.

421
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,778
I actually made a reservation there
when I heard you were coming.

422
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,407
Darling, you like sushi, right?
This is great.

423
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,660
Mr. Baek, you should have
a drink with me instead.

424
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,536
I have something to discuss in private.

425
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,289
My staff will escort you, Ms. Bae.

426
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,084
You've done your part.

427
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,544
Now, it's Mr. Baek's turn
to finish things.

428
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:19,257
I'm sure he didn't come all this way
just to have some sushi with me.

429
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,635
Am I right, Mr. Baek?

430
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,432
Does Ms. Bae know why we're meeting?

431
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:30,227
No.

432
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,896
She wouldn't have the faintest idea.

433
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,524
So you want to do business with me
in Jo Manjae's place?

434
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,651
A senior KCIA agent himself?

435
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,653
Is that a problem?

436
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,988
Does Director Hwang know?

437
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,823
Does he need to?

438
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,660
By the way… …how do you know him?

439
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,412
I used to work with him.

440
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,080
On what?

441
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:51,832
Just some business.

442
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,589
"Chairman of the Korea-Japan
Cultural Exchange Foundation."

443
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:03,093
"Director of the Korea-Japan
Development Council."

444
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,972
Since when do yakuza
do this kind of thing?

445
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,440
We do anything that makes money,

446
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,774
just like you.

447
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,155
Are you serious about doing this right?

448
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,657
If we're not doing it right,

449
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,160
then I'm not doing it at all.

450
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,761
If you don't hold up your end again,

451
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,890
I'll make sure you pay for it,
even for wasting my time.

452
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,518
That sounds like a threat.

453
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,813
It is a threat.

454
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,357
If you can't handle it, walk away.

455
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,121
Let me ask you one thing.

456
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,627
Did you want to see me?

457
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,756
I wanted to see you.

458
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,847
Mr. Baek!

459
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:37,312
Darling,
were you okay without me?

460
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,856
Did you enjoy shopping, Ms. Bae?

461
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,652
Yeah, I picked up a few briefs
for my dear Mr. Baek.

462
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,549
HAPPY BUSAN CITIZENS' DAY

463
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,679
Hello, Director Hwang.

464
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,974
Jang Geonyoung,
Special Investigations, Busan Office.

465
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,810
Oh, right.

466
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:22,315
I heard you've been working hard
chasing after those junkies.

467
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,733
Me? Not at all.

468
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,278
You're the one
who must have it rough, sir.

469
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,239
With all the big names in Busan
in the palm of your hand,

470
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,576
I can only imagine
how much work that takes.

471
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,747
I don't know what you've heard exactly.

472
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,250
But narcotics cases?

473
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,752
You just end up
chasing the tail all night.

474
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,214
-You've got your share of headaches.
-That's why

475
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,842
I was hoping to ask you for some intel.

476
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,635
What kind of intel?

477
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,762
You know Jo Manjae well, right?

478
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,890
The Manjae Gang boss.

479
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,726
Well, I guess
I know about as much as you do.

480
00:32:58,894 --> 00:32:59,895
But I was told

481
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,273
he disappeared. Isn't that right?

482
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,608
Yes, that's right.

483
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,985
He did disappear, without a trace.

484
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,030
But just when I started
investigating again,

485
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:14,201
a witness pops up saying they'd seen him
in the Philippines.

486
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:18,288
And the next thing I know,
the higher-ups shut it all down.

487
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,541
So what exactly is it

488
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,502
that you want to know?

489
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,215
Whether he's alive in the Philippines

490
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,425
or rotting somewhere, that can wait.

491
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,221
But who has taken over his operation

492
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,682
and is running
the drug trade here in Busan?

493
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,228
That's what I want to know.

494
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,778
That's news to me.

495
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,072
Someone's definitely taken it over.

496
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,573
I'm sure of it.

497
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,578
Rounding up the leftover goons,

498
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,289
and trying to bring in a new cook.

499
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,085
Ah…

500
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:06,920
By the way,

501
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,589
I don't see your guy here. Baek Kitae?

502
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:10,924
He's usually with you.

503
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,969
I guess the KCIA
must be swamped these days.

504
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,350
You're good at peeling these.

505
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,851
I can never get it right.

506
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:23,687
Is that so?

507
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,815
-Want me to peel one for you?
-Would you?

508
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,899
Sure.

509
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,861
Here.

510
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,697
You grab the legs

511
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,908
and peel it off like this.

512
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:37,993
There.

513
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,036
-For you, sir.
-Thanks.

514
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,085
-Go ahead.
-All right.

515
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,426
Mr. Jang!

516
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,722
How did it go?

517
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,350
Seeing how he played dumb,

518
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,394
it's clear the KCIA
took care of Jo Manjae.

519
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,814
So, does that mean
Director Hwang killed him off

520
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,983
and is pushing meth himself?

521
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,904
I don't think Director Hwang
knows much about the drugs.

522
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,826
Then who the hell is it?

523
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,828
When are you meeting Baek Soyeong?

524
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,792
Do you think…

525
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,213
Baek Kitae is trying to push meth
behind Hwang's back?

526
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,007
I threw it out there,

527
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,301
so let's wait and see

528
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,055
if Baek Kitae is really running drugs.

529
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,643
Have you lost your mind?

530
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,228
A KCIA agent dealing meth?

531
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,356
What are you thinking? Huh?

532
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,316
Are you trying to get us all killed?

533
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,946
I'm doing this so we can all survive.

534
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,743
After Mom died,

535
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,121
how did the three of us make it to Busan?

536
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,998
And what's our life been like?

537
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:10,502
If we keep living like this,
nothing will be different in 10, 20 years.

538
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,712
We'll never get out
of this damn hillside slum.

539
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,632
Soyeong.

540
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,592
Don't you trust me?

541
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,805
Say I bring in just one kilo.
That costs 200,000 won.

542
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,558
Cook it and sell it, that's 5 million.
Ship it to Japan, 15 million.

543
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,269
Fif…

544
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,107
Fifteen million won?

545
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,694
Plus, I'm not doing this alone.

546
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,237
People above me…

547
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,658
We're all in on it.

548
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,785
Above you? The KCIA?

549
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,578
How high up?

550
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,038
Way up.

551
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,917
Which means
there's no risk of getting caught.

552
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,128
No.

553
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,005
There will be addicts.

554
00:36:56,506 --> 00:37:00,301
It'll wreck the country, right when
they're trying to build a new era.

555
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,055
Kitae, no, I'd feel too guilty.

556
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,558
You don't have to worry about that.

557
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,685
We'll make it here,

558
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,437
but we'll ship it all out to Japan.

559
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,355
Japan?

560
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,315
Yeah. We'll be
bringing in foreign currency,

561
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,443
and we'll be the ones driving exports.

562
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,445
If the business goes well,

563
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,030
we'll be doing our part
in building the new era.

564
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,782
Our family won't be left behind.

565
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,118
We'll be at the forefront
if we get with the times.

566
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,203
That means we're serving the country.

567
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,329
It's patriotic work.

568
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,081
Patriotic?

569
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,167
Yes.

570
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,963
Don't tell Kihyun.
He doesn't need to know.

571
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:39,299
Okay.

572
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,428
You just need to take care of the money

573
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,681
and keep an eye on Kang Daeil, all right?

574
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,684
Mmm.

575
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,774
Yeah. Thank you, sir.

576
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,077
Our goal…

577
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,289
is to make the best product

578
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,999
and take over the Japanese market.

579
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,461
What about Korea?

580
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,172
Focus on Japan for now.

581
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,299
Don't put anything out in Korea
without my approval.

582
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,801
Understood.

583
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,014
What about the chemist?

584
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,352
We've got someone
with sharp eyes and skilled hands.

585
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,980
He's made quite a name
for himself in this business.

586
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,315
It wasn't easy,
but I managed to bring him in.

587
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:23,987
The best of the best, as pure as possible.

588
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,867
That's how we win the Japanese over.

589
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,034
You know that, right?

590
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,661
Understood, sir.

591
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,709
And I'm bringing one more person on board.

592
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,837
Who is it?

593
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,506
The place has a nice view.

594
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,801
Right. Yeah, very nice.

595
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,393
Let's do this!

596
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,105
Yeah, let's do this!

597
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,336
All right, the pigs are here.

598
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,849
Okay, let's go.

599
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,104
Come on, let's go.

600
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:43,983
Go on, get in there.

601
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,951
They stink bad, huh?

602
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,035
It's fine.

603
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,418
Here, this will help.

604
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,388
I'm Kang Daeil.

605
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,556
I've heard a lot about you.

606
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,600
If it ever gets tough, just let me know.

607
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,685
Tough? No way.

608
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,228
This is patriotic work after all.

609
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,356
Patriotic?

610
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,025
That's nice.

611
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,487
Man, smells real sweet.

612
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,489
Make sure they have plenty to eat!

613
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,746
We've got the pigs here.

614
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,998
You want to get started?

615
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,924
Mr. Kang.

616
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,010
I have a question.

617
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,553
Why did you bring pigs here?

618
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,346
They cost money, don't they?

619
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,850
It stinks when you cook meth, you know.

620
00:41:58,933 --> 00:41:59,934
And?

621
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,270
You cover it with the smell of pig crap.

622
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,230
Ah…

623
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,314
Hey.

624
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,697
Hey.

625
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,033
What?

626
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,263
DIRECTOR GENERAL HWANG GUKPYEONG

627
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,476
This month's take looks a little light.

628
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:47,565
Kang Daeil's still trying
to pull the gang back together, so…

629
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,570
Fine. More importantly,

630
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,782
who did she meet in Osaka?

631
00:42:58,951 --> 00:42:59,952
Bae Geumji.

632
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,039
No one in particular.

633
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,708
She just went shopping and sightseeing.

634
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,627
Shopping, huh?

635
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,129
And I'm losing my mind over here.

636
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,007
Where's that tramp now?

637
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,052
She's staying with her family
to take care of her kid.

638
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,304
Lee's keeping an eye on her now.

639
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,098
I'll be taking over again tomorrow.

640
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,433
Right, I appreciate it.

641
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,145
Phone in every two hours.

642
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:27,897
Yes, sir.

643
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,275
You can go.

644
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:51,963
Yes, sir.

645
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,756
Send Pyo in.

646
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,092
Yes, sir. I will.

647
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,219
Mr. Pyo, he'll see you now.

648
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,317
-Did you find out?
-Yes, sir.

649
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,571
Baek Kitae met with Ikeda Yuji in Osaka.

650
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,531
Choi Yuji?

651
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,615
Yes, sir.

652
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,452
Baek Kitae…

653
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,038
met with Choi Yuji?

654
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,416
That little bastard.

655
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,502
I told him to shut down the meth business…

656
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,338
…and now he's going all in on it?

657
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:38,301
It looks like he and Kang Daeil
have taken over the whole Manjae Gang.

658
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,682
I guess I've been raising
a tiger all along, huh?

659
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:50,855
If word gets out the KCIA's pushing meth,
it'll be a hell of a show, won't it?

660
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,402
Sir.

661
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,405
But the thing is,

662
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:03,618
I hear the profits are massive.

663
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,078
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

664
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,340
How much are we talking?

665
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:21,177
I'll get back to you with exact numbers.

666
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,947
What did you pray for?

667
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:43,908
The country's well-being
and world peace.

668
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,287
I'm serious.

669
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:51,916
Don't you ever pray?

670
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,712
Does He ever answer your prayers?

671
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,090
Of course.

672
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,927
If you really want it
with all your heart, He does.

673
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:08,724
Ms. Bae,
what is it that you really want?

674
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,942
Does the notebook even exist?

675
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,951
What about you? What do you really want?

676
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,496
Money?

677
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:32,415
Power?

678
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:34,709
Love?

679
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,550
You want it all, don't you?

680
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,845
So no one can ever look down on you.

681
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:52,685
So do I.

682
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:55,980
Same as you.

683
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,572
Fucking hell.

684
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,451
Bow properly, damn it!

685
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:17,793
Hello?

686
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:19,545
Hey, where the hell are you?

687
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,880
Where's Bae Geumji?

688
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,257
She's attending church service.

689
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,968
That bitch wants
to see the President today!

690
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,348
He'll be inspecting
Seoul National University in a bit,

691
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:33,017
and that crazy bitch is planning
to show up there!

692
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,353
Hey!

693
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,397
If you lose her, you and I are finished.
You get that, right?

694
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,858
You get that or not, you little shit?

695
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,957
Bae Geumji!

696
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:09,303
Na Yongcheol,
Chief of Staff to the President.

697
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,849
Cheon Seokjung's sole rival
and his closest enemy.

698
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:18,187
You think you can just pop out a kid
and turn your life around?

699
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,775
Well,
I figured I'd give it a try.

700
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,611
See if it works.

701
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,906
There's only one kid.

702
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,242
How many fathers does he have?

703
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,161
You looking to milk everyone dry?

704
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,165
Hmm…

705
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,875
You and I

706
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:41,919
both know

707
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,963
who the father is.

708
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,840
What matters isn't the truth.

709
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,426
What matters is

710
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,720
what people believe, Mr. Na.

711
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:55,349
Either way, they all believe
what they want to believe.

712
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,017
And?

713
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,771
You're just going to let them believe it?

714
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,567
Why not? It doesn't hurt me.

715
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,362
There's no reason for me to run around
telling people the whole story, is there?

716
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,157
Well,
if it bothers you that much,

717
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,743
why don't you go ahead
and tell them yourself?

718
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:17,872
So the country can go to hell,
as long as you save your own skin?

719
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,707
All those men you're stirring up

720
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,835
are those working hard
to keep this country going.

721
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:23,919
Exactly.

722
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,755
Which is why I'm asking for your help.

723
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,634
I want to be able
to care about the country too.

724
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:31,719
You know,

725
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,763
you could really end up dead
if you keep this up.

726
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:37,850
Don't you know any of them could easily
get rid of someone like you?

727
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,814
Doesn't matter.

728
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:47,026
No matter what anyone says,
I'm not leaving.

729
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:50,905
So help me.

730
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,705
Come on. After everything…

731
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,085
I can ask you that much, can't I?

732
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,505
Hmm?

733
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:08,589
Truth is,

734
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:11,550
I've been thinking
of starting my own business.

735
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,136
I've always wanted to.

736
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,932
A courtesan house, bigger than Cheonungak.

737
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,892
How does that sound?

738
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,853
I've already got my eye
on the building and the land.

739
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,647
Hmm…

740
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,400
And I think I'd like a villa too.
Everyone else has one.

741
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,111
What do you think?

742
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:38,994
Mr. Na.

743
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,082
Don't take this lightly.

744
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,752
Because everything I said today?

745
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,257
I meant every word.

746
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,637
You crazy bitch.

747
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,347
Are you threatening me right now?

748
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,362
So, you're saying…

749
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:16,740
She went to see

750
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,493
Chief Na, not the President?

751
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:20,828
Yes, sir.

752
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,538
That crazy bitch.

753
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,209
She's digging her own grave, isn't she?

754
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,380
What about Baek?

755
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:33,966
He's standing by in Seoul.

756
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:38,262
Goddamn idiot,
falling for some tramp like that.

757
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,768
Still, the woman's a real piece of work.

758
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,813
She just had to stir up the hornet's nest

759
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,483
and throw all the men upstairs into chaos.

760
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,362
I can't tell if she's naïve
or just plain stupid.

761
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,701
-Hey.
-Yes, sir?

762
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,786
Have you ever been in love?

763
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:06,874
I'm not so sure.

764
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,341
She's pulling all this shit
just because she wants to be loved.

765
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,935
Fucking bitch.

766
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,439
That's right.

767
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,984
This was the night I last saw him.

768
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,614
It was the first time
he'd ever asked to meet,

769
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,700
so I wondered what it was about.

770
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:49,833
Darling.

771
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,170
Are you mad at me?

772
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,177
Go back.

773
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,805
Are you really going to do this?

774
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,057
You're ruining the mood.

775
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,443
Those guys can't do anything to me.

776
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:19,571
I've got my notebook.

777
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,825
Hand that over and get out of the country

778
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:24,827
if you want to stay alive.

779
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:27,663
If I hand that over…

780
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:31,125
they'll kill me.

781
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,252
And they'll kill you if you don't.

782
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,884
Why are you trying to scare me like this?

783
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:52,563
Enough games.

784
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,065
Hand over the notebook, now.

785
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:57,443
And if I don't?

786
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:00,863
You might not make it through the night.

787
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:05,826
My God.

788
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,871
How do you even make threats look so cool?

789
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,249
Do you practice in front of a mirror
or something?

790
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:16,587
Gosh, that hurt.

791
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:25,512
It never existed.

792
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,768
The notebook.

793
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,644
It never existed.

794
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,521
I'm telling you the truth

795
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,524
because I think you figured that out
a long time ago.

796
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,119
Stay with me tonight.

797
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,248
I don't want to be alone.

798
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,084
You said I might not make it
through the night.

799
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,670
If something happens to me,

800
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,673
you'll have to save me.

801
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,805
Why should I do that?

802
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,062
You think I don't know?

803
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,693
About whatever deal
you've got going with Choi Yuji.

804
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,905
Did you think I wouldn't figure it out?

805
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:33,705
You can't do this to me.

806
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:35,874
You…

807
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:37,376
Darling.

808
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,379
You like me, don't you?

809
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,568
Mr. Baek.

810
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,444
Darling.

811
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:16,034
Hey, Seongguk's birthday is…

812
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,452
Next Saturday.

813
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,667
How about we take him to Changgyeongwon?

814
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,586
And show him the elephants.

815
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,214
Geumji,
we should stop this now.

816
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,093
Let's go back to the States
with Seongguk, all right?

817
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,595
I'll do whatever it takes
to raise him well.

818
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,141
Aren't you angry?

819
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,604
I am.

820
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,649
At this world.

821
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:12,466
Hey. Get out of the car, punk.

822
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,884
Who the hell are you?

823
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,844
-Get out of the car.
-Who the hell are you?

824
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,429
-Come on.
-Let go! Let go of me!

825
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,806
-Walk straight, you bastard!
-Who the hell are you?

826
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,266
-Hey, get him in.
-Hey! Damn it.

827
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,643
-Get off me!
-Get the hell in!

828
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,118
What's going on? You scared me.

829
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,126
Can't you just let me go?

830
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,691
I wanted to fall in love again.

831
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,182
