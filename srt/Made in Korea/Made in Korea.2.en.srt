00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,092
[newscaster] The collapse
of the Mapo Citizens' Apartment

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,094
already notorious for shoddy construction…

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,722
[man] Would you look at that?
The world has gone crazy.

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,849
It's not long
before everything goes to hell.

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,143
Well, I guess it had a good run.

6
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,980
One day, the whole world will come
crashing down like that apartment.

7
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,316
Will you stop with the doom
and gloom already?

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,611
What about our Huijeong?
Want her to die before she even blooms?

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,864
I'm just saying. The world is
not going to fold that easily.

10
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,241
The doenjang stew is good.

11
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,159
I'm scared the baby might hear you.

12
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,497
With its so-called dad
spouting that kind of talk,

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,582
you think it'd even want to be born?

14
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,001
Geez. I'm sorry, okay? Let's just eat.

15
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,087
[newscaster continues]

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,548
[banging on door]

17
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,132
[man] Who's that?

18
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,301
[banging on door continues]

19
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,136
[man] Damn, who is it?

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,305
[Robert speaking in English] Mr. Kim, it…
It's Robert.

21
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,895
[in English] Are you nuts?

22
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,356
I told you not to come to my house.

23
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,442
[Robert] Mr. Kim, we're going back
to the States next week.

24
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,070
For old times' sake,
let me have it just this once.

25
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,405
I'll pay you double.

26
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,782
Double?

27
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,410
[in Korean] Damn it.

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,204
[in English] Come on.

29
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,711
[in Korean] Have you lost it?
What were you thinking calling them here?

30
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,006
I didn't. They showed up on their own.

31
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,757
[phone ringing]

32
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,305
Hello?

33
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,603
BEOMCHEON-DONG, CAFÉ C'EST…

34
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,898
Got it. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

35
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,447
[whispering] They said they'll pay double.

36
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,116
Let's just give it
and send them away. Go get it.

37
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,996
Hurry, go grab it.

[chattering]

48
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,808
[investigator] Huh? Mr. Jang.

49
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:28,894
Be careful.

50
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,365
[sighs softly]

51
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,701
[girl fussing softly]

52
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,164
[Investigator Kim]
Evening, sir. [clears throat]

53
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,585
The victims were married.

54
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,422
Kim Taeyeong, 29 years old,
and his wife, Lee Suni, 26.

55
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,050
They had a three-year-old daughter, and…

56
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,137
the wife was pregnant.

57
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,224
[clears throat] Oh, and this.

58
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,655
The US Army already took them
into custody and got their confessions.

59
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,825
First,

60
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,953
let's get the kid out of here.

61
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,164
She doesn't really have
anywhere else to go.

62
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,668
Her uncle's on his way now.

63
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,964
[sighs] Is it because of the rain?

64
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,424
The whole place reeks of blood.

65
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,263
[grunts, sighs]

66
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,432
[door opens]

-[♪ intriguing music plays]

68
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,238
BEOMCHEON-DONG,
CAFÉ C'EST LA VIE, 6 P.M., 1 KG

69
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,156
[girl fussing softly]

70
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:07,659
[giggling]

71
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,786
[Geonyoung]
This child's parents were drug dealers.

72
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:16,209
Middlemen who got meth from suppliers
and sold it on to end consumers.

73
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,878
[siren wailing in distance]

74
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,963
The couple seemed as ordinary as anyone,

75
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,466
but they were murdered
by US soldiers while dealing drugs.

76
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,014
Those US soldiers were addicted to meth.

77
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,851
They never had the money
to buy it in the first place.

78
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,854
With no money, they had to steal.

79
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,356
Once you're hooked on meth…

80
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,108
-Move, please!
-…nothing else matters.

81
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,234
This way, sir.

82
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,821
[Geonyoung] I bet that's what happened
when they killed this girl's parents.

83
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:50,493
They decided their own craving
mattered more than someone else's life.

84
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,207
This girl's name is Kim Huijeong.

85
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,210
Now that her parents are dead,

86
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,881
the bottle in her mouth
is all she has to survive on.

87
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,760
When she grows up,
will she remember this moment?

88
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,513
People say time heals all wounds.

89
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,850
That everything gets better with time.

90
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,146
But this girl will remember this
for the rest of her life.

91
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,983
Her own face as she sucked on the bottle,

92
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,820
her parents' faces as their throats
were cut over a drug deal,

93
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,740
and the stench of blood
that filled the room.

94
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,119
If there really is a God,

95
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,955
may he save this girl's soul

96
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,626
from the power of the dog.

97
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,005
[♪ relentlessly frenetic music plays]

98
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,184
[Geonyoung humming]

99
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,402
Ah, ah. [clears throat]

100
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,739
[Geonyoung resumes humming]

101
00:08:58,913 --> 00:08:59,956
[Geonyoung clears his throat]

102
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,920
[investigators] Good afternoon, sir.

103
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,005
[man] What's that?

104
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,924
Well, I went home
to grab some files I'd forgotten.

105
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,676
-[man] On your bike?
-[Geonyoung] Yes.

106
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,345
Did you guys eat yet?

107
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,430
[investigators] Yes.

108
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,931
[Investigator Kim] Sure did.

109
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,392
[Geonyoung] Can you order me
a jjajangmyeon? Make it extra-large.

110
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,729
-[investigator] Yes, sir.
-[man] Hey, Jang!

111
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,398
Listen.

112
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,276
You said you weren't
taking public security cases.

113
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,071
[Geonyoung] That's right.

114
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,656
Then focus on narcotics.

115
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,951
Why are you poking around
in a public security case?

116
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:41,664
[Geonyoung] It's connected to the victims
in my case, so I looked into it.

117
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,002
Being a KCIA informant doesn't mean
you can't be a junkie too, right?

118
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,087
Jang.

119
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,798
When I first met you at the Seoul Office,

120
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,343
I was a section chief, and you were
just a prosecutor with no title, right?

121
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,137
And when I was in Gwangju
as a departmental chief,

122
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,473
you still had no title.

123
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,435
And now, I've been sent here
to Busan as the deputy chief prosecutor.

124
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,730
But you? You're still without a title.

125
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,943
All your peers are section chiefs now,
some moving up to departmental chiefs.

126
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:14,239
How long will you keep drifting
around the country without a title?

127
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:19,077
[Geonyoung]
Well, all I can do is give it my best.

128
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,122
[chief prosecutor] That's exactly why
you never get promoted. You're too rigid.

129
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,998
No flexibility!

130
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,669
Learn to work the hierarchy.

131
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,255
What do you think an organization is, huh?

132
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,260
[Geonyoung]
An organization is a place where you work.

133
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,179
I still have work to do,
so I'd better get to it now.

134
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,391
Jang. Don't mess with the KCIA, all right?

135
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,394
Cross them and we're
the only ones who bleed.

136
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,106
[Geonyoung] Okay. I'll keep that
in mind and do my best, sir.

137
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,359
We certainly can't have
bloodshed on the job. [sighs]

138
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,902
[chief prosecutor] You're impossible.

139
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,947
Open a window in here, will you?
It smells like…

140
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,576
And turn the lights on!
It's so dark in here.

141
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,369
-Yes, sir.
-What is this, a rat's nest?

-Geez.

143
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,539
Well, I'm off!

144
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,750
[investigators] Good day, sir!

145
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,336
-[Geonyoung] Turn them off.
-[door slams shut]

146
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,380
The lights.

147
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,050
Goodness.

00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,680
It's nice and gloomy, isn't it?

In charge of the entire
Busan branch of the KCIA.

[Kitae] It got on me.

156

One word from him,
and the whole city moves.

157
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,668

about Jo Manjae.

159

I hear he's been
dealing meth with the Yakuza.

160
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,053
Yes, I'm aware.

161
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,976
You're aware?

162
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,062
[Kitae] Yes, sir.

163
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,988
[Kitae] That meth is what I loaded
onto the plane and sent off to Pyongyang.

164
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,240
The Manjae Gang's meth.

Under Director Hwang's protection,
they grew fast.

170
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,986
They kick back 30%
of their monthly take to him,

171
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,196

is apparently gunning for Jo Manjae,

180
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,776
They say he's a Marine legend
who once took down armed guerrillas

with his bare hands and got
a Hwarang Order of Military Merit for it.

182

And he's the kind of loose cannon
who doesn't give a damn about higher-ups.

00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,983
[Geonyoung] Put your hands
in your pockets and relax.

348
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,860
-You're as stiff as a board.
-[Yejin] Yes, sir.

349
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,395
[Geonyoung] He looks familiar. Who is he?

350
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,899
[Yejin] Let's see the stuff first!

351
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,075
Let's see the cash first.

352
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,537
[clears throat]

353
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,895
[Yejin] Well, this stuff is nice.

354
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,230
Yeah, good stuff.

355
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,606
[radio crackles while tuning]

356
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,527
[newscaster] Last night's brutal murder
of a married couple in Haeundae

357
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,113
has been revealed to be
the work of US soldiers

358
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,699
who had been dealing meth with them.

359
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,536
The victims, Kim and his wife,
had a young daughter,

360
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,832
and it was discovered that she was
present at the scene, adding to the shock.

361
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,501
The Busan Haeundae Police
are focusing their investigation

362
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,546
on the possibility
that the suspects committed the crime…

363
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,089
[Daeil] Who the hell are you guys?

364
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,173
[Geonyoung] This bastard.

365
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,509
I just remembered who he is.

366
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,177

[Yejin] Honey!

369
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,104
What the hell? Are you nuts?
Who the hell are you?

370
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,480
[Yejin] He's asking who we are!

371
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,399
-You insane?
-Can you believe this guy?

372
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,734
What the fuck?

373
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:28,861
You're Kang Daeil, right?

374
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,571
The Manjae Gang's underboss?

375
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,157

[Yejin] Hey!
Where do you think you're going?

Hey!

You're so dead!

390
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,952
Get back here!

391
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,417

Hey! You little shit!

For Christ's sake!

402
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,539
[Yejin] Where did he go?

403
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:10,963
Goddamn it!

404
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,215

Where the hell did he go?

413
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,199

Hey.

418
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,260
Paying respects to your ancestors?

419
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,054
What are you doing over there
with your head on the ground?

420
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:02,973
[Daeil] For fuck's sake.

Hey, get out here. Come sit down.

Man, I'm fucking exhausted.

Goddamn it.

426
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,657
You can run, huh?

427
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,243
Where's Oh, my investigator?

428
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,873
[Daeil] Your investigator?
How the fuck would I know!

Not at all. I'm soft as can be.

Don't ever do anything
I didn't tell you to again.

Mr. Jang!

466
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,934
You know,

467
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,729
if you get locked up this time,

468
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,815
it's 10 years minimum.

469
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,110
Fuck.

470
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,573
Ten years just for pushing some meth?
I don't think so.

471
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,366
It's not like I killed anyone.

472
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,328
I'll probably be out in a couple.

473
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,375
Bullshit.

474
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,962
The Manjae Gang's number two,
out selling drugs himself?

475
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,174
Why would you do that, huh?

476
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,179
What are they saying?

477
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,599
Hey.

478
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,645
You've been sneaking out drugs
behind Jo Manjae's back, haven't you?

479
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,230
If he finds out…

480
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,651
you think he'll let you get away with it?

481
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:05,113
His number two stealing his stash?

482
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,659
Fucking hell.

483
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,829
So what do you want?

484
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,748
[Geonyoung] Listen carefully.

485
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,832
The thing is,

486
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,920
it's Jo Manjae that I really want.

487
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,632
Which means you can save yourself

488
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,009
if you just do what I say.

489
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,512
You want me to be a goddamn rat?

490
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,598
If I get caught, I'm the only one fucked.

491
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,849
So why should I?

492
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,644
Damn it, you thick-headed idiot.

493
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,812
Hey.

494
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,565
You dumbass.
Does your brain even work? Hmm?

495
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,569
Do you not get
who's holding your leash right now?

496
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,239
I don't want the small fry
with a kilo or two.

497
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,492
I want 10 kilos or more,
the kind of deal Manjae handles himself.

498
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,786
The choice is yours.

499
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,372
Be a goddamn rat,

500
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,375
or die at Jo Manjae's hands.

501
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,090
Investigator Oh.

502
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,430
The key.

503
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,308
-[Yejin] What key?
-[Geonyoung] To the handcuffs.

504
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,519
[Yejin] Why?

505
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,531
Huh? Huh?

506
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:32,784
Huh?

507
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:34,578
What…

508
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,331
Get out of here. Go.

509
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,750
[Yejin] What? Oh!

510
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,337
Mr. Jang! What the hell are you doing?

511
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,883
-I let him go.
-Why?

512
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,385
[Geonyoung] This stays between you and me.

513
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,972
It's our little secret.

514
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,642
[Kitae] His mother is dead.

515
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,478
He's got a father and a younger sister.

516
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,689
[agent]
Yes, the father's name is Jang Myeongho.

517
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,357
He's in a psychiatric hospital.

518
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,443
[Kitae] Psychiatric hospital?

519
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,862
[agent] He's been there a long time,
about 20 years.

520
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,864
[Kitae] What for?

521
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:11,948
[agent] I'm looking into it.

522
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,700
[Kitae] What about his sister?

523
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,119
[agent] Jang Hyeeun, 25 years old.

524
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:20,207
She works at a dye factory in Gyeonggi-do.
There's nothing unusual about her.

525
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,750
Check the people around him too.

526
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,169
Report back if you find anything useful.

527
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,295
[agent] Yes, sir.

528
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:30,050
And about Ikeda Yuji,
the one you mentioned last time.

529
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,551
Did you look into her?

530
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,011
[agent] Her real name is Choi Yuji.

531
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,721
She's a Zainichi.

532
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,599
A Zainichi?

533
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,644
[agent] Yes, she lost both her parents
when she was 13.

534
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,063
Then Chairman Ikeda adopted her.

535
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,024
He seems to put a lot of trust in her.

536
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,109
She's got real pull in the organization,

537
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,153
with plenty of people gunning for her.

538
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,446
Choi Yuji.

539
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,782
[in Japanese] I'll see you again.

540
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,367
[engine turns over]

541
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,587
[in Korean] Look at that idiot.

542
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,137
[agent]
But why are you looking into Choi Yuji?

543
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,810
I'm sorry.

544
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,691
Choi Yuji…

545
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,070
[agent] While you were out earlier,
Mr. Baek Kihyun called.

546
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,154
[Kitae] What did he say?

547
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,157
[agent] He's coming today
for your mother's memorial.

548
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,451
He said he couldn't make it.

549
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,786
He's in the army, right?

550
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,833
Top of his class at the Military Academy.

551
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,876
[agent] Top of his class…

552
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,671
It's just a matter of time
before he pins on a star, right?

553
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,965
A star? Sure, he'll get one.

554
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,093
The question is, how many.

555
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,478
[Kitae] Hey, Baek Kihyun.

556
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,319
[cup thuds softly]

557
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:03,787
[Kitae] Let's eat.

558
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,998
[Kihyun] Thank you for the meal.

559
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:15,006
Kihyun was only in first
or second grade when Mom passed.

560
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,301
Time really flies. Doesn't it, Kitae?

561
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,139
[Kitae]
How's life in the army? Doing all right?

562
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,558
[Kihyun] I'm doing fine.

563
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,062
[Kitae] Is something up?

564
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,191
I wish it were.

565
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,490
[Kitae] Staring at barbed wire
on the front line is boring, no?

566
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,200
SECURITY COMMAND
AHN SEUNGHYEOK

567
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,869
He'll let you know once a spot opens up
at Security Command.

568
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,790
You always wanted to go there
after graduating the academy.

569
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,710
I can take care of myself.

570
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,505
Just let me help you.
What are big brothers for?

571
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,006
Right, Soyeong?

572
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,591
You're right.

573
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,179
But you know, Kihyun's all grown up now.

574
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,473
His opinion matters too.

575
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,191
[Kitae] Just take it.

576
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,819
I'm sure plenty of others got his card.

577
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,488
I told you.

578
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,742
In the end, guys with money
and connections run the world.

579
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:28,037
[Soyeong] That's true. Life is brutal
without parents or connections.

580
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,290
But things get easier
if you have money and power.

581
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,416
Funny how that works.

582
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,504
Kitae.

583
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,926
I can take care of myself.

584
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,432
Fine.

585
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,309
Let me know if you change your mind.

586
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,443
[Yejin sighs]

587
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:03,990
So, your plan is to use Kang Daeil
as a mole to get Jo Manjae?

588
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:05,992
[Geonyoung] Yes.

589
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:12,415
[Yejin] But what if Kang Daeil doesn't
play along and just disappears on you?

590
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,626
-What are you going to do then?
-[chuckles]

591
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,756
He'll have no choice but to do as I say
if he wants to stay alive.

592
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,591
How can you be so sure?

593
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,551
Because Kang Daeil, that punk,

594
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,012
has been skimming drugs
behind his boss's back.

595
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:30,225
It means being a number two
isn't enough for him.

596
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,018
What are you…

597
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,686
I promised him

598
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:38,358
I'd make him number one in the gang.

599
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,944
Once I take down Jo Manjae,

600
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,947
Kang Daeil becomes the boss of the gang.

601
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,202
[Yejin] So then,

602
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,749
you're going to take down Jo Manjae,
but really just let Kang Daeil walk free?

603
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,210
[♪ mysterious music playing]

604
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,631
First, I take down Jo Manjae.

605
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,509
Then, I'll put Kang Daeil behind bars too.

606
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,351
[Yejin] Mr. Jang.

607
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:14,978
Yeah.

608
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,813
You know Alain Delon, right?

609
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,439
Alain Delon? What about him?

610
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,650
You know, in those movies,

611
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:26,239
he goes around killing people brutally
with that handsome face.

612
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,618
And then he smokes,
just like you are right now.

613
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,496
Yeah. That's it.

614
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:42,839
Every time I watch him,
I get butterflies for some reason.

615
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:46,426
People must tell you all the time
you look like him, right?

616
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,142
[Geonyoung] Enough with the nonsense.

617
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,478
Take a look at this photo.

618

[Geonyoung sighs]

619
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,444
That guy next to Jo Manjae.

620
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,198
[Yejin] Looks like Jo Manjae's bowing
and scraping to him.

621
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,117
Who's the guy, his backer?

622
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,245
[Geonyoung] We'll know who he is
once we've got Jo Manjae.

623
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,374
[Yejin sighs]

624
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,460
Wow, there's another Alain Delon here.

625
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,424
[Geonyoung] Just how many Alain Delons
do you see exactly?

626
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:30,553
Me? Only one, of course.

627
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,432

Well, we keep getting wrong numbers.

you're standing in the middle of
someone else's office while they're out.

696
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,525
You know Jo Manjae, right?

697
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,986
The Manjae Gang's number one.

698
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,112
Right, the Manjae Gang.

699
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,114
I came here

700
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:09,285
to ask you to drop Jo Manjae. Lay off him.

701
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,960
You're telling me
to shut down my investigation?

702
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,879
The KCIA

703
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,757
giving orders to a prosecutor?

704
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,636
I didn't mean it like that.

705
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,890
[Geonyoung] Then what?

706
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,184
At least give me a proper explanation.

707
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:41,233
[Kitae] Did you know Jo Manjae's
married to a Zainichi?

708
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,360
Yes.

709
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,823
According to our recent intel,

710
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,452
his wife has been deeply involved
with North Korea.

711
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,624
[Geonyoung] Ah.

712
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,419
So Jo Manjae is tangled up
with commies now, huh?

713
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:04,048
[Kitae] We got word that his gang's been
pushing meth up North through Japan.

714
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,842
We've been running an operation
on this for over a year now.

715
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:10,596
I went undercover
to make contact with Jo Manjae myself.

716
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,974
[Geonyoung] So you're saying,
the KCIA's already working him,

717
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,227
and I'm supposed to back off?

718
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,187
We're all civil servants here.

719
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,147
We should help one another, shouldn't we?

720
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,525
It's all for the country after all.

721
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,738
[Geonyoung sighs]

722
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,284
Okay!

723
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:33,744
Got it.

724
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,372
I'll leave Jo Manjae to you then.

725
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,833
That goddamn commie.

726
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,419
[Kitae] Thank you for understanding.

727
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,170
Gosh, don't mention it.

728
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,965
[Kitae] You moved to Busan
about two months ago, right?

729
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,216
Yeah, that's right.

730
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,970
You're from Seoul, so I bet
it hasn't been easy settling in here.

731
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,889
We should grab some raw fish sometime.

732
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,766
I'll take you someplace nice.

733
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,060
[Geonyoung] Ah, actually…

734
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,897
I'm not really into raw fish.

735
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,316
When we get the chance,

736
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,111
let's have some soju instead,
with pork and rice soup.

737
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,195
That sounds good too.

738
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,531
All right, then. I'll give you a call.

739
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,217
Jo Manjae is…

740
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:34,680
tied up with commies, huh?

741
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:40,186
[laughing]

742
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,693
Yeah, right.

743
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,654
Who the hell does he think he's fooling?

744
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,616
[vocalizing]

745
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,995
[whistling]

746
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,971
-Let's go eat.
-[agent] Yes, sir.

747
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:29,818
[sighs] Mr. Jang isn't here yet.

748
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,325
-[Geonyoung] Turn the lights off.
-Damn, you scared me.

749
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,619
[Geonyoung] It's broad daylight.

750
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,912
[Yejin] I didn't see you there.

751
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,873
Save if you want a better life.

752
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:47,294
[Yejin]
Well, I picked up some lunch for you.

753
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,921
Have you eaten yet?

754
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,589
[Geonyoung] No.

755
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,633
Where's Mr. Kim and…

756
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,968
Where is everyone?

757
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,719
[Yejin] He said he was going to court.

758
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,930
The other investigators
are out at the scene.

759
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,564
[Yejin sighs]

760
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,942
[Geonyoung chewing]

761
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,819
[Yejin] Were you hungry? [chuckles]

762
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,071
Slow down, or you'll get indigestion.

763
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,991
-[Geonyoung] Here. Take a look.
-[paper rustling]

764
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,745
What's this?

765
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,080
[cup thuds]

766
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,748
9TH, 8 P.M.
ROOM 611, BUSAN HOTEL

767
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,792
He says the Yakuza's coming to Busan.

768
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:29,420
[Yejin] The Yakuza?

769
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,504
Yes.

770
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,301
[Geonyoung]
He's meeting Jo Manjae at Busan Hotel.

771
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:37,928
[Yejin] Uh… It's about the meth, right?

772
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,306
That's what it looks like.

773
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,932
[Yejin] Damn.

774
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,810
This time…

775
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:49,064
we have to get Jo Manjae.

776
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,359
[Yejin] Hang on.

777
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,069
The 9th?

778
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,447
That's the day after tomorrow, isn't it?

779
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,532
[Geonyoung] That's right.
The day after tomorrow.

780
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,286
Oh, right. The KCIA was here earlier.

781
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,499
-[Yejin] The KCIA? W-Why?
-Yeah.

782
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,084
What business…

783
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,920
could they possibly have

784
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,757
here at the Busan District
Prosecutors' Office?

785
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,133
[Yejin]
What could've brought the KCIA here?

786
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,136
[Geonyoung] Exactly.
What could've brought them here?

787
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,304
Look at this guy.

788
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,226
[♪ foreboding music playing]

[Investigator Kim breathing heavily]

791
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,033
[Daeil] Boss, he's here.

792
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,702
[Manjae] Yeah? All right.

793
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,709
Pleasure to meet you. I'm Jo Manjae.

794
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,502
[Daeil translates into Japanese]

795

[Yakuza speaking in Japanese]

797
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,132
[Daeil] He says hello.

798
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,759
-[Manjae] Have a seat.
-[Daeil translates into Japanese]

[Yakuza sighs]

801
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:51,186
So, is this your first time in Busan?

802

[speaks in Japanese]

804
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,738
[Daeil] He used to live here as a kid.

805
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,616
-[Manjae] So he's a Zainichi?
-[Daeil translates into Japanese]

-[♪ tense music playing]
-[Yakuza speaking in Japanese]

808
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:15,502
He's Japanese, and he was here in 1944.

809
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:18,922
That's before liberation.

810
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:25,846
My grandfather was killed by a Jap bullet
at the Battle of Cheongsan-ri, you know.

811
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,515
[Daeil] Uh…

812
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,600
[in Japanese] Well…

813
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,809
[sneezes]

814
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:36,940
[in Korean] Well, never mind.

815

History's history,
and business is business, eh?

816
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,991
Go get the stuff.

817
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:48,827
[Daeil speaking in Japanese]
Uh… We'll bring it to you now.

818
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,711
Looks good.

819
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,214
But…

820
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:03,926
you think you can move
10 kilos every month?

821
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,513
[in Korean] He's asking if we can do
10 kilos every month.

822
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,681
[Manjae] Let's see the cash first.

823
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,310
[Daeil translates into Japanese]

824
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,687

[clattering]

826
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:24,947
[Manjae] Tell him we can do 20 kilos.

[Daeil translates into Japanese]

828
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,953
[Yakuza speaking in Japanese]
That's impressive.

829
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,413
[Manjae] "Sugoi"?

830
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,999
[Daeil speaking in Korean]
"Sugoi" means "impressive."

831
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,462
[Manjae speaking in Japanese] Cheers.

I'd say we're good to go.

All right.

00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,705
Shit, it's hot!

870
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,081
It's hot!

871
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,669
Move!

872
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,463
Move!

873
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,090
Move!

874
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,671
[Gukpyeong sighs]

875
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,840
[Gukpyeong]
Do you not realize how serious this is?

876
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,760
The Japanese Metropolitan
Police Department

877
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:17,095
put those Yakuza bastards
on the wanted list.

878
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,515
They even sent over a formal request
for cooperation, Mr. Jo.

879
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:24,186
[Daeil] Sir, I'm really sorry
we didn't clear it with you first.

880
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:27,689
But still, after everything
we've paid up until now,

881
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,816
isn't this the time
you step in and cover us?

882
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,151
[Gukpyeong] Who the hell is this guy?

883
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,280
[Manjae] Sir, please forgive him.

884
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,283
This guy doesn't…
He doesn't know any better.

885
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,785
[Daeil] It won't happen again.

886
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,579
We just got a little greedy and messed up.

887
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:47,292
If you help us out just this once,
we'll make sure to pay you back for it!

888
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:50,587
[Gukpyeong] Wow. This one's got
more guts than him, right?

889
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,838
Hey, you're better.

890
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,424
[Manjae] Yeah, you're right.

891
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,302
He's got guts.
If you'd forgive us just this once…

892
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,223
[Manjae spluttering]

893
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,479
[Gukpyeong] Shut it. [clicks tongue]

894
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,613
[breathing shakily]

895
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:20,158
[Kitae]
Sir, it's probably best to leave him.

896
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:24,663
We'll need someone to pull the gang
back together as their new leader.

897
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,169
The election's right around the corner.

898
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,463
[Daeil breathing shakily]

899
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,180
You think you can do well?

900
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:45,725
Yes, sir.

901
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:47,269
Yeah?

902
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,530
[Gukpyeong sighs]

903
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,366
[agent 1] On your knees!

904
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:04,160
-[agent 2] Stay still!
-[agent 1] Stop resisting!

905
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,955
[agent 1] On your knees!

906
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:09,749
-[agent 2] Stay still!
-[agent 1] Stop resisting!

907
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,085
[agent 1] On your knees!

908
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,713
-[agent 2] Stay still!
-[agent 1] Stop resisting!

909
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,842
[sighs]

910
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:22,137
Who the hell screwed us over
and snatched Jo Manjae?

911
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,221
[door swings open]

912
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,515
-Hello. So…
-[Yejin] Morning, sir.

913
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,352
-[door closes]
-Did you guys clean the office yet?

914
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,397
-[Yejin] Clean?
-[Investigator Kim] No, we didn't…

915
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,524
[Geonyoung] How many times
have I told you to clean up?

916
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,109
Just look at this place!

917
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,527
-[Yejin] I'm sorry, sir.
-[Geonyoung] Huh?

918
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:41,031
[Investigator Kim] Ms. Oh, go and…
Go get the broom and the dustpan.

919
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,033
[Yejin] Yes, sir.
I'll bring the dustpan and sweep up.

920
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,536
And these useless boxes.
Get them all out to the storage room!

921
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,913
[Investigator Kim]
Okay, I'll clear them out.

922
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:50,123
[Geonyoung] And what the hell
is this bag doing here, huh?

923
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,208
Why would you leave
a bag lying around here?

924
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:53,877
-[Yejin] I'm sorry.
-[Investigator Kim] I'll put it away.

925
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,755
-[♪ gripping music plays]
-[bug detector beeping]

926
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,806
Lay low for a while.

927
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,560
You don't have to give me all this.

928
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,105
I won't breathe a word to Director Hwang.

929
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,523
Don't worry, sir.

930
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:19,361
If I was worried
about you running your mouth,

931
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,987
I would've let you die back there.

932
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,073
Then why did you…

933
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,157
[Kitae] I told you.

934
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,661
You're Jo Manjae's replacement now.

935
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,829
The whole gang's already in pieces,

936
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,999
so why would you even need a replacement?

937
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,585
The business.

938
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,213
You've got to keep it going, don't you?

939
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:42,217
[Geonyoung] All right, open up the cabinet
and toss out all those old files!

940
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,301
[Yejin] Yes, sir. I will.

941
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,512
[Investigator Kim] How many times
have I told you to clean that out?

942
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,097
-[Yejin] I'm sorry.
-[bug detector beeping]

943
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,605
[Geonyoung] And this box!

944
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,816
-[Yejin] That's…
-[Geonyoung] I told you a hundred times

945
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,068
-to throw it out already! Geez!
-[Yejin] That… I'm sorry!

946
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,612
[Investigator Kim] Mr. Jang, please
just leave it. We'll take care of it.

947
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,489
Just leave it. We'll do it.

948
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,074
[bug detector beeping]

949
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,412
Me?

950
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,000
You.

951
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,002
Me.

952
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:20,005
-Us.
-[sighs]

953
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,677
That meth business of yours.

954
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,931
I've had my eye on it for a long time.

955
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:32,600
[Manjae] Mr. Baek, I heard

956
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,396
you'll be going to Japan soon.

957
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,856
Would it be all right

958
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:40,483
if I asked you a small favor on your way?

959
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:44,988
[Kitae] That's why
I did you guys the favor.

960
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:50,035
I'll figure out a way to reopen
the connection with the Japanese.

961
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:51,911
In the meantime,

962
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,873
you take that money,
pull the guys back together,

963
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,625
and get the lab running again.

964
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,253
You want to sell the drugs yourself?

965
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,173
But…

966
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,800
A government man dealing drugs…

967
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:08,970
What?

968
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,015
Is that a problem?

969
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,017
No, sir.

970
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,518
Not at all.

971
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:23,568
[Geonyoung] I thought
they were just petty thieves,

972
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:27,280
but turns out those bastards
are a lot more audacious than I expected.

973
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,700
[Kitae] I'm Baek Kitae, KCIA Busan branch.
