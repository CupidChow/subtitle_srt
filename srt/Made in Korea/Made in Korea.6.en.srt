he recruited factory girls

that we should each stay
in our lane and do our jobs.

136

Meaning there are lines
we shouldn't cross.

You say that, but you seem to be…

00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,715
If we push it through,
it'll hold enough weight in court.

176
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,383
Come on, you know this already.

177
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,514
[Geonyoung sighs]

178
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,975
If you want to save your sister, sign it.

179
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,269
When you're given a chance, you take it.

180
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,021
You don't want your only sibling

181
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,899
to end up like your father, do you?

182
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,410
[Haksu] Come on, outside.

183
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,579
It's important.

184
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,423
-[Haksu] Hey.
-[Kitae] What is it?

185
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:01,012
[Haksu] I got chewed out
for pulling shit without reporting in.

186
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,933
-Orders are, let Jang go right away…
-[Kitae sighs]

187
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,976
…and focus on the Japan deal.

188
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,728
I'll take care of it.

189
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,521
[Haksu] Take care of it how exactly?

190
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,274
You know the election's
right around the corner.

191
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,653
The amount of funds we secure now
will decide the game.

192
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,988
[Kitae] That's exactly why I'm doing this.

193
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,076
I need to deal with Jang for good
to focus on the deal--

194
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,787
It looks like the prosecutors
got Chief Na on their side.

195
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,123
The higher-ups already agreed
to take Jang out of play,

196
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,084
so you just stick to business.

197
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,503
[Kitae sighs]

198
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,629
[Haksu] You know that…

199
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,299
Chief Cheon never repeats himself, right?

200
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,637
I've delivered his message then.

201
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,311
Next time, run it by me first, will you?

202
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,982
Not cool.

203
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,010
Come on out.

204
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,101
Hold still. Hey, hang on.

205
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,645
Mr. Jang.

206
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,522
The other day,

207
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,900
you asked me if I trusted Baek Kitae.

208
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,320
I thought about it,

209
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,533
and there's no reason
you and I can't get along.

210
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,663
[Geonyoung grunts]

211
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,207
You son of a bitch.

212
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,960
From now on, let's get along.

213
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,421
You get what I'm saying?

214
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,798
I'll be in touch.

215
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,385
[Geonyoung] Hey!

216
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,387
Where's Hyeeun?

217
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,681
She's fine. Don't worry.

218
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,018
[car door shuts]

219
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,952
-[footsteps approaching quickly]
-[Yejin gasps]

220
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,121
[Yejin] Mr. Jang!

221
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,418
[gasps]

222
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,922
[Jeongwon] Oh! What the heck…

223
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,091
Everything okay while I was gone?

224
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,551
Pack your stuff.

225
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,678
We're clearing out

226
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,848
and heading back to the office.

227
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,725
What are you talking about, sir?

228
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,770
No more secret investigations.

229
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,355
Mr. Jang.

230
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,941
Did something happen to you?

231
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,611
We've got plenty of work piled up
at the office.

232
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,075
From now on, we stick to our duty.

233
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,295
[Yuji] What happened with Prosecutor Jang?

234
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,464
We don't need to worry about him anymore?

235
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,592
He won't be able
to make a move anytime soon.

236
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,137
[Yuji] Hmm… All right.

237
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,430
Anyway, make sure
you deliver the goods on time.

238
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,683
My father's not as forgiving as I am.

239
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,976
I keep my promises.

240
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,229
What about the raw materials?

241
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,066
[Kitae] We can scale up production
as much as we want.

242
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,818
The problem is securing the source.

243
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,989
Breaking into the Taiwan supply line
isn't easy, either.

244
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,076
[Yuji] That's actually why I called.

245
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,162
To hit the volume I set,

246
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,206
securing a stable supply comes first.

247
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,625
Can you go overseas with me next week?

248
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,546
There's someone we need to meet in Saigon.

249
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,339
[♪ upbeat music]

250
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,676
[cars honking]

251
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,470
SAIGON, VIETNAM

252
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,307
[soldier] Why aren't they moving?

253
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,642
[honking]

254
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,937
Geez, what are they doing?

255
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,235
The mango juice here is amazing.

256
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,612
Hold on a second.

257
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,909
[in Vietnamese] Excuse me.

258
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,493
Two cups of mango juice, please.

259
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,923
[soldier, in Korean] Oh, here you go.

260
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,219
Ah…

261
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,679
Did you hear the news?

262
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,806
There was a big mess
in Nha Trang a few days ago.

263
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,350
What happened?

264
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,310
Apparently, inspectors came from back home

265
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,145
and turned the whole unit upside down.

266
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,858
You know Captain Yoon, the one who got
caught skimming supplies with US soldiers?

267
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,944
He's been ordered back home.

268
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,404
How do you even know all this?

269
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,074
Come on. I've been out here
for over two years.

270
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,160
I could call the Viet Cong
my brothers at this point.

271
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,750
[soldiers conducting drills]

272
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,057
[private] Lieutenant!

273
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,767
Sir.

274
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,144
The company commander is asking for you.

275
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,771
Someone's come from Seoul.

276
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,856
[soldier] From Seoul? Who?

277
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,650
PERSONAL RECORD
NAME: BAEK KIHYUN

278
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,820
[major] Korea Military Academy, Class 26.
Top of your class.

279
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,281
Born in Japan,

280
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,241

HEAD OF SECURITY COMMAND
MAJOR WON DONGHYEOK

282
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,453
-Your brother's with the KCIA?
-Yes, sir.

283
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,917
[Donghyeok] Man, it's hot, huh?

284
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,631
The temperature's lower than in Seoul,

285
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,009
but it's the damn humidity
that drives you crazy.

286
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,344
-Is it always like this here?
-[lighter clicks, ignites]

287
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,388
It's worse now during monsoon season.

288
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,017
Listen.

289
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,936
Do you know why I came
all the way from Seoul?

290
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,107
What about why I called you in?

291
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,067
I'm not sure, sir.

292
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,779
[Donghyeok] You were questioned
by Nam Sanguk before, right?

293
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,825
-Did he say anything about me?
-Not that I recall, sir.

294
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,162
[Donghyeok] Yeah?
Guess you two aren't that close.

295
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:46,876
Well, that prick was always stuck-up,
coming from a fancy family.

296
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,461
Good thing we shipped him off.

297
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,131
What, you didn't know?

298
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,134
That jerk got kicked out
of Security Command.

299
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,722
Anyway, you look like
you've been through some shit.

300
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,683
Probably got more sense than he does.

301
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:06,771
Though we'll have to see
if you measure up to your big brother.

302
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,607
I'm sorry, but I don't follow.

303
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,661
[Donghyeok]
I'm saying I've got a job for you.

304
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,664
What? You don't want to get promoted?

305
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,998
That's not it, sir.

306
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,085
[Donghyeok] Everyone who comes out here's
only got promotion on their mind, right?

307
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,837
Isn't that why you're out here
slaving away?

308
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,798
You'll start tomorrow.

309
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,257
I'll clear a desk for you.

310
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,552
Get your bearings for a few days,
then you'll serve under Colonel Chu.

311
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,723
You know Chu Gwangseop,
commander of the 29th Infantry Regiment?

312
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,517
Yes, I do, sir.

313
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,478
[Donghyeok] Go under him
and report every damn thing he does,

314
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,939
without leaving out a single detail.

315
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,234
Do this right,
and Nam Sanguk's former post…

316
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,363
will be yours.

317
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,004
[Giho] This is Prosecutor Jang Geonyoung,
the one I mentioned before.

318
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,382
Come on, pour him a drink.

319
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,473
I'm Jang Geonyoung.

320
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,144
Let me pour you a drink, Chief Na.

321
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,543
Even after all you've been through,
your spirit hasn't broken.

322
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,965
Mr. Jang, you're a true patriot, huh?
They're hard to come by.

323
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,718
If you support the prosecution, sir,

324
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,720
I'll bring clear proof

325
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,807
that Chief Cheon Seokjung
is backing Baek Kitae.

326
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,771
Rush in too soon,
and it'll backfire on you like last time.

327
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,275
There's one thing I learned
during my recent detention at the KCIA.

328
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,361
The evidence to bring down
Chief Cheon will come

329
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,739
straight from Baek Kitae himself.

330
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,491
How would you make that happen?

331
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,659
[Geonyoung]
First, we'll put Baek in custody…

332
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,412
-[♪ intriguing music]
-…and drive a wedge between the two.

333
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:33,375
Cheon's the kind of guy who'll cut off
his tail first when things blow up.

334
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,003
And Baek knows that well.

335
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,047
He'll do whatever he can

336
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,840
to save his own skin.

337
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,219
Like an internal conflict?

338
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,262
If you give me a chance…

339
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,641
I'll get him no matter what.

340
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,768
[Yongcheol] You may lower your head,

341
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,063
but you're not the sort
to ever bow to anyone.

342
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,357
[Giho] If you're looking
for a blade against Cheon,

343
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,983
he's not a bad choice, sir.

344
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,737
[Geonyoung clears throat]

345
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,300
[Haksu] Hey, you came.

346
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,641
What do you want? Why'd you ask to see me?

347
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,895
I just want to get closer to you.

348
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,938
Thinking of jumping ship?

349
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,405
Well, I get it. At this rate,
Baek Kitae will push you aside

350
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,949
and take Hwang's place.

351
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,868
Not you, Mr. Pyo.

352
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:34,997
You're right.

353
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,499
Let's be honest with each other.

354
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:44,381
Lately, the President seems
to be pushing Chief Cheon away.

355
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,175
Best to go with the flow, right?

356
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,971
How was your dinner with Chief Na?

357
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,142
So you're interested in him as well, huh?

358
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,645
How did you know about that?

359
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,980
Work in the KCIA for over a decade,

360
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,899
and you know everything.

361
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,196
What can I do for you?

362
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,995
When Baek Kitae handed money
over to Cheon,

363
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,332
you think that's all he did?

364
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:19,917
Or what?

365
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,211
[Geonyoung] Baek Kitae has

366
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,422
a recording of Cheon.

367
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,634
Bring it to me.

368
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,637
If you do,

369
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:33,639
it'll be you…

370
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,018
-who takes Hwang's seat.
-[♪ tense music]

371
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,020
Not Baek Kitae.

372
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,732
So?

373
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,776
How does that sound?

374
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,653
Sounds good.

375
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,450

you were going? Saigon?

377

-[Kitae] Yeah.

378
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:36,827
For how long?

379
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,871
[Kitae] Not long.

380
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,373
Just keep an eye on Jang Geonyoung for me.

381
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,168
If anything happens, call me right away.

382
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,252
[Haksu] Got it.

383
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,880
Hey, can I bum a smoke?

384
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,801
You want to live till you're old and gray.
Why start again?

385
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,764
Maybe because life's looking up.

386
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,016
Got the craving back.

387
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,559
I knew you wouldn't last forever.

388
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,688
The lighter.

389
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,316
-You can have the rest of the pack.
-[Haksu] Thanks, man.

390
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,144

So, what's the big deal?

391
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,479
Goddamn bastards.

392
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,606

Hey!

399
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,415
What the hell are you doing?

400
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,212
Sir.

401
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,964
Look at this clown.

402
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,885
Major Lee from the Anti-Communist Bureau
recommended you?

403
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,680
-Yes, sir.
-That's impressive, kid.

404
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,058
You won over someone as strict as he is.

405
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,561
Not at all, sir.
It's an honor to serve under you.

406
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,942
[Donghyeok] Colonel Chu Gwangseop.
Korea Military Academy, Class 11.

00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,819
-[♪ precarious music]
-Born in Hapcheon, South Gyeongsang-do.

-[Gwangseop] Now, get the hell in.
-Yes, sir.

409
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,739
[Donghyeok] He earned
the President's trust

410
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,533
when he was with
the Capital Garrison Command,

411
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,077
and was the first of his class
to get promoted.

412
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,745
He never cared for combat,

413
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,331
and spent his days
entertaining guests and partying.

414
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,876
Sneaking out supplies was
just routine for him.

415
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,086
The man's got quite the reputation.

416
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,465
But this time,
it's on a whole different scale.

417
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,262
There are some Vietnamese officers
colluding with local arms traffickers,

418
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,057
and we have intel that Chu's been
in frequent contact with them lately.

419

[♪ lively music playing]

420
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,211
[Yuji] There he is.

421
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,923
Soon to be our partner
who'll save us, Jason Chang.

422
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,884
He's Taiwanese-American,
and has a firm grip on the smuggling route

423
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,969
for raw materials used
to make Taiwanese meth.

424
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,348
He's been busy pushing heroin here
in Saigon the last few years, though.

425
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,102
[Jason, in English]
I'm glad you got in touch.

426
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,688
I didn't think you'd fly
all the way to Saigon.

427
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,024
As I mentioned on the call,

428
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,693
I have a partner
I really want to introduce you to.

429
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,406
Mr. Baek is in need of a large quantity
of raw materials.

430
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,992
I told him you might be able to help.

431
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,205
Well, I've never done business
with Koreans before.

432
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,751
I don't want to waste my time
on a rookie and take a risk.

433
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,294
[in Korean] It's just as I expected.

434
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,672
He's worried because you're a rookie.

435
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,301
[in English] Saigon has changed a lot.

436
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,722
American soldiers are openly doing drugs.

437
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,767
No wonder they lost the war.

438
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,560
Were you in Vietnam?

439
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,814
I was in the jungle in '65.

440
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,609
Back then, the Americans had
some sense of justice.

441
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,780
A lot of us died fighting
the Viet Cong in the jungle.

442
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,659
We, the Americans, the Viet Cong.

443
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,375
You must have made a lot of money, huh?

444
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,046
The war is coming to an end now.

445
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,841
Aren't you gonna make some money?

446
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,552

You know that, right?

463

What the Viet Cong wants
is not Korean weapons.

464
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,711
They need the M16 or heavy machine guns
the Americans use.

00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,291
-[Soyeong] Daeil!
-[Yejin] Hold still!

521
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,668
[Soyeong] No!

522
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,505
[Geonyoung] Daeil!

523
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,674
Don't make this hard!

524
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,220
-[Soyeong] Daeil!
-[Daeil panting]

525
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,473
-[Yejin] Baek Soyeong!
-[Soyeong] Let go!

526
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,976
No! Stop that!

527
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:53,146
-[Daeil] Let go of me! Let go!
-[handcuffs snap shut]

528
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,109
[Geonyoung] Kang Daeil.

529
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,029
[Geonyoung] Hey, Kang Daeil!

530
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,324
Damn it, you idiot!

531
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,617
Hey, did you just dodge?

532
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,786
You dodged? Huh?

533
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,622
Are you just stupid?

534
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,624
Or you think I'm a goddamn joke?

535
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,794
You had the fucking nerve to screw me over

536
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,754
and still show up to see Baek Soyeong?

537
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,548
[Daeil scoffs]

538
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,845
[Daeil] Well…

539
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,810
you can't do anything now anyway, right?

540
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,854
The Narcotics Unit's been shut down.

541
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:38,107
It's all over, isn't it?

542
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,776
You asshole.

543
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,738
You'll rot in prison, you son of a bitch.

544
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:48,117
I told you there's only one way for you
to get out of this alive, didn't I?

545
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,038
You don't know what you're talking about.

546
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,832
If I betray Kitae…

547
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,836
I'm dead for real.

548
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,297
Yeah, that's why… Baek Kitae, damn it.

549
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,133
That's why you should put him
behind bars with your own hands!

550
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,010
Hey! Kang Daeil!

551
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,681
Listen carefully
if you want your sentence reduced.

552
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,059
Confess to everything.
Say Baek Kitae made you do it.

553
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,353
Got it? You understand?

554
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,358
What the hell are you looking at?

555
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,485
[♪ sinister music]

556
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,746
This bastard.

557
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,585
Let me see, damn it.

558
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:46,342
You've been toying with meth,
and now you've turned into a damn junkie.

559
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,265
How many times do I have to ask?

560
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,018
You've been keeping Baek Kitae's ledgers.

561
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,311
Where are they?

562
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,688
I have no idea what you're talking about.

563
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,024
You know

564
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,028
my brother's a public official.

565
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,112
Oh, yeah?

566
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,156
Then what about the meth here?

567
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,617
Are you saying you got this on your own?

568
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:15,872
Are you seriously going to take
all the blame?

569
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,084
Why would you do that for a guy
who dragged his own sister into his mess

570
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,753
and turned her into a criminal?

571
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,381
Can I have a cigarette, please?

572
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:36,726
[Yejin] Thanks.

573
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,773
[sighs]

574
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,990
Sunyeong… Oh, right.

575
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:54,535
Ms. Oh Yejin.

576
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,623
You told me you had older brothers.

577
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,500
Was that true?

578
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,044
I only have two younger siblings.

579
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,254
[Soyeong] Well then,

580
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,298
you should know.

581
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:10,969
You see,

582
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,263
I feel sorry for my big brother.

583
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,309
Our parents died young,

584
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:22,522
and he had to feed us, clothe us,
and put us through school.

585
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,276
Do you have any idea how hard he worked?

586
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:30,530
And now…

587
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,740
[sighs]

588
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,704
…you're telling me to sell him out
just to save myself?

589
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,207
No, I'd rather die.

590
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,262
[Jeongwon] How did it go?

591
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,139
Baek Soyeong didn't even bat an eye.

592
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,308
She'd jump straight into hellfire
if he told her to.

593
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,811
Well, good thing we got
at least one of them to talk.

594
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,064
-What do you mean?
-[Jeongwon] Kang Daeil confessed.

595
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,191
Are you serious?

596
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,651
Yeah.

597
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,820
-[Yejin sighs]
-[Jeongwon sighs]

598
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,322
-[Daeil, on recording] It was all…
-[Geonyoung mumbling]

599
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,161
Kitae. He made me do it.

600
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,999
Baek Kitae's the one who suggested it.

601
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:29,464
He said we should really expand
the meth business.

602
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,591
The Ikeda clan…

603
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,220
When Manjae was alive…

604
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,139
[Daeil breathing shakily, on recording]

605
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,392
[Daeil] Soyeong doesn't know any of this.

606
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,103
I just asked her

607
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,940
to bring it to me, and she did.

608
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:49,442
That's all, I swear.

609
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,651
Mr. Jang.

610
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,904
Soyeong really doesn't know
anything, okay?

611
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,531
Promise me. She doesn't know anything.

612
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,742
She has nothing to do with this!

613
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,037
-Daeil. Daeil, I hear you.
-[Daeil] She doesn't know anything.

614
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,539
I need you to promise me. Promise me.

615
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:04,624
All right.

616
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,376
I hear you, so calm down.

617
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,214
You're doing great, okay? Just trust me.

618
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,383
Okay.

619
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,011
You're going to say the whole thing again

620
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,971
from start to finish.

621
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,307
Slowly and clearly.

622
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,602
Ready, go.

623
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,939
It was all…

624
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,986
Kitae. He made me do it.

625
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,783
-[♪ menacing music]
-Baek Kitae's the one who suggested it.

00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,838
[agent] Who the hell are you? Gangsters?

629
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:52,922
[Geonyoung] Excuse me.

630
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:56,425
Esteemed KCIA agents,

Well, screw you.

634
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,400
[Geonyoung] Yeah, well, that's the plan.

635
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,485
-Push through!
-[investigators shouting]

636

at a fellow public servant!

Goddamn it!

Who are you?

What do you think you're doing?

653
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,002

-[investigator 2] Clear the way.

[president] My fellow citizens of Busan.

664
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:32,790
Thanks to your support
in the 5th and 6th presidential elections,

665
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,877
I was elected president twice.

[crowd cheering]

00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,176
[attendant] Chief,

668
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,638
the prosecutors have arrested
Baek from the KCIA.

669
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:52,143
[president] I have always been grateful
for that support.

670
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:54,729
[aide] We just got word.

671
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,273
They've raided Chief Cheon's office too.

672
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,277
Tell them to strike hard.
No hesitation, no half measures.

673
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,946
This is our chance

674
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:09,076
to wipe out all those KCIA men
in the Blue House.

675
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,330
[president] And I…

676
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:18,127
[door swings open, shuts]

677
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,339

-[Geonyoung] Go have a smoke.

[Daeil, on recording] It was all…

Kitae. He made me do it.

[Daeil breathing shakily, on recording]

686
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,166
Baek Kitae's the one who suggested it.

He said we should really expand
the meth business.

688
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,340
There's this yakuza clan

689
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,134
Manjae tried to deal with

690
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,678
back when he was alive.

691
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,223
Baek Kitae…

692
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,937
and that woman named Ikeda Yuji…

693
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:21,816
made a deal…

694
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:29,698
Daeil seemed to care a lot
about Baek Soyeong.

695
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,743

[Geonyoung] This is the meth

702
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,441
Baek Soyeong was distributing.

703
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,317
With Kang Daeil.

704
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:07,570
It's a massive amount,

705
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,572
and we caught it.

706
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,787
Baek Soyeong and Kang Daeil

707

You get the picture now?

710
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,010
If you lock me up,

711
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,306
you think you're going
to move up in the world?

712
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,933
What are you doing this for?

713
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,978
I want to get rid of people like you

714
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,898
from this world.

715

You want to change the world?

716

That kind of thing?

717
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,490
Even if I'm gone,
the world isn't going to change.

718

[Geonyoung] Hmm…

719
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,498
When you handed the money to Chief Cheon,

720
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,417
you got that on tape, didn't you?

721
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,091
That tape.

722
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,219
Hand it over to me.

723
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,804
Otherwise, you're going to prison.

726
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,944
You think Cheon's
going to protect you? Hmm?

Baek Kitae's being questioned
at the prosecutors' office,

732
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,611
but things are not looking good, sir.

733
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,615
What about Pyo?

734
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:18,784
I can't reach him.

735
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:26,875
[Geonyoung] To him, you're just a tool
he can toss aside anytime he wants.

You know that better than anyone.

Where's the tape you recorded of him?

739
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:44,226
[Kitae] If there was such a thing,
you'd already have it.

740
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,895
You guys have already torn through

I wonder what'll happen

751

if Cheon finds out you made

a recording of him.

753
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,398
Mr. Baek, you've come this far.

754
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:15,859
Let's see it through.

755
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,759
Have you heard of the Cu Chi tunnels?

756
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:45,639
They're underground tunnels the Viet Cong
dug to take cover from US bombing.

757
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,936
They're barely big enough
for one person to squeeze through.

758
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,731
It was hard even to breathe in there.

759
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,942
[Geonyoung] What are you talking about?

760
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,820
[Kitae] Just let me finish my story.
It's not that long.

761
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,781
I've never told this to anyone before.

762
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:07,828
I'm sharing it only with you, Mr. Jang.

763

[♪ uneasy music]

764
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,379
[Kitae] My company was sent in with orders
to root out the Viet Cong hideouts.

765
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,175
Those tunnels were like a maze.

766
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,678
Hard to see ahead,

767
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,347
never knowing where a bullet
might come from.

768
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:34,396
Fear closes in, and the only thing
you can rely on is your comrades.

769
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:38,484
All you can do is follow them forward.

00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,176
It is a Viet Cong hideout, sir.

00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,720

and report back as you go.

[trooper] Sir, we've confirmed
it's a Viet Cong hideout.

777
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:15,521
We should pull out.

778
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,317
[Kitae] The guys wanted to pull out,

779
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,403
but I couldn't do that.

780
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,239
Why?

781
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,367
Because I was a soldier,

782
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,743
and soldiers follow orders.

783
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,540
I led my guys deeper

784
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,584

It was US bombing.

792
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,754
The moment they confirmed
it was a Viet Cong hideout,

793
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,089
they started the bombing.

794
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,885
Whether we lived or died
didn't matter to them.

795
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,806
After all,

796
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,227
I was just cannon fodder
for someone else's rise.

797
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,856
By sheer luck,

798
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:45,277
I barely made it out
of those tunnels alive.

799
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,282
I went straight to the battalion commander
to punch him in the face.

800
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,119
I really wanted to kill that bastard.

801
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,247
But guess what?

802
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,876
I took responsibility
for my men's deaths and stepped down,

while that bastard jumped two ranks

804
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,089

it's those with power
who change the world in the end.

All that matters to him is
whether something benefits him or not.

The President doesn't have much affection
for his dogs like you or me.

[Jeongwon] Prosecutor Jang Geonyoung met

894

[Haksu] When did you find out

925
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:24,290
I'd switched over to Jang Geonyoung?

926
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,169
[Kitae] If Cheon Seokjung finds out

927
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:30,672
you switched over to him,
what do you think he'll say?

928
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,091
Is that a threat or what?

929

[Haksu chuckles]

930

You sly bastard.

931
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,434
You used me as bait
to bring Jang Geonyoung down?

932
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,481
[Kitae] Hey, Pyo.

933
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,317
Get your act together now.

934
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,154
Stop going back and forth between sides.

prosecutors in Busan found evidence
suggesting the group had been

01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:38,197
under the protection
of a prosecutor in the Narcotics Unit.

and trafficking it to Japan,
