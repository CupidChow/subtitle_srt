1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,226
Methamphetamine. Philopon.

2
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,269
Street name, meth.

3
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,648
This wonder drug keeps you awake
and erases fear,

4
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,526
practically sending you into euphoria.

5
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,861
It was born during the war.

6
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:34,576
Soldiers high on it charged
into enemy lines without fear,

7
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,995
and it was used to force

8
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,040
conscripted laborers
into endless nights of work.

9
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,627
The real problem began after the war.

10
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,090
When liberation came
and men returned home to their families,

11
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,676
they were no longer the same.

12
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,518
A boy who had longed to see
his father again

13
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,939
was struck with fear at the sight of a man
he no longer recognized.

14
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,196
No wonder.

15
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,659
His father had come back as a meth addict.

16
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,621
Stop! Stop it!

17
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,292
Stop!

18
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,676
Jesus Christ.
What happened here?

19
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,678
Oh, it's their son.

20
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,972
-That's terrible.
-Good grief.

21
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,210
The name of the man who got
addicted to meth and killed his wife is

22
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,463
Jang Myeongho.

23
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,298
My father.

24
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,445
Here, have some.

25
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,741
When I was little, my father
would often bring home red bean buns.

26
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:25,997
I got tired of them
and said I wanted something else.

27
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,251
But he kept bringing red bean buns.

28
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,170
It wasn't until later that I realized

29
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,132
they were my mother's favorite.

30
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,557
He wasn't buying the buns

31
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,893
for me, but for her.

32
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,981
How's your mom?

33
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,984
Is she doing well?

34
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:57,946
That damn woman.

35
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,867
She's not cheating on me, is she?

36
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,415
Next time,

37
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,460
make sure you bring her.

38
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,046
Ever since he killed my mother,

39
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,924
he has been locked away
in a mental hospital.

40
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,679
Completely unaware of what he did…

41
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,141
he still asks for her.

42
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:40,989
Hyeeun!

43
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,699
Come here.

44
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,826
Come on, quick.

45
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,745
Your brother's here.

46
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,455
-My brother?
-Yeah, go on.

47
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,374
Come on, people. Pick up the pace!

48
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,293
You want to miss today's quota?

49
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,091
How have you been?

50
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,344
You know, same old.

51
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,096
I guess things will get better with time.

52
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,476
Oh, right.

53
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,394
Are you getting any better at guitar?

54
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,688
Wait, how do you know about that?

55
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,148
How would I know?

56
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,192
You told me about it last time.

57
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,819
Oh…

58
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,487
Did I?

59
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,030
So, getting better?

60
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,615
No.

61
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,659
Not really.

62
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,206
Why don't you play something?
There's a guitar.

63
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,290
What?

64
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,126
No, I don't want to. It's embarrassing.

65
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,128
What's embarrassing?

66
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,213
Give it a try.

67
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,757
But…

68
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,926
Let's see what you can do on the guitar.

69
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,889
Even if it's bad, don't make fun of me.

70
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,432
Why would I make fun of you?

71
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,319
Yang Heeeun "Morning Dew"]

72
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:50,201
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER

73
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,038
Prosecutor,
your sentencing recommendation.

74
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,499
The defendants, Robert Blunt

75
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,754
and Jimmy Walters,
entered the residence of the victims,

76
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:05,967
Kim Taeyeong and Lee Suni,
on March 2, 1970,

77
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,970
at approximately 7:30 p.m.

78
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,431
In the course
of demanding methamphetamine,

79
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,559
they brutally murdered the victims.

80
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,062
The knife and other evidence

81
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,564
recovered at the horrific crime scene

82
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,442
clearly establish their intent to kill

83
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,738
during the commission of the offense.

84
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,661
Therefore, in order
to heighten society's vigilance

85
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,413
against the dangers
of narcotics addiction,

86
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,751
the Prosecution submits the defendants
bear full criminal responsibility.

87
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,837
For the defendants,

88
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,423
Robert Blunt

89
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,592
and…

90
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,804
Jimmy Walters,

91
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,224
the Prosecution seeks a death sentence.

92
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,898
How long?

93
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,567
Five? Five years? Ten?

94
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,528
Order in the court!

95
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,244
INDICTMENT

96
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,206
The death penalty?

97
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,791
THE PROSECUTION WALKING
THE STRAIGHT PATH…

98
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,502
I thought you promised
to reduce their sentences!

99
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,089
That's why the Yanks cooperated
with the investigation!

100
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,133
"The Prosecution,

101
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,343
walking the straight path,
upholding principle."

102
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,472
I never promised.
I said I would consider it.

103
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,599
They deserve the death penalty.

104
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,853
The victims were brutally murdered
with slit throats.

105
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,063
And Lee Suni was pregnant.

106
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,065
I know. I get it.

107
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,901
You think
the Americans will just sit back?

108
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,113
-What about US-Korea relations?
-Well…

109
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,574
As I understand it,

110
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,619
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
is paying very close attention to that.

111
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:01,249
And I heard the US just set up
a federal agency called

112
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,252
the Drug Enforcement Administration
on the president's orders.

113
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,465
So why don't we make
something like that too, sir?

114
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,551
If you recommend it
to the Prosecutor General,

115
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,722
and he raises it with the President,
it could happen.

116
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,348
What have you been up to lately?

117
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,184
Why are you never at your desk?

118
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,811
Well, I'm doing
what I've always been doing, sir.

119
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,438
Yeah, so what is it?

120
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,941
-My job.
-Which is?

121
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,735
Catching criminals.

122
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,029
You know, my job.

123
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,409
If you'll excuse me, I've got work to do.

124
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,036
Hey,

125
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,205
I'm warning you again.

126
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,124
Don't go stirring up the KCIA.

127
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:48,088
Well, as long as they're not
tangled up in drugs,

128
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,215
I have no reason to.

129
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,928
I'll be going now, sir.

130
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,098
That nutjob.

131
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,227
What about the notebook?

132
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,020
There was no notebook.

133
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,691
No notebook?

134
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,527
No.

135
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,488
She said it never existed
in the first place.

136
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,582
That crazy bitch.

137
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,129
She pulled all that shit
when there wasn't even a notebook?

138
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,881
Right?

139
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,179
You were colluding
with Bae Geumji, weren't you?

140
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,646
That's why you went to Japan with her,

141
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,275
and why you met Choi Yuji?

142
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,866
You plotted it since the time…

143
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,617
…you stopped me
from killing Kang Daeil, right?

144
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,343
Hey. You run a goddamn department
at the KCIA.

145
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,263
And you're pushing drugs?

146
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,224
Huh?

147
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,814
What will people say if they find out?

148
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,482
You little shit!

149
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,278
Hey.

150
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,572
Did you think I wouldn't know?

151
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,868
You tried to fool me?

152
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,162
How dare you!

153
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,498
-Oh? Oh?
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry, sir!

154
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,626
Get off me.

155
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,462
Please give me one more chance!

156
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,882
And my life is yours.

157
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,592
You goddamn piece of shit.

158
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,470
How about 200 million?

159
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,015
I'll give you 200 million every month.

160
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,808
You must have an insane death wish.

161
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,893
Hey.

162
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,979
If anyone finds out,
we're both dead, you asshole.

163
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,731
That'll never happen.

164
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,152
Even if something were to go wrong,
we just need to get rid of Kang Daeil.

165
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,113
Sir, it's 200 million every month!

166
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,367
We could make even more down the line!

167
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,871
You don't want to spend your whole life
groveling to Chief Cheon, do you?

168
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,289
What did you just say?

169
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:32,669
I swear I'll do whatever it takes
to put you in the Blue House, sir.

170
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,636
Make it 300 million.

171
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,514
Three hundred million every month.

172
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,558
If you can't do it,

173
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,478
then just die.

174
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,081
You snitched, didn't you?
You fucking bastard!

175
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,668
Hey, what happened, huh?
I didn't snitch.

176
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,128
Come on, man. You scared me.

177
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,297
Look.

178
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,592
Hwang already knew everything, all right?

179
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,262
Jang Geonyoung
from Busan District Prosecutors' Office

180
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,140
showed up and told him
you were tied up with Kang Daeil.

181
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,310
Jang Geonyoung told him?

182
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,771
How the hell does he know?

183
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,106
Beats me, fucker.

184
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,736
Watch yourself, man.

185
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,115
Keep this up,
and you really might end up dead.

186
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,372
Let me meet Cheon Seokjung.

187
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,253
What?

188
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,255
You thought I didn't know?

189
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,635
You're the little rat he planted
to keep tabs on Hwang, aren't you?

190
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,933
How long have you known?

191
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,144
Does it matter how long I've known?

192
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,938
Does Hwang know too?

193
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,023
No.

194
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,153
Why didn't you tell him? You should have.

195
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,198
You could've gone straight to him
and said you found Cheon's mole.

196
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,534
What for? There's no need.

197
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,579
Hey… Oh…

198
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,916
I thought you were just a reckless bastard
with a fucking death wish.

199
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,754
Turns out you're a snake.

200
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,928
Cheon Seokjung.

201
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,305
I have to see him.

202
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,892
I'll pay you back plenty.

203
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,314
Baek Kitae wants to see me?

204
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,525
What for?

205
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,443
He has something to tell you.

206
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,071
How much has Hwang skimmed off?

207
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,031
About a billion, sir.

208
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,201
I see.

209
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,746
I'll think about it and let you know.

210
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,872
Yes, sir.

211
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,217
Nam Jin "In My Small Heart"]

212
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,345
Na Hoona or Nam Jin?
One, two, three!

213
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
-Na Hoona!
-Nam Jin!

214
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,514
Oh!

215
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,015
Guess you really are from Gyeongsang-do.

216
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,892
What? No. Gyeongsang-do or Jeolla-do,

217
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,936
when it comes to singing,
Hoona's the best.

218
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,563
Well, I like Jin better.

219
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,481
You silly…

220
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,566
Well, that's good.

221
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,819
You can have Jin. Hoona's mine.

222
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,490
Hey, you think we can just claim them?
Did Hoona ever say he's yours?

223
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,616
Or not. Whatever.

224
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,786
By the way, Soyeong.

225
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,622
Did you really quit your job at the bank?

226
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,125
But why? That's a great job.

227
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,377
Well, you know.

228
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,504
I'm sick of handling other people's money.

229
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,840
So, have you found something new?

230
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,968
No, I'm taking a break.

231
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,679
Your brother didn't say anything?

232
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,349
I mean, others would kill for that job.

233
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,144
Mmm. My brother would never…

234
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,354
Oh, right! Sunyeong.

235
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,357
I have to go. I've got plans.

236
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,525
What plans?

237
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,069
I'm going to see a movie.
The one with Shin Seongil!

238
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,864
Hey, I love Shin Seongil too!

239
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,534
-Can I come? Yeah?
-What? Ah…

240
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,662
-Uh…
-What is it?

241
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,998
Wait, is this a date?

242
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,959
Gosh, you catch on fast!

243
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,086
I'll call you later, okay?

244
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,005
Who's the guy? Hey!

245
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,632
Call me!

246
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,265
BOK'S KNITTING SHOP

247
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,593
Soyeong,
I'm going to use the restroom.

248
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,678
Okay.

249
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,738
Hey, Daeil.

250
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,245
It's been a while, huh?

251
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,709
Look at you out on a date.

252
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,839
If Baek Kitae finds out
his little sister's seeing a gangster,

253
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,467
you think he's going to let that slide?

254
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,138
What do you want now?

255
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,100
I did everything
you asked last time, didn't I?

256
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,435
That was then.

257
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,520
There's a new star of the show.

258
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,942
I know the score.

259
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,777
You're moving meth with Baek Kitae, right?

260
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,907
You should make it
to your sister's wedding next month.

261
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,036
And watch her marry
into that teacher's family.

262
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,955
I heard you even bought her a house.

263
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,458
Looks like you made a lot of money

264
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,585
skimming Jo Manjae's meth.

265
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,669
Huh, Daeil?

266
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,347
Call this number
when the first batch is out.

267
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,230
Mr. Jang.

268
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,107
What?

269
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,235
Let me ask you something.

270
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,113
You think you can take on
the KCIA and win?

271
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,325
Want to know what I think? You'll lose.

272
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,868
The KCIA…

273
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,579
They're number one in this country!

274
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,699
You goddamn thug.

275
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,201
Don't screw this up.

276
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,829
Call me when the first batch is out.

277
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,392
Jang Geonyoung,
Busan District Prosecutors' Office.

278
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,977
This is Baek Kitae.

279
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:35,109
It's been a while. So, what made you call?

280
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,318
Have you had dinner yet?

281
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,404
Not yet.

282
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,322
Good. Would you care to join me?

283
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,993
You mentioned pork and rice soup before.

284
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,537
There's a local spot
called the Miryang House.

285
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,498
The broth there is nice and rich.

286
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,292
Actually,
why don't you come here?

287
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,587
There's a good place
right across from my office.

288
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,715
We can order in
and have a nice, quiet dinner here.

289
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,719
Everyone's gone for the day,
so no need to worry.

290
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,140
All right.
I'll be there by 8:00 p.m.

291
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,729
Here.

292
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,910
This is nice.

293
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:14,083
So, why did you want to see me?

294
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,585
Well, we said
we'd grab a meal sometime.

295
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,505
I thought I'd make good on it
and also pay my respects properly.

296
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,507
Respects? Come on. By the way…

297
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,928
You've got a certain vibe. You know that?

298
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,514
What do you mean?

299
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,308
Like right now. You're polite.

300
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:32,393
Too polite.

301
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,395
I'll take that as a compliment.

302
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,355
Compliment? As if.

303
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,984
I'm saying you've got that
KCIA feel, you know?

304
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,278
Gentleman up front,

305
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,488
but savage in the back.

306
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,116
Two-faced, like Janus.

307
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:51,078
It looks like I've upset you
over Jo Manjae, Mr. Jang.

308
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,997
I'm glad you know!

309
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,876
I hope you don't hold onto it.

310
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,211
Let's clear the air today.

311
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,130
Fine.

312
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,631
So,

313
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,675
did you guys catch Jo Manjae?

314
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,177
He's gone missing.

315
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,764
Missing?

316
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,392
He disappeared.

317
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,979
Well, someone claims they saw him
in the Philippines, but…

318
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,107
He's dead.

319
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,651
Who, Jo Manjae?

320
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,779
Yes. You know,

321
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:29,199
there was a time this whole city
was flooded with Jo's meth.

322
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,411
It even stirred things up
across the water in Japan.

323
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:36,123
But the meth's all dried up now.

324
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,792
He suddenly disappeared, you say?

325
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,503
Jo Manjae, the hotshot?

326
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,381
Why?

327
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,550
He must've been killed.

328
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,803
Who killed him?

329
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,987
We'll talk about it next time.

330
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,367
So, why'd you join the KCIA, Mr. Baek?

331
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,576
To serve the country.

332
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,455
Serve the country? Oh…

333
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,627
Hey, you want to hear a funny story?

334
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,088
What's the story?

335
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:29,218
I once busted a meth dealer back in Seoul.
Mmm?

336
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,095
And this idiot said his dream was

337
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,056
to export meth to Japan,

338
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,559
earn some foreign currency,
and flood all of Japan with Korean meth.

339
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,479
He said,
"If that's not patriotism, what is?"

340
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:46,735
You see, patriotism comes in many forms.

341
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,488
That's funny.

342
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,034
Let me tell you another funny story.

343
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:55,953
Mr. Baek.

344
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,373
I don't care

345
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,166
if it's the KCIA

346
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,669
or whoever pulls their strings.

347
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,130
If you want to take me on,

348
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,424
you'd better be ready.

349
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,970
I don't break easily.

350
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,310
I have no idea what you're talking about.

351
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,229
Mr. Jang.

352
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,983
Man, the timing couldn't be worse.

353
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,695
You know Jang Hyeeun, right?

354
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,239
She works at a dye factory
in Gimpo, Gyeonggi-do.

355
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,243
Apparently, she joined a guitar club,

356
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:40,622
but we got intel the guitar instructor
has been taking funds from the North.

357
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,961
You'd better tell your sister
to get out of there quickly.

358
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,852
Should I be thanking you?

359
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,437
There's no need.

360
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,815
You and I both work for the government.

361
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,109
We should help one another, shouldn't we?

362
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,449
Your brother graduated top
of his Military Academy class?

363
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,827
But I heard back in high school,

364
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,873
Baek Kihyun got mixed up
in a pretty big incident.

365
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,127
Why bring up my family out of nowhere?

366
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:28,629
No, it's just,

367
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:34,259
since you were kind enough
to take an interest in mine,

368
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:39,139
I thought I'd return the favor with yours.

369
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,974
You really want to know?

370
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,270
Not if it puts you on the spot.

371
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,068
Guess it does. Hmm.

372
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,072
Let me throw another one at you then.

373
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,492
That light up there.

374
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,040
And over here!

375
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,378
And this.

376
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,673
Well?

377
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,511
Is this serving the country too? Hmm?

378
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,306
Is the KCIA wiretapping a prosecutor
your idea of serving the country?

379
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,816
Mr. Jang Geonyoung.

380
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,069
This is getting nowhere.

381
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,158
Thanks for dinner.

382
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,913
Mr. Baek Kitae!

383
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,456
You'll see me again! Count on it!

384
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,757
"Serving the country"?

385
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,242
Pull the wiretap team out
and get the Jang Hyeeun file ready.

386
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,202
Yes, sir.

387
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,000
Did you say Jang Geonyoung's father is
in a mental hospital?

388
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,961
Yes.
A municipal psychiatric hospital in Daegu.

389
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,174
That family has its share of troubles.

390
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,242
How many kilos?

391
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,410
Twenty kilos.

392
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,287
Twenty kilos?

393
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,666
-Is it going to Japan?
-Osaka.

394
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,252
-Who in Osaka?
-Ikeda Yuji.

395
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,004
Ikeda Yuji?

396
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,923
Are you talking about the Ikeda clan
in Osaka? The yakuza?

397
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,509
Baek's delivering it himself?

398
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,094
Yes.

399
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,764
When?

400
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,268
The 13th.

401
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,979
5:00 a.m., Yeongdo.

402
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,523
The 13th.

403
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,902
5:00 a.m., Yeongdo.

404
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,167
The only ship going
from Yeongdo, Busan to Osaka

405
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,710
on the 13th is the Mangeum.

406
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,295
The Mangeum, huh?

407
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,631
But word is, it's actually a KCIA ship.

408
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,345
Those bastards
are really going all in, huh?

409
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,347
Good.

410
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,309
When will it arrive in Osaka?

411
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,810
The next afternoon.

412
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,104
Ms. Oh, you said you speak Japanese?

413
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,899
Yes, I learned it in school.

414
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,234
Book the plane tickets
and hotel rooms right away.

415
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:02,444
Yes, sir. I will.

416
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,322
Mr. Kim, we don't have much time,
but gather everything you can

417
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,908
on the Ikeda clan,
the one Baek Kitae's dealing with.

418
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,992
Yes, sir. Got it.

419
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,745
All right! We're flying to Osaka.

420
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,873
We'll get there first and tail Baek Kitae.

421
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,708
And sir, here.

422
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,919
That thing you asked about before.

423
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,796
There's nothing special.

424
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,216
He's on leave from SNU's art department,
no history in the student movement.

425
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,300
Clean record.

426
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,094
- KIM MINSU
- MALE,- 29

427
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,679
You said he's
your sister's guitar instructor, right?

428
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,607
So the meth is ready?

429
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,360
Yes, sir.

430
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,195
How many kilos?

431
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,738
Twenty kilos.

432
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,075
Oh… Here.

433
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,084
Kitae.

434
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,418
Yes, sir.

435
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,171
How long have we known each other?

436
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:06,800
About ten years, sir.

437
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,011
Wow.

438
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,763
Ten years?

439
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,765
Time really flies.

440
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,734
Hey, send Pyo in.

441
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,031
Osaka, did you say?

442
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,741
Yes.

443
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,536
All right. You're going to be
on a tight schedule,

444
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,372
so take care of yourself, yeah?

445
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,292
And while you're there,
pick up a bottle of whiskey.

446
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:44,212
We'll drink ourselves under the table
when you get back.

447
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,047
Yes, sir.

448
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,515
-Come, have a seat.
-Yes, sir.

449
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,229
Baek's taking the meth to Japan.

450
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,898
You should go with him.

451
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:03,982
Yes, sir.

452
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,363
-What?
-Nothing, sir.

453
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,241
All right. Cheers.

454
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,035
Have a safe trip.

455
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,420
You can go now.

456
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,468
I'll see you when I get back, sir.

457
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,552
All right.

458
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,316
Any particular reason
you're sending me with him?

459
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,528
He says he's delivering 20 kilos
to Chairman Ikeda.

460
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,280
-Right.
-Keep a close eye on him.

461
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,365
Yes, sir.

462
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,756
Tell Choi Yuji
I want to meet her in private.

463
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,840
Yes, sir.

464
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,969
Let's get rid of him.

465
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,016
Baek Kitae.

466
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,811
The way he looks at me…

467
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,690
isn't the same anymore.

468
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,778
Take care of him

469
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,531
on the ship back to Korea.

470
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,449
Yes, sir.

471
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,166
The way he looks at me…

472
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,712
isn't the same anymore.

473
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,717
Take care of him…

474
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,304
on the ship back to Korea.

475
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:24,873
OSAKA, JAPAN

476
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:29,002
Here is
last month's balance sheet, Father.

477
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,300
I believe you'll be pleased,

478
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:39,095
but if it falls short, please guide me.

479
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,765
I hear Kimura

480
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:47,395
and the other executives
have been talking.

481
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,939
You've heard already?

482
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:54,235
You know it's hard to keep
the factories running in Japan now.

483
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,321
Korea's our only option now.

484
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,782
The quality of the sample is solid too.

485
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,536
It may still be too soon.

486
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,749
Don't you trust me, Father?

487
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,841
Yeah,
you had that same look in your eyes…

488
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,887
the first time I saw you.

489
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,722
Still,

490
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:27,227
you seemed too good to be serving others.

491
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,354
And I'm always grateful to you.

492
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,816
If so, keep your head on straight.

493
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,530
Unless you want to go back to that life.

494
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,952
You need to earn their trust

495
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,621
with your own ability,

496
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,749
not because you're my daughter.

497
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,961
If you can't get things done
without me stepping in,

498
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:58,883
there's no reason to put you out front.

499
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:01,970
Yes, sir.

500
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,557
I'll make sure
you have nothing to worry about.

501
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,562
That'd be good.

502
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,191
I do think of you as my own.

503
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,737
But for the sake of the clan,

504
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,363
sometimes

505
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,034
one must spill their own child's blood…

506
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,041
Are you all right?

507
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,835
Should I call Dr. Miura?

508
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,930
A bath. Just draw me a bath.

509
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:50,727
Yes, sir.

510
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,939
HOTEL FUKI

511
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,235
The budget's a little tight.

512
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,073
But I didn't know
it was this kind of place.

513
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,336
Excuse me…

514
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,172
I booked two rooms.

515
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,591
It says it's one room.

516
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,760
-That can't be.
-What's wrong?

517
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,179
Oh…

518
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,598
She says only one room is booked.

519
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,642
I clearly booked two.

520
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,685
Just ask for one more room then.

521
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:33,770
Okay.

522
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,191
Well… we'd like one more room, please.

523
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,151
I'm very sorry.

524
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,864
With the Osaka Expo going on,
we have no vacancies.

525
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:46,658
Expo?

526
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,535
Expo?

527
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:49,619
Expo.

528
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,247
She says there's no room.

529
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,331
Man…

530
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,673
Oh, boy.

531
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,901
-Hello?
-Mr. Jang?

532
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,694
Yeah. Go ahead.

533
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,030
Sir, Baek Kitae just left on the ship.

534
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,114
Really?

535
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,949
But some guy got on with him.

536
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,659
Okay, got it.

537
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,411
Yeah.

538
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,038
Wait. Listen.

539
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,497
-Wait…
-Don't hang up yet.

540
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,582
Let's talk a little more.

541
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,334
I'm hearing some kind of noise.

542
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,336
-Noise?
-Are you doing something?

543
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,879
No, what would I be doing?

544
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,213
I hear some weird…

545
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:27,133
What do you… Gosh,
that's enough. I'm hanging up now.

546
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,135
Okay. Good night, sir.

547
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,219
Was that Mr. Kim?

548
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,474
Yeah.

549
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,269
He said Baek Kitae left on the ship,

550
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,730
but he wasn't alone.

551
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,732
Who's with him?

552
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:46,694
We don't know.

553
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,407
THE MANGEUM

554
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,695
Boss!

555
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,375
Boss.

556
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,586
Hurry it up!

557
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,427
Boss!

558
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,971
Boss!

559
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,973
-Back to work!
-Yes, sir!

560
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,143
It may look like just a fish market,

561
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:05,857
but this one distribution network delivers
meth to every dinner table across Japan.

562
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,093
Boss.

563
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,762
I'm hungry.
Want to go grab a bite to eat?

564
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,057
How about a drink?
We closed the deal on good terms.

565
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:26,354
If you don't mind, there's somewhere
I'd like to go with Mr. Baek alone.

566
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:37,865
Go.

567
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,786
-Let's go!
-Yes, sir!

568
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,801
-Boss!
-Boss!

569
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:07,603
KOREATOWN, OSAKA

570
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,917
I thought you were hungry.

571
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,002
What are we doing here?

572
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,920
This is where I grew up.

573
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,716
My lifelong goal was to get out of here,

574
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,093
but I could never forget the food.

575
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,304
-The hibiscus flower's bloomed!
-Got you! Run!

576
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,847
Run!

577
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,308
DON'T BE FOOLED BY PROPAGANDA!

578
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,437
Actually, I grew up here too.

579
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:58,696
Nice broth.

580
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,367
When did you move to Japan?

581
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,120
When I was little,
about nine years old.

582
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,330
What about you?

583
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,290
I was born here.

584
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,711
We might've crossed paths here back then.

585
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:19,592
Come to think of it,
I think I remember seeing you.

586
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,929
When did you go back to Korea?

587
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,181
When I was 19,
after my father passed away.

588
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,391
We moved to Busan, my mother's hometown.

589
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,727
The next year, my mother passed too.

590
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,396
So, I was busy providing
for my younger siblings.

591
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,608
Must've been rough.

592
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,236
Family, right?

593
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,405
Can't win with or without them.

594
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:47,703
I thought
I'd at least stop hearing "Chosenjin".

595
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,332
But instead,
I got called "Jap" all the time.

596
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:54,877
So sick of it.

597
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,800
The food was great. I'll see you again.

598
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,718
Thank you.

599
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,058
I need a partner
who can produce

600
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,810
much larger volumes on a steady basis.

601
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,730
Right now, you're still small-time
in this business.

602
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:19,360
I can't help but doubt
how much you can actually put out.

603
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,115
How much exactly do you want?

604
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:26,200
Ten times the amount now.

605
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,995
-That would cover all of Japan--
-That's right.

606
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:32,957
I need enough supply
to swallow up all of Japan in one go.

607
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:37,586
That's the only way
I'll have the power to crush

608
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,798
that greedy old man once and for all.

609
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,303
I shut down our factory
on the outskirts of Osaka not long ago.

610
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:48,431
It had a stock
of the finest Taiwanese precursors.

611
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,851
With that, you'll have more than enough
to hit the quota I gave you.

612
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,520
You're saying
you'll hand me the raw material?

613
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:56,564
At what price?

614
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,691
Don't worry.
I'll consider it an investment.

615
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,446
But make sure you secure a steady pipeline
of precursors from Taiwan soon.

616
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,199
I can't keep covering for you every time.

617
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,243
I never asked you to.

618
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:14,248
You're right.
Maybe I just want to see you.

619
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,252
Are you coming on to me?

620
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:33,225
Sir, the deal went through smoothly.

621
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,604
And did you talk to Choi Yuji?

622
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,147
Yes, sir. I did.

623
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,775
When are you coming back?

624
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,651
We'll be on our way now.

625
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,113
Take good care of Baek Kitae.

626
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,698
Yes, sir. I will.

627
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,955
HWANG GUKPYEONG, KCIA

628
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,354
How much is that?

629
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,649
Comes out to about 300 million won.

630
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,068
I see.

631
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,571
You can buy 100 apartments with that.

632
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,534
Name your price.

633
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,558
PORT OF BUSAN, KOREA

634
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,861
Man, if Pyo Haksu is in on it too,

635
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:10,114
that means the KCIA is running meth
on an organized scale.

636
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,784
At this point,
Hwang must be in on it too, right?

637
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:15,286
I guess so.

638
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,250
-Here they come.
-They're coming out.

639
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,334
They're coming out.

640
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:25,671
-That's Pyo Haksu. He's out.
-All right, get ready.

641
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,715
-Get ready.
-Hey, get ready.

642
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:28,799
Get ready.

643
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,260
Wait. But I don't see Baek Kitae.
Baek's not here.

644
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,889
Oh? Baek Kitae's not here.

645
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,391
Wait, hold position.

646
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,809
Hold position.

647
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:39,894
Hold position.

648
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,938
Stay sharp and stand by.

649
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,358
-Car! Incoming!
-Get down!

650
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,531
Damn, that scared me.

651
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,367
Isn't that Director Hwang's car?

652
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:56,452
Yes, it is.

653
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,913
-What's he doing here?
-What's going on?

654
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,707
-The cash?
-In the bags, sir.

655
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,377
-Nice work.
-Yes, sir.

656
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,884
Wait,
but Baek Kitae hasn't come out yet.

657
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:13,677
Where is he?

658
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:15,804
-Why isn't that bastard coming out?
-Damn it.

659
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,226
What? They're turning around.

660
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,269
-Wait. Why are they leaving?
-They're leaving.

661
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,438
-They're coming! Down!
-What about Baek Kitae?

662
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:27,399
-Hide! They're coming! Down!
-Why are they leaving without him?

663
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,322
They left.

664
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,535
But Baek Kitae's…
Sir, what do we do?

665
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:38,619
Baek…

666
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,412
Okay. Well…

667
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:43,040
Stay hidden and watch the Mangeum closely.

668
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,709
Make sure you see if Baek Geum…
Baek… Baek Kitae gets off!

669
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,712
What about Baek Kitae?

670
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,590
All taken care of, sir.

671
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:54,593
Geez.

672
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,306
And what did Choi Yuji say?

673
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,978
We had a good talk.
She said she'd get in touch with us soon.

674
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:08,357
-Take down Kang Daeil and seize the gang.
-Yes, sir.

675
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,401
And run the factory yourself.

676
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,569
Yes, sir. Understood.

677
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,990
Kitae, you fool.

678
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,131
What happened with Baek Kitae?

679
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,596
He hasn't gotten off the ship yet.

680
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,224
Listen, you can't lose him!
Watch closely!

681
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,227
Sir, Baek Kitae…

682
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:47,563
What?

683
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,648
Baek Kitae, what?

684
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,441
Oh, no.

685
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,735
Hey, hey, hey!

686
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:40,783
Hey, what the heck? What's happening?

687
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:15,651
Stop!

688
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,155
What the hell is this?

689
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,828
They had to raise hell
with a goddamn ritual today of all days?

690
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:28,789
Give me.

691
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:31,291
-Wait here.
-Yes, sir.

692
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,345
-Did Baek Kitae…
-Yes?

693
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,140
…say anything to you?

694
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,144
He just groveled and begged for his life.

695
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:58,569
I'll be here, sir.

696
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:51,997
God, those bastards.

697
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,333
Where the hell did they go?

698
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:57,711
Damn it.

699
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,041
There.

700
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,781
Stop!

701
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:09,950
Oh, dear.

702
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,286
Stop!

703
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:33,432
What the hell?

704
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:42,858
Sunja!

705
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,030
You can't do this!

706
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,302
Fucking bastards.

707
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,487
What the hell is going on here?

708
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,323
You!

709
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,741
What the hell are you doing?

710
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,910
Stop fighting!

711
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,079
Wait, hey! Stop them!

712
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,622
Come on, stop them!

713
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,253
-You goddamn vermin.
-Wait, wait…

714
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:51,218
THE HALL OF ULTIMATE BLISS

715
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,258
Hey! You!

716
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,229
Kitae.

717
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:13,049
Ms. Oh, start searching outside!

718
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:37,616
Director Hwang.

719
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,493
What happened here?

720
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,708
Hmm?

721
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,135
Ambulance.

722
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:41,221
Ambulance!

723
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,281
The phone!

724
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,241
Where's the phone?

725
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,857
Hello? This is Jang Geonyoung
from Busan District Prosecutors' Office.

726
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,484
I'm in Bansong, Haeundae.

727
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:39,988
Someone's in critical condition here,
so send an ambulance right now.

728
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:43,116
I'm here in Bansong… It's… A temple!

729
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,451
I'm at a temple!

730
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,661
The name of the temple?
I don't know! What?

731
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:50,415
There are five temples in this area?
Then send an ambulance

732
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,750
-to all five!
-Fire!

733
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,293
-Fire!
-Fire!

734
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,004
-Call the fire department!
-Fire!

735
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,465
-What the hell?
-Fire!

736
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,718
Fire! Fire! Fire!

737
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,053
Watch out!

738
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,473
Water. Oh, water.

739
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,021
Okay. All right, move! Move out!

740
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:24,199
Okay, okay.

741
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:27,285
Oh, no! Stay back! It's dangerous!
