I'm already at the Ziyun Room.

Well,

192
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,700
Nie Xiaofei tried everything

193
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,460
to get you
to come to her birthday party.

194
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,380
Given that

195
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,220
she's a hopeless romantic,

196
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,340
she probably wants to get close to you.

197
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,380
She probably does.

198
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,700
Song Zhizhi's spilling wine
is suspicious.

199
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,220
Look into it.

200
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,380
Alright.

I'm helping you.

Why are you two together?

Please tell us.

Hello, everyone.

And I am Nie Xiaofei's mother.

Since her debut,

224
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,620
she has received your attention
and support.

Today's birthday party

I do not wish to see any reports

230

I apologize.

I have my own reasons

243
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,660
for forcibly keeping you here.

To get this footage,

255
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,460
I had to
go through security verification,

follow legal procedures,

257
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,740
and comply with hotel regulations.

to finally get it.

was clearly trying to set you up.

got put together.

doesn't Song Zhizhi like Yi Wenhan?

She even broke off her engagement
with you for him.

269
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,140
It seems the Song family

270
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,660
isn't as peaceful as it appears.

271

But this works in our favor.

You're my sister.

Zhizhi, it's not like that.

302
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,820
No, it's a misunderstanding.

303
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,060
What misunderstanding?

304
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,060
What do you expect me to believe?

305
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,860
That you weren't

Since we were kids,

310
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,580
I've let you have everything you wanted.

311
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,580
But Yi Wenhan
is your future brother-in-law.

312
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,580
Don't you have
the slightest bit of morality?

313
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,500
No, Zhizhi,
it really is a misunderstanding.

314
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,500
Of course it is.

315
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,940
I misunderstood
that you loved me wholeheartedly.

316
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,660
To marry you,

317
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,260
I even sacrificed
the Song family's reputation

318
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,740
to break off the engagement
with the Ji family.

319
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,140
And you?

320
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,700
You thought I was a pushover?

321
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,380
No, I didn't.

322
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,580
I'm a jewelry designer.

323
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,500
I knew all along that the necklace
you gave me was fake.

324
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,860
But I still treasured it.

325
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,900
Because I knew you didn't have money.

326
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,420
As long as it was from you,

327
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,260
I didn't mind.

328
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,620
I'm sorry.

all this time,

332
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,340
I thought you had shown me genuine love.

333
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,700
Now I finally see you for who you are.

334
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,980
You're disgusting.

335
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,460
You don't deserve me.

336
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
Sorry.

337
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,700
I'm sorry, really.

338
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,180
It really is a misunderstanding.

339
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,340
I can explain everything.

340
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,340
It is a misunderstanding!
