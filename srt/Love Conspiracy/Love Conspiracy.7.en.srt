you threw up
all over Baijian's clothes yesterday.

42

And it was so late.

Zhizhi,

55
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,540
I need to have a word with you.

56
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,900
You

57
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,180
are a girl from a well-respected family.

58
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,900

You worried your grandmother and father,

63
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,700
and troubled Baijian to bring you back.

64
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,180
It's

65
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,860
rather undignified.

66

Mr. and Mrs. Song,

67
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,540
to be honest,

68
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,500
neither Zhizhi nor I
are irresponsible people.

69
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,700
We're working on rebuilding
our relationship.

70
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,780

97
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,860
I couldn't say much

98
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,580

103
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,340
I got carried away
and had a few too many drinks.

104
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,820
Baijian happened to be there.

105
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,300
He took care of me the whole time.

106
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,660
That's wonderful.

107
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,940

112
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,340

She left first thing this morning.

119

before I went to bed last night.

120
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,060
Maybe

121
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,980
she went to bed
even earlier than you did.

122
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,540
She woke up early this morning

123
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,020

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,740
Dad, I was just drunk.

190
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,900
Grandma, Dad, Mom, please believe me.

191
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,020
I was really drunk.

192
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,460
I didn't know anything.

193
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,500
Xiaofei,

194
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,380
you know exactly

195
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,020
the history between Yi Wenhan and me.

196
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,380
How could you do this?

197
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,580
You're just trying to

198
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,980
ruin our family's reputation!

199
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,860
Yeah! You...

200
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,620
I... I didn't.

201
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,980
You're still denying?

202
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,500
It's all on camera!

203
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,780
So indecent.

204
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,340
And you! Nie Wenzhi!

205
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,380
When you married into this family,

206
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,260
I took pity on you two.

207
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,140
All I asked was for you

208
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,980
to behave properly.

209
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,140
But now...

210
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,420
If you can't even do that,

211
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,460
then get out!

212
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,140
Mom.

213
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,220
Mom, you're right.

214
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,340
I failed as a mother!

215
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,620
Mom, don't hit yourself. Mom!

216
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,580
I know I was wrong.

217
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,700
I'll punish Xiaofei hard.

218
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,380
I'll make sure she never forgets!

219
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:18,860
Mom.

220
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,260
We know we were wrong.

221
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,980
I'm sorry, honey.

222
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,860
I know I was wrong.

223
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,860
I'm really sorry, Mom.

224
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,180
Crying won't help.

225
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,300
Fix this mess now!

226
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,740
Dad, have a seat.

227
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,380
Grandma, Dad,

228
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,020
the scandal is already out there.

229
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,380
It'll be very difficult to suppress now.

230
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,740
I'll contact the company

231
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,380
to handle the crisis PR.

232
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,060
The priority right now

233
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,140
is to minimize the impact this has

234
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,780
on our company

235
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,660
and our family's reputation.

236
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,100
Yes, Zhizhi is right.

237
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,940
The most important thing now

238
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,020
is to protect the company

239
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,020
and our family's reputation.

240
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,740
We can deal

241
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,460
with Xiaofei's matter privately
and take our time with it.

242
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,380
Aunt Wenzhi,

243
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,220
I disagree.

244
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,300
One should fix what they've messed up.

245
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,260
We need Xiaofei to explain

246
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,580
what happened.

247
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,020
Only then can we address it properly.

248
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,540
Crying, that's all you do!

249
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,660
What were you thinking before?

250
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,300
Tell us everything now!

251
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,940
Dad, I really don't know.

252
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,060
Grandma, I don't remember anything.

253
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,140
Won't talk, huh?

254
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,460
Then don't blame me for being harsh.

255
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,780
Aunt Wenzhi, Xiaofei,

256
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,780
get up.

257
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,300
Get up.

258
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,420
Thank you, Mom.

259
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,020
Grandma,

260
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,940
I just thought about it.

261
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,860
I feel like something's off about this.

262
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,020
In the video,

263
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,540
Xiaofei was pinned against the wall.

264
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,300
And she insists
she doesn't remember anything.

265
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,420
Even if someone is drunk,

266
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,780
they shouldn't be
completely passive like that.

267
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,500
Is it possible

268
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,980
Xiaofei was set up?

269
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,180
While she was completely out of it,

270
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,100
Yi Wenhan took advantage...

271
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,300
It's possible.

272
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,060
Very possible.

273
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,380
It must be Yi Wenhan.

274
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,180
He's probably held a grudge against us

275
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,660
because of what happened before.

276
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,900
So

277
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,260
he set Xiaofei up while she was drinking

278
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,460
to get back at us!

279
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,260
Wenzhi.

280
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,900
Call the police.

281
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,900
Yes, call the police, Aunt Wenzhi.

282
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,580
Mom.

283
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,780
I'm not against calling the police.

284
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,340
I'm just worried it'll blow this up.

285
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,140
Aunt Wenzhi,

286
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,460
why are you hesitating?

287
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,860
Xiaofei doesn't remember anything.

288
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,580
She was clearly set up.

289
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,380
And Yi Wenhan is scum.

290
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,460
He just did this to me,

291
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,980
and now he's targeting Xiaofei!

292
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,860
I'm not hesitating.

293
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,180
I'm just thinking

294
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,180
calling the police will blow this up.

295
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,900
If we don't have solid evidence,

296
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,620
we'll just become a laughingstock.

297
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,220
The most important thing now

298
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,620
is to get that entertainment news
taken down

299
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,460
and calm the public.

300
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,860
Once things die down,

301
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,820
we can look for evidence.

302
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,780
Aunt Wenzhi,

303
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,380
suppressing the news

304
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,060
might seem like
it lessens the impact on us,

305
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,060
but it actually confirms
that the Song family's daughter

306
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,260
behaved improperly!

307
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,860
This incident

308
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,060
has already affected our family.

309
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,140
But it's not irreparable.

310
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,020
If we can prove

311
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,380
Xiaofei was framed,

312
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,580
we become the victims.

313
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,220
That way,

314
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,940
people will see us

315
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,300
as a family that would rather
take a hit to our reputation

316
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,100
than compromise our girl's dignity.

317
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,380
It could actually win us sympathy.

318
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,140
And if Yi Wenhan

319
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,460
really did something,

320
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,300
there must be evidence.

321
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,660
Xiaofei.

322
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,300
Don't worry.

323
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,220
We'll make this right for you.

324
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,340
Zhizhi's analysis makes sense.

325
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,060
I've made up my mind.

326
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,180
Call the police.

327
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:06,900
Mom.

328
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,460
I have no problem with that.

329
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,700
Zhizhi makes a good point.

330
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,220
But it's too risky.

331
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,220
Actually, it's okay for Xiaofei

332
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,260
to endure a bit of injustice
for our family.

333
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,660
We don't need to sacrifice Xiaofei

334
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,300
to protect our family's reputation.

335
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,180
Besides, this issue must be resolved

336
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,700
to avoid future trouble.

337
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,060
If it's brought up again
and used against us,

338
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,660
the damage could be even greater.

339
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,740
And as a woman,

340
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,340
I can't bear to see Xiaofei
suffer like this.

341
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,340
Aunt Wenzhi,

342
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,740
you're Xiaofei's mother.

343
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,540
You must want

344
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,460
justice for her, right?

345
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,940
Yes, yes.

346
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,700
Call the police.

347
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,060
Call the police.

348
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:01,780
Call...

349
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,180
Why are you still hesitating?

350
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,420
Did you never intend to

351
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,380
call the police in the first place?

352
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,220
Zhizhi is right.

353
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,580
Call the police.

354
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,540
Alright, I'll call the police.

355
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,180
I'll call.

356
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,860
Hello, is this 110?

357
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,860
I want to report!

358
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,300
Our family...

359
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,500
Hello?

360
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,220
- Xiaofei!
- Xiaofei!

361
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,300
- Xiaofei!
- Xiaofei!

362
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,740
Honey, Xiaofei fainted.

363
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,380
Xiaofei.

364
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,340
Mom, do you think

365
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,020
Song Zhizhi switched my drink
and Wenhan's?

366
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,980
Mom, what do we do?

367
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,580
I'm scared.

368
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,700
Drugged?

369
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,100
Think you're clever, huh?

370
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,900
Do you realize your recklessness

371
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,900
almost got us thrown out?

372
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,340
And now

373
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,300
your brother might face charges!

374
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,020
I didn't mean to!

375
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,420
I was just trying to help him
