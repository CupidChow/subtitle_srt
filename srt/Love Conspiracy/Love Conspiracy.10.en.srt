00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,660
When she comes next time,

189
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,100
I want to get a good look at her.

190
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,780
That girl has had it hard enough.

191
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,940
You're all so busy with work.

192
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,900
Can't be there with her.

193
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,980
She's always alone.

194
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,180
Ms. Wu,

195
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,620
what's wrong with Grandma?

196
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,300
She doesn't recognize me.

197
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,900
She must have had a shock.

198
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,220
Her emotions have been very unstable.

199
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,460
Her memory comes and goes too.

200
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,020
So can she recover?

201
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,980
It's hard to say.

202
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,900
The doctors said

203
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,220
giving her a comfortable,
peaceful environment,

204
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,820
along with medication,

205
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,380
can hopefully keep her condition

206
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,140
from getting worse.

207
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,480
[Dad]

208
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,860
Hey, Dad?

209
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,400
I asked you to look into

210
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,280
the rough gemstone purchase
from back then.

211
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,140
Where did you disappear to?

212
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,140
I had a last-minute business trip.

213
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,980
I'll be back later.

214
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,900
Mom.

215
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,500
It's been so long.

216
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,740
Why can't I announce

217
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,580
that Wenhan and I have broken up?

218
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,580
Look, my posters got taken down.

219
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,100
My fans are leaving.

220
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,980
They say I'm boy-crazy
and have no ambition.

221
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,460
Xiaofei,

222
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,020
this is a critical period
for your brother's fight

223
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,140
with Song Zhizhi for control.

224
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,100
We can't afford
any negative media attention.

225
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,340
I promise you,

226
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,740
once things calm down,

227
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,740
the endorsements will come your way.

228
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,740
But Mom, my career is also on the rise.

229
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,340
Xiaofei, you're great in every way,

230
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,820
but you're just too self-centered.

231
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,980
Your career is important, of course.

232
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,500
But isn't our family's happiness
more important?

233
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,380
Fine.

234
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,700
I'll help you get in touch

235
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,500
with some overseas agencies.

236
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,580
But are these
so-called overseas connections

237
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,740
really useful?

238
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,660
What can your mere acquaintances

239
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,900
from the parties really do?

240
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,420
Whether my connections
are useful or not

241
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,780
isn't for you to decide.

242
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,300
Your job right now is
to support your brother

243
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,940
and help us succeed in our plan.

244
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:40,980
Understood?

245
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,580
Since you won't help me,

246
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,500
I'll figure it out myself.

247
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,220
Have something to eat.

248
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,940
Ms. Wu brought it.

249
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,860
With Grandma like this,

250
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,260
how can I have an appetite?

251
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,580
Being back here

252
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,780
reminds me of when I was little,

253
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,060
with Dad, Zhiyan,

254
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,820
and Grandma.

255
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,460
Such happy times.

256
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,500
But

257
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,260
how did it all turn out like this?

258
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,020
I understand how you feel.

259
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,980
I've been there.

260
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,380
My mother was a very gentle

261
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,900
and kind person.

262
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,660
But I lost her in an accident.

263
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,060
I couldn't accept it at the time.

264
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,220
I even felt like life had lost
all meaning.

265
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,300
But later, I came to realize it.

266
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,460
I needed to move on.

267
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,620
Look at me now,
running Jihong Group.

268
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,580
I think if she knew,

269
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,820
she'd be proud of me.

270
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,860
So Zhizhi,

271
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,180
you need to be strong
and brave through all this.

272
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,020
You can do it too.

273
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,980
I wish I were as capable as you.

274
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,620
If you need anything,

275
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,180
I'll help you.

276
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
Going back means
another tough battle ahead.

277
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,980
Someone just vowed

278
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,300
they were ready to fight.

279
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,340
But they're so ruthless.

280
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,980
They'll stop at nothing

281
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,900
for money and profit.

282
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,860
The family I once believed in

283
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,100
has now fallen apart.

284
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,620
Grandma and Dad have fallen ill.

285
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,780
I just want to protect my dad's company.

286
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,500
Why is it so hard?

287
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,620
Don't worry.

288
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,580
I will help you.

289
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,020

that can still tell me what to do?

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,340
Hello?

309
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,340
Xiaofei,

310
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,060
why weren't you answering your phone?

311
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,980
You went to contact
the overseas companies?

312
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,020
No way. It doesn't matter

313
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,140
how good the resources
or the offers are.

314
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,700
We don't need the money.

315
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,940
This is reckless!

316
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,060
Absolutely not!

317
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:09,660

318
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,780
Hello? I...

319
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,260
What did Xiaofei say?

320
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,580
She said some overseas company

321
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,220
wants to sign her for an endorsement.

322
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,220
Has she signed already?

323
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,140
Not yet.

324
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,540
But it's clear

325
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,820
she really wants to.

326
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,980
And Song Zhizhi is nowhere to be found.

327
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,180
The family car and driver are here.

328
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,820
But she's not responding

329
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,020
to my messages.

330
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,740
Right now, shares are
the most important for Song Zhizhi.

331
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,300
Is it possible

332
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,460
she went to her grandmother
to ask for her shares?

333
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,380
Very possible.

334
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,740
Wenhan,

335
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,540
go talk some sense into Xiaofei
and bring her back.

336
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,620
I'll deal with Song Zhizhi.

Zhizhi,

338
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,340
let me handle these chores.

339
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:22,940
Zhizhi,

340
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,020
Madam asked me to give this to you.

341
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,220
Zhizhi,

342
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,660
I'm getting old.

343
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,900
My health isn't what it used to be.

344
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,900
Your father is also unwell.

345
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,180
Zhiyan can be a bit willful.

346
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,380
And you, poor girl,

347
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,540
lost your mother so young.

348
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,300
I can tell

349
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,740
Nie Wenzhi has ulterior motives.

350
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,740
While I'm still here, I can protect you.

351
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,580
If there comes a day

352
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,980
when I can no longer protect you,

353
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,620
I'm afraid the burden

354
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,580
of this family
will fall on your shoulders.

355
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,340
Although I really wish

356
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,660
you could remain a carefree girl forever

357
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,860
and never have to open this letter.

358
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,180
I was afraid something might happen,

359
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,420
so I prepared
this share transfer agreement

360
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,500
for you in advance.

361
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,900
[Share Transfer Agreement]
I know if you've come here,

362
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,620
you must be facing some difficulty.

363
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,660
Hope I can help you one last time.

364
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,900
Hello, it's me.

365
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,900
I'm feeling a bit uneasy.

366
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,300
Song Zhizhi went to see Qin Xiuyun.

367
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,020
She's probably already gotten
her shares.

368
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:35,980
Yes.

369
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,260
She's also acquired

370
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,540
some shares in the company.

371
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,060
To be safe,

372
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,100
we should just make sure she can't
attend this shareholders' meeting.

373
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,220
Understood.

374
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,500
Mom, I'm back.

375
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,580
Mom,

376
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,220
I contacted an overseas agency.

377
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,300
They have a very important show

378
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,140
they want me for.

379
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,980
But it's quite urgent.

380
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,060
I need to leave in a couple of days.

381
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,500
I wanted to discuss it with you.

382
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,700
There's nothing to discuss.

383
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,860
You are not going.

384
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,540
Why?

385
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,740
Because the shareholders' meeting
is crucial.

386
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,980
You know every shareholder
must be present.

387
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,260
If you're not there,

388
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,700
what about our vote?

389
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,380
But this opportunity
is important to me too!

390
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,660
I earned this myself!

391
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,180
You don't have to help me,
but don't stand in my way!

392
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,660
Alright, alright.

393
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,780
I support your dreams.

394
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,940
Let's talk this through.

395
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,140
I support you.

396
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,540
I just need you to do one thing for me

397
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,220
before you go abroad.

398
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,260
Is...

399
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,980
Is that really necessary?

400
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,500
From what I know,

401
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,980
Song Zhizhi has already known

402
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,660
about your plans to go abroad.

403
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,700
And she knows the owner
of the company

404
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,780
you're signing with.

405
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,660
They're going to meet soon.

406
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,460
And guess what they would do
if they met.

407
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,580
I'm just worried

408
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,500
she might try to block
your path overseas.

409
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,420
But...

410
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,660
Why would she?

411
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,740
Why?

412
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,060
Because you're more talented
than she is.

413
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,460
Because you're a thorn in her side.

414
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,780
Xiaofei,

415
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,180
if I were you,

416
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,980
I'd never leave my enemies
any way out.

417
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,660
Those who've harmed you
must be eliminated.

418
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,060
Only then can you go abroad
and develop your career.

419
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,340
Hello?

420
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,420
We have a lead on the rough gemstones.

421
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,140
Go to Italy

422
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,660
and find out who received
those rough gemstones

423
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,700
back then.

424
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,220
Understood.

425
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,740
Zhizhi.

426
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,420
I need to talk to you about something.

427
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,660
What is it?

428
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,220
Does this necklace look nice?

429
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,660
It's pretty.

430
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,740
Can you help me put it on?

431
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,380
My nails are too long.

432
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,340
It's tricky for me to do it.

433
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,020
I'm afraid I might scratch it.

434
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,140
Wenhan bought me this necklace.

435
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,900
He said it's really hard
to find pearls of this Tennyo grade.

436
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,780
He went through

437
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,020
a lot of trouble to get it.

438
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,260
He just bought you this?

439
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,540
This is just
a regular saltwater pearl at best.

440
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,780
Not Tennyo grade.

441
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,460
It's already yellowing

442
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,460
and has obvious flaws.

443
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,940
It's probably second-hand.

444
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,940
What are you doing?

445
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,500
Song Zhizhi,

446
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,820
is it that in your eyes,

447
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,660
everything I have is inferior

448
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,220
and flawed?

449
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,900
Stop acting so superior all the time!

450
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,100
Let me tell you,

451
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,980
the company will sign me,

452
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,700
and Wenhan loves me.

453
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,140
Don't think you can easily ruin me!

454
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,580
Xiaofei. Xiaofei!

455
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,820
Xiaofei!

456
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,900
Xiaofei.

457
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,180
Xiaofei!

458
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,500
This way, please.

459
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,580
Xiaofei!

460
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,620
Xiaofei!

461
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,180
Xiaofei!

462
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,500
- Xiaofei!
- Xiaofei, what's wrong?

463
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,580
Xiaofei.

464
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,340
- Xiaofei!
- Xiaofei, are you okay?

465
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:07,820
Xiaofei.

466
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,700
Song Zhizhi,

467
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,380
why would you do this to Xiaofei?

468
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,060
What did she ever do to you?

469
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,300
Even if you two don't get along...

470
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:14,820
Xiaofei.

471
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,220
you didn't have to ruin her!

472
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:16,980
I didn't!

473
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,820
Xiaofei.

474
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,260
Xiaofei!

475
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,900
Ma'am.

476
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:20,940
- Xiaofei...
- What's wrong?

477
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,780
What happened?

478
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,940
I came in

479
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,060
and saw Xiaofei tumble down the stairs

480
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,180
right in front of Song Zhizhi.

481
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,380
Song Zhizhi, it was you.

482
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,860
What did you do?

483
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,340
Xiaofei. Xiaofei!

484
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,580
- Xiaofei, wake up.
- Xiaofei!

485
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,500
Qing, hurry.

486
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,580
Call an ambulance!

487
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,460
Now!

488
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,700
Xiaofei.

489
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,860
Xiaofei. Xiaofei.

490
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,500
Get in the car!

491
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,060
Quick!

492
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,460
Don't be scared. Mom's here.

493
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:00,980
Be careful.

494
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,020
Where do you think you're going?

495
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,500
Stop pretending to be the good one!

496
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,140
I'm warning you,

497
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,940
stay away from my daughter from now on!

498
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,280
[Operation Room]

499
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,300
How is Xiaofei?

500
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,780
Song Zhizhi,

501
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,780
I really don't understand

502
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,660
how you have the nerve to come here.

503
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,980
Why can't you just let her go?

504
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,740
After you ruined her career here,

505
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,500
she finally found
an opportunity overseas.

506
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,740
We were planning

507
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,060
to start over abroad!

508
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,060
What overseas opportunity?

509
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,980
What are you talking about?

510
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,260
You're still pretending?

511
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,700
How can you keep pretending?

512
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,900
Keep this up,

513
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,300
and I'll hit you again

514
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,620
until you admit it!

515
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,100
What proof do you have that I did it?

516
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,540
What proof?

517
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,540
The proof is that you see Xiaofei
as a thorn in your side!

518
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,980
Zhizhi,

519
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,660
all these years,

520
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,980
I've treated you like my own daughter.

521
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,820
But how have you repaid me?

522
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,020
How have you treated Xiaofei?

523
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,260
How... How could you hurt her like this?

524
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,860
Nie Xiaofei's family?

525
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,860
The skin tissue on her leg
is severely damaged.

526
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,740
According to the CT scan,

527
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,260
findings include a leg fracture,

528
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,460
nerve rupture,

529
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,740
and spinal nerve compression.

530
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,820
She may not be able
to walk normally in the future.

531
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,980
This is our proposed treatment plan.

532
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,980
You need to sign
the surgical consent form.

533
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,780
Okay, alright.

534
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,460
Alright.

535
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,260
The last time I signed a consent form

536
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,860
was for your dad's surgery.

537
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,060
And now, just days later,

538
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,740
I have to sign one for my daughter.

539
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,180
Ms. Nie,

540
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,940
how is Xiaofei now?

541
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,140
Is she okay?

542
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,980
She's in surgery.

543
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,100
Song Zhizhi!

544
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,060
Whatever happened between us

545
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,220
is in the past.

546
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,100
If you can't let go of the past,

547
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,100
that's your problem.

548
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,700
Sort out your feelings!

549
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,580
But now, Nie Xiaofei is my girlfriend.

550
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,980
She's also the sister you live with.

551
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,460
How could you hurt her

552
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,780
so cruelly?

553
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,660
How can you be so ruthless?

554
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,540
Let go of me! Let go!

555
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,540
♪From this moment on, I no longer care♪

556
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,140
♪No more noise in my ears♪

557
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,540
♪That's the peace
