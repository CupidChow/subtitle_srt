can't you consider
the difficult position I'm in?

192
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,020
Once the company goes public,

193
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,420
if I don't have
absolute controlling interest,

194
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,060
don't you think investor confidence

195
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,140
will be affected?

196
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,100
The stock price could even take a hit,

Now, what kind of talk is that, Song?

207

Looks to me like someone

as an excuse

376
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,740
yet you walk away clean.

377
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,100
Why?

378
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,780
Why?

379
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,580
Without my plan,

380
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,660
do you think you'd be

381
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,380
where you are today?

382
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,660
Because of your so-called plan,

383
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,260
I have nothing left now!

384
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,420
And my future?

385
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,420
My future is ruined!

386
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,140
This is your own doing.

387
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,020
You can't blame anyone.

388
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,700
Your so-called plan

389
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,140
ruined me and my mom!

390
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,540
We could have lived a peaceful life.

391
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,980
But you gave my mom to another man!

392
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,220
And me?

393
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,380
I was just a pawn
from the very beginning!

394
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,860
Qian Guanshu,

395
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,940
you don't deserve to be my father.

396
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,540
Wenhan.

397
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,940
Calm down and let me explain!

398
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,060
I don't want to hear it!

399
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,620
What's the point?

400
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,940
Then what do you want?

401
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,780
First,

402
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,900
get my mom out.

403
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,060
Second,

404
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,620
prepare money

405
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,900
to get me and my mom out of here safely.

406
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,100
I'm already working on all that.

407
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,220
Your mom will be released
on bail pending trial soon.

408
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,820
I'll get the money together.

409
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,580
But you need

410
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,980
to lay low here

411
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,700
during this time.

412
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,500
Don't cause any more trouble.

413
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,060
I hope

414
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,420
you keep your word this time.

415
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,380
How is Nie Wenzhi's case going?

416
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,940
Her detention period has expired.

417
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,100
But the case needs further trial.

418
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,940
She provided proof

419
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,140
of a serious medical condition
to the police,

420
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,060
so she's been released
on bail pending trial.

421
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,060
But don't worry.

422
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,020
She's committed so many crimes.

423
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,620
She won't get away with this.

424
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,740
Dad,

425
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,860
just rest at home.

426
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,220
Don't worry about anything.

427
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,980
Tomorrow you'll chair

428
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,220
your first company meeting
as General Manager.

429
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,380
Are you ready?

430
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,740
I'm ready.

431
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,340
Last time I left,

432
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,940
this was a full, bustling house.

433
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,740
Now

434
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,380
it feels empty.

435
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,060
The family is broken.

436
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,140
If we hadn't discovered
Wenzhi's true nature,

437
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,260
maybe

438
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,980
we could have just kept living together.

439
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,220
Dad,

440
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,540
what's done is done.

441
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,940
Even if we played dumb,

442
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,900
everything in this house

443
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,740
would still be a facade.

444
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,100
All good things must come to an end.

445
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,060
We have to embrace change.

446
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,260
Look at you, Zhizhi.

447
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,260
You're full of wisdom now.

448
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,260
You've changed so much.

449
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,860
You weren't like this before.

450
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,460
After everything that's happened,

451
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,660
it's time I grew up.

452
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,100
My little girl

453
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,900
really has grown up.

454
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,420
I remember
when you were learning to walk.

455
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,820
You'd take two steps and fall,

456
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,500
sitting on the ground crying.

457
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,500
And I'd pick you up

458
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,060
again and again,

459
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
until you finally learned.

460
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,220
Since you were little,

461
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,900
I've been afraid of you getting hurt

462
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,940
or bullied.

463
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,500
I always wanted to protect you

464
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,820
with everything I had.

465
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,500
But you'd grow up anyway

466
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,220
and have to face
this complicated world on your own.

467
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,140
You earned the position

468
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,140
of Acting General Manager yourself.

469
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,060
I'm really happy for you.

470
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,940
Zhizhi,

471
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,980
you will surpass me.

472
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,580
You'll do even better.

473
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,140
Dad,

474
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,060
am I your pride?

475
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,900
Good morning, everyone.

476
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,140
As Mr. Song is currently

477
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,940
feeling unwell,

478
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,140
I'm chairing my first company meeting

479
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,060
as the Acting General Manager today.

480
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,460
Let's have each department head

481
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,100
report on this week's progress.

482
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,740
Regarding the Quefeng series campaign,

483
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,500
the influencers we've contacted

484
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,540
think partnering with us is too risky

485
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,100
after the Chuxin incident.

486
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,980
They're all making
outrageous demands now,

487
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,140
threatening to pull out

488
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,180
unless we pay them more.

489
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,140
Then scrub the list.

490
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,100
Find younger influencers

491
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,860
with more potential
and better attitudes.

492
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,380
Also,

493
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,900
the collaborative project
with the overseas Anya Corp

494
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,100
has tied up
most of next quarter's production funds.

495
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,660
Finance

496
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,380
is still waiting for the capital
to be returned.

497
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,260
The company's overall cash flow
is extremely tight.

498
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
We're really stretched thin

499
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,580
for operating funds.

500
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,100
Regarding the company's finances,

501
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,660
I need everyone

502
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,460
to stay confident.

503
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,740
These difficulties are temporary.

504
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,260
I will find a solution.

Zhizhi, bad news.

513
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,780
The collaborative project
with Anya Corp

514
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,100
has tied up
most of our production funds.

515
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,220
I just got word.

516
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,060
They've declared bankruptcy.

517
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,720
[Bankruptcy Declaration of Anya Corp]

518
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,140
How could such a basic mistake happen?

519
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,100
This was a Design Department project

520
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,380
that started before you became
the Acting General Manager.

521
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,820
It was seen as questionable
due to the high capital commitment

522
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,780
and long cycle.

523
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,060
But somehow
the senior management approved it,

524
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,420
so they had to proceed.

525
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,140
Which senior executive approved it?

526
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,900
How could anyone approve
a project like that?

527
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,340
I've looked into it.

528
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,220
Nie Wenzhi did it behind the scenes

529
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,780
during the chaos
of the shareholders' meeting.

530
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,100
So Nie Wenzhi

531
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,820
was plotting

532
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,180
against the company from that far back?

533
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,500
Now next quarter's production funds

534
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,260
are frozen.

535
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,860
If the production line funding dries up,

536
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,100
the Quefeng series
will likely be halted.

537
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,780
Ms. Song, we have a problem
with the bank.

538
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,100
Our loan application was rejected.

539
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,020
They probably got wind of our situation

540
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,420
and don't want to take the risk.

541
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,140
We need to keep this quiet.

542
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:12,780
Alright.

543
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,660
If this gets out,

544
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,980
it could seriously impact the company.

545
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,900
Understood. I'll leave then.

546
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,420
At this rate,
forget developing new products,

547
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,700
even keeping the company running
will be a problem.

548
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,100
Nie Wenzhi

549
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,420
schemed to take my dad's assets.

550
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,900
