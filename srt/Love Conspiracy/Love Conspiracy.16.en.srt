Sorry. The subscriber you dialed

Zhizhi,

20
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,940
where are you?

21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,980
Why didn't you answer your phone?

22
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,780
I'm at home.

23
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,100
My phone died,
that's why I missed your call.

24
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,620
Wait for me at home.

25
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,420
Zhizhi,

26
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,740
are you okay?

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,020
Why would anything be wrong?

28
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,820
I was about to ask you.

29
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,660
Weren't we supposed to
have dinner together tonight?

30
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,420
Why didn't you show up?

31
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,980
Why were you having dinner with my dad?

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,220
Your dad came to see me at the office.

33
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,980
He asked me to have dinner
and said that you would be there.

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,500
Zhizhi,

35
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,900
if my dad comes to you again,

36
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,060
you have to tell me immediately.

37
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,740
But your dad is quite intimidating.

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,780
I'm getting older.

39
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,100
I don't know what you young ladies

like to eat these days.

41
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,340
So I just ordered a few things.

42
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,860
Well, does it suit your taste?

43
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,860
Sir,

44
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,100
I'm fine with anything.
I'm not a picky eater.

Zhizhi,

46
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,100
I've discussed your marriage

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,740
to Baijian with your father.

48
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,460
We both think

49
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,180
it's time to move things forward.

50
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,300
We will

51
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,900
follow whatever you elders decide.

52
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,660
Good.

53
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,660
If you want to become
part of the Ji family,

54
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,740
you must abide by the Ji family rules.

55
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,620
I can be self-centered.

56
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,340
As the head of this family,

57
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,220
I'm rather blunt.

58
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,740
I hope

59
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,420
you won't mind.

60
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,340
Baijian.

61
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,260
When you go back, please ask your dad

62
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,900
what his impression of me was.

63
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,700
I feel like

64
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,500
I wasn't quite at my best today.

65
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,900
Okay.

66
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,820
Since you're alright, I'll leave.

67
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,980
Get some rest.

68
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,140
Why are you so flustered today?

69
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,180
I have other things to do.

70
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,940
Why did you go see Song Zhizhi?

71
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,180
You know what I'll do if you disobey me.

72
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,540
It's a puppy.

73
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,180
Dad, where's Ye?

74
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,100
You actually disobeyed me!

75
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,940
Dad, I'll listen to you from now on.

76
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,900
Please, give Ye back to me.

77
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,980
I'll always obey you.

78
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,860
Please, give Ye back to me.

79
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,620
All these years,

80
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,540
my father has been living

81
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,900
in the shadow of losing my mother.

82
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,940
Knowing him,

83
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,100
he will seek revenge.

84
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,660
He will make sure Song Shan

85
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,620
feels the pain of losing his career

86
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,860
and his family too.

87
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,860
I can't change him.

88
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,740
You're planning to propose to Zhizhi?

89
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,980
Marrying her

90
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,380
will allow you to protect her better.

91
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,700
At least, if I marry her,

92
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,300
she'll be my dad's daughter-in-law.

93
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,500
The decades-old feud between my dad
and the Song family

94
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,140
will at least not involve her anymore.

95
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,940
It's the best protection I can give her.

96
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,740
Ji,

97
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,300
think this through.

98
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,060
Once you make this move,

99
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,540
there's no going back.

100
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,220
And Song Zhizhi

101
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,780
may never understand your reasons.

102
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,060
How lively.

103
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,940
Why did you suddenly ask me out?
Is something wrong?

104
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,820
Zhizhi,

105
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,620
about starting the new company,

106
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,420
what did your dad say?

107
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,540
He still doesn't agree.

108
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,380
After all, Starlight Jewelry

109
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,220
is his life's work.

110
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,940
Transferring the core team

111
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,660
to start a new company

112
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,900
is hard for him to accept.

113
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,740
And Ziming also feels

114
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,420
it might not be the right approach.

115
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,300
Let's get married.

116
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,740
What did you say?

117
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,580
I said, let's get married.

118
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,420
We're already engaged.

119
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,340
And a marriage alliance

120
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,580
would solve your family's problems.

121
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,500
It's the logical next step.

122
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,820
A marriage alliance?

123
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,140
You're saying our marriage
would be a business arrangement?

124
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,580
No, I mean,

125
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,220
you're having a funding problem now.

126
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,980
Our marriage

127
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,420
would justify my diverting funds

128
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,980
from Jihong Group.

129
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,620
If marriage is meant to help my family,

130
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,380
then forget it.

131
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,060
If you still see this

132
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,780
as just a business arrangement,

133
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,180
I appreciate the offer.

134
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,340
But I don't need it.

135
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,660
Why are you getting so upset
all of a sudden?

136
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,580
Let go of me.

137
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,780
Zhizhi.

138
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,460
What's wrong?

139
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,860
Something's bothering you?

140
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,860
No, nothing.

141
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,180
Ziming,

142
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,980
I want to ask you a question.

143
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,660
What do you think

144
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,620
the best relationship

145
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,060
between two people is?

146
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,740
I think

147
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,900
it must be

148
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
mutual love,

149
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,860
help,

150
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,780
and support.

151
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,500
Ji Baijian proposed to me.

152
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,060
Did you say yes?

153
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,260
I thought

154
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,860
what I had with him

155
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,860
was exactly the kind of relationship
you described.

156
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,060
But today he called it
a marriage alliance.

157
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,740
It upset me.

158
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,460
Then...

I'll leave you two alone.

186
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,060
Have a seat. Let's talk over a drink.

187
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,020
Ji Baijian,

188
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,500
I heard you proposed to Song Zhizhi.

189
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,780

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,780
turning my world upside down.

377
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,420
We've taken such a winding path,

378
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,620
and I've made you wait far too long.

379
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,500
I'm sorry.

380
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,900
It's all my fault for being so hesitant,

381
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,300
for not telling you
how I felt about you sooner.

382
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,060
For the rest of my life,

383
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,140
I want to do my utmost

384
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,460
to take care of and protect you.

385
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,700
I want to marry you.

Marry me.

391

Will you?

392
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,820

410
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,380
Mr. Song,

411
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,340
as Zhizhi mentioned last time,

412
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,340
we could establish a new joint venture

413
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,820
and move the Quefeng project

414
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,060
to this new company,

415
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,180
where Jihong Group will

416
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,060
inject capital.

417
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,780
This will provide
sufficient financial support

418
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,580
to address Starlight Jewelry's inability

419
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,940
to run the project

420
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,220
due to a broken capital chain.

421
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,860
Mr. Song, what do you think?

422
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,220
Mr. Song.

423
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,300
There's a document here
requiring your signature.

424
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,020
I'll get back to work then.

425
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,060
Mr. Song,

426
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,700
I also suggest you

427
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,460
gradually transfer the core team
to the new company.

428
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,180
Ye Taiting wants Starlight Jewelry,
doesn't he?

429
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,340
Let's just give him the empty shell.

430
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,300
Baijian,

431
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,140
your father

432
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,980
has always valued
relationships and loyalty.

433
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,860
I appreciate the thoughtfulness
from you and your father.

434
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,260
But Zhizhi must have told you

435
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,020
about my concerns.

436
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,060
Mr. Song, I understand.

437
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,020
You built Starlight Jewelry

438
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,860
with painstaking effort.

439
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,780
You've always treated it
like your own child.

440
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,100
Giving it up would be like

441
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,500
losing a part of yourself.

442
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,140
And I guess

443
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,100
you've also considered the shares
for the new company.

444
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
The Ji family's involvement

445
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,540
would inevitably dilute
the Song family's control.

446
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,300
You're worried
about ending up with nothing.

447
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,420
Don't worry about that.

448
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,700
I've formally proposed to Zhizhi.

449
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,420
And she has said yes.

450
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,180
After we are married,

451
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,900
the company will be registered
under both our names.

452
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,980
It'll be our marital property.

453
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,540
This new company

454
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,300
will be entirely
under Zhizhi's management.

455
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,700
She is more talented than I am

456
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,940
in jewelry design.

457
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,540
I'll fully support her

458
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,300
and be her strongest backup.

459
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,180
Baijian,

460
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,780
since you're being so sincere,

461
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,740
we'll go ahead with your plan.

462
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,420
I trust your character,

463
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,820
and I trust Zhizhi's choice.

464
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,540
Then I'm entrusting my precious girl

465
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,380
to you.

466
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,700
You must treat her well.

467
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,220
Don't let her down.

468
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,340
You should move forward
with the wedding plans

469
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,980
and the establishment
of the new company.

470
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,660
Dad, don't worry.

471
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,220
Baijian and I won't let you down.

472
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,780
Found it!

473
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,580
Zhizhi,

474
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,420
look at you, always so rushed
and careless.

475
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,700
I need to give you
a few words of advice.

476
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,980
You're about to get married.

477
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,980
You need to stop acting so spoiled.

478
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,060
Dad,

479
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,620
what are you talking about?

480
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,180
I'm not that willful.

481
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,140
You've got me wrong.

482
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,260
I know

483
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,380
my own daughter very well.

484
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,180
Dad, look.

485
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,700
I remember this photo

486
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,180
was from when we went on
that trip together,

487
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,220
and Zhiyan fell into the fountain.

488
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,260
Yes.

489
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,420
In the blink of an eye,
you've all grown so big.

490
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,380
This one.

491
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,140
This must be
from my fifth birthday, right?

492
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,180
Is this Baijian?

493
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,660
No.

494
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,620
This is Ye Shengheng, the son

495
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,740
of Ye Taiting's big brother.

496
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,260
Such a pity. There was a car accident.

497
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,620
And his whole family was gone.

498
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,020
Baijian?

499
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,620
He didn't come that day.

500
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,100
I think he was sick.

501
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,420
I specifically had someone

502
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
deliver the gift to him.

503
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,460
But when Baijian proposed,

504
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,580
he said our first meeting

505
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,380
was at my fifth birthday party.

506
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,140
