00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,600
It's the middle of the night.
Something must've come up.

188
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,360
Alright, follow her. I'm on my way.

189
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,600
Keep me updated on her location.

190
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,440
Got it.

191
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,870
Strange.
Why is the traffic so bad today?

192
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,720
Forget it. I'll take a different route.

195
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,550
Hello?

196
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,000
Hey, Yin Qin.

197
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
Which direction is she headed?

198
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,630
[Yin Qin]
She got on the expressway.

199
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,000
The expressway only has two exits.

200
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,150
I'll take exit A.

201
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,000
You take the other one.

202
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,080
Get out.

203
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,030
Who are you people?

204
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,480
Who are you?

205
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,150
Move!

206
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,790
Let go of me!

207
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,080
[Zhiyan]

208
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,120
Sorry.

209
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,080
The number you've dialed
is currently unavailable.

210
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,480
Please try again...

211
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,910
I've never done anything to you.

212
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Why are you doing this?

213
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,030
Do I need a reason?

214
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,080
Why?

215
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,510
I just don't like you!

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,360
Hello?

217
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,240
Say something to your sister!

218
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,440
Zhizhi, don't come! It's dangerous!

219
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,390
Don't move!

220
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,320
You heard it?

221
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,390
If you're not here soon, your brother
won't be able to speak anymore.

222
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,200
Don't hurt him. I'm on my way.

223
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,790
Wait.

224
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,200
Come alone.

225
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,320
Or your brother dies!

226
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,030
I understand.

227
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,790
How did this happen?

228
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,510
I rejected Yi Wenhan's proposal.

229
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,790
But everything is still playing out
the same way.

230
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,670
Is there really no way to change fate?

231
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,440
This time,

232
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,030
I won't lose any of my family.

233
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,030
Brat.

234
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,910
Boss,

235
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,080
I thought we were supposed to take one.

236
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,120
What do you know?

237
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,360
This one dies.

238
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,120
That one's still useful.

239
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,030
The client paid extra.

240
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,150

How much? I'll pay.

250
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,500
No need. We've already been paid.

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,980

we're just paid to do the job.

257
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,140
We don't want any trouble with you.

258
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,940
Take your clothes off.

259
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,980
We'll take a few photos,

260
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,220
some videos,

261
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,740
and we're done.

262
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,500
But he stays.

263
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,420

No, huh?

265
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,900
Then we'll beat you until you do.

thank you so much for today.

318
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,620
If you hadn't shown up,

319
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,900
my brother and I...

320
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,780
would have been in serious trouble.

321
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,460
Don't mention it.

322
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,860
I should be thanking both of you.

Let... Let me help you with that.

324
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,940
But it's so late.

325
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,580
What were you doing

326
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,460
in such a remote area?

327
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,460
Urgent business. I was just passing by.

328
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,980
May I ask what kind

329
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,100
of urgent business?

330
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,580
You see,

331
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,140
you missed your own plans

332
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,060
to save us.

333
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,380
I want to make it up to you.

334
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,300
Can't. And not necessary.

Mr. Ji,

336
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,340
are you still upset with me?

337
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,980
Which matter are we talking about?

338
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,060
Whatever it is,

339
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,460
I had my reasons.

340
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,420
I hope you can understand.

341
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,900
Please forgive me.

342
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,180
You certainly have a lot of reasons.

343
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,380
And they always involve others.

344
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,140
If you hadn't wanted to get involved,

345
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,660
you could have not shown up.

346
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,940
So your appearance tonight
makes me think...

347
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,860
You still suspect me?

348
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,660
Weren't you just saying

349
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,820
how terrible things would have been

350
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,620
if I hadn't shown up?

351
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,180
You saved my life.

352
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,860
I wouldn't dare suspect you.

353
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,020
Thank you.

354
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,100
Alright.

355
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,700
I see.

356
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,140
Who told you to go after Song Zhizhi?

357
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,140
You've ruined everything!

358
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,700
It's all destroyed!

359
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,540
But Mom,

360
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,780
she started it!

361
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,500
She showed that embarrassing video
of me and Wenhan

362
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,180
in public.

363
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,860
I just wanted

364
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,620
to get some nude photos

365
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,060
and videos of her.

366
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,020
Why does she get to do that to me,

367
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,860
but I can't do it back?

368
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,260
You're such a fool! So stupid!

369
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,980
I...

370
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,940

371
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,540
Well,

372
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
what do we do now?

373
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,940
What do you think?

374
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,100
Someone rescued them.

375
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,140
That brat is still alive,

376
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,260
and Song Zhizhi
is completely unharmed.

377
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,380
I'm furious.

378
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,980
If someone investigates
and follows the trail,

379
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,260
listen,

380
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,460
we'll all be exposed!

381
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,980
As in "diligence".
[*The character "Qin" means diligence.]

382
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,820
We'll be in touch.

383
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,820
Nice save there, hero.

384
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,340
You got wounded.

385
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,420
If you're going to sell it,
make it look real.

386
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,740
Put some real feelings into it.

387
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,060
Your approach is outdated.

388
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,420
You're the expert.

389
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,980
Song Zhizhi is actually quite brave.

390
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,380
Risked everything to save her brother,

391
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,500
then came back for me.

392
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,580
Quite the heroine.

393
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,420
But what happened tonight

394
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,420
wasn't simple.

395
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,380
Look into it.

396
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,380
Alright.

397
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,300
Nie Xiaofei, tell me,

398
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,380
what is our purpose in the Song family?

399
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,500
Have you forgotten?

400
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,780
Our goal

401
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,060
is to ensure Song Zhiyan
never inherits anything.

402
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,220
To take the Song family's fortune.

403
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,260
Not to fight over some man

404
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,220
with her!

405
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,140
Song Zhizhi,

406
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,940
just you wait.

407
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,580
I'll ruin you sooner or later.

408
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,460
He's fine now. He can be discharged.

409
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,300
Thank you.

410
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,100
Thanks, Zhizhi.

411
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,300
How are you feeling?

412
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,500
Any discomfort?

413
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,500
It's nothing. Just minor injuries.

414
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,260
Don't worry.

415
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,620
How can I not worry?

416
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,100
Right after Dad announced you
as the successor,

417
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,180
this happened.

418
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,180
Zhizhi,

419
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,220
you seem

420
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,500
different lately.

421
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,460
You never used
to overthink things like this.

422
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,940
Maybe I didn't care enough
about you before.

423
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,100
Zhiyan,

424
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,060
you and Dad mean everything to me.

425
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,260
Nothing can happen to either of you.

426
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,140
You have to stay safe.

427
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,940
Okay, I understand.

428
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,380
Let's go home. Come on.

429
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,980
Alright, out with it.

430
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,980
Why did you come back so suddenly?

431
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:19,980
I...

432
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,100
I want to switch
to studying photography.

433
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,820
Xiaofei said

434
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,340
Yi Wenhan proposed to you.

435
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,340
She told me to come back and celebrate.

436
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,940
I thought with the engagement,

437
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,340
Dad would be happy,

438
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,620
and he might say yes to me.

439
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,660
So it really was Nie Xiaofei.

440
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,620
I didn't say yes to Yi Wenhan.

441
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,700
She lied to you.

442
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,540
Why would Xiaofei lie to me?

443
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,060
Was she

444
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,500
really involved in this?

445
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,700
Mom.

446
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,100
Grandma! What are you doing here?

447
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,660
Zhiyan.

448
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,060
Zhiyan.

449
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,660
Oh, my boy.

450
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,020
Such a terrible thing happened to you.

451
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,340
Of course I had to come.

452
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,060
Here, have a seat.

453
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,660
Let me get a good look at you.

454
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,220
How are you feeling?

455
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,500
I'm fine, Grandma.

456
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,580
The doctor said

457
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,100
it's just scratches.

458
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:23,940
I'll be better in a couple of days.

459
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,460
You still need to pay attention.

460
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,180
I'll get you a great doctor

461
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,780
for a thorough check-up.

462
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,380
Yes, absolutely.

463
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,860
Aunt Wenzhi,

464
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,620
Zhiyan came back.

465
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,060
You must be surprised.

466
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:46,980
Yes.

467
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,740
I really was surprised.

468
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,220
My son came back so suddenly.

469
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,060
I was both happy and surprised.

470
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,180
Grandma.

471
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,580
You have no idea
how dangerous it was yesterday.

472
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,540
I heard from the police

473
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,380
that those kidnappers

474
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,100
beat Zhiyan for money.

475
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,580
What?

476
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,300
Who would dare

477
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,700
hurt the only son of the Song family?

478
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,260
Who knows?

479
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,940
But it seems like

480
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,180
someone set this up.

481
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,140
I only found out

482
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,020
Zhiyan was back after he landed.

483
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,620
Who else could have known

484
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,980
so early?

485
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,420
I wanted

486
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,700
to surprise Zhizhi and you.

487
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,420
So I only told Xiaofei

488
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,220
about coming back.

489
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,620
Xiaofei?

490
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,780
Grandma,

491
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,860
I... I did know Zhiyan was coming back.

492
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,340
But I didn't tell anyone about that.

493
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,940
Xiaofei,

494
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,220
if you knew his flight details,

495
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,140
why didn't you send the driver
to pick him up?

496
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,180
You left a car at the airport

497
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,740
for him to drive himself back.

498
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,780
What were you thinking?

499
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,900
I thought the driver was off yesterday?

500
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,460
Nonsense!

501
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,300
Wasn't it you who sent the driver away?

502
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,580
What were you trying to do?
What's your game?

503
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,100
Grandma,

504
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,860
I had a business dinner yesterday
and had some drinks.

505
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,340
I had no choice but to send the driver.

506
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,620
I thought

507
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,420
since Zhiyan was coming back so late,

508
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,500
if his flight was delayed,

509
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,900
driving himself might be better.

510
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,340
So I left the car there.

511
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,020
He could have taken a regular route.

512
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,260
But he ended up on the most remote one.

513
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,420
I had no idea he'd change routes!

514
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,420
I did that because of the traffic.

515
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,860
See, Grandma?

516
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,820
I really wasn't lying.

517
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,420
Xiaofei, you've always been

518
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,420
so careless.

519
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,420
You borrowed the car for fun

520
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,820
and caused this misunderstanding!

521
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,020
All you care about is having fun!

522
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,500
You never use your brain!

523
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,140
Exactly.

524
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,260
What's your brain for?

525
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,820
Apologize to Grandma now.

526
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,020
Grandma.

527
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,860
This is all my fault.

528
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,460
Please don't be upset over this.

529
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,020
I should have thought it through.

530
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,300
You meant well,

531
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,380
but you can't just take matters
into your own hands.

532
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,860
Thankfully, Zhiyan is safe.

533
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,620
What if something had happened to him?

534
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,900
Could you take that responsibility?

535
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,220
Xiaofei, from now on,

536
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,660
you discuss everything

537
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,380
with Grandma before making a move.

538
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,900
If there's a next time,

539
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,580
you'll regret it!

540
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,980
It's all my fault, Grandma.

541
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,620
Please don't be angry.

542
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,060
Don't be mad, please?

543
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,420
Alright, stop crying.

544
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,660
Look.

545
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,060
Zhiyan went through so much

546
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,420
and isn't complaining.

547
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,740
I just said a few words,

548
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,140
and you're already in tears.

549
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,500
People will think

550
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,860
I'm giving you a hard time.

551
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,820
Grandma, please don't be mad.

552
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,460
Grandma.

553
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,180
This is not entirely

554
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,940
Xiaofei's fault.

555
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,260
Blame those bad guys.

556
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,740
But they've already been caught.

557
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,180
The police will get to the truth.

558
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,660
Besides those bad guys,

559
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,740
I won't let go

560
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,300
of the people behind them either.

561
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,860
♪From this moment on, I no longer care♪

562
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,460
♪No more noise in my ears♪

563
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,860
♪That's the peace
I've always yearned for♪
