tell you something about Song Zhizhi.

189
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,100
Song Zhizhi?

190
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,100
What about her?

191
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,740
Ye Taiting has Wei Ziming

192
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,500
deeply involved in managing
and operating

193
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,660
Starlight Jewelry.

194
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,660
It's clear to sideline Song Zhizhi.

195
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,180
Of course,

196
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,540
that's just the first step.

197
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,340
Kicking Song Zhizhi out
of Starlight Jewelry

198
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,780
is their goal.

199
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,620
Wei Ziming

200
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,140
is lovesick, bitter,
and twisted by hatred.

201
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,860
Now, with Ye Taiting
brainwashing him daily,

202
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,100
he's lost all rationality.

203
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,860
I'm afraid

204
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,140
they'll stop at nothing.

205
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,460
Thank you for telling me this.

206
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,140
To be honest, I wasn't recording.

207
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,220
I never believed your loyalty
to Ye Taiting was unshakable.

208
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:33,820
Maybe

209
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,860
one day we'll end up on the same side.

210
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,780
Contact me

211
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,460
when you've come around.

212
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,060
Ziming,

213
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,380
just say what's on your mind.

214
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
I had lawyers compile
the investigative report

215
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,500
on the car accident
involving Ye Shengheng,

216
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,580
now known as Ji Baijian,

217
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,620
and his parents.

218
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,620
On the day of the accident,

219
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,540
Ye Xiaoting's last call

220
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,660
was to you.

221
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,100
You planned to have dinner together

222
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,740
and reminisce.

223
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,060
But you arrived early.

224
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,460
And Ye Xiaoting never showed up.

225
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,580
You knew his route

226
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,140
and timing perfectly.

227
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,660
Yet you told the police

228
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,100
that last five-minute call

229
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,540
was just to remind him to hurry.

230
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,340
After that call,

231
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,540
he made a decision

232
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,060
that baffled everyone.

233
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,180
What are you trying to say?

234
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,980
He was originally driving
with his family

235
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,060
on the outer ring road.

236
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,740
Longer, but smoother.

237
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,380
Probably because his wife and child
were with him.

238
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,020
But halfway,

239
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,060
he suddenly turned around

240
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,780
and took a shorter

241
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,940
but more remote route.

242
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,060
The accident happened there.

243
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,500
I think your call

244
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,380
led to that decision.

245
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,620
So indirectly,

246
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,220
you're also responsible for the deaths
of Ye Xiaoting and his wife.

247
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,180
Then Ji Baijian
is too dangerous for you all!

248
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,180
He's getting close
to the Song family and Zhizhi

249
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,860
just to uncover the truth
about what happened.

250
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,140
Once he finds out,

251
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,940
it'll drive an irreparable wedge

252
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,620
between him and Zhizhi.

253
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,620
Zhizhi'll never be happy!

254
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Even if she doesn't end up
with Ji Baijian,

255
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,540
I won't let her be with you!

256
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,300
You'd use this to pressure me?

257
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,300
You're truly Ye Taiting's son.
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

258
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,820
Even your tactics are just like his.

259
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,380
You've disappointed me so much!

260
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,780
Why?

261
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,860
After everything Ji Baijian has done,

262
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,180
why do you still take his side?

263
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,980
Do you still see me

264
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,420
as that helpless orphan?

265
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,660
Wei Ziming,

266
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,460
I hope you turn back now

267
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,140
and cut ties with Ye Taiting!

268
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,260
Otherwise, forget Zhizhi,

269
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,940
even I

270
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,140
won't want to see you again.

271
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
Come on out.

272
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,500
You left such a mess

273
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,380
with that thing back then.

274
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,540
Not just Ji Baijian
is digging into the accident.

275
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,580
Just now, my son...

276
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,980
My son Wei Ziming called

277
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,260
and asked me about the accident too.

278
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,700
It's about to blow wide open.

279
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,060
Explain this to me.

280
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,020
What is going on here?

281
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,780
Don't worry.
I'll look into it right away!

282
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,580
Look into what? You idiot!

283
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,780
Let me ask you,

284
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,780
was it that driver you hired...?

285
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
That driver threw me
under the bus, right?

286
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:45,980
Mr. Ye,

287
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,180
that driver was dealt with long ago.

288
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,660
We sent money to his family
for five years.

289
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,460
Well, this is interesting.

290
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,900
It couldn't have been me.

291
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,660
Who else could it be?

292
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,380
Well,

293
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,820
that only leaves you.

294
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,940
I looked into the driver's family.

295
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,820
Qian Guanshu had been
sending them money all along.

296
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,420
If it was really just an accident,

297
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,940
then why has he kept

298
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,180
sending money to his mother?

299
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,420
The Song family

300
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,940
wronged Ji Baijian.

301
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,620
I made a mistake back then
with the Ji family's

302
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,260
rough gemstones.

303
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,940
Then, with the Ye family's car accident,

304
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,300
I made another mistake.

305
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,860
With every mistake,

306
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,340
I pushed an innocent Ji Baijian

307
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,660
deeper into despair.

308
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,780
Among the partners of Starlight Group,

309
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,820
Ye Xiaoting was upright and principled,

310
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,500
while Ye Taiting

311
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,460
always cut corners,

312
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,340
chasing profits in gray areas.

313
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,900
Disapproving of Ye Taiting's actions,

314
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,620
Ji Yunlei left Starlight Group
and established Dafu Jewelry.

315
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,860
Later, when Ye Taiting's schemes
came to light,

316
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,820
Ye Xiaoting found out.

317
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,620
He turned his own brother in,

318
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,020
exposing his deeds

319
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,540
and forcing him out of the company.

320
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,340
That's when the two brothers broke ties.

321
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,460
Ye Taiting grew to resent his brother.

322
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,580
This time, I'm not listening to you!

323
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,580
Let's call it quits!

324
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:46,980
What are you doing?

325
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,340
What are you doing?

326
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:48,780
Ye Taiting!

327
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,260
I'm telling you,

328
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,300
from now on,

329
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,340
we'll just

330
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,260
go our separate ways!

331
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:53,780
Get out!

332
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,500
Taiting!

333
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,140
So, is that when

334
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,780
you got involved?

335
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,900
Not exactly involved.

336
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,340
But I was there.

337
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,620
Among the founding partners,

338
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,620
Ye Taiting and I were the closest.

339
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,700
So he came to me.

340
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,620
He asked me to invite his brother out.

341
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Said he wanted to apologize in person.

342
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,460
I really didn't think much of it.

343
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,300
They were brothers, after all.

344
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,340
So

345
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,380
I believed him.

346
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,020
Alright, Xiaoting.

347
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,300
See you soon.

348
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,060
Alright.

349
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,660
He'll be here soon.

350
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,340
He is

351
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,700
bringing his wife and son this time.

352
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,380
Good.

353
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,540
Even better if they all come.

354
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,900
Their whole family can be together.

355
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,940
Everyone's here.

356
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,500
Shan, I have to take this call.

357
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,660
Sir,

358
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,460
the vehicle you mentioned
never showed up.

359
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,060
They're not coming?

360
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,900
Understood.

361
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,300
What's wrong?

362
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,860
Something happened?

363
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,860
Look at my brother.

364
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,860
Instead of taking the good road,

365
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,700
he took the old road.

366
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,220
That road had a landslide recently.

367
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,740
Unbelievable.

368
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,780
And it's the longer route.

369
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,780
Shan, why don't you

370
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,980
call him? Use your name.

371
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,940
Tell him not to take that road.

372
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,660
Then, which route should he take?

373
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,380
The newly paved road.

374
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
Right, I know that one.

375
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,540
Hello?

376
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,100
Xiaoting, listen,

377
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,620
there's been a landslide
on your current route.

378
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,700
Switch to the new road.

379
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,620
Yes, that one.

380
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,660
Alright, we'll be waiting for you.

381
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,580
Alright.

382
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,900
Done.

383
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,380
Shan, you're good.

384
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,300
So he listened to you

385
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,700
and changed routes?

386
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,100
Yes.

387
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,140
He took

388
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,460
the new route I suggested

389
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,860
and had a car accident.

390
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,100
Originally,

391
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,220
Ye Xiaoting was coming alone.

392
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,700
But he was so happy.

393
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,260
So he brought his wife and kid.

394
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,900
Who would've thought...

395
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,820
Dad,

396
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,580
don't blame yourself.

397
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,300
You didn't know

398
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,180
about that.

399
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,260
I thought

400
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,180
it was an accident too.

401
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,460
Until I learned

402
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,660
there was never any landslide

403
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,180
on their original route!

404
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,660
So Ye Taiting

405
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,660
lied to you.

406
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,460
I confronted him.

407
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,980
Asked why he lied.

408
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,620
He threatened me

409
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,220
and said since I made the call

410
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,140
and suggested the route.

411
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,180
And if this ever came out,

412
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,780
their deaths

413
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,940
would be on me.

414
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,300
Dad,

415
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,820
this isn't your fault.

416
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,860
Ye Taiting.

417
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,540
He planned

418
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,940
the whole thing.

419
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,820
Mr. Ye,

420
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,460
you suspect me?

421
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,300
You're breaking my heart.

422
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
I've been with you for over 20 years.

423
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,180
I've done every dirty job you handed me.

424
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,740
When you said jump,
I never asked why.

425
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,220
We're on the same boat.

426
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,660
Back then,

427
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,980
you told me

428
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,620
you had issues with your brother.

429
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,700
Song Shan set up that dinner

430
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,540
to mediate.

431
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,460
You said

432
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,260
you didn't want Ye Xiaoting there.

433
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,660
Told me to handle him.

434
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,260
After that,

435
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,700
you've sent money
to the driver for five years.

436
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,820
A million.

437
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,900
That came from your pockets.

438
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,580
And yes,

439
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,700
I gave him the final route.

440
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,860
But you know well

441
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,580
whether there were landslides

442
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,060
on that route

443
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,460
they originally chose.

444
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,420
Guanshu.

445
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,220
Guanshu,

446
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,220
what is that talk?

447
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,460
I was just saying.

448
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,340
You actually took it seriously?

449
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,020
You're something else.

450
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,340
All these years,

451
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,140
I treated you like my own brother.

452
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,820
Mr. Ye,

453
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,820
I've always seen you
as my own brother too.

454
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,220
That's why

455
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,700
I usually acted

456
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,660
with your direct orders.

457
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,700
You've carried

458
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,700
a heavy burden all these years.

459
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,180
There's a board meeting tomorrow.

460
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,420
Go back and get some rest.

461
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,260
Go home and rest.

462
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,020
Guanshu,

463
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,980
where were you last night?

464
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,180
At home, drinking and watching the game.

465
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,420
Just asking.

466
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,340
It's nothing.

467
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,460
Go get some rest.

468
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,340
Take care on your way.

469
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,620
[Ji Baijian]

470
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,060
Hello? Hello?

471
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,260
We're here today

472
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,260
for an internal board meeting.

473
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,260
For the upcoming tasks,

474
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,940
I'm going to hand them over

475
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,140
to a remarkably capable young man.

476
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,420
He will take on the role
of Executive Director

477
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,100
and address these issues.

478
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,660
Let's welcome

479
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,260
our new Executive Director,

480
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,420
Mr. Wei Ziming!

481
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,620
Have a seat, Ziming.

482
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,420
I'm sure I don't need to
introduce Ziming in detail.

483
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,980
He's the Deputy General Manager
of Starlight Jewelry

484
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,660
and a key young talent

485
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,380
the group has been cultivating

486
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,300
these years.

487
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,500
I propose

488
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,020
that Wei Ziming also oversee
Starlight Jewelry's operations

489
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,740
on behalf of the group,

490
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,020
with veto power.

491
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,380
I object!

492
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,340
I am the General Manager
of Starlight Jewelry.

493
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,860
I don't oppose Wei Ziming

494
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,700
participating in our daily operations

495
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,460
and management.

496
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,740
But with veto power?

497
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,340
On what grounds?

498
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,020
Zhizhi,

499
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,020
I hope there's no misunderstanding here.

500
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,980
We all want what's best for the group.

501
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,940
The bid for Drizzt

502
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,540
is crucial

503
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,260
for us.

504
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,260
So I want Ziming

505
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,900
to lend you his support.

506
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,180
Ziming, say something.

507
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,180
I'm honored to serve as Acting Director

508
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,780
and to work with Zhizhi

509
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,420
on securing the bid for Drizzt.

510
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,140
I believe

511
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,140
I won't let the group down.

512
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,740
Ji Baijian?

513
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,100
What are you doing here?

514
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,500
You know exactly why I'm here.

515
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,900
I oppose the resolution just passed.

516
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,580
Mr. Ji Baijian,

517
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,500
on what grounds

518
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,060
do you object

519
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,620
to our internal meeting?

520
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,140
I am Ye Shengheng,
son of the late chairman

521
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,700
of Starlight Group,

522
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,540
Ye Xiaoting.

523
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,420
Shengheng?

524
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,180
It's really you?

525
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,620
Shengheng,

526
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,260
it is you.

527
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,980
You're alive.

528
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,740
I searched for you for so long.

529
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,380
Let me get a good look at you.

530
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,380
My boy,

531
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,460
I've made offerings

532
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,740
to your parents and you every year.

533
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,220
Why didn't you

534
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,780
come home to me?

535
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,700
Come home to you?

536
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,380
All these years,

537
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,500
you never stopped

538
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,820
trying to have me killed, did you?

539
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,500
If I had come to you,

540
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,100
I probably wouldn't be alive today.

541
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,020
Kid,

542
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,140
I don't know what you mean.

543
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,420
My parents were murdered.

544
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,460
Kid,

545
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,420
the police didn't find any evidence

546
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,340
that it was a murder.

547
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,620
Don't just make wild guesses.

548
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:51,980
Evidence, you say?

549
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,780
You should be familiar

550
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,060
with this watch, right?

551
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,900
Why did you bring this here?

552
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,980
It is evidence!

553
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,380
Destroy it now.

554
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,420
What about this watch?

555
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,020
Let your secretary, Qian Guanshu,

556
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,660
explain this.

557
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,260
Was Qian Guanshu behind this too?

558
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,100
Qian Guanshu is just a secretary.

559
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,940
Would he dare do any of this

560
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,860
without you pulling the strings?

561
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,540
Ye Taiting,

562
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,980
someone will come forward today

563
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,140
and explain everything to everyone.

564
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,700
