80
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,900
was driven to this state

81

93

Under the guise of fund investment,

94
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,500
he transferred
the entire core team away,

95
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,540

agreed on together.

Listen for yourself.

105
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,460
How could he possibly

106
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,740
agree to marry his daughter

107
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,700

108
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,300

your marriage alliance is fake.

is to get revenge
for what happened back then, right?

were in your family's warehouse.

123
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,140
So now,

124
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,660
he's using this marriage alliance

125

130
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,820
he's always suspected your father

131
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,540
was involved in his mother's death.

132
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,740

133
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,980
to take everything from your father.

134
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,820
Impossible.

135
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,340
Absolutely impossible.

136
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,380

311

313
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,060
placed those rough gemstones

314
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,620
in my warehouse!

315
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,540
Back then,

316
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,700
when the scandal

317
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,420
about Dafu Jewelry
swapping high-quality stones

318
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,900
for inferior ones broke out,

319
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,660
I had no idea they were in my warehouse.

320
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,020
By the time I found out,

321
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,740
your mother

322
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,940
had already taken her own life
because of this.

323
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,100
If I had come forward then,

324
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,300
I'd have had no way to clear my name.

325
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,700
Yes.

326
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,780
I investigated in Italy too.

327
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,420
The rough gemstones were picked up
by an Asian man.

328
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,820
Paid in cash.

329
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,660
I got the transaction records.

330
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,660
There was
no signature of yours on them...

331
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,940
But those gemstones

332
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,700
did end up in my warehouse.

333
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,420
I never dared to touch or sell

334
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,940
those gemstones.

335
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,300
I've always kept them in the warehouse.

336
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,060
To avoid drawing attention,

337
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,420
I even listed them as inferior quality.

338
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,580
Some time ago,

339
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,540
Yi Wenhan developed a low-end series

340
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,620
and used those gemstones.

341
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,780
When I found out,

342
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,540
I immediately
called off this product line

343
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,780
and sealed up all the bulk goods!

344
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,340
Baijian,

345
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,620

your family's rough gemstones.

346
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,060
Yes, Dafu Jewelry's downfall

347
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,540
helped Starlight Jewelry rise.

348
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,580
But I

349
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,060
am not that kind of vile man!

350
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,620
I can swear to you.

351
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,620
If I had anything to do
with your family's gemstones,

352
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,140
may I rot in the grave!

353
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,460
Then tell me,

354
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,660

355
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,660

356
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,820

360

370
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,260

371
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,860

372

378
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,180
I need to explain.

379
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,340
Fine.

380
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,820
Go ahead.

381
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,820
I'd love to hear

382
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,940
what excuse you've come up with.

383
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,500
Here's the thing.

384
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,980
My mother designed
a piece of jewelry back then,

385
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,700
but the rough gemstones were swapped.

386
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,020
When the scandal broke
about the inferior stones,

387
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,580
she was bombarded
with a torrent of abuse.

388
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,140
My mother's death

389
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,140
made my father furious.

390
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,100
He vowed to find the culprit

391
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
and get revenge.

392
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,020
So he wanted me to use
the arranged marriage

393
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,060
to investigate your family.

394
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,420
I... I'd been living abroad.

395
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,780
I didn't know you.

396
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,620
So when he asked me, I agreed.

397
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,940
But as I got to know you,

398
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,700
I started to understand you

399
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,900
and I fell in love with you.

Zhizhi,

00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,420

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,820

00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,700
By the way, Mr. Ye,

493
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,940
I just got some news.

494
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,700
The Italian jewelry brand, Drizzt,

495
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,460
is preparing to enter the China market.

496
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,900
They're recruiting agents in China
for the first time.

497
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,160
[Drizzt China Market
Agent Recruitment RFP]

498
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,620
Drizzt is a major international brand.

499
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,380
If we can partner with them,

500
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,860
all our current problems

501
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,420
will be solved.

502
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,700
Are there any difficulties

503
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,980
in acquiring their agency rights?

504
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,580
There are some challenges.

505
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,180
From what I know,

506
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,300
their requirements
for the China agency partnership

507
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,980
involve significant capital.

508
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,180
And the public tender
is in just ten days.

509
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,500
Securing the Drizzt agency rights

510
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,460
is crucial for us.

511
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,340
So, I want you
to raise the capital immediately,

512
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,340
at all costs!

513
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,180
Understood.

514
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,300
Also, Mr. Ye,

515
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,740
now that the marriage

516
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,220
between Song Zhizhi
and Ji Baijian is off,

517
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,900
there's one person

518
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,260
we can use to our advantage.

519
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,020
Who?

520
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,740
Wei Ziming.

521
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,580
Actually, the Song family

522
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,940
knew exactly what was on his mind.

523
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,860
But he never dares to confess.

524
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,740
It all came down to his background.

525
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,740
Plus, Song Zhizhi

526
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,980
only sees him as a brother.

527
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:12,940
So,

528
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
he just endures it silently.

529
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,740
I see.

530
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,340
He needs a title.

531
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,500
Mr. Wei,

532
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,620
I thought you weren't going to come.

533
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,300
Just say what you mean.

534
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,380
What do you want from me?

535
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,740
Mr. Wei, be patient.

536
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,540
Actually, I've been looking
for an opportunity

537
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,780
to talk with you.

538
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,580
Right now, Starlight Jewelry

539
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,900
is losing employees.

540
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,220
With your talent,

541
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,420
only being

542
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,780
a Deputy General Manager there

543
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,140
is a waste.

544
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,660
I was wondering
if you'd like to join our group?

545
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,340
Mr. Ye

546
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,700
would value you highly

547
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,100
and offer you

548
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,140
a much better platform for development.

549
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,540
After all,

550
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,700
Starlight Jewelry and Starlight Group

551
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,300
are on completely different scales.

552
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,620
Mr. Qian, you should know

553
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,660
the only reason I stay

554
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,300
at Starlight Jewelry
is out of gratitude to the Song family.

555
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,260
As for the status
and position you mentioned,

556
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,740
they hold no appeal for me.

557
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,420
But you

558
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,900
don't carry the Song name.

559
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,500
What have you gained from them
besides a chance

560
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,820
to repay the favor?

561
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,260
You can't even confess your feelings

562
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,420
to the person you love.

563
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,780
But if you join our group,
