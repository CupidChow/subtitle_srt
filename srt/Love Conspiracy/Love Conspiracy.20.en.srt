00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,100
Look at this mess.

20
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,340
You've had so much to drink.

21
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,140
What are you doing here?

22
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,900
Just leave it there. Stop cleaning up.

If I don't clean,

24
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,380
will you do it?

I'll drink with you.

Come on, Wenhan.

35
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,260
I've worked myself to the bone
all these years,

36
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,540
and in the end, I've lost everything.

37
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,820
I just don't know what to do.

38
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,620
All I wanted

39
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,420
was for you to grow up happily

40
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,500
and for us to live a normal, simple life

41
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,180
like a regular family.

42

But now it seems

43
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,140
it's too late for all that.

44
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,220
I came today

I'm going to face the consequences.

51
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,220
But Wenhan, don't be afraid.

52
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,860
Though Qian Guanshu helped me
secure bail pending trial,

53
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,980
now, for you,

54
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,540

Hope I can protect you.

Why should you take the blame?

58

Qian Guanshu is to blame!

59
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,780
He's the one

60
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,940
who sent me to the orphanage
when I was little.

61

You secretly visited me.

62

that one day

you'd bring me home,

would be together happily.

And now?

67

My whole life, I've been walking
the path you laid out for me.

68
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,420
But did either of you ever
consider how I felt?

69
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,540
Yes, Wenhan.

70
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,260
You're right.

71
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,220
As parents,

72
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,620
we were selfish.

on the phone.

105
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,100
Are you really confused,

106
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,420
or are you playing dumb with me?

107
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,940
I'll be blunt.

108
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,300
I have evidence

109
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,980
of your past crimes with Zhenhua Group.

110
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,260
I'm guessing

111
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,340
you don't want the police

112
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,980
to get this evidence, right?

113
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,620
You're threatening me?

114
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,180
Take a good look at yourself.

115
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,660
You're a wanted criminal.

believe anything you say?

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,140
I'm the son of Qian Guanshu
and Nie Wenzhi?

119
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,460
Does that change your mind
even a little?

120
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,060
You're Guanshu

121
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,780
and Nie Wenzhi's son?

122

about your shady dealings.

125
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,620
He privately collected a lot of evidence

126
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,100
and gave it to me for safekeeping.

127
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,540
It's kind of like his insurance policy.

128
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,540
If that's the insurance policy

129
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,860
your father left you,

130
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,060
why would you trade it to me?

131
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,460
Because Qian Guanshu
doesn't deserve to be my father.

132
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,100
He never cared about me or my mother.

133
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,820
If that's how he treats
his own wife and son,

134
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,980
do you really think he's loyal

00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
Alright.

376
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,740
Take your time.

377
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,460
I...

378
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,380
Dad won't force you.

379
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,620
Mr. Wei,

380
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,620
regarding the photo you asked me
to look into last night,

381
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,900
it's confirmed

382
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,100
to be a photo
of Ye Xiaoting and his son.

383
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,620
Ye Xiaoting?

384
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,100
Ye Taiting's older brother?

385
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,260
Yes.

386
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,580
Over a decade ago,

387
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,100
Ye Xiaoting and Ye Taiting

388
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,660
ran Starlight Group together.

389
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,740
Ye Xiaoting was the Chairman then,

390
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,620
and Ye Taiting was the General Manager.

391
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,540
But they two

392
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,580
often clashed over differences

393
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,740
in management philosophy.

394
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,340
Later, Ye Xiaoting's family

395
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,780
were in a car accident,

396
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
and he died.

397
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,620
So Ye Taiting
took over the entire group.

398
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,580
Alright.

399
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,260
I know about the car accident.

400
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,780
You can go now.

401
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,660
And, we're still looking into the matter

402
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,020
concerning your mother.
There are no leads yet.

403
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,820
Mr. Ye.

404
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,940
Ms. Song is here.

405
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,460
Zhizhi, you're here.

406
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,420
This is the proposal
for the Drizzt project

407
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,540
from Zhifu Jewelry that I took

408
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,740
from Ji Baijian's place.

409
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,780
Excellent.

410
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:56,820
Mr. Ye,

411
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,740
this is a deal.

412
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,460
What about what you promised me?

413
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,900
Zhizhi,

414
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,300
don't you trust me?

415
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,700
I had it ready for you.

416
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,860
Look at you.

417
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,100
Alright.

418
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,180
The list

419
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,060
of designers and suppliers you asked for

420
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,300
is all here.

421
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,100
Guanshu,

422
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,780
with this proposal,

423
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,220
our chances of winning have increased.

424
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,340
Zhizhi,

425
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,420
perfect timing.

426
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,820
I just received
some new high-mountain tea.

427
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,940
Join me for a cup over there.

428
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,420
That won't be necessary.

429
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,500
Thanks for the cooperation.

430
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,380
I have other things to attend to.

431
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,500
Guanshu, see Zhizhi out.

432
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,180
Got it.

433
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,620
I know the way.

434
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,260
That girl certainly has character.

435
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,860
Ziming?

436
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,980
Why are you...?

437
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,660
I saw you were working late again.

438
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,780
Worried you hadn't eaten,

439
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,100
so I brought you some late-night snacks.

440
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,500
Thank you.

441
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,820
We've both been so busy lately.

442
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,540
Haven't had time to properly talk.

443
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,380
Yes.

444
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,540
The company's team got poached.

445
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,220
I'm recruiting new designers now.

446
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,780
This is the state
the company's operations are in.

447
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,820
I'm not sure what to do next.

448
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,620
And I don't even know if these designers

449
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,300
will want to come here.

450
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,300
What are your thoughts
on Ji Baijian then?

451
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,580
On Ji Baijian?

452
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,460
I don't really have any.

453
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,620
I'm not in the mood
to think about that right now.

454
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,340
I'm just focused on work.

455
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,140
Zhizhi.

456
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,260
I saw

457
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,020
you went back to his place.

458
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,660
Yes.

459
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,020
Because there are still

460
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,740
some things unresolved between us.

461
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,340
Look what I brought you.

462
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,380
What a feast.

463
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,500
By the way,

464
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,380
where did you get that photo

465
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,820
you asked me to look into?

466
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,460
Did... Did you find something?

467
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:30,900
Not yet.

468
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,380
It's just that knowing the source

469
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,060
makes it easier to investigate.

470
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,620
But

471
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,060
that photo belongs to a friend of mine.

472
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,140
He probably isn't clear
about its source.

473
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,460
Is it

474
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,860
related to Ji Baijian?

475
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,340
Ziming,

476
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,060
I don't want to lie to you.

477
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,060
It is indeed Ji Baijian's.

478
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,500
And what's between him and me...

479
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,140
It's very complicated.

480
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,260
It's not something
that can be resolved quickly.

481
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,860
And I have my own reasons.

482
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,220
I understand.

483
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,100
I'll leave then.

484
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,380
Make sure you eat something.

485
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,820
[Wei Ziming]
Mr. Ye, I'll go to the reception

486
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,380
tomorrow evening with you.

487
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,220
You're off work early today.

488
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,700
What brings you here?

489
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,060
Where's Song Zhizhi?

490
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,740
She's not back yet.

491
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,060
She's met with Ye Taiting alone

492
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,340
a few times recently.

493
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,340
I bet she's got an agenda

494
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,220
coming back to you now.

495
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,740
I know about her meetings
with Ye Taiting.

496
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,940
I've been busy

497
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,340
and haven't had a chance to tell you.

498
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,660
The incident with the rough gemstones

499
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,060
really had nothing to do with Song Shan.

500
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,100
I found the photos of the goods pickup
and warehousing.

501
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,980
The person who picked them up
was Qian Guanshu.

502
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,220
So Ye Taiting must be behind it.

503
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,940
Ye Taiting?

504
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,700
That unrepentant old scum!

505
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,740
I suspected him too,

506
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,660
but I never got the evidence.

507
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,780
Now it's confirmed.

508
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,620
He ruined our family

509
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,940
and made me lose
the person I loved most.

510
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,620
I will make him pay!

511
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,780
It seems your judgment back then
was right.

512
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,460
What's your next move?

513
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Ye Taiying's position
is now on shaky ground.

514
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,220
The reason I'm pouring all my energy

515
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,140
into the new company

516
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,940
is to use it to defeat Starlight Group.

517
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,460
I've heard some rumors

518
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,260
that if Ye Taiting fails to secure

519
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,740
the Drizzt project this time,

520
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,900
the board will likely remove him.

521
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,540
Indeed.

522
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,060
If things go smoothly for us,

523
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,980
it will be a huge blow

524
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,100
to Ye Taiting.

525
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,900
But there's quite a bit of criticism
aimed at me

526
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,900
within our group right now.

527
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,620
I'm hoping you can speak up for me

528
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,980
at the upcoming board meeting.

529
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,860
At first,

530
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,700
I thought you were supporting
Zhifu Jewelry

531
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,100
just for Song Zhizhi.

532
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,900
Now I see I was wrong about you.

533
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,260
You've actually got some brains.

534
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,420
When did you learn to cook?

535
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,820
Smells pretty good.

536
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,540
Hello?

537
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:17,980
Hello?

538
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,860
You'll be off work soon, right?

539
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,300
Ji Baijian,

540
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,460
I won't go to your place anymore.

541
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,060
I've already given the fake proposal
you gave me

542
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,100
to Ye Taiting.

543
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,900
Our little act

544
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,180
is over.

545
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,540
I hope you will

546
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,460
transfer the shares
of Starlight Jewelry to me soon.

547
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,500
Then we'll be even.

548
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,940
He believed that proposal?

549
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,900
At least he doesn't seem
to have caught on yet.

550
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,140
Otherwise,
he wouldn't have sent me the list.

551
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,860
Well,

552
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,500
is everything going smoothly for you?

553
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,540
Of course it is.

554
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,340
Mr. Ji,

555
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,420
you only poached a few of my designers.

556
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,500
I'll find better ones.

557
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:06,740
Fine.

558
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,500
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

559
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,580
Zhizhi.

560
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,660
