188
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,420
Please pick up the pace.

189
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,460
Mr. Yi looks confident.

190
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,300
Seems like he's sure

191
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,980
to win this year's championship.

192
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:01,900
Where is she?

193
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,300
Her car's at the hotel,

194
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,740
but she's nowhere to be found.

195
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,500
Time's almost up.

196
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,500
How about this?

197
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,740
You go ask the organizers

198
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,460
to reschedule for later.

199
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,700
Song Zhizhi is
from Starlight Group, after all.

200
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:16,820
No.

201
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,340
She's using a pseudonym

202
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,980
instead of her real name

203
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,900
to avoid gossip.

204
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,580
I'll check the underground garage.

205
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,780
You keep looking around nearby.

206
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,420
Song Zhizhi!

207
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,700
Song Zhizhi.

208
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,660
Song Zhizhi.

209
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,620
Song Zhizhi.

210
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,140
What are you doing? Open the door.

211
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,500
Song Zhizhi.

212
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,500
Song Zhizhi.

213
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,300
Song Zhizhi!

214
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,580
I will work with Zhizhi
to take Starlight Jewelry

215
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,540
to new heights!

216
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,500
Winning this award

217
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,260
is all thanks to my own efforts.

218
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,140
Are you okay?

219
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,100
Is the competition over?

220
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,380
Did Yi Wenhan win?

221
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,100
What nonsense are you talking about?

222
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,860
There's still time.

223
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,700
Isn't that Ms. Song?

224
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,620
She's only showing up now?

225
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,940
Zhizhi, what are you doing here?

226
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,100
I'm Enna.

227
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,780
I'm here to compete.

228
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,420
But there are

229
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,220
less than 30 minutes left.

230
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,460
You can't possibly finish in time.

231
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,300
Who says I can't?

232
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,380
You're late.

233
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,700
You're disqualified.

234
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,700
Exactly.

235
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,780
Just because your family
holds the competition?

236
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,520
[Time remaining: 29:54]

237
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,980
According to the rules,

238
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,420
as long as the contestant arrives
and completes their work

239
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,220
within the allotted time,

240
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,140
their entry remains valid.

241
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,780
Miss, let her begin.

242
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,820
Three, two, one.

243
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,060
Time's up.

244
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
The competition is over.

245
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,860
Thank you, everyone.

246
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,140
Once the hostesses

247
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,620
have collected all the entries,

248
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,820
the works of all the contestants

249
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,460
will be displayed

250
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,900
on the screen.

251
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,340
What we're seeing now

252
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,260
are all 25 pieces of work

253
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,460
from every contestant.

254
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,780
We'll have the judges give their scores

255
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,540
and cast their votes.

256
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,100
So, who will the judges

257
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,740
cast their votes for?

258
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,180
We're all eager to find out.

259
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,540
Alright.

260
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,240
[Contestant: Enna, Votes: 562]
[Contestant: Yi Wenhan, Votes: 562]

261
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,220
The results are in.

262
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,380
Two designers

263
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,140
have received the same number of votes.

264
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,740
They are Enna

265
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,340
and Yi Wenhan!

266
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,140
Give it up for them!

267
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,620
Congratulations to you both.

268
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,380
Now,

269
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,860
we'll turn it over to our judges

270
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,220
to determine the winner.

271
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,100
How is a tie even possible?

272
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,820
You're clearly with Starlight Jewelry.

273
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,300
Did you

274
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,780
rig the theme in advance?

275
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,900
I'll expose you!

276
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,380
Stop making such accusations!

277
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,540
Anyone with half a brain can see

278
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,980
Ms. Song's design is on another level

279
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,540
compared to Yi Wenhan's!

280
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,780
It even rivals Anne's.

281
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,500
Fine, Song Zhizhi.

282
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,860
Since I can't win...

283
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,500
No need to vote!

284
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,580
Zhizhi,

285
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,820
since you want this championship
this badly,

286
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,260
I'll let you have it.

287
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,340
After all, I know

288
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,620
how rigged these competitions can be.

289
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,260
I don't care about winning.

290
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,300
All I care about is you.

291
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,660
You're letting me have it?

292
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,660
Rigged?

293
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,220
Have you forgotten?

294
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,260
You plagiarized my work
in the preliminary round!

295
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,140
Without me,

296
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,460
you wouldn't even have qualified
for the competition.

297
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,820
Everyone, look at the screen.

298
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,460
On the left

299
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,580
is my work from high school.

300
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,420
On the right

301
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,140
is Mr. Yi Wenhan's entry
from the preliminary round.

302
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,380
The resemblance is obvious, isn't it?

303
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,100
This has to be rigged.

304
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,420
Zhizhi.

305
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,340
Stop making a scene.

306
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,660
And there's another thing.

307
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,780
All of Mr. Yi Wenhan's previous works

308
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,180
were actually ghost designed by others.

309
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,820
I've been in a deal with Mr. Yi Wenhan

310
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,900
for five years.

311
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,260
Back then, my mother was seriously ill

312
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,380
and I needed money.

313
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,100
These are all my designs.

314
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,980
Here's my

315
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,100
copyright registration certificate.

316
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,140
And these

317
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,420
are the copyright transfer agreements

318
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
from when Yi Wenhan bought my works.

319
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,780
He published them

320
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,540
as his own.

321
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,260
You're framing me!

322
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,020
You're making things up!

323
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,140
You copied the works
and hired the ghost designer.

324
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,780
What does any of that
have to do with me?

325
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,700
Yi Wenhan,

326
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,460
we've treated you well.

327
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,260
How could you be so morally bankrupt?

328
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,620
From now on,

329
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,260
Yi Wenhan is disqualified
from the competition

330
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,060
and suspended from all duties
at the company!

331
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,620
He'll wait for further investigation!

332
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,940
Song Zhizhi...

333
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,180
Let go of me. Let go!

334
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,100
Song Zhizhi set me up.

335
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,700
Yeah, I saw everything.

336
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,460
I'm hanging up.

337
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:28,940
Hello?

338
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,100
I thought you had
arranged for Wenhan to win?

339
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,500
But we didn't expect Song Zhizhi

340
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,300
to join the competition or get hold

341
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,260
of the evidence that Wenhan plagiarized.

342
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,260
You said she wasn't that clever.

343
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,900
That was before.

344
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,380
After Xiaofei's birthday,

345
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,140
I felt she'd changed somehow.

346
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,420
Do you need me to do anything?

347
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,460
Look into it thoroughly.

348
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,940
I've been taking care
of my little flower for years,

349
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,780
and now it suddenly wants
to bloom and grow its own way?

350
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,500
I won't allow it.

351
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,620
Song Zhizhi.

352
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,220
Since you refuse to behave,

353
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,380
don't blame me for what happens next.

354
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:27,740
Mom.

355
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,740
Mom, look, it's Song Zhizhi.

356
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,700
She's really with Baijian?

357
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,980
Be quiet.

358
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,780
Read the room.

359
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,340
Get a grip.

360
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,860
I'm going over.

361
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:52,900
Aunt Wenzhi.

362
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,100
Xiaofei.

363
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,420
Zhizhi,

364
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,860
why did you come with Baijian?

365
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,900
I wanted to surprise everyone.

366
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,580
I never realized

367
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,580
how exceptional Baijian is.

368
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,620
So,

369
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,420
do you like this surprise?

370
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,740
Love it.

371
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,820
You're adorable.

372
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,660
You taught me well.

373
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,700
Yi Wenhan

374
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,420
is such a scumbag.

375
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,020
Can't believe I actually loved him.

376
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,300
What kind of mother

377
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,740
raises a son like that?

378
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,060
Well, Aunt Wenzhi, Xiaofei,

379
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,940
you two carry on. I'm going back over.

380
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:31,900
Okay.

381
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,220
Look at her.
What's there to be so proud of?

382
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,820
You couldn't pull it off.

383
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,900
Don't blame others for being stronger.

384
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,820
Men don't like whiners.

385
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,340
Good evening,

386
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,700
everyone.

387
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,060
First, on behalf of Starlight Jewelry
and Jihong Group,

388
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,900
I'd like to thank all of you

389
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,220
for joining us at this gathering!

390
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,420
Besides,

391
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,740
the champion of the competition

392
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,420
is my eldest daughter, Song Zhizhi!

393
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,180
I hereby announce

394
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,100
that Zhizhi

395
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,140
will be joining the design department
of Starlight Jewelry!

396
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,180
I hope she'll have your support.

397
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,820
Song Zhizhi's win was rigged!

398
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,580
Let go!

399
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,540
It was rigged!

400
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,220
Let go of me! Let go!

401
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,300
It was rigged!

402
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,300
Yi Wenhan!

403
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,380
This is not the place for your nonsense!

404
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,180
Take him away!

405
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,020
Dad,

406
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,660
if you do that,
everyone will just think I'm guilty.

407
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,460
I have nothing to hide.

408
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,900
Yi Wenhan,

409
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,780
let's hear

410
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,220
what you have to say.

411
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,740
Everyone!

412
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,660
I have something shocking

413
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,900
to share with everyone.

414
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,060
The one who accused me, Song Zhizhi,

415
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,420
is the real plagiarist.

416
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,180
On the left

417
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,420
is Song Zhizhi's entry
for this competition.

418
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,860
On the right

419
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,700
is a sketch titled "First Love"

420
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,340
posted by international
jewelry design rising star Anne

421
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,420
on her personal page.

422
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,340
The two are 70 percent identical!

423
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,140
Mr. Yi.

424
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,380
You've got quite the eye.

425
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,100
You accuse me of plagiarism
based on one piece?

426
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,900
Then let me ask you,

427
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,900
as a plagiarist yourself,

428
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,540
what right or credibility

429
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,780
do you have to question me?

430
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,900
I knew

431
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,660
someone as dishonest as Song Zhizhi

432
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,380
would deny it

433
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,300
and even try to pin it on me.

434
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,980
That's why

435
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,380
I brought
Anne's original hand-drawn sketches.

436
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,340
Compare them,

437
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,580
and you'll know

438
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,780
everything I've said is true.

439
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,100
Here.

440
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,580
You even forged something like this?

441
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,300
Why are these sketches real?

442
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,320
[Pendant]

443
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,620
How did you get these sketches?

444
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,260
Anne gave them to me herself, of course.

445
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,300
Impossible!

446
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,860
Because I am Anne.

447
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,060
You're Anne?

448
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,300
I was going to spare you some dignity.

449
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,820
But since you have no shame,

450
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,500
I won't hold back.

451
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,380
I've got

452
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,660
a surprise for you.

453
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,980
