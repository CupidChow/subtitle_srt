00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,500
I got some great tea recently

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
and wanted to share it with you.

34
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,540
Oh, you kid.

35
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,140
You're too kind.

36
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,500
Our collaboration

37
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,100

38
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,860
And it's really thanks to you

39
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,300
that I could form a new team.

40
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,220
We're family.

41
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,860
Collaboration is only natural.

55
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,660
that for this agency selection,

56
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,220
Drizzt isn't just looking
for strong financial backing,

57
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,020
but also for absolute authority
and influence

was to take down Ye Taiting.

129
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,860

Things have gone too far now.

185
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,540
I won't do anything else to hurt you.

186
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,020
Come in.

187
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,260

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,060
Qian Guanshu?

192
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,580
Why would he give you a watch?

193
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,500
Qian Guanshu was my husband.

194
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,340
He was your husband?

195
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:45,860
Then

196
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,460
why did you marry my dad?

197
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,300
Because we were desperately poor.

198
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,900
Especially after I gave birth to Wenhan,

199
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,580
we could barely make ends meet.

200
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,420
One day, Qian told me

201
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,740
the Song family was really wealthy,

202
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,260
and the man of the house
was still single.

203
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,580
If I could marry into the Song family,

204
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,500
I could get into high society,

205
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,940
have plenty of money,

206
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,060
and secure a happy life for my son.

207
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,420
So, for money,

208
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,380
and for his own selfish desires,

209
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,060
Qian Guanshu just handed you
and his son over to someone else?

210
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,740
You could say that.

211
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,380
But later, after Qian Guanshu reported
to the police at Starlight Group

212
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,700
and had Wenhan arrested.

213
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,500
I've completely given up on him.

214
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,220
He only ever cares about himself.

215
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,180
He never considered us family.

216
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,260
Qian Guanshu has done
so many evil things.

217
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,420
Why didn't you speak up sooner

218
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,260
and let him face the consequences?

219
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,740
You're oversimplifying things.

220
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,540
I know Qian Guanshu very well.

221
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,260
He's meticulous in everything he does.

222
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,420
He won't give me
any chance to catch him out.

223
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,740
Then why are you reaching out to me now?

224
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,500
He's utterly ruthless
when it comes to his own interests.

225
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,860
He even sacrificed his own son.

226
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,260
I have to make him pay.

227
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,700
If I keep helping him hide the truth,
I'd be failing Wenhan.

228
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,340
Back when he gave me this watch,

229
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,020
he insisted I mustn't let anyone
discover it.

230
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,460
I was very puzzled.

231
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,780
It was the first time
I saw such a sinister look

232
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,700
in Qian Guanshu's eyes.

233
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,780
Even now, the memory
sends a chill down my spine.

234
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,580
My gut tells me

235
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,300
this watch

236
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,100
hides a huge secret.

237
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,620
And it's definitely

238
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,100
nothing good.

239
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,100
I hope you can defeat Qian Guanshu

240
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,900
and make him face the punishment
he deserves.

241
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,180
Qian Guanshu has been
with Ye Taiting all these years.

242
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,860
He must have done plenty of evil deeds.

243
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,980
There must be

244
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,420
a huge secret behind this watch.

245
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,940
I'll look into this watch.

246
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,220
With this brand,

247
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,100
we should be able to trace the owner
through the serial number.

248
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,060
I'll do my best.

249
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,660

Mr. Qian,

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,700
you've lived so cautiously
all these years.

281
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,060
It must be exhausting.

Ms. Song, what are you implying?

283
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,020
Nothing.

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,140
Just making an observation.

285
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,700
You and Mr. Ye are quite alike.

286
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,620
You're both so meticulous,

287
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,740
always thinking several steps ahead.

Mr. Ye, congratulations
on your double happiness.

293
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,180
Not double.

294

It's triple.

295
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,580
Triple?

Mr. Ye, since when do you have a son?

302

I've been working on confirming this

00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,980
for a while.

304
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,580
It's been such a long time, after all.

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,620
We should avoid any mistakes.

with all the group's operations.

00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,620
Mr. Ji.

376
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,180
Let's make a deal.

377
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,300
A deal?

378
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,460
The rough gemstones incident
was over a decade ago.

379
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,740
I doubt you'll be able to
reopen the case.

380
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,980
But I have some information

381
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,580
that might be very helpful to you.

382
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,100
Go on.

383
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,740
I believe

384
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,860
you'll be very interested

385
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,300
in the matter of Ye Taiting's son.

386
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,940
Wei Ziming.

387
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,380
Who would've thought

388
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,020
Wei Ziming is Ye Taiting's son?

389
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,700
Well, I'd heard Ye Taiting had a son.

390
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,620
Got lost somehow later.

391
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,620
They searched but never found him.

392
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,580
And now he just reappears?

393
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,260
Any update on that nursing home

394
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,540
for Wei Ziming's mother

395
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,340
you were looking into?

396
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,780
I actually dug up a secret.

397
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,180
Guess who owns that nursing home?

398
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:39,900
Who?

399
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,180
Ye Taiting.

400
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,020
And

401
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,300
according to a nurse there,

402
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,860
Ye Taiting never once visited

403
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,740
Wei Ziming's mother,

404
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,940
but he kept asking
about her son's whereabouts.

405
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,740
Recently, Ms. Wang's mental state

406
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,860
had actually improved a bit.

407
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,060
She said some things about her son.

408
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,900
Ye Taiting was thrilled.

409
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,220
Then

410
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,260
three days later,

411
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,180
Ms. Wang died in an accident.

412
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,380
Died in an accident?

413
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,540
According to that nurse,

414
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,100
Ms. Wang was determined
to send her son away.

415
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,940
Said something about not letting him
grow up near a murderer.

416
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,900
A murderer?

417
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,940
This is Ms. Wang's belongings.

418
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,820
I had someone get them out immediately.

419
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,540
Take a look.

420
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,340
How old was he
when he was sent to the orphanage?

421
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,180
Eight, I think.

422
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,140
Eight years old?

423
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,860
He was eight, and I was seven.

424
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,380
The year my parents
died in the car crash.

425
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,380
Qian Guanshu,

426
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,500
Ji Baijian is already looking into

427
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,060
the nursing home
where Ziming's mother was!

428
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,540
Did you know about this?

429
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,380
I didn't expect Ji Baijian
to find it so quickly.

430
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,580
After I had her dealt with,

431
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,380
I handled the aftermath swiftly.

432
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,740
I even replaced all the medical staff

433
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,660
who had contact with her.

434
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,420
It's just...

435
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,420
Just what?

436
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,580
There was one young nurse
I didn't get to in time.

437
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,820
Qian Guanshu,

438
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,220
you always mess up

439
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,020
and leave me to clean up your mess!

440
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,660
Mr. Ye,

441
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,940
I transferred

442
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,420
that nurse to another city.

443
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,660
There's no way Ji Baijian can find her.

444
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,020
But she

445
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,940
already gave the woman's belongings

446
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,540
to Ji Baijian!

447
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,140
I checked all her belongings.

448
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,180
Got rid of what I had to.

449
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,180
There were just some old drawings.

450
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,180
I've taken care of them all.

451
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,420
Don't worry.

452
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,540
Are you sure?

453
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,140
I'm sure.

454
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,340
Ziming,

455
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,980
what brings you here?

456
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,500
You must be tired lately

457
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,940
with all the company work.

458
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,620
It has been exhausting.

459
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,660
You know

460
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,220
the company isn't what it used to be.

461
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,060
So there's a lot to handle.

462
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,180
But for Starlight Jewelry,

463
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:01,940
I have no complaints.

464
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,900
It's alright.

465
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,220
Everything will be better soon.

466
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,100
Soon, I'll be able to
help the Song family

467
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,300
and you.

468
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,540
Once I have a higher status,

469
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,260
everyone will see me in a new light.

470
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:28,980
Ziming,

471
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,060
what do you mean by that?

472
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,900
You'll know soon enough.

473
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,380
I won't allow Ji Baijian to deceive

474
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,820
and hurt you again.

475
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,740
I'll protect the Song family

476
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,260
and you.

477
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,140
What happened between Ji Baijian and me

478
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,940
is in the past.

479
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,020
I don't want this to affect you.

480
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,380
I'll handle

481
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,860
my relationship issues.

482
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,980
You've forgiven him?

483
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,620
Have you forgotten what he did to you?

484
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,460
I haven't.

485
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,700
I just

486
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,740
don't want revenge anymore.

487
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,140
For me and him,

488
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,780
only when we don't contact each other
do we have a chance...

489
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,380
Ziming,

490
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,820
don't worry about my issues.

491
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,940
But you seem weird today.

492
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,500
Is something wrong?

493
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,500
What did you mean

494
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,340
about a "higher status"?

495
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,540
Zhizhi,

496
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,380
if I had a higher status,

497
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,220
would you

498
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,380
still see me as a brother?

499
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,420
Of course.

500
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,620
You'll always be my brother.

501
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,580
I see.

502
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,580
I should go.

503
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,500
See you tomorrow.

504
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,380
See you tomorrow.

505
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,660
Guanshu,

506
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,580
everyone is speculating

507
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,100
about which side Song Zhizhi is on.

508
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,020
What's your take?

509
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,380
To be honest, Mr. Ye,

510
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,580
I'm worried that Song Zhizhi
might betray us at the last minute

511
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,340
and abandon the bid

512
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,020
to ensure Zhifu Jewelry wins.

513
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,020
But...

514
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,740
But we've already

515
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,820
agreed to having Starlight Jewelry

516
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,460
represent the group in the bid.

517
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,380
It's a bit of a problem.

518
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,660
Normally,

519
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,380
Song Zhizhi wouldn't

520
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,620
take her father's life's work as a joke.

521
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,620
But it's hard to say.

522
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,220
She holds shares in Zhifu Jewelry too.

523
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,660
And her relationship with Ji Baijian...

524
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,340
Guanshu,

525
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,340
keep your eyes open.

526
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,820
Actually, we just need to

527
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,340
ensure Song Zhizhi

528
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,420
isn't the presenter

529
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,740
during the bid.

530
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,620
And I've already

531
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,380
found the perfect person for the role.

532
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,620
Who is it?

533
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,620
Mr. Ye,

534
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,940
you wanted to see me?

535
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Guanshu,

536
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,940
who could be a better fit
for this than him?

537
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,360
[Drizzt Bidding Event Roster]

538
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,360
[Wei Ziming,
Starlight Jewelry Co., Ltd.]

539
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,820
Have you seen this?

540
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,420
Starlight Group's bid presenter
has been changed.

541
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,500
I saw.

542
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,300
Wei Ziming must have switched sides.

543
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,380
This is very bad for Zhizhi.

544
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,580
What should we do next?

545
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,340
Come on.

546
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,300
Come with me to Starlight Group.

547
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:40,900
Let's go!

548
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,780
Ziming,

549
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,580
make sure you prepare
the bid presentation well.

550
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,380
We all have great confidence in you.

551
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,620
Don't feel pressured.

552
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:50,700
I won't.

553
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:57,900
Mr. Ye,

554
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,740
what do you mean?

555
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,900
Why was I replaced as the bid presenter

556
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,020
by Wei Ziming?

557
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,700
Ziming,

558
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,860
you two planned this, didn't you?

559
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,380
Zhizhi,

560
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,420
you're both from Starlight Jewelry.

561
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,460
Does it make any difference

562
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,780
which one of you presents?

563
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,300
Of course it does!

564
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,780
Though Starlight Jewelry

565
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,700
is a subsidiary of Starlight Group,

566
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,660
it operates

567
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,020
relatively independently.

568
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,380
And, I am the major shareholder

569
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,540
and General Manager.

570
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,700
While Wei Ziming

571
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,180
is only the Deputy General Manager.

572
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,580
You changed the presenter

573
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,020
without my consent!

574
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:35,980
Mr. Ye,

575
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,340
aren't you overstepping?

576
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,620
Zhizhi,

577
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,860
Mr. Ye

578
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,980
was concerned your position

579
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,820
might make things awkward,

580
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,060
so he asked me
to present instead...

581
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,500
Mr. Wei,

582
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,620
since when do you
take orders from Mr. Ye?

583
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,340
That's because

584
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,740
Ye Taiting

585
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,140
is Wei Ziming's father!

586
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,500
Ji Baijian,

587
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,020
this is an internal meeting.

588
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,180
What are you doing here?

589
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,660
What is going on here?

590
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,020
Since Baijian

591
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,980
revealed Ziming's identity today,

592
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,420
there's no need to hide anything.

593
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,220
I am

594
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,140
announcing something here today.

595
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,820
Wei Ziming

596
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,020
is my son.

597
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,620
My biological son.

598
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:31,740
Baijian,

599
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,100
barging into our group office

600
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,140
and disrupting our meeting like this

601
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,380
is highly improper.

602
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,540
Was it just to

603
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,900
tell us this?

604
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,260
I'm here to warn Zhizhi to be careful
of the people around her.

605
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,780
When we talk
about the people around her,

606
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,020
you, the one set to marry her,

607
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,260
are that person.

608
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,460
You should be more concerned

609
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,500
about who the people
around you really are.

610
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,660
What do you mean by that?

611
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,820
You don't know what I mean?

612
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,380
Then I'll be blunt.

613
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,180
