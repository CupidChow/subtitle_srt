[Episode 19]

18
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:14,840
Mr. Ye,

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,200
the board has sent word.

20
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,510
They believe the group's severe losses
in recent years

21
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,350
are tied to your decision-making.

22
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,870
Go on.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,840
At this year's shareholders' meeting,

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,120
they intend to remove you

25
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,280
from the chairman position.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,760
How dare they?

27
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,480
This is rebellion!

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,510
Mr. Ye, please calm down.

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,590
The group has set a goal

30
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,560
to secure the agency rights for Drizzt.

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,560
They said

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,230
they want to see your performance
on this project.

33
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,920
What are our chances
with the Drizzt project?

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,590
From what I know,

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,510
Ji Baijian's Zhifu Jewelry
is also making a move.

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,640
That Ji Baijian again.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,640
We absolutely
can't let him succeed this time.

38
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,350
Don't worry.

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,950
If we win the bid for Drizzt,

40
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,000
we can proceed with a smooth IPO.

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,960
That will shut

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,240

to get Ji Baijian's bidding plan.

45
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,870
Ji Baijian is always very cautious.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,240
I'm afraid it might be difficult.

47
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,030
Perhaps

48
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,310
there's someone who can help us.

49
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,800
Who?

50
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,960
Song Zhizhi.

51
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,190
Song Zhizhi?

52
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,000
She would help us?

53
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,240
Last time we ruined things for her.

54
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,680
She doesn't like us very much.

55
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,120
Of course she doesn't.

56
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,430
But right now,

57
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,400
her father's company
has been hollowed out,

58
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,080
and she was deceived.

59
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,360
She's caught between love and hatred.

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
She's a rich girl.

61
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,360
What she hates most
is being made a fool of.

62
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,960
If you hand her a knife right now,

63
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,360
she'd be only too grateful.

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,630
Zhizhi, you're still working?

65
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,840
What brings you here?

66
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,430
Back in the day, Starlight Jewelry
was full of talent.

67
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,870
Look how quiet it is now.

68
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,190
You're basically manning the ship
all by yourself now, huh?

69
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,750
Times have changed.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,630
Mr. Ye,

71
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,240
if you're here to mock me,

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
you can leave now.

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,240
What kind of talk is that?

74
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,310
I'd never mock you.

75
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,030
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

76
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,430
Alright.

77
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,280
Let me give you a sincere apology.

78
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,750
Let's not let
this misunderstanding get worse.

79
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,840
I was just trying to do you a favor
and remind you

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,630
to watch out for Ji Baijian
and his father.

81
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,040
I never expected...

82
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,310
I didn't expect to ruin her marriage.

83
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,040
But speaking of which,

84
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,390
I actually think she and Baijian

85
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,630
make a great couple. Right?

86
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,160
Mr. Ye.

87
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,720
There's no need for this.

88
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,390
Oh, look at you.

89
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,270
I've apologized.

90
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,830
Why are you still being so distant?

91
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,360
Kid, let me tell you,

92
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,480
the business world is a battlefield.

93
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,750
If you're not careful
in judging people or handling matters,

94
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,390
you can easily fall into a trap.

95
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,430
I couldn't bear to just watch you
fall into a trap!

96
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,120
You came to see me

97
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,070
for a reason, didn't you?

98
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,750
Stop beating around the bush.

99
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,190
Get straight to the point.

100
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,630
See?

101
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,270
Zhizhi's so perceptive.

102
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,630
Let's get down to business.

103
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,270
I'll be blunt then.

104
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,190
The group is preparing to bid

105
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,480
for the Drizzt agency rights project.

106
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,680
You know

107
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,750
how crucial this bid is for the group.

108
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,070
But I've heard

109
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,430
that Ji Baijian
seems to be involved as well.

110
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,430
Jihong Group

111
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,560
has always been Starlight Group's

112
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,360
most formidable competitor.

113
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,070
So

114
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,040
I'd like to ask for your help.

115
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,720
See if you can get their

116
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,950
bidding plan.

117
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,390
Knowing the enemy
gives us a greater chance of victory.

118
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,950
Isn't that right?

119
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,240
Mr. Ye,

120
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,560
what makes you so sure
I'll help you?

121
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,830
Because

122
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,040
I have something you want.

123
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,310
That confident?

124
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,510
Say it.

125
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,000
What do you want?

126
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,680
Since you're being direct,

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,190
I won't beat around the bush.

128
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,020
I want the list of renowned

129
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,740
ancient gold crafting artisans
in the country,

130
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,460
and the list
of raw jewelry material suppliers.

131
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,260
Zhizhi, you're asking for a lot.

132
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,580
Compared to securing
the agency rights for Drizzt,

133
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,580
it's not that much, is it?

134
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,020
Besides, if Starlight Jewelry
is to be rebuilt

135
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,860
and compete with Zhifu Jewelry,

136
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,300
wouldn't that only work in your favor?

137
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,380
But I know Ji Baijian

138
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,780
quite well.

139
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,540
He's meticulous and cautious.

140
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,140
Getting that plan

141
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,300
might not be so simple.

142
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,060
I'll need time.

143
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,300
Zhizhi,

144
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,980
some things

145
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,740
are more complicated than you think.

146
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,540
Starlight Jewelry has been hollowed out
by the Ji family.

147
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,420
Its operations

148
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,180
are in shambles.

149
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,820
Rebuilding it is easier said than done.

150
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,420
Mr. Ye,

151
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,460
if I recall correctly,

152
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,500
you came here to ask for my help.

153
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,820
If you don't think I'm capable,

154
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,140
then you should just leave.

155
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,820
Look at you.

156
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,020
Always so blunt,

157
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,740
forgetting your place.

158
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,020
If I didn't think you were capable,

159
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,660
I wouldn't be here.

160
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,540
Help me get the plan,

161
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,220
and I promise we'll work together

162
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,020
to rebuild Starlight Jewelry.

163
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,100
I'll be waiting for your good news.

164
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:46,900
We're leaving.

165
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,740
This kid is something else. Let's go.

166
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,700
Guanshu.

167
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,860
Say what you will about Zhizhi,

168
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,460
but she always thinks
of her father's interests.

169
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,100
That's the benefit of having children.

170
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,420
Not like me,

171
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,500
fighting the old generation,
then the young.

172
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,060
Ended up all alone.

173
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,460
Mr. Ye, I will always be
your right-hand man.

174
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,060
Guanshu, go to the garage
and wait for me with the car.

175
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:35,980
I'll be right down.

176
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,660
Alright.

177
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,500
Come on, spill it. What's happening?

178
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,220
Sir, after searching for over 20 years,

179
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,220
we finally have a lead on Da.

180
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,540
She talked?

181
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,060
Yes. She said Da is still alive.

182
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,900
I'll verify it as soon as I can.

183
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,900
Alright.

184
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,300
Once confirmed,
she's no longer needed.

185
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,060
She knows too much.

186
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,380
Hello?

187
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,420
Mr. Ji, about that batch
of rough gemstones

188
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,700
for Dafu Jewelry

189
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,980
you asked about last time,

190
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,180
I've got some new leads.

191
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,020
I've sent you an email.

192
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,140
Take a look.

193
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,540
Alright.

194
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,020
What are these photos?

195
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,700
We take photos of all materials
during inventory check-in

196
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,220
and check-out.

197
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,380
After your visit,

198
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,020
I still couldn't find any information
on who picked up those gemstones.

199
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,460
But a couple of days ago,

200
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,540
while I was organizing the archives,

201
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,300
I found these photos

202
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,820
from that batch.

203
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,780
When taking photos of a crate
of rough gemstones being shipped out,

204
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,020
we seem to have accidentally

205
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,460
captured the person who picked them up.

206
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,820
Are you saying the person in this photo

207
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,900
is the one who took the gemstones?

208
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,940
That's correct, Mr. Ji.

209
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,020
I don't know who he is.

210
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,500
I sent them to you.

211
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,620
Hope it helps.

212
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,140
Alright, thank you.

213
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,700
Hello?

214
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,340
Zhizhi, where are you?

215
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,140
Haven't I made myself clear?

216
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,580
Stop bothering me.

217
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,580
I've found out the truth
about the rough gemstones.

218
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,300
And it concerns your dad.

219
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,820
So, can I come see you?

220
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,500
I'm at the office.

221
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,780
Alright, I'm on my way.

222
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,860
Ji Baijian,

223
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,540
I'm only seeing you because of my dad.

224
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,300
I believe he would never

225
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,660
do anything so heinous.

226
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:26,940
Alright.

227
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,060
I know.

228
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,500
How have you been?

229
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,140
What do you think?

230
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,900
I've found out the truth
about the rough gemstones.

231
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,500
My trip to Italy

232
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,260
was to investigate the pickup order.

233
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,540
But there was no signature on it.

234
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,100
So you just assumed it was my dad?

235
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,500
It wasn't me suspecting him.

236
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,660
My dad believed

237
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,460
that since the gemstones ended up
in your warehouse,

238
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,940
your dad must have been involved.

239
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,460
I found the person
who picked those gemstones up.

240
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,140
It's Qian Guanshu in the photo.

241
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,860
So it must have something to do
with Ye Taiting.

242
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,820
So it really is Ye Taiting.

243
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,260
He framed my dad,

244
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,780
which led to all that harm.

245
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,380
Including your mother's passing.

246
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,340
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,060
I'm sorry, Zhizhi.

248
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,700
I owe your dad an apology too.

249
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,060
I never wanted to see Starlight Jewelry

250
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,340
end up like this.

251
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,420
Losing you

252
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,660
is such a harsh punishment for me.

253
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,500
Can you just give me a...?

254
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,060
Stop.

255
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,260
You should go now.

256
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,140
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,760
[Ji Baijian has come
to see Song Zhizhi.]

258
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,640
[Sent]

259
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,500
Mr. Ye.

260
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,740
Look.

261
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,860
Good.

262
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,580
Keep a close watch on them.

263
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,360
[Yi Wenhan]

264
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,280
[Yi Wenhan]

265
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,180
Wenhan.

266
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,620
You think I can't find you

267
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,420
just because you're hiding from me?

268
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,900
Wenhan,

269
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,220
I'm your dad.

270
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,260
I'm not going to hide from you
or abandon you.

271
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,300
Dad?

272
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,900
You've manipulated me
with emotional lies for years.

273
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,780
You think I still believe you?

274
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,660
When will I get the money
and see my mom?

275
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,820
Wenhan,

276
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,460
that's a huge sum.

277
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,100
I need time.

278
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,220
Fine.

279
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,140
Then don't blame me for what's coming.

280
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,420
Let's see if Ye Taiting
will still tolerate you

281
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,020
once he knows everything.

282
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,780
What do you want?

283
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,260
Three days.

284
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,140
You have three days.

285
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,060
I want the money,
and I want to see my mom.

286
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,820
Then don't blame me for getting tough.

287
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,100
Hello?

288
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,180
Mr. Ji,

289
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,340
the board members are not supportive
of Zhifu Jewelry

290
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,900
bidding for the Drizzt project.
Should we continue?

291
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,540
I know.

292
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,260
I know the shareholders

293
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,340
have strong opinions
about the Drizzt project.

294
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,900
I'll speak with them personally.

295
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,100
Zhizhi.

296
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,780
I was just passing by
and thought I'd check on you.

297
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,660
Mr. Ye, you've been coming to me
repeatedly lately.

298
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,020
What do you want?

299
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,860
I see you're full of ambition,

300
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,460
pushing so hard to rebuild
your father's company.

301
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,420
I was worried you might be
overworking yourself.

302
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,660
Just wanted to see
how you're holding up.

303
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,140
There's no need for you
to worry about my work.

304
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,860
So, how is it going

305
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,660
with that matter I asked you about?

306
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,740
So you're here to check on the progress.

307
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,140
Not exactly. Well,

308
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,300
we're clear-headed.

309
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,660
Let me be frank with you.

310
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,860
I've enlisted others

311
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,260
within Zhifu Jewelry

312
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,980
to help me with this project as well.

313
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,220
So

314
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,500
you're not my only card to play.

315
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,900
But I can tell you for sure

316
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,460
that no one but Starlight Group

317
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,460
can give you

318
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,740
what you want.

319
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,820
Mr. Ye.

320
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,100
You've certainly done your homework.

321
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,900
You might not know.

322
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,740
But Ji Baijian

323
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,700
is personally overseeing this project.

324
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,720
[Ji Baijian]
[Zhizhi, I'm sorry.]

325
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,340
For a project personally overseen
by Ji Baijian,

326
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,180
all the core secrets

327
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,380
are undoubtedly in his hands.

328
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,500
Those small fries at the company

329
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,300
are useless.

330
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,540
The only one of your cards

331
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,700
who can get that file from him

332
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,300
is me.

333
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,300
Be patient.

334
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,620
I am patient.

335
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,020
I have plenty of patience.

336
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,260
Alright then, Zhizhi,

337
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,340
I'll let you get back to work.

338
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,020
See yourself out.

339
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,300
Okay. Alright.

340
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,940
Ji Baijian,

341
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,900
where are you?

342
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,860
I need to see you.

343
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,460
Zhizhi,

344
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,100
I didn't expect you to reach out.

345
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,660
Does this mean you forgive me?

346
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,300
Get in the car first.

347
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:31,780
Let's go.

348
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,780
See that car over there?

349
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,420
Are we being followed?

350
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,100
Ye Taiting's men.

351
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,020
Did he do anything to you?

352
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,500
Ye Taiting came to see me.

353
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,700
He wanted to discuss a deal.

354
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,660
A deal?

355
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,260
He wants me to get

356
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,940
Zhifu Jewelry's bidding plan

357
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,420
for the Drizzt project from you.

358
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,940
So he had someone follow me

359
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,940
and keep an eye on me.

360
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,300
In exchange, he said...

361
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:17,740
Zhizhi,

362
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,700
you know what Ye Taiting is like.

363
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,380
Don't let him fool you.

364
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,620
If you want something,

365
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,060
whatever Ye Taiting is offering,
I can...

366
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,500
You can't give it to me.

367
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,980
And I don't trust you anymore.

368
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,140
But to be honest,

369
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:37,900
Ji Baijian,

370
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,140
even though you lied to me,

371
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,500
I don't want to harm you.

372
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,100
So I won't steal your plan.

373
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,620
I came to see you

374
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,460
to propose we work together.

375
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,500
Let's put on a show for him.

376
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,580
Thank you.

377
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,740
Thank you for telling me.

378
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,180
No need to thank me.

379
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,460
I'm not doing this for you.

380
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,500
I just don't want to compromise

381
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,060
my own professional ethics.

382
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,900
I think we share a common goal

383
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,980
when it comes to

384
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,540
dealing with Ye Taiting.

385
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,900
So I want you to help me get

386
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,980
what I want.

387
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,740
What do you need me to do?

388
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,220
I need you to prepare
a fake bidding plan.

389
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,180
Make it detailed.

390
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,700
Make Ye Taiting believe it.

391
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,100
After this is over,

392
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,780
I want to buy twenty percent
of your shares

393
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,900
in Starlight Jewelry.

394
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,580
Alright.

395
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,700
I agree.

396
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:47,940
Let's go then.

397
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,380
They're still following you.

398
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,380
Sell the lie.

Let's go to your place.

400
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,100
Have you been

401
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,140
having a tough time lately?

402
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,500
Not really.

403
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,860
Just a lot going on recently.

404
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,900
Is there anything I can do to help?

405
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,660
I don't need your help.

406
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,580
You should rest when we get home.

407
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,540
I'll make something to eat.

408
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,980
It's late.
You probably don't have time to eat.

Mr. Ye,

441
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,220
we have news about your son.

442
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,420
After multiple confirmations,

443
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,940
the news is absolutely reliable.

444
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,140
You'll never guess who it is.

445
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,660
Ziming, you've been working hard.

446
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
Here, let me toast you.

447
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,180
Mr. Ye,

448
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,660
what's the occasion for this dinner?

449
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,660
I've been wanting to find time
to sit down with you.

450
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,180
Qian has spoken to you, hasn't he?

451
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,580
So I wanted to take this opportunity

452
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,100
to ask you directly.

453
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,460
Would you like
to take a position in the group?

454
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,980
I made myself very clear to Mr. Qian.

455
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,420
I must repay

456
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,020
the Song family's kindness.

457
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,780
I'm afraid I'll have to
disappoint you, Mr. Ye.

458
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
Not at all.

459
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,940
For a young man,

460
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,180
you have such a strong sense of loyalty.

461
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,580
I admire that.

462
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:03,860
By the way,

463
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,300
you're also fond of Zhizhi, aren't you?

464
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,340
You've been investigating me?

465
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,580
That's my personal matter.

466
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,420
You're overstepping.

467
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,300

00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,420

as the Song family's adopted kid,

472
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,620
you have some prejudices against me.

473
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,300
I totally understand.

474
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,820
