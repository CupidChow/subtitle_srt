He won't have a controlling interest.

189
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,500
And right now,
we have no bargaining chips.

190
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,980
So even if it's a risky gamble,

191
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,020
we might have to take it.

192
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,180
We can't fail now.

193
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,780
I'd rather take this gamble

194
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,220
than give those shares to Ye Taiting.

195
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,740
Hello?

196
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,700
Zhizhi,

197
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,100
whatever you decide,
don't do anything yet.

198
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,260
Don't be in a rush to sign the contract
with Xu Pengfei.

199
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,100
I'll go see you now.

200
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,420
I'm on my way

201
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:37,980
Okay.

202
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,660
Ziming,

203
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,140
I need to head back.

204
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,260
Baijian needs to see me.

205
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,540
Let's not do anything for now.

206
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,260
Okay.

207
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,060
Look at this.

208
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,900
Now I know the whole story.

209
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,100
So Nie Wenzhi embezzled

210
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,500
the production funds from the start,

211
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,780
causing the company's
financial problems.

212
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,380
Then Ye Taiting seized the opportunity

213
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,460
to pressure my dad
into giving up his shares.

214
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,820
When my dad refused,

215
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,820
he sent Xu Pengfei to invest.

216
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,980
That cunning Ye Taiting.

217
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,060
It's his classic move.

218
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,060
So what do we do now?

219
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,140
I've checked
with Jihong's Finance Department.

220
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,580
They're still in meetings discussing it.

221
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,300
It's fine.

222
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,340
We can handle this.

223
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,420
We've weathered

224
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,620
worse storms than this over the years.

225
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,700
My dad said

226
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,100
he has an idea

227
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,940
that might help you.

228
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,180
He suggests

229
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,500
that Jihong Group and Starlight Jewelry

230
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,620
jointly establish a fund.

231
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,540
The fund would then

232
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,660
invest in the Quefeng series
to solve the cash flow problem.

233
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,500
But the prerequisite is

234
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,100
that we need to establish
a new company for Quefeng.

235
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,340
The design team will also need to
move there temporarily

236
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,700
to handle the operations.

237
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,380
It could work.

238
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,420
But

239
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,540
I don't think my dad will agree.

240
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,900
After all, Starlight Jewelry
is his life's work.

241
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,140
I understand.

242
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,420
You should

243
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,620
ask your dad first.

244
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,980
See what he thinks.

245
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,200
[Ye Taiting]

246
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,220
Ye Taiting is trying to seize
the Song family's interests

247
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,500
by altering the shareholding structure.

248
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,660
This must have been his plan all along.

249
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,140
He told Xu Pengfei to pretend
to invest in Starlight Jewelry,

250
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,460
aiming to take control
of the company.

251
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,380
Has he been

252
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,020
the mastermind

253
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,780
all along?

254
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,100
Mr. Ye, Xu Pengfei is here.

255
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,300
Let him in.

256
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,500
Sorry, Mr. Ye.

257
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,020
I had almost convinced Song Zhizhi

258
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,740
to cooperate with us.

259
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,260
But for some reason,

260
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,740
she suddenly backed out
at the last minute.

261
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,220
I'm still investigating the reasons.

262
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,700
I've learned

263
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,660
it might have something to do
with Ji Baijian.

264
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,340
He's the one
who changed Song Zhizhi's mind.

265
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,980
It seems the Ji family

266
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,100
is trying to sabotage me.

267
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,740
You can go now.

268
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:30,820
Yes.

269
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,020
Mr. Ye,

270
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,740
I have something to report.

271
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,500
Go on.

272
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,820
I previously found out

273
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,060
that Ji Baijian
specifically went to Italy

274
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,540
to investigate the rough gemstone thing.

275
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,220
It appears they aren't targeting us.

276
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,700
They clearly suspect Song Shan.

277
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,380
But since this
hasn't been brought into the open,

278
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,580
it means their suspicions remain.

279
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,380
In my opinion,

280
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,220
the Ji family's attitude

281
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,940
towards their marriage

282
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,460
might not be as simple as we thought.

283
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,460
It seems

284
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,380
this is gonna dredge up

285
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,660
that old story.

286
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,580
Eye of the Sea

287
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,260
won

288
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,940
a major design award that year.

289
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,220
It was met with critical acclaim,
and orders poured in.

290
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,140
We all thought

291
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,580
Dafu Jewelry would use this opportunity

292
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,460
to reach new heights.

293
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,300
But just as we were

294
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,420
about to ship and launch,

295
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,340
our high-quality rough gemstones

296
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,940
were all swapped.

297
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,300
I happened to be abroad at the time

298
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,580
and couldn't discover it in time.

299
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,380
Suddenly,

300
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,380
customers were protesting at our stores,

301
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,820
demanding refunds and compensation.

302
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,820
- Refund!
- Refund!

303
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,780
Refund!

304
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,980
We are victims too.

305
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,060
Our rough gemstones were swapped.

306
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,780
We will get to the bottom of this

307
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,620
and give everyone a proper explanation!

308
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,940
From then on,

309
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,820
Dafu Jewelry's reputation was ruined.

310
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,380
Our funding chain completely collapsed.

311
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,780
Your mother

312
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,860
fell into a deep depression

313
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,340
and never recovered,

314
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,580
until she...

315
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,300
Honey.

316
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,740
Honey.

317
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,300
Honey!

318
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,220
And right at that time,

319
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,940
Song Shan's Starlight Jewelry
was flourishing,

320
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,180
quickly replacing Dafu Jewelry.

321
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,180
Congratulations to Mr. Song Shan
on breaking 200 million in sales!

322
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,980
Let's wish Starlight Jewelry
continued success!

323
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,020
Alright.

324
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,180
[Congratulations! Starlight Jewelry
Sales Break 200 Million!]

325
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,940
Alright, okay.

326
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,500
All these years,

327
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,500
I've been investigating.

328
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,380
Song Shan was the one
who benefited then.

329
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,260
So naturally,

330
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,420
he's my prime suspect.

331
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,740
But that cunning old guy

332
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,540
has never left me

333
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,220
a single shred of evidence
all these years.

334
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,640
It wasn't until that missing batch
of rough gemstones

335
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,480
was found in his house

336
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,700
that he finally slipped up.

337
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,460
However, I also investigated abroad.

338
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,860
It turns out Song Shan wasn't the one

339
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,260
who took the gemstones back then.

340
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,860
Kid,

341
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,340
our family's rough gemstones

342
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,700
were stored
in the Song family's warehouse

343
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,260
for over a decade!

344
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,780
You need to wake up.

345
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,780
The feud between me and Song Shan

346
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,580
stems from him killing my wife.

347
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,380
An irreconcilable hatred!

348
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,380
Back then,

349
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,860
if he had beaten Dafu with real talent,

350
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,660
I would have accepted it.

351
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,340
But he used such despicable means.

352
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,460
He's the one

353
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,660
who drove your mother to suicide!

354
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,700
Dad,

355
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,100
Ziming,

356
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,980
Baijian says

357
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,620
Jihong Group is willing to help.

358
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,860
What do you think?

359
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,580
Zhizhi,

360
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,820
I'm worried

361
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,860
once this new company is established

362
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,660
and Starlight Jewelry
moves all its resources over,

363
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,340
if they play any tricks,

364
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,260
Starlight Jewelry will become theirs.

365
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,900
He's right, Zhizhi.

366
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,660
I'm worried about that too.

367
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,300
Dad,

368
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,100
I understand your concerns.

369
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,420
But now

370
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,500
we know for sure

371
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,860
that Xu Pengfei is working
for Ye Taiting.

372
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,860
They've set up an elaborate trap,

373
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,940
and they're

374
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,500
more impatient than we imagined.

375
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,540
If we reject Xu Pengfei,

376
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,100
they won't just let it go.

377
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,620
They'll create
even bigger obstacles for us.

378
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,820
But we can't afford

379
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,420
to keep fighting

380
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,500
Ye Taiting like this.

381
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,820
If we don't solve the funding issue now,

382
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,940
Starlight Jewelry will face

383
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,980
financial tightening, layoffs, cutbacks,

384
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,260
and a gradual slide
into even greater crisis.

385
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,180
I know

386
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,540
all that.

387
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,660
I just don't feel at ease
about entrusting

388
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,900
the company to the Ji family.

389
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,340
Well,

390
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
maybe we should keep looking.

391
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,020
See if there are other investors

392
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,300
willing to help.

393
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,180
The share terms are negotiable.

394
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,140
I have other things to handle.

395
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,900
Let's all give it some more thought.

396
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,620
Zhizhi.

397
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,420
Why do you trust Ji Baijian so much?

398
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,540
It's not just about trust.

399
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,220
The thing is,

400
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,220
we don't have a better choice.

401
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,500
Let's not talk business right now.

402
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,060
Just talk about feelings.

403
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,540
I want to advise you.

404
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,540
Love is blind.

405
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,220
It clouds your judgment.

406
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,900
Ji Baijian

407
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,340
has an ex-girlfriend
who won't leave him alone.

408
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,260
And his close friend, Yin Qin,

409
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,300
is a known playboy.

410
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,140
Frankly,

411
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,940
I don't think he's right for you.

412
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,300
Ziming.

413
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,740
You deserve the best kind of love.

414
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,380
You should be cherished

415
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,580
wholeheartedly

416
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,860
for a lifetime.

417
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,780
What's wrong, Ziming?

418
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,700
Ji Baijian and I

419
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,380
are just dating right now.

420
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,620
Besides,

421
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,020
if he ever dares to mistreat me,

422
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,380
you know me,

423
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,860
I'd never let him off.

424
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,220
Hey, don't look so serious.

425
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,180
Mr. Zhang, would you reconsider?

426
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,100
Starlight Jewelry won't let you down.

427
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,940
Sorry. Maybe we can cooperate next time.

428
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,620
Alright.

429
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,360
[Manager's Office]

430
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,540
No matter how big the problem is,

431
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,820
you still need to take care of yourself.

432
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,820
Look how exhausted you are.

433
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,300
I'm fine.

434
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,940
This is nothing.

435
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,220
The company is
in such a terrible situation now.

436
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,020
The funding gap is huge.

437
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,260
I thought I could secure
some external capital.

438
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,500
Ziming and I
have been making the rounds,

439
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,220
but we keep getting rejected.

440
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,500
Did you ask your dad?

441
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,980
Did he agree
to our joint venture proposal?

442
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,860
I did. He said no.

443
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,940
What is Song Shan's attitude

444
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,780
towards establishing a new company?

445
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,980
Zhizhi told me

446
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,860
he's still hesitant.

447
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,940
It seems he remains wary of me.

448
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,140
I expected that.

449
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,300
Even though
you're engaged to his daughter,

450
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,540
he won't truly accept you as family.

451
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,180
It's time to advance your relationship

452
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,500
with Song Zhizhi.

453
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,740
Talk to her about marriage.

454
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,580
Marriage?

455
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,980
Dad, you want me to marry her

456
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,140
to gain Song Shan's trust?

457
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,180
So he'll agree

458
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,440
to transfer
Starlight Jewelry's core operations

459
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,360
to the new company?

460
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,100
Not just a part of it.

461
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,060
My ultimate goal is
to force Song Shan out completely.

462
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,700
I hope you haven't forgotten

463
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,100
why we approached the Song family
in the first place.

464
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,620
When I told you to get back engaged
to Song Zhizhi,

465
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,060
I didn't mean for you

466
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,700
to actually fall in love with her!

467
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,460
You know

468
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,980
the real purpose of this!

469
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,620
Dad.

470
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,620
Even if Mother's death
is connected to Song Shan,

471
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,860
Zhizhi is an outsider.

472
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,780
Also,

473
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,180
using a girl's marriage and happiness

474
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,660
to settle last generation's grudge

475
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,060
is terribly unfair to her.

476
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,540
Unfair?

477
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,220
How did our family

478
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,780
end up where we are today?

479
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,860
Was any of this fair

480
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,980
to us?

481
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,940
He destroyed our family

482
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,220
and made us lose
the person we loved most.

483
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,020
All these years,

484
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,700
I've been waiting
for an opportunity like this.

485
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,660
I want Song Shan

486
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,980
to experience everything

487
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,780
I've been through.

488
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,540
Yes, Dad.

489
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,460
I understand how you feel.

490
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,780
But each generation has its own destiny.

491
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,220
We can't just...

492
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:08,820
Enough!

493
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,380
Ji Baijian, listen carefully.

494
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,700
This is the perfect moment for revenge,

495
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,580
and I will not let it slip away.

496
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,140
Song Shan brings this upon himself.

497
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,100
If you believe Song Zhizhi is innocent,

498
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,460
well, I promise you,

499
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,340
after we succeed,

500
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,620
she can still have the life she wants.

501
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,620
But

502
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,820
if she becomes an obstacle,

503
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,380
I wouldn't mind
making Song Shan experience

504
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,820
the pain of losing a loved one.

505
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,660
This matter

506
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,180
is not up for discussion.

507
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,540
Mr. Ji?

508
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,180
You're here.

509
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,780
Zhizhi,

510
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,740
I just came to invite you out
for a meal.

511
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,300
Where's Baijian?

512
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,020
Don't wait for him.

513
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,620
I'll take you there first.

514
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,580
He'll be there soon.

515
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,900
Okay.

516
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,520
[Song Zhizhi]

517
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,380
Ms. Wang,

518
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
have you seen Ms. Song?

519
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,900
She was picked up by your father.

520
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,700
If she becomes an obstacle,

521
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,940
I wouldn't mind
making Song Shan experience

522
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,260
the pain of losing a loved one.

523
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,580
Mr. Ji Jr., what's the matter?

524
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,740
Where's my dad?

525
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,980
That's his private schedule.

526
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,580
I'm asking you, where did he go?

527
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,460
He went to have dinner
with Ms. Song Zhizhi.

528
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,300
Mr. Ji,

529
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,980
you still read a physical newspaper?

530
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,940
Most people use their phones
to read the news nowadays.

531
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,580
I'm not used to that.

532
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,900
The restaurant we're going to
is quite far away,

533
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,140
but it's very famous.

534
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,340
