194
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,420
That's strange.

195
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,700
There's no way Zhizhi did this.

196
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,900
But this video shows
no signs of editing.

197
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,420
Could it be

198
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,700
an issue with the camera angle
in their house?

199
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,940
Look,

200
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,700
this camera only covers the first floor.

201
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,060
What happened upstairs

202
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,220
is completely invisible.

203
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,740
And this other camera

204
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,820
only captures a corner
of the second floor.

205
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,940
It can't clearly show

206
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,740
the front of anyone
standing at the stairwell.

207
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,660
If, according to the first camera,

208
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,660
Song Zhizhi followed Nie Xiaofei down,

209
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,860
she shouldn't appear so quickly

210
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,060
in the second shot.

211
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,060
The Song family's staircase

212
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,580
has a turn coming down from upstairs,

213
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
creating a blind spot

214
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,380
from the stairwell's perspective.

215
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,500
Wait.

216
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,140
That walking posture...

217
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,660
What about it?

218
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,380
The woman in the video
walks with her feet splayed out.

219
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,860
Zhizhi doesn't walk like that.

220
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,620
This person is not Zhizhi.

221
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,180
Someone pretended to be her.

222
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,820
As her childhood sweetheart,

223
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,260
you know her inside and out.

224
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,140
We need to find this woman.

225
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,340
She's the key to clearing Zhizhi.

Ji, why'd it take you so long to answer?

229
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,580
Something big happened.

230
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,220
I'm fine.

231
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,180
Just got into a fight.

232
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,940
How is Song Zhizhi?

233
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,780
Are you okay?

234
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,180
I'm fine, just tell me.

235
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,780
Song Zhizhi pushed Nie Xiaofei down
from upstairs,

236
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,380
leaving Nie Xiaofei seriously injured.

237
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,820
Song Zhizhi is now facing

238
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,220
charges of intentional assault.

239
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,100
Do you think she would do that?

240
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,060
No way.

241
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,660
Song Zhizhi has already been detained.

243

Mr. Wei,

248
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,340
I'm seriously impressed.

249
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,620
I've never met anyone

250

To find a ballerina,

252
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,700
you stayed up all night on the computer,

253
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,340
and you don't even
need a nap during the day.

254
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,980
We got word from the police

255
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,980
that ballerina-specific

256
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,060
toe tape was found

257
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,180
in Zhizhi's house.

258
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,180
The impersonator must be
one of the ballerinas.

shows us rehearsing together.

270
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,660
A week ago,

271
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,260
she asked our director for leave,

272
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,820
saying she had family matters
to attend to back home,

273
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,780
and then she left.

00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,020

Yes?

377
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,500
Have you seen this girl?

378
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,980
No.

379
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,180
Thank you.

380
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,540
Hey.

381
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,580
Hey, Ji.

382
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,620
I asked a friend in Italy to try
to triangulate the signal,

383
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,820
but it's incredibly unstable.

384
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,940
Send me all the possible locations.

385
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,020
There are over a dozen spots

386
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,180
that need to be checked.

387
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,900
But Milan is huge...

388
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,860
Just send them to me.

389
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,380
Fine, sending them now.

390
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,340
Hello, is this the Mirya Hotel?

391
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
I'd like to inquire

392
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,260
if a Chinese tourist named Bai Xue

393
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,300
has checked in today.

394
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:47,980
Hello.

395
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,700
Is there a Chinese guest named Bai Xue

396
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,700
staying in this hotel?

397
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,780
Mr. Wei,

398
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,980
we called every hotel and inn in Italy,

399
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,940
one by one,

400
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,620
for days now.

401
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,700
This is like finding a needle
in a haystack.

402
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,140
The trial is about to start.

403
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,820
I have to save Zhizhi.

404
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,740
There's no other way.

405
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,820
Call every station we can contact.

406
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,140
Ask all of them.

407
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,300
Okay.

408
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,730
[Jinshan Hospital]

409
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,460
Mrs. Song,

410
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,860
sorry to have you come all this way.

411
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,620
Mr. Song did show signs
of regaining consciousness before,

412
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,900
but unfortunately, those signs

413
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,780
only lasted a short while before fading.

414
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,220
I thought my husband would wake up.

415
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,620
I really thought he'd get better.

416
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,180
I'm sorry, Doctor.

417
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,300
I'm a bit emotional.

418
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,660
Are you okay?

419
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,620
Yeah.

420
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,420
I'd like to be with him for some time,

421
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,260
if that's okay?

422
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,220
Yeah, sure.

423
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,340
Mrs. Song, please.

424
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,260
I'll go check on other patients.

425
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,580
Okay, thank you.

426
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,100
Honey?

427
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,660
Honey?

428
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,420
Honey.

429
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,940
You've been unconscious for days now.

430
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,980
I'm so worried, so scared.

431
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,100
I'm terribly worried about you

432
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,580
waking up.

433
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,180
I'm just so exhausted.

434
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,700
So exhausted that

435
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,500
I almost can't keep up the act anymore.

436
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
All these years,

437
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,260
to please that old hag mother of yours,

438
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,580
I've had to swallow my pride,

439
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,060
enduring your family's bullying
and contempt.

440
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,700
No matter how well I behaved,

441
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,220
how virtuous I appeared,

442
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,860
you never truly trusted me.

443
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,900
Self-righteous rich people like you

444
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,900
are actually dirty and cold-blooded.

445
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,300
Honey, do you know why

446
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,060
I've suffered from insomnia
all these years?

447
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,020
It's because whenever I wake up at night

448
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
and see you sleeping next to me,

449
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,100
I feel utterly disgusted.

450
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,700
The shareholders' meeting
is coming up soon.

451
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,100
I've waited for this day
for far too long.

452
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,740
Honey,

453
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,620
soon, you,

454
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,020
your beloved daughter,

455
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,980
and your precious Starlight Jewelry

456
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,660
will all be finished.

457
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,060
Everything your family owns

458
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,420
will soon belong to me

459
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,460
and him.
