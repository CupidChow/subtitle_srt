hadn't invited me

I can confirm

55
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,780
that Ms. Song Zhizhi here

56
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,980
is the real Anne.

57
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,340
How is that possible?

58
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,100
Over the years,
we've only kept in touch online

59
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,700
and never actually met in person.

60
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,740
A few days ago,

61
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,940
Yi Wenhan privately messaged

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,100
claiming someone was impersonating her.

64
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,020
To protect Anne's reputation,

65
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,940
I had to expose the fraud.

66
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,740
But I never expected

67
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,260
Ms. Song wasn't an imposter.

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,100
Earlier, at the entrance,

71
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,340
Yi Wenhan told me

72
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,580
to introduce myself as Anne

73
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,140
to make the exposure more convincing.

74
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,220
He also gave me a card

75
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,940
with one million on it.

76
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,580
Sorry.

77
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,260
I shouldn't have agreed.

78
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,020
You decide what to do
with the money now.

79
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,420
Since you're being so generous,

80
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,660
I'll accept it.

81
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,780
I'll donate this one million

82
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,100

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,180

Thanks.

87
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,300
But exposing them in public

88
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,100
was so satisfying.

89
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,340
So good.

90
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,460
Nice acting.

91
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,020
For this competition,

92
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,340
I'll imitate Anne's style.

93
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,300
That snake Yi Wenhan

94
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,740
would definitely suspect me.

95
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,220
I even let him steal my design drafts.

96
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,020
Knowing him,

97
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,700
he'd make a huge deal out of it.

98
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,820
Nice move.

99
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,420
Playing with fire.

100
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,900
It's not playing with fire.

101
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,620
It's flushing out the rat.

102
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,980
Song Zhizhi.

103
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,700
Song Zhizhi.

104
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,860
Wenhan,

105
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,220
you worked so hard

106
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,900
all these years

107
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,500
to build your reputation
in the design world.

108
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,660
And just like that,

109
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,060
she ruined everything.

110
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,060
I mean,

111
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,100
who would've known
she is the real Anne?

112
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,500
I ended up embarrassing myself today!

113
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,860
But why?

114
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,940
There are so many men out there.

115
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,980
Why does she have to
steal Baijian from me?

116
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,540
She just can't stand seeing me happy.

117
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,820
But why?

118
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,980
But why does she get to

119
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,980
destroy your career

120
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,820
and my love life so easily?

121
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,820
Wenhan,

122
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,420
even if you can take this,

123
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,620
I can't!

124
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,300
What else can we do?

125
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,620
Mom told us

126
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,500
not to make any moves lately.

127
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,780
But Mom also said she had looked
into what happened today!

128
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,380
Look how things turned out.

129
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,420
You were embarrassed like this.

130
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,540
Maybe Mom

131
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,460
isn't always right.

132
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,420
By the way,

133
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,020
the results are out
for the milk sample you gave me.

134
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,780
There's nothing wrong with it.

135
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,620
The milk is fine?

136
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,580
How could that be?

137
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,700
My dad's medical report shows

138
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,860
a chronic stimulant in his blood.

139
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,500
Long-term use

140
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,180
can have serious side effects.

141
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,220
It could even put someone
in a vegetative state.

142
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,380
I thought it was because of the milk.

143
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,700
But how could this happen?

144
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,860
The results for the hair sample
you asked me to test

145
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,740
are also out.

146
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,220
The results show

147
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,460
Nie Xiaofei is not related to Yi Wenhan

148
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,500
or Nie Wenzhi.

149
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,780
But Yi Wenhan and Nie Wenzhi
are biologically related.

150
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,420
They're mother and son?

151
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,100
So what are you suspecting?

152
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,220
Wenhan.

153
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,100
Just thinking about how Song Zhizhi

154
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,860
used to be

155
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,700
completely under your control

156
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,060
makes me feel better.

157
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,180
Do you want things to get back on track?

158
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,860
I have a way

159
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,540
to make her

160
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,980
truly yours.

161
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,860
Mine?

162
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,660
I suspect those three
are plotting against my family

163
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,060
and have been drugging my father's milk.

164
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,700
I wanted to show him

165
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,300
the test report as proof.

166
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,380
But things didn't turn out as I thought.

167
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,820
It's true that you can't see clearly
when you're involved.

168
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,140
What good would exposing them do?

169
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,100
Do you want everyone to know

170
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,100
Nie Wenzhi and Yi Wenhan
are mother and son

171
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,180
so they can reunite?

172
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,860
Or prove Nie Wenzhi

173
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,460
adopted Nie Xiaofei

174
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,020
to show how kind she is?

175
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,420
How does that help you?

176
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,820
You can't trust anyone easily.

177
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,660
Usually, the ones you trust the most

178
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,980
are the ones who hurt you the deepest.

179
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,500
Ji Baijian,

180
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,260
good thing we're allies,

181
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,660
not enemies.

182
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,980
What's most important now is

183
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,860
shaking my dad's trust in Nie Wenzhi.

184
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,420
Only then will this test report
mean something.

185
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,980
Otherwise, it's just a piece of paper.

186
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,260
But Nie Wenzhi
has been setting this up for years.

187
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,380
Her defenses are rock-solid.

188
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,140
Breaking through

189
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,460
won't happen overnight.

190
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,700
But if

191
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,020
I erode her trust bit by bit?

192
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,140
When the time comes,

193
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,740
her foundation
will collapse in an instant.

194
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,260
Come out. Let's meet.

195
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,140
I told you

196
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,580
to verify every detail
about Song Zhizhi.

197
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,900
I never expected

198
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,340
she's actually Anne.

199
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,860
Now she has Ji Baijian by her side.

200
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,300
That'd cause big problems for our plans.

201
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,700
Understood.

202
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,140
Wenzhi,

203
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,820
let's go talk to Ji.

204
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,340
Okay.

205
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,540
I can't believe you're really Anne.

206
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,700
Exactly.

207
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,140
Yi Wenhan is such a scumbag.

208
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,420
That's why girls really have to
keep their eyes open.

209
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,060
Cheers.

210
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,660
- You're amazing.
- So impressive.

211
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,580
[Xiaofei]
Zhizhi, let's have a heart-to-heart.

212
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Excuse me for a moment.

213
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,380
Zhizhi.

214
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,020
You're here.

215
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,540
Xiaofei,

216
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,780
what did you want to talk about?

217
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,100
I was just wondering

218
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,620
why you suddenly stopped

219
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,540
liking Wenhan.

220
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,780
Weren't you totally into him...

221
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,020
I was naive back then.

222
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,060
Not anymore.

223
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,780
But he's always been so good to you.

224
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,100
Was he really good to me?

225
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,780
Yeah.

226
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,500
He's always treated you well.

227
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,420
Zhizhi.

228
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,260
Xiaofei.

229
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,380
Wenhan.

230
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,220
You're here.

231
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,620
What are you doing here?

232
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,260
I came to apologize.

233
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,940
Xiaofei,

234
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,700
we'll talk another time.

235
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:18,980
Zhizhi,

236
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,460
don't be mad.

237
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,740
It was all my fault.

238
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,460
I sincerely apologize.

239
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,940
I won't bother you anymore.

240
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,380
Let's have this drink

241
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,020
and forget all the unhappiness
from the past.

242
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,300
Alright?

243
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,700
Yeah, Zhizhi.

244
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,820
Just forgive him.

245
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,140
Take it easy on the drinks.

246
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,220
Cheers.

247
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,220
Cheers.

248
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,020
Forget?

249
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,820
Yi Wenhan,

250
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,740
your pathetic acting

251
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,820
makes me sick.

252
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,100
Zhizhi. Zhizhi.

253
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,740
Zhizhi.

254
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,060
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

255
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,420
Let me go with you
to the restroom to clean up.

256
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,980
Ji, just as you predicted.

257
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,900
Yi Wenhan and Nie Xiaofei

258
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,780
were plotting against Song Zhizhi.

259
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,660
I overheard everything
outside the dressing room.

260
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,100
By then,

261
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,580
Baijian won't want her anymore.

262
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,580
You'll

263
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,700
become the Song family's son-in-law,

264
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,780
and I'll

265
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,740
become the Ji family's daughter-in-law.

266
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,100
Plotting against Song Zhizhi?

267
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,540
Yes.

268
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,420
She was just here.

269
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,460
Check the surveillance.

270
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,020
Okay.

271
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:45,860
Zhizhi.

272
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,940
I just remembered I forgot my phone.

273
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,700
Wait for me.

274
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,100
Zhizhi.

275
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,980
Wenhan.

276
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,300
You're here.

277
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:06,940
Cheers.

278
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,700
Cheers.

279
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,060
Hello?

280
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,460
Hey, Ji.

281
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,940
I just arrived at the surveillance room.

282
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,940
Excuse me, sir.

283
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,860
I can't find my friend.

284
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,700
Could you please
check the surveillance footage?

285
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,420
This one!

286
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,900
Yeah, this one.

287
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,220
Hello?

288
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,420
Found her.

289
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,820
Yi Wenhan took her away.

290
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,540
It's on the 20th floor.

291
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,940
You sure it's this floor?

292
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,380
I'll send you the room number now.

293
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,740
Okay.

294
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,700
Everything's ready.

295
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,860
Send those people up to take photos.

296
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,860
Song Zhizhi!

297
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,100
Zhizhi!

298
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,580
You scum.

299
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,220
I'm here.

300
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,100
Hello?

301
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,860
Ji,

302
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,020
they're rushing up now.

303
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,700
If they catch you

304
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,180
holding Song Zhizhi like this
while she's out of it,

305
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,380
it'll be a huge scandal.

306
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,380
Hide now.

307
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,420
I couldn't stop them.

308
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,580
