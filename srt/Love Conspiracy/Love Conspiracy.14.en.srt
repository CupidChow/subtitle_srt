00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,580
so I dumped him.

173

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,340

188
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,380
Ji, no wonder
you were acting so weird today.

189
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,500
Sorry.

190
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,580
Let's eat.

191
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,540
Dig in.

192
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,460
Ji and Song Zhizhi's engagement
is one of convenience, right?

193
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,060
Yes.

194
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,180
And no.

195
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,900
The truth is,

196
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,300
they are really
stuck together like glue.

197
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,180
And

198
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,780
Ji is the one who's fallen even deeper.

199
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,980
But what does he see in her?

200
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,020
Maybe it was just

201
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,780
the right person

202
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,780
at the right time.

203
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,140
Ji has never been short
of outstanding girls around him.

204
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,900
Well, Song Zhizhi

205
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,660
is outstanding too.

206
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,220
She just took over

207
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,500
and already managed the company
in an orderly manner.

208
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,580
Excuse me?

209
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,220
If everything is already in order,

210
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,140
why did she ask me to come back
all this way to help?

211
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,020
Well,

212
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,340
because you're outstanding too.

213
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,820
But being back this time,

214
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,940
I've noticed Ji has really changed.

215
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,660
He's

216
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,220
more mature

217
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,660

You might not want to hear this,

221
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,900
but I have to say it.

222
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,500
You see,

223
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,260
it's been so long.

224
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,220
And people change.

225
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,300
And so do their feelings.

226
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,100
Right?

227
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,700
And feelings...

228
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,340
We can't force them, right?

229
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,500
If they can change once,

230
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
they can change again.

231
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,580
Just focus on your driving.

232
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,140

322
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,420

323
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,300

337
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,020
take a look first.

338
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,580
Are you very concerned
about my relationship with Baijian?

339
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,900
No, I'm not.

340
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,140
Good.

341
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,060

a major financial loss due to fraud.

373
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,900
Is Starlight Jewelry

374
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,460
facing a capital chain rupture?

375
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,620
Starlight Jewelry isn't that fragile.

376
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,740
It's only a matter of time
before the funds are recovered.

377
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,220
We've heard that morale
at Starlight Jewelry is low,

378
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,820
with many employees resigning.

379
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,660
Can your company operate normally

380
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,260
before the defrauded funds
are recovered?

381
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,900
The case is won.

382
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,580
As the plaintiff's attorney,

383
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,820
I'll see this through

384
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,340
until every cent is recovered.

385
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,900
Please rest assured.

386
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:56,980
Let's go.

387
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,940
Excuse me. Let us through.

388
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,740
Ms. Song. Ms. Song!

389
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,340
We won the case.

390
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,260
How about buying me a drink?

391
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,860
I might even tell you

392
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,180
a little secret about Baijian.

393
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,540
Okay.

394
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,700
Why did you want to see me?

395
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,340
How are things going

396
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,820
with what I asked you to handle?

397
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,220
Your mother has been released
on bail pending trial.

398
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,940
I'm still gathering the money.

399
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,300
Then why hasn't she contacted me?

400
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,180
Are you insane?

401
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,700
Her legal troubles aren't resolved,

402
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,860
and you've caused this huge mess!

403
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,380
How could she possibly contact you?

404
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,340
Wenhan,

405
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,140
you need to lay low.

406
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,220
Contact her again later.

407
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,820
What about the money?

408
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,940
I have a few hundred thousand here.

409
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,100
You can take it all.

410
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,380
A few hundred thousand?

411
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,740
Am I a beggar or what?

412
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,820
I need fifty million!

413
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,300
Get it for me soon.

414
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,340
Remember,

415
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,540
the sooner, the better.

416
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,220
Fifty million?

417
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,060
Where am I supposed
to get that much money?

418
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,140
With the power you wield

419
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,660
under Ye Taiting's nose,

420
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,380
that amount

421
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,740
shouldn't be too hard for you, right?

422
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,780
Hurry up!

423
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,380
You're finally here.

424
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,500
Have a seat.

425
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,660
How are you feeling?

426
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,860
I'm doing alright.

427
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,900
What about Wenhan?

428
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,540
I just met him.

429
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,420
He's hiding in a safe place.

430
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,620
Let him lay low for now.

431
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,580
I'll figure something out later.

432
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,940
He's impulsive.

433
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,580
You must take good care of him.

434
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,980
If Wenhan ends up in prison,

435
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,980
I'll feel like there's no point anymore.

436
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Then our family

437
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,940
would truly be finished.

438
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,780
After all I've been through these years,

439
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,580
leaving my own husband and child

440
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,740
to be someone else's wife,

441
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,580
raising another woman's children...

442
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,220
If it all comes to nothing in the end,

443
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,500
I just can't accept it.

444
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,900
Wenzhi.

445
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,020
Don't worry.

446
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,300
We need to plan carefully.

447
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,020
We can start over.

448
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,140
You don't understand.

449
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,380
Now that Song Zhizhi has won her case,

450
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,740
I'm really worried the Song family

451
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,020
will make a comeback soon.

452
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,180
But look at us?

453
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,780
One gone, one in prison.

454
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,500
I'm so full of hatred.

455
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,380
I've made up my mind.

456
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,820
Even if I have to fight this out
to the end,

457
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,940
even if I die,

458
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,900
I'm taking them down with me!

459
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,740
It's rare for you to have time

460
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,900
to join us for camping, Ms. Song.

461
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,900
Well, we won the case.

462
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,860
Time for a change of scenery.

463
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,500
Getting out is nice.

464
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,780
You'll love the spot I picked.

465
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,180
I spent a long time

466
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,420
choosing this campsite.

467
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,420
Ji, do you remember?

468
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,220
What was the name of that park

469
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,580
we went to when we were abroad?

470
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,900
Winter...

471
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,980
Did we go there often?

472
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,820
Alright then.

473
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,100
We'll wait and see.

474
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,100
Drive slower.

475
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:03,820
Okay.

476
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,900
You handle this car pretty well.

477
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,700
Have a drink?

478
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,260
I'll have water, thanks.

479
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,100
Be careful.

480
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,660
I'll get it.

481
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:13,780
Let me.

482
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,060
Then I'll go get that bag.

483
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,140
Is it heavy?

484
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:21,940
Not really.

485
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:30,820
Let me.

486
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,700
You rest.

487
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,780
I think this spot is nice.

488
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,700
Worth the drive.

489
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,100
It's alright. Nothing too special.

490
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,500
I'll take this over first.

491
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,100
Ji, come have a drink!

492
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,820
Let's celebrate.

493
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,980
Sure. Let's have a toast.

494
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,300
Alright.

495
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,620
Okay.

496
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:08,820
Cheers.

497
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,580
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

498
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,260
To our victory!

499
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,380
Ziming,

500
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,180
let me do the grilling.

501
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,420
You must be tired from driving.

502
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,300
No, thanks.

503
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,420
It's fine.

504
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,020
It's just that we drove all this way,

505
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,020
searched around,

506
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,100
and this place doesn't seem
that special.

507
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,820
Who says it's not special?

508
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,220
This is a little secret
between me and Baijian.

509
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,100
We took a photo

510
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,940
under this tree ten years ago.

511
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,740
We promised each other

512
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,620
that if we ever came back

513
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,380
to this city ten years later,

514
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,100
we'd take another photo
under this same tree.

515
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,340
Ji, remember?

516
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,020
I don't remember.

517
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,500
How can you not remember?

518
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,820
I even have the photo here.

519
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,060
Let me find it.

520
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,220
Look.

521
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,100
Ji really wasn't as handsome back then
as he is now.

522
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,740
Look.

523
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,780
Zhizhi,

524
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,180
these are done.

525
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,140
Have some.

526
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,620
Have something to eat.

527
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,260
Not hungry.

528
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,980
I'm hungry. I'll have it.

529
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,780
I really never thought

530
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,620
we'd get the chance to come back here,

531
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,060
to barbecue and camp together like this.

532
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
Ji,

533
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,140
back when we used to go out,

534
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,220
you always loved to sing...

535
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,740
I don't remember. Stop talking about it.

536
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,860
Are you playing dumb with me now?

537
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,780
Zhizhi, are you cold?

538
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,540
Do you want a blanket?

539
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,620
No, I'm not.

540
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,460
Then I'll take a walk with you.

541
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:14,660
Let's go.

542
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,940
Where to? I just sat down.

543
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,140
Haven't even eaten yet.

544
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,780
Eat first.

545
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,260
I'm afraid the two of us might

546
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,020
interrupt your catch-up with Ms. Qin.

547
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,420
Wei Ziming, stop being sarcastic.

548
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Enough, both of you.

549
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,100
I'll go by myself.

550
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,180
Zhizhi.

551
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,660
Game over.

552
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,140
Why did you bring up that photo?

553
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,300
You should thank me.

554
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,380
Look, she's jealous.

555
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,700
That means she likes you.

556
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,180
You should go check on her.

557
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,740
Ms. Qin,

558
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,060
am I just another piece
in your game too?

559
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,300
What do you think?

560
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,020
Zhizhi.

561
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,100
You've got me wrong.

562
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,420
What have I got wrong?

563
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,020
You and your childhood sweetheart

564
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,580
are back in a familiar place,

565
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,740
reliving sweet old times.

566
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,260
Shouldn't I leave?

567
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,900
There's no way I'll rekindle anything
with Qin Jingxiang.

568
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,340
And she knows how I feel about you.

569
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,180
How do you feel about me?

570
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,540
You don't even know yourself.

571
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,140
You're wavering.

572
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,260
I am not wavering!

573
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,060
And I'm not reliving old memories!

574
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,780
I know exactly how I feel about you!

575
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,540
Song Zhizhi!

576
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,380
