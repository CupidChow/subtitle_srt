00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,741
HAIE INHERITANCE INVESTIGATION OFFICE

2
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:25,291
We have a huge deficit again this month!

3
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:29,329
Rent, labor costs, utility costs,
and everything else.

4
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,531
What is going to happen to this office?

5
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,833
I was so close to defeating Alatreon…

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,636
Mr. Tomonaga,
the Wi-Fi you use for that game

7
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,805
is also the reason for our deficit.

8
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,440
It's nothing compared to the amount

9
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,308
that Mr. Haie is borrowing from me.

10
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,744
-Huh?
-Calm down, Reiko.

11
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,813
Isn't it crazy that a part-timer like you

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,948
has a higher monthly income than me?

13
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,750
I am only getting paid

14
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,385
the minimum wage set by Tokyo.

15
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:56,956
I need the funds to return to
medical school. More like,

16
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,992
here's what I don't get.

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,794
Even when we do make a profit,

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,462
it's mostly used to pay off our debt.

19
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,531
How much do you owe anyway?

20
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,433
Wait, don't tell me

21
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,368
you took out an illegal loan?

22
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,639
They're here.

23
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,682
Please wait until next month.

24
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,150
I swear we will pay you.

25
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,618
I am terribly sorry.

26
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,855
It's not like that, Reiko.

27
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,095
Is this place reliable?

28
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,296
Ouch.

29
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,897
They're not debt collectors?

30
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,267
Daikoku Seimei
made an appointment with us…

31
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,036
That's a huge company!

32
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,138
Why didn't you tell me about this?

33
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,773
It slipped my mind.

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,608
This time,

35
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:54,080
both myself and Ms. Ebiru Makoto
will be your clients.

36
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,082
Long time no see, Mr. Kito.

37
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,885
Huh? Oh, yes it is.

38
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,688
You seem to be doing well, Mr. Tomonaga.

39
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,556
So, Mr. Kito.

40
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,026
-What is the nature of your request?
-Right…

41
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,463
Last month, on the 11th,

42
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,267
a wealthy man
living in Tokyo died unexpectedly.

43
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:18,505
Mr. Shimamura Takezo, 53 years old.
Their last names are different,

44
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,474
but he is Ms. Ebiru Makoto's
biological father.

45
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,045
So your parents got divorced
and you took your mother's name?

46
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,615
What else could it be?

47
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,489
Excuse me.

48
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,793
An insurance payout of 300 million yen

49
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,263
and around 700 million yen of assets are

50
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,899
all given to the widow per his will.

51
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:46,966
One billion yen?

52
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,235
Mr. Shimamura

53
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,906
divorced Ms. Makoto's mother
and remarried two years later.

54
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:53,973
And just

55
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,442
four months later, he suddenly died.

56
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,079
The widow who acquired
his massive inheritance

57
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,116
is Shimamura Saryu.

58
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,754
Saryu.

59
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,256
So this is the infamous Saryu?

60
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,859
You know about her?

61
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,563
This woman named Saryu is famous
within the insurance industry

62
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,132
<i>as a person of interest.</i>

63
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,801
<i>She has a unique name, so I remembered it.</i>

64
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,339
<i>Back then, I believe she worked</i>
<i>as a hostess in Ginza.</i>

65
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,145
She seems complicated and is not my type,

66
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,247
but I can see why men would fall for her.

67
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,182
What do you mean by person of interest?

68
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,451
I mean someone who has received

69
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,820
large life insurance payouts

70
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,854
multiple times.

71
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,890
She is definitely a "black widow"

72
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,892
who murdered her partners.

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,929
This is a kind of story Katahira Nagisa

74
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,332
and Yamamura Momiji would star in.

75
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,602
-Maybe Reiko is actually in her forties.
-Yeah.

76
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,669
And the cause of death?

77
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,907
It was judged to be a heart attack.

78
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,309
According to our research,

79
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,679
his primary care physician
who wrote his death certificate

80
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,748
is apparently

81
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,116
under Saryu's thumb.

82
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,517
But if you get an autopsy--

83
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,386
Yes, so our people contacted

84
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,822
the MPD's
First Criminal Investigation Division

85
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,423
and were able to get an autopsy done.
However…

86
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,896
<i>They didn't find any traces of poison.</i>

87
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:24,797
We considered

88
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:28,001
other ways she could've
caused a heart attack, like electricity

89
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,535
or an overdosage of potassium,

90
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,006
but they didn't find
any evidence of that either.

91
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,574
If this is the conclusion that

92
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,409
Dr. Ugajin, a leading expert, came to,

93
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,278
it must not be homicide.

94
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,179
Then what killed him?

95
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,181
Simply, a heart attack.

96
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,052
It means there is no other way
of explaining this,

97
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,655
other than a perfect unexpected death.

98
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,456
The will or the insurance--

99
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,425
Yes? You have something to say?

100
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,893
The will

101
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,629
or the insurance contract.
Were there any issues?

102
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,431
Any traces of forgery?

103
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,966
-Right?
-Exactly.

104
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,902
Of course, we had it analyzed

105
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,038
and assessed it in detail.

106
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,241
The handwriting analysis
came back with zero issues.

107
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,576
It is Mr. Shimamura's own handwriting.

108
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,577
What company?

109
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,279
Central Analysis Lab of Forensic Science.

110
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,414
What method?

111
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,482
The handwriting analysis was done using

112
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,951
computer-aided multivariate analysis.

113
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,888
In that case,
there is no room for suspicion.

114
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,890
This will be deemed to be 100% authentic

115
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,359
and written by Mr. Shimamura himself.

116
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,163
Well, based on what we've heard,

117
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,599
we can't stop her from getting
the inheritance and insurance payout.

118
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,204
And we're out of a job again.

119
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,173
As I thought, you're no help.

120
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,110
From what I can see,
it's nothing but suspicious.

121
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,314
He had to redo his divorce paperwork

122
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,116
three times because he made mistakes.

123
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,188
How could he write a perfect contract
with no correction stamp?

124
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,726
I don't care about him at all.

125
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,160
But when I

126
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,665
think about my mother, who's been
going through hardships since the divorce…

127
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,968
it's frustrating.

128
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,404
But you know,

129
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,475
once divorced,
the ex-wife is legally a stranger.

130
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,809
So whatever the case is,

131
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,012
your mother won't get
a single yen of inheritance.

132
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,082
As his daughter, you have something called

133
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,685
a legitime,
which is a fraction of his assets that

134
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,120
you're legally entitled to.

135
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,291
Laws are so shitty.

136
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,662
-What can we do…?
-Mr. Haie.

137
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,931
May I speak with you?

138
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,376
I will pay you ten million.

139
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,677
-Huh?
-Ten…?

140
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,514
I want you to investigate

141
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,949
whether this was murder or not.

142
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,184
Moreover,

143
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,254
I want evidence that it's murder.

144
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,991
Evidence that it's murder?

145
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:08,060
In other words,
it can be made-up evidence?

146
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,297
Thank you for your understanding.

147
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,834
I see.

148
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,002
Well, you know.

149
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,004
I was thinking that it was suspicious

150
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,472
how his unexpected death

151
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,741
seemed a little too "perfect."

152
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,377
I'm not desperate enough
to be swayed by money

153
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,312
as shamelessly as Ms. Reiko.

154
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,583
But I did find it suspicious that it was
"100%" authentic.

155
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,518
Surprisingly, we're on the same page.

156
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,820
We will accept your request.

157
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,522
Hey, I haven't said anything yet.

158
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,757
Then say something.

159
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,226
It's true that

160
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,728
I am not fond of things that are

161
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,465
"perfect" and "100%" either.

162
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,799
To be honest…

163
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,473
we're willing to do whatever it takes.

164
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,343
First of all, your company has
professional people who do this

165
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,545
called insurance investigators.

166
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,249
Oh, I've heard rumors about
insurance investigators

167
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,351
hiring outside companies to do

168
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,586
their dirty work.

169
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,822
Is this perhaps

170
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,925
a Code Black case?

171
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,161
Code Black?

172
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,733
I'll think about it for 20 million.

173
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,072
We can only pay ten million.

174
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,608
Then forget about it--

175
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,010
We will accept this case
for ten million yen.

176
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:33,913
Reiko…

177
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,048
Adults are…

178
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:38,851
so shitty.

179
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,466
Everything is perfect.

180
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,712
She looks vulnerable,
but her tactic is flawless.

181
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,181
They have a lot of methods
of killing that we don't know about.

182
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,283
My name is Mitawa Reiko.

183
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,250
-Right there!
-What!

184
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,854
<i>Mr. Haie,</i>
<i>we can't overturn her perfect crime.</i>

185
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,294
Oh, it's my Hyena!

186
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,628
A WELL-INFORMED PERSON IN GINZA
MADAM HARUKO

187
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,030
Did someone die again?

188
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,832
Don't make it sound like
I'm the Grim Reaper.

189
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,738
Do you know a woman named Saryu?

190
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,309
She's a disgrace to all women in Ginza.

191
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,419
Good morning, you two.

192
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,221
I see you've had a lot to drink.

193
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,057
Expense this please.

194
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,860
100,000 yen at a club in Ginza?

195
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,662
I can't write this off as an expense.

196
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,199
But I got information that's worth
more than 100,000 yen.

197
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,303
We've received more files from Mr. Kito.

198
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,742
This woman named Saryu has lost
four family members.

199
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,979
And all four times,
she's received a large sum of money.

200
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,115
Here's the first case.
Sakaki Saryu moved to Tokyo from

201
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,584
<i>a fishing port in Aomori when she was 18.</i>

202
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,553
<i>She commuted to nursing school</i>

203
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,955
<i>while working as a hostess</i>
<i>at a club in Ginza.</i>

204
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,192
<i>At 24, she married a self-employed man</i>
<i>15 years older than her</i>

205
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,660
<i>named Mr. Tajima Katsumi.</i>

206
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,962
The following year, she lost her husband

207
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,897
and got 50 million yen through insurance.

208
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,233
The cause of death was a heart attack.

209
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,702
The autopsy and insurance contract
were faultless.

210
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,139
She got a taste of success.
What's the second case?

211
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,508
When she was 26,
she married another older man,

212
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,410
<i>Mr. Nakatani Ko, a dental surgeon.</i>

213
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,912
Six months later, she lost her husband
to a heart attack

214
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,615
and got 100 million through insurance
and a 500-million inheritance.

215
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,852
Again, the autopsy and insurance contract
were faultless.

216
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,988
The third case?

217
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,024
That's the thing…

218
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,594
When Saryu was 27,
she adopted a 24-year-old man

219
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,430
named Mr. Yagi Kazuya as her son.

220
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,532
One year later, Mr. Kazuya died.

221
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,068
As her son?
They look like a lovey-dovey couple.

222
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,137
-Cause of death?
-Ruptured organs.

223
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,605
What?

224
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,206
Kazuya is the only one who died

225
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,308
from a hit-and-run crash by a dump truck.

226
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,545
And she got a 100-million-yen
insurance payout.

227
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,580
A hit-and-run?

228
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,451
<i>The dump truck was stolen.</i>

229
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,787
<i>The culprit wasn't found</i>
<i>and the case is unsolved.</i>

230
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,356
This one is not like the rest.

231
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,826
And this case is her fourth one.

232
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,197
<i>At 31 years old, Saryu remarried</i>
<i>Ms. Makoto's father, Mr. Shimamura Takezo.</i>

233
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,734
After only four months,
she lost her husband to a heart attack

234
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,571
and got 300 million through insurance
and a 700-million inheritance.

235
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,140
Another heart attack.

236
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,409
The autopsy came back clear

237
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,311
and the insurance contract
was his handwriting.

238
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,015
It's her usual,
100% perfect modus operandi.

239
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:59,885
What tactic did she use
to make them write it themselves?

240
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,188
Did she hypnotize them?

241
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,692
All of their bodies are already cremated.
Mr. Haie,

242
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,762
we can't overturn her perfect crime.

243
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,133
I think we'll just have to
make up a fake report.

244
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,936
Do you actually think I can do
something like that?

245
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,106
-Of course.
-That's the Hyena we know.

246
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,533
There's one interesting fact.

247
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,171
When Saryu was a hostess,
she also worked as a nurse.

248
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,975
But she was suspected of stealing
medical narcotics and quit the hospital.

249
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,877
-Did she steal it?
-There's no proof.

250
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,346
Medicine and poison
are two sides of the same coin.

251
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,680
But how will we

252
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,650
find a breach in this woman's
perfect tactic?

253
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,086
We'll have to search using illegal means.

254
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,588
You won't lie, but you'll break the law.

255
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:13,292
I wouldn't expect less from a man who was
stripped of his attorney's license.

256
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,829
We will not allow you
to use someone's death

257
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,998
as a way of making money.

258
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,042
SHOTO, SHIBUYA, TOKYO
UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD

259
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,113
<i>Yes?</i>

260
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,383
I am from the Osawa Housekeeping Agency.

261
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,451
My name is Mitawa Reiko.

262
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,064
SUSPECTED OF BEING A BLACK WIDOW
SHIMAMURA SARYU

263
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,500
Please come in. I was waiting for you.

264
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,640
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,511
Ever since my husband died,
I haven't had the energy to do anything.

266
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,051
You can ask me to do organizing, cleaning,

267
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,853
or any kind of housework in general.

268
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,988
Have you already had breakfast?

269
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,060
I can make smoothies on my own,

270
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,328
but I have no appetite.

271
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,463
That's not good.

272
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,365
Is there anything you might
be able to eat?

273
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,968
Let's see…

274
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,174
Pancakes with extra whipped cream.

275
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,147
Understood.

276
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,569
I hope you like it.

277
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,845
Oh, that's delicious.

278
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,747
It's so fluffy.

279
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,150
This is the first time I've felt fulfilled

280
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,685
ever since my husband died.

281
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,593
I'm so glad.

282
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,030
Please go ahead
and start cleaning whatever

283
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,064
you notice.

284
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:33,732
Understood.

285
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,507
That smile that won her one billion yen
is out of this world!

286
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:53,986
What happened?

287
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,155
There were two termites.

288
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,723
-Right there!
-What?!

289
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,325
Kill them! Kill them now!

290
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,760
-There must be a nest underground.
-What?

291
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,996
You have to call a company
to exterminate them.

292
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,164
Call them now!

293
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,266
You take care of it!

294
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,801
Understood!

295
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,236
Hello.

296
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,006
Good morning.
We're the pest control company.

297
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,774
Thank you very much.

298
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,609
Ma'am.

299
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,714
I had heard my other clients saying

300
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,282
that this company is very good.

301
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,584
I see. Mr. Suzuki?

302
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,619
Thank you for coming.

303
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,254
Our pleasure.

304
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,590
We'll get to work right away.

305
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,491
Come in.

306
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:36,562
Well then, let's put a protective sheet
over any valuables, just in case.

307
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:40,299
Our treatment doesn't harm the body,

308
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,768
but we're extra careful
with fragile items.

309
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,937
Please do that.

310
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,622
AIR CONDITIONER

311
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,196
Is this a Monet?

312
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:16,902
I've never seen a Monet this big
outside of an art museum.

313
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:20,606
How much does this even cost? Wow…

314
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,544
Actually, I drew that painting.

315
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,811
What?

316
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:28,981
There's no way.

317
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,718
Whoa.

318
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,753
These strokes…

319
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,523
I can't believe it's not real.

320
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,624
I know, right?

321
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,493
Even my husband, who has no interest
in art, was impressed.

322
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,364
He said that I could be a billionaire

323
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,866
if I became an art forger.

324
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,203
That is true.

325
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,538
I would buy them all.

326
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,574
It's literally perfect.

327
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,377
Perfect?

328
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,717
You two are so funny.

329
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,288
And both of you are so good
at complimenting people.

330
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,892
Excuse me.

331
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,662
Can we stop chatting and get on with it?

332
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,475
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

333
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,943
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

334
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,045
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,714
Oh, sorry about that.

336
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,683
It's a little far.

337
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,220
Please wait a little bit. Can you reach?

338
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,990
Sorry, it'll take a little longer.
Man, it went so far.

339
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,697
Thank you.

340
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,538
My friend

341
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,341
invited me on a cruise
for a change of pace.

342
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,977
I think you should go.

343
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,745
You think so?

344
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,248
Maybe I will then.

345
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,751
The cruise supposedly
circles around Tokyo Bay.

346
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,220
<i>But I might get seasick.</i>

347
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,256
<i>Oh, that's true.</i>

348
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,745
Shall we get started?

349
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,315
-What did you say?
-Huh?

350
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,488
-Let's begin the fumigation.
-Let's begin the fumigation!

351
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,256
SMOKE INSECTICIDE

352
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:11,777
My goodness, this is really amazing.

353
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,179
It's perfect.

354
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,953
The more I look at it,
the more it scares me.

355
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,129
I'm back.

356
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,199
Welcome back. How was it?

357
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,735
We tested for any traces of poison

358
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,338
and found absolutely none.

359
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,709
I had the Cutting Edge Analysis Lab
of Forensic Science test them.

360
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,245
And even their role play toys

361
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,213
came back clean.

362
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,149
She's perfect, after all.

363
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,485
She looks vulnerable,
but her tactic is flawless.

364
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,089
She was cute, though.

365
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,124
Men are so easy.

366
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,359
Reiko.

367
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,463
Something about bad women
piques a man's curiosity.

368
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,232
Exactly. It's so thrilling.

369
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,067
Look at this.

370
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,737
I found Saryu communicating in Russian
in her computer history.

371
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:12,704
Russian?

372
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,207
She's scheduling something. She's probably

373
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,776
connected to some kind of
Russian syndicate.

374
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,111
That's a problem.

375
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,445
They have a lot of methods

376
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,180
of killing that we don't know about.

377
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,315
Seriously?

378
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,851
And I found out through
Saryu's smartphone history

379
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:26,985
that her new money…

380
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,087
I mean, her new relationship
has already begun.

381
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,990
Are you serious?

382
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,259
Do you know her next target?

383
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,095
Sakaguchi Keita, 58 years old.
A rich plastic surgeon

384
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,964
who owns several clinics.

385
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,632
Of course, he's single.

386
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,934
The perfect target.

387
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,170
If he doesn't have family,
his inheritance will

388
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,072
go to Saryu once they get married.

389
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,074
I finally understand why Mr. Kito

390
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,509
is willing to break the law

391
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,678
to prevent her from
getting the insurance payout.

392
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,480
Well then, please continue
your undercover mission.

393
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:59,751
Back to doing a mountain of housework…

394
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,955
You're very good.

395
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,358
You know where all the muscle fibers

396
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,126
and lymph nodes are.

397
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,029
Thank you.

398
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:17,169
I must say, your skin is so beautiful.

399
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,870
You're too nice.

400
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,541
But no matter how much
you take care of yourself,

401
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,543
you can't win against youth.

402
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,712
How old are you?

403
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,880
I'm 24.

404
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,749
Twenty-four, huh?

405
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,619
If only I could go back in time…

406
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,825
Oh, please.
I'm sure you haven't changed at all.

407
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,794
I have changed. A lot.

408
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,997
Did you know?

409
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,900
It's easy

410
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,070
for you to start running,

411
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,273
but once you get to a certain point,

412
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,210
there is no turning back.

413
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,815
You have no choice but to keep running.

414
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,620
<i>Forever…</i>

415
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,357
No choice but to keep running…

416
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,638
Why do I have to remember that man?

417
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,774
I knew you'd say that.

418
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,843
But learning about how he acted after

419
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,846
he got remarried will shed some light
on how he died.

420
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,350
Any detail counts.

421
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,688
I remember scoffing at him for something.

422
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,891
<i>Tell me if you ever need help.</i>

423
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,659
You can even

424
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,294
write me a letter.

425
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,496
To tell you the truth,

426
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,566
I decided to remarry
after starting an exchange diary.

427
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,104
Emails are boring
and you can't see their true qualities.

428
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,239
But with exchange diaries,

429
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:05,076
you can see their personality,
way of thinking, and everything.

430
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,047
In the end, he was tricked and murdered,

431
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,449
so he's nothing but a fool.

432
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,818
An exchange diary?

433
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,054
I see. So that's what it was…

434
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,290
Are you onto something?

435
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,527
We might be able

436
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,696
to get back the entire inheritance

437
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,765
that you should have received.

438
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,335
I won't get my hopes up.

439
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,472
But please do what you can for my mother.

440
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,276
-An exchange diary?
-Yeah.

441
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,612
Now that you mention it,
Saryu was into that.

442
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,414
She spoke a regional dialect,

443
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,216
so she struggled at communicating

444
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,051
and couldn't get clients.

445
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:48,887
So she came up with that idea herself.

446
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,558
Her parents died when she was small,
so she wanted to become a nurse.

447
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,895
She was working as a hostess
to pay for her tuition.

448
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,464
That's a touching story.

449
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,200
That's why I thought highly of her
at first too.

450
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,069
<i>She had nice handwriting,</i>

451
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,570
<i>so she would write thank you cards</i>

452
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,006
<i>to clients on behalf of other hostesses.</i>

453
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,108
On their behalf?

454
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:14,145
But after her first husband died,
she received

455
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,780
<i>an insurance payout, as you know.</i>

456
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,149
<i>That is when she completely changed.</i>

457
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,752
She started preying on wealthy people,

458
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,388
moving from one bar to the next.

459
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,260
Those she latches onto die without fail.

460
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,562
She is a monster.

461
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,290
YAGI KAZUYA

462
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,292
OCCUPATION: ART DEALER

463
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,401
Good morning…

464
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,737
This is Mr. Sakaguchi.

465
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,273
We got married.

466
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,575
Nice to meet you.

467
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,087
Congratulations.

468
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,989
She means business.

469
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,191
"Once we move into our new house,

470
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,895
I want to hire you again."
"I'd be lonely without you."

471
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,130
Next thing you know,
I might become her accomplice.

472
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:42,267
I wish Saryu would say that to me.

473
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,869
"I'd be lonely without you."
Can you imagine?

474
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,005
Don't fall for her.

475
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,574
Now that she's married,
that means Mr. Sakaguchi

476
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,843
could die at any time. What should we do?

477
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:58,083
We'll have to find their new house
and just monitor them 24/7.

478
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:01,052
He might've bought a new house
for the two of them.

479
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,420
I'm looking it up.

480
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,724
A property two rich people
can quickly purchase,

481
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,026
or a luxury hotel where they can live…

482
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,261
Found it. Here it is.

483
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,730
That was fast.

484
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,570
I kind of

485
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:59,344
vaguely sense
feelings of sadness from her.

486
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,448
I wonder if she is really guilty?

487
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,553
Who knew Ms. Reiko would fall for her too…

488
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,533
Thanks.

489
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,640
A LOAN SHARK OF THE UNDERWORLD
KANAYAMA RYU

490
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,877
If you have this kind of money,
pay off your debt.

491
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,679
I will soon.

492
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,651
You put me in a risky situation.

493
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,321
Of all things, why the Russians?

494
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,992
In return, I'll pick up the tab.

495
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,129
The Hyena

496
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,866
has finally started
to dabble in murder, huh?

497
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,569
Not at all. I'm doing a kind deed.

498
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,271
For who?

499
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,676
My client and… how should I put this…?

500
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,313
A woman who's lost control of her brakes,

501
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,447
I guess.

502
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,283
You're an idiot.

503
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,955
In our world, idiots get killed real fast.

504
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,827
I will keep that in mind.

505
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,401
How was it?

506
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,871
If this is the same thing,

507
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,339
there's a possibility.

508
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,407
<i>Send that over to the lab.</i>

509
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,447
<i>The moment we met,</i>
<i>I felt like it was destiny.</i>

510
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:45,316
Another day went by with nothing but you

511
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,418
on my mind.

512
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:49,988
Me too.

513
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,425
Will you stay by my side forever?

514
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,564
I'll never let you go.

515
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,234
Rock, paper, scissors.

516
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,369
Darn!

517
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,338
I have to listen to this all night?

518
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,807
Do you want him to be killed?

519
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:09,841
Fine, I get it.

520
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:10,909
Good night.

521
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,450
-Good morning.
-Morning.

522
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,661
-Bye.
-Bye.

523
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,336
Mr. Sakaguchi is alive.

524
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,083
Damn it, she made him drink it.

525
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,284
I'll call an ambulance.

526
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,286
Sensei, Mr. Sakaguchi is…

527
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,855
Darn.

528
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,557
Reiko, can you do me a favor?

529
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:13,905
I found it.

530
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,009
Good.

531
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,411
Sorry for the wait.

532
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,414
I brought the original copies
of every insurance contract

533
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,651
that Saryu was involved in,
including Mr. Shimamura's.

534
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,919
Even ones from other companies.

535
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,187
I've been waiting for this.

536
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:32,123
-Tomonaga, please analyze this too.
-Okay.

537
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,791
Please return them ASAP

538
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,159
for compliance reasons.

539
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,528
Who do you think I am?

540
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,698
Mr. Kito, you've had to
get your hands dirty too, huh?

541
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,101
This is part of my job as a member

542
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,936
of the special affairs department.

543
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,371
What about the poison?

544
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:49,007
Ms. Reiko is running it through
the machine in the lab.

545
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:49,908
See you.

546
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,845
Mr. Kito,

547
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,848
shall we go too?

548
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,128
I am Kito from Daikoku Seimei.

549
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,076
Is this what you're looking for?

550
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,077
WILL

551
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,879
Mrs. Sakaguchi Saryu?

552
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,481
Both Mr. Sakaguchi and Mr. Shimamura

553
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,985
conveniently left behind
an insurance contract and a will…

554
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:34,886
Not.

555
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:39,090
You forged them, didn't you?

556
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,191
Just like you did

557
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,193
this Monet painting.

558
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,764
What are you talking about, Mr. Termite?

559
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,633
Did you exterminate the termites?

560
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,237
Are you going to exterminate me next?

561
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,114
TOMONAGA
ANALYSIS COMPLETE

562
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:06,751
Pardon me.

563
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:11,055
I am Haie Nao, an inheritance detective.

564
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,195
You see, when I came here
to exterminate the termites,

565
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,830
I saw your sketchbook.

566
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,265
And I remembered

567
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:25,470
how Leonardo da Vinci drew sketches
of birds that look like burst shots.

568
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:28,006
He drew how their wings flap,

569
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:31,075
something which
the human eye cannot capture.

570
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:34,512
He was able to see things that
only super slow-mo cameras can capture.

571
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,748
I guess that's what made him a genius.

572
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,917
And you can do the same thing, can't you?

573
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:44,222
Oh? Have you already heard this before?

574
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,524
No.

575
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,793
I see.

576
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,062
You probably have the ability

577
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,964
to recall everything you've seen

578
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,432
in the form of an image.

579
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,801
And you learned how to use
your extensive memory

580
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,003
to easily copy people's handwriting.

581
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,840
Thanks to your exchange diaries.

582
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,209
YOU'RE SUCH A WONDERFUL WOMAN

583
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,310
TAKEZO

584
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,453
Tomonaga.
Please tell us the analysis results.

585
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,589
After analyzing
Mr. Sakaguchi's will, along with

586
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,324
all of the original copies
of past insurance contracts,

587
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:23,327
I found a common idiosyncrasy.

588
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,929
Huh?

589
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,668
A subtle difference in ink distribution
due to the change in pen pressure.

590
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,804
Only I could have noticed this.

591
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,505
You can call it an art.

592
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,543
This corner? I don't see it at all.

593
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:45,315
<i>My conclusion is that Saryu forged</i>
<i>all of the original copies.</i>

594
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,085
You heard him.

595
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,355
I don't get it.

596
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,357
Even if I was able to copy

597
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,359
someone else's handwriting,

598
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,726
the insurance paperwork has to

599
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:58,029
be filled out by them.

600
00:34:58,629 --> 00:34:59,664
About that…

601
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,432
After an internal investigation,

602
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,967
one of our insurance salespeople

603
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,236
has admitted to being dishonest.

604
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,638
Insurance salespeople who conclude

605
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,108
shady contracts just to reach
their sales quota

606
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:13,044
are part of the dark side
of insurance companies.

607
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,645
In other words, a Code Black.

608
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,883
Even if you are right,

609
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,353
what crime are you trying
to charge me with?

610
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,224
Forgery of a private document
with signature or seal?

611
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,592
Maybe even fraud?

612
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,063
What are you talking about?

613
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,398
The most important one

614
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,601
is murder.

615
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,305
Me? How?

616
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,674
Go ahead and search this entire house.

617
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,815
This is something I obtained
through a certain route.

618
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,084
<i>It works kind of like</i>

619
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,754
a muscle relaxant
and naturally induces a heart attack.

620
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,589
It isn't available domestically,

621
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,758
so autopsies in Japan don't check for it.

622
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,661
It even passes more than
200 toxicology tests undetected.

623
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:07,632
It's basically
an unknown foreign-made poison.

624
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,935
Actually, while Mr. Sakaguchi was being

625
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,336
taken to the hospital,

626
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,306
my assistant sneaked inside your new home

627
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,909
and obtained some
of your homemade smoothie

628
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,410
<i>for analysis.</i>

629
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,046
Tomonaga, what are the results?

630
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,649
<i>Bingo. The same kind of poison</i>
<i>as the unknown poison</i>

631
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,050
<i>was found.</i>

632
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,253
Now that we've specified the poison,
success is ours.

633
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,422
The cup in the sink with remnants of

634
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,125
the smoothie, has both

635
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,760
Mr. Sakaguchi's and your fingerprints.

636
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,029
We've preserved the crime scene.

637
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,097
Once we give it to the police

638
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,733
and forensics can detect the same poison,

639
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,036
you know what will happen, right?

640
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,341
Okay, then!

641
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,643
I'm done presenting the facts…

642
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,478
except just one thing.

643
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,182
It's about Mr. Kazuya,

644
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,885
whom you adopted.

645
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,190
The other day, I went to the art gallery
where Mr. Kazuya worked.

646
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,192
And I heard from the owner…

647
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,096
Mr. Kazuya was trying to become
an art critic.

648
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,633
You two met when you just
happened to walk into that gallery.

649
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,669
About a year later,
an unfortunate accident happened.

650
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,638
A hit-and-run crash by a dump truck.

651
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:25,910
There is no doubt
that you two were lovers.

652
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,980
This sketch says it all.

653
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:34,085
I heard you wanted to be a painter
before you became a nurse.

654
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,320
I bet Mr. Kazuya saw your drawings

655
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,222
and talked to you about Leonardo da Vinci.

656
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,860
By memorizing Mr. Kazuya's

657
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,528
every single move,

658
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,064
you knew him more than he knew himself.

659
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:50,301
You were actually capable
of feeling pure love.

660
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,637
However,

661
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,040
there is no way
the underground organization would

662
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,575
let you go straight.

663
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:58,843
Kazuya!

664
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,856
Are you okay?

665
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,065
Here is what I think happened.

666
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,600
At first, you were tricked by

667
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,602
the organization
into accepting the insurance payout.

668
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,805
Then you started working as a black widow.

669
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:28,806
But

670
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,310
you fell in love with a man, Mr. Kazuya.

671
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,813
And so, you secretly adopted him,
so that he would

672
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,183
receive your inheritance
if anything happened to you.

673
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,187
Your contract with the organization
most likely specified

674
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,956
that you must kill
whoever you get married to.

675
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,559
But the mafia didn't allow you
to use such a loophole,

676
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,261
and they killed Mr. Kazuya.

677
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,464
Did they threaten you by saying,
"Don't even think

678
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,699
you can cut ties with us"?

679
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,405
Whatever your situation is,

680
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,942
the fact that you killed
these men who loved you

681
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,111
is a serious crime.

682
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:13,918
Do you know about
the "causes of disqualification of heir"?

683
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,721
Article 891 of the Civil Code states that

684
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,523
a person who causes
the death of a decedent

685
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,192
or forges their will

686
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,993
shall lose their inheritance rights.

687
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,296
In other words,

688
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,231
neither Mr. Sakaguchi

689
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,033
nor Mr. Shimamura's inheritance

690
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,735
is yours.

691
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,312
How strange…

692
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:48,486
I felt a little relieved right now.

693
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:51,655
I told you, remember?

694
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,892
It's easy for you to start running,

695
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,895
but once you get to a certain point,

696
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,830
there is no turning back.

697
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,068
So you have no choice but to maintain
your form and run.

698
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:09,473
Even if you run out of breath, grow old,

699
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,142
or lose something along the way.

700
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,545
Forever…

701
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,747
and ever…

702
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,989
It's just as you said.

703
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:28,225
I can recall anything
as if it were an image.

704
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,470
But I just couldn't let go
of this sketchbook…

705
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,608
In order for me to keep running.

706
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:48,312
Who knew this would bring me down.

707
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,616
You win.

708
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,697
Mr. Haie Nao…

709
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,270
If only I had met you sooner…

710
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:50,708
Sensei, she was definitely preying on you.

711
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,411
You'd better watch out or you'll be next.

712
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,779
Reiko,

713
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,682
she'll most likely get the death penalty.

714
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,607
As a result,
Daikoku Seimei is not required

715
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,743
to pay the insurance payout.

716
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,645
And Mr. Shimamura's entire inheritance

717
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,812
will be given to

718
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,681
Ms. Makoto, his only heir.

719
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:31,649
Well then,

720
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,886
I will deliver
the ten million yen in cash,

721
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,089
as promised.

722
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,826
That will be much appreciated.

723
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,298
The entire inheritance…

724
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:50,701
goes to me?

725
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:52,536
Yes.

726
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,839
Please use it to

727
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,075
ease your mother's burden.

728
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:09,587
My father wasn't good to me or my mother.

729
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:14,325
But still…

730
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,161
He didn't deserve to be killed.

731
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,802
He was taken away
and I can't even complain to him again.

732
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:34,945
That's just…

733
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,115
It shouldn't happen.

734
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:41,518
I agree with you.

735
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,961
Hey, Hyena.

736
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,299
That was quite the success, huh?

737
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,937
Thanks to you,
my reportage on black widows

738
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,139
became a series.

739
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:03,173
FREELANCE WRITER FOR A WEEKLY MAGAZINE
HAGETA KAORU

740
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,975
Thank you so much.

741
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,981
I will gather as much

742
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,718
information as I can
until Saryu's execution.

743
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:19,556
Oh, right.

744
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:25,295
If you pull the same
dirty tricks as before,

745
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:28,899
I wouldn't mind writing
an article about you again.

746
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:32,736
LAWYER'S EMBEZZLEMENT

747
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,689
<i>Marie Antoinette?</i>

748
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,991
<i>I bet the will said something weird.</i>

749
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,092
I don't know.
