00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,440
THE LEGENDARY CONFECTIONERY

2
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:16,149
<i>They look as fresh as real fruits.</i>

3
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:21,154
<i>It's hard to believe that these are</i>
<i>state-of-the-art nerikiri,</i>

4
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,790
<i>a type of Japanese confectionery.</i>

5
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,659
PROFESSIONALISM

6
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:31,064
<i>In a quiet little residential neighborhood</i>

7
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,500
<i>in Kitashirakawa, Kyoto,</i>

8
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,335
<i>this fusion of centuries-old tradition</i>

9
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:39,039
<i>and innovative ideas</i>
<i>has created a microcosm.</i>

10
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:45,211
<i>This is the work of Houou,</i>
<i>a confectioner universally recognized</i>

11
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,680
<i>for making the world's best</i>
<i>Japanese confectioneries.</i>

12
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:48,782
HOUOU

13
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:52,185
I'd feel bad eating them.
They all look like pieces of art.

14
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,522
After all, it's Kyoto's famous
Japanese confectionery that's said to be

15
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,323
more beautiful than a Bulgari jewel.

16
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,225
I haven't had one in a while.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,429
-I order them at least once a month.
-What?!

18
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,464
Then why aren't you sharing them?

19
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:11,571
What makes Houou great is the owner,
Hyakumanben Koichi,

20
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,807
and his son and apprentice, Yashin.

21
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:18,912
Mr. Koichi is a Living National Treasure
who received the Medal with Yellow Ribbon.

22
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:22,682
Following in his footsteps
is his son, Yashin,

23
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,685
a young genius trying to
master the art by using

24
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,554
unconventional techniques.

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,522
I wonder what is going on in the minds

26
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:34,461
of people who can make confectionery
that is this beautiful and delicious.

27
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,130
But man, Mr. Koichi looks so scary.

28
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,698
He's famous for never smiling.

29
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,134
In Kyoto, he's famous
for being an odd person.

30
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,802
By the way, that guy named Yashin

31
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,904
is supposedly the mistress' son.

32
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,876
The wife's son is a good-for-nothing
rich boy who doesn't work at all

33
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,778
and is always hanging around Ponto-cho.

34
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,013
He seems to be popular
with the geishas, though.

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,982
I didn't know about that.

36
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,951
I am a Kyoto local, after all.

37
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,753
Oh right, you dropped out of
Kyoto Medical and Dental University.

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,222
I didn't drop out. I'm taking a break.

39
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,090
-You're going to return?
-That's why I'm saving up.

40
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,391
You won't save anything working here.

41
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,094
That's the problem!

42
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:09,795
Yay!

43
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,832
<i>Maybe I'll ask Attorney Fukushi</i>
<i>to make me his</i>

44
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,801
personal trainer.

45
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,203
-What? That's a possibility?
-What? That's a possibility?

46
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,706
I am a capable trainer, after all.

47
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,442
I get recruited quite often.

48
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,843
Interesting.

49
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,913
Hey!

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,414
What is going on?!

51
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,315
KOICHI'S WIFE
HYAKUMANBEN MIYABI

52
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,885
Masaomi is nowhere to be seen!

53
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,621
You're the real heir!

54
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,291
They're making it seem like
Yashin is his successor.

55
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,027
This is ridiculous!

56
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,429
No way. That's definitely not happening.

57
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,864
Mr. Yohei,

58
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,200
you didn't check it?

59
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,502
I'm very sorry.

60
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,403
HEAD CLERK OF HOUOU
ICHIJOJI YOHEI

61
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,705
I'll have to call the producer

62
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,340
and put in a complaint.

63
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,209
Mom, in that case, tell them

64
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,947
that this kind of sloppy production
is the reason why

65
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,082
the TV industry is going downhill.

66
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,252
Madam! We have an emergency!

67
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,954
-I'm the one in an emergency.
-No.

68
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,023
The owner collapsed.

69
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,659
What?! What did you say?

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,029
Master, hang in there.

71
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,298
-Master!
-Dad! Dad!

72
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,699
Ko!

73
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,135
Dad! Dad!

74
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,920
Dad!

75
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,056
Master!

76
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,427
HOUOU

77
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,431
TWO WEEKS LATER

78
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:01,808
Can you work, please?

79
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,443
I would if I had work to do.

80
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,879
I want to go on a trip somewhere.

81
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,849
Didn't you take a motorcycle trip
to Hakone?

82
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,750
HAKONE MANJU

83
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,252
That's right,

84
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,854
didn't you go to a hot spring
in Hakone too?

85
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,457
Bikers in Tokyo ride to Hakone
to break in their tires.

86
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,726
I don't consider that a "trip."

87
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,296
I'll let you take time off, so go
ride around Suzuka Circuit or something.

88
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,898
I want to go

89
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,368
on a business trip or something with

90
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,971
meal and transportation expenses included.

91
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,507
Life isn't that easy…

92
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,112
Hello.

93
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,814
Is this the office for

94
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,117
Inheritance Detective Haie?

95
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,185
Yes. Please, come in.

96
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,323
Oh?

97
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,393
This scent is from the sachets
they make in Masuya-cho, Kyoto,

98
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,395
called the Scent of Kitashirakawa.

99
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,196
You really are a detective, huh?

100
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,265
How did you know?

101
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:03,169
No, she is nothing but an assistant.
She just used to live in Kyoto.

102
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,804
-Watch it.
-Okay.

103
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,441
Did you come all the way from Kyoto?

104
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,244
The truth is,

105
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,745
I am an employee

106
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,081
at a confectionery in Kyoto called Houou.

107
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,717
A confectionery called Houou?

108
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,787
We just watched the documentary.

109
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,322
We also just found out

110
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:26,225
the other day that Mr. Hyakumanben Koichi
passed away suddenly.

111
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,428
We are also in shock.

112
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:33,266
He always had high blood pressure,
so he was trying to be careful.

113
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,500
He had a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

114
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,103
He was still young too…

115
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,472
We offer our sincere condolences.

116
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,242
The owner's art is lost from this world.

117
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,679
It is truly regrettable.

118
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,049
Well then…

119
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,853
What does an employee of Houou
want from us?

120
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,158
If you watched the TV show,
you probably know already,

121
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,194
but a craftsman named Yashin

122
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,363
worked under Mr. Koichi.

123
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,200
He is my son.

124
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,869
-So you're the mistress--
-Hey.

125
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,238
Sorry.

126
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:13,940
It's okay…

127
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,074
YASHIN'S MOTHER
MIYAKOSHI TATSUKO

128
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,843
Originally,

129
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,245
I was officially his fiancée.

130
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,881
But as the generations changed,

131
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,651
my family's business started
struggling financially and went bankrupt.

132
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,087
Then his mother said
our family statuses were now

133
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,823
incompatible,
and our engagement was called off.

134
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,192
What an old-fashioned way of thinking.

135
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,727
It's common in Kyoto.

136
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:38,765
After that,
he married his wife, Ms. Miyabi,

137
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,367
but she couldn't conceive a child
for a while.

138
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,736
So Mr. Koichi asked me

139
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,005
to give birth to his child and promised

140
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,174
to marry me in exchange.

141
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,675
So I gave birth to Yashin.

142
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,077
I see.

143
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,045
But the following year,

144
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,482
<i>his wife, Ms. Miyabi, became pregnant.</i>

145
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,551
What timing…

146
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:02,221
<i>And she had Mr. Masaomi,</i>
<i>their legitimate son.</i>

147
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,057
Ever since,
I've been called "the mistress,"

148
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,627
and his promise to marry me
went out the window.

149
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,629
Now they treat me like a nuisance.

150
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,697
Horrible…

151
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,366
A bed of nails…

152
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,101
I don't care about me.

153
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,570
I'll take responsibility
for my own actions.

154
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,338
It's just that

155
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,875
I feel so bad for my son, Yashin.

156
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,846
But Mr. Yashin is now a craftsman
who is popular enough to be on TV.

157
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,949
And that's what annoys Mrs. Miyabi.

158
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,851
I see.

159
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,289
So, what is it that you want us to do?

160
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,761
In the event that
you cannot accept my request,

161
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,629
I want you to

162
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,364
keep this a secret.

163
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,969
Can you promise me that?

164
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,506
Of course.
We are very strict about confidentiality.

165
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,049
The thing is, after Mr. Koichi died,

166
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,818
we found his will.

167
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,520
WILL

168
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,322
Let me take a look.

169
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,094
His handwriting is too fancy…

170
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,433
"My wife, Miyabi,
and my legitimate son, Masaomi,

171
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,767
will each inherit

172
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,538
<i>half of my inheritance."</i>

173
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,475
Okay.

174
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,445
According to this will,

175
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,749
you will not inherit a single yen.

176
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:40,820
If he has acknowledged paternity for
Mr. Yashin, he can get a small legitime.

177
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:44,123
The genius only gets an eighth?
Ridiculous.

178
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,057
I agree.

179
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,359
By the way,

180
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,830
was this will recognized
as an official will?

181
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,500
Is this really
the late owner's handwriting?

182
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,505
It doesn't look real to me.

183
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,141
I cannot accept this.

184
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,743
That is why

185
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,845
I came here, after hearing that

186
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,515
you are very reputable
regarding inheritance investigations.

187
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,983
I see.

188
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,653
So you're saying that

189
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,055
there is something suspicious
about this will?

190
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,327
The truth is,
it's completely different from what

191
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:25,565
I had heard from Mr. Koichi
when he was alive.

192
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,000
Completely different in what way?

193
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,102
He told me that

194
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,039
the Houou brand will go to Masaomi,

195
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,475
while the workshop
and the store will go to Yashin.

196
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,480
Mr. Koichi really said that?

197
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:45,217
Yes. I'm sure I heard him say that.

198
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,461
That is definitely more realistic
than this will.

199
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,130
That is the kind of

200
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,933
odd will that I would expect from

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,338
someone who was known to be odd,
like Mr. Hyakumanben Koichi.

202
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,774
What do you mean?

203
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,276
Mr. Haie

204
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,912
is fired up.

205
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,451
Does that mean you will accept my request?

206
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,853
Let me just make sure.

207
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,056
What you want us to do is prove

208
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,625
that this will is fake, right?

209
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,226
Yes.

210
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,561
I accept.

211
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,096
I will do it for Houou.

212
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,265
Thank you! Thank you very much.

213
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,268
I will make sure to compensate you.

214
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,238
And…

215
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,174
Please enjoy this.

216
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,121
You got the business trip that you wanted.
Will you come?

217
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,890
-You don't have to--
-Of course, I'll go.

218
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:02,328
We finally get to work.

219
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,040
<i>Yashin, the "mistress' son,"</i>

220
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,877
<i>made these this morning with great care.</i>

221
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,112
It's called the <i>Akiburumai.</i>

222
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,751
I will dissect the mind of the owner

223
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,887
who raised the man who made these.

224
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,594
I'm going to Kyoto too.

225
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,464
What about your main job
at the analysis lab?

226
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,700
I will use my paid time off to protect
Yashin the genius.

227
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:44,370
Wow. So, shall we start by investigating
their surroundings like usual?

228
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:48,574
No, this time we'll charge in head-on.
Ms. Tatsuko is prepared for it.

229
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,109
Interesting.

230
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,745
That's surprisingly haphazard of you.

231
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,481
Or more like, bold.

232
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,019
People in Kyoto tend to be
more complex and two-faced.

233
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,988
We need to meet them head-on
for an unbiased outlook.

234
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,025
Assuming that the will is fake,

235
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,461
there are two people who would plot
something like this.

236
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,997
The wife, Miyabi, and her son, Masaomi.

237
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,632
I get it,

238
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,135
but would they really do something

239
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,870
so obviously suspicious?

240
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,872
It's hard to believe.

241
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,342
That's why it's interesting.

242
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,446
God only knows what may happen.
We'll have to go and see.

243
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,282
To the Eternal Capital we go!

244
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,132
A very simple trick…

245
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,467
-We're here.
-So impressive.

246
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,603
I wonder if she is finally
going to leave this store?

247
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,975
I'll make sure to enjoy
every minute of this.

248
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:04,049
Kyoto's streets are said to
resemble the squares of a <i>go</i> board,

249
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,819
but they're actually more rectangular.

250
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,988
Because Hideyoshi built new roads
in the Tensho era.

251
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,791
My goodness,
there are so many foreign tourists.

252
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,260
What?

253
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,029
Ms. Reiko, you're not staying
at your family's house?

254
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,600
Well, we're here for work.

255
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,235
That's right.

256
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,349
Hey,

257
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,186
why do you look so nervous being back

258
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,155
in the city where you were
born and raised?

259
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,191
You sound so creepy. I'm not nervous.

260
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,561
Are you worried about
bumping into old classmates?

261
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,196
Not at all. Let's go.

262
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,001
Hey, wait for me.

263
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,339
<i>Kitashirakawa is located</i>
<i>near Ginkaku-ji and Daimonjiyama</i>

264
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,907
<i>and the Philosopher's Walk.</i>

265
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,144
<i>It's a quiet residential neighborhood</i>
<i>where many of Kyoto University</i>

266
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,546
<i>and Doshisha University's</i>
<i>professors and students live.</i>

267
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,116
<i>It's also near</i>
<i>the Tenkaippin flagship store.</i>

268
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,284
TENKAIPPIN FLAGSHIP STORE

269
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,321
Mr. Haie,

270
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,624
why is Ms. Reiko
taking a break from school?

271
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:23,395
That story goes back to when I was
still a lawyer and she was my client.

272
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,664
So I can't talk about it, even to you.

273
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,767
I see how it is.

274
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,803
We're here.

275
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,947
HOUOU

276
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,187
Beautiful.

277
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:52,258
Everything, from the confectionery
to the storefront, is a work of art.

278
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,393
So impressive.

279
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,697
Mr. Haie and everyone,

280
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,333
thank you for coming all the way here.

281
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,702
The pleasure is ours.

282
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,039
Mom, are they the ones?

283
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,611
Oh? Ms. Tatsuko,

284
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,680
are these customers your friends?

285
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,749
They aren't customers.

286
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,550
Then what are they?

287
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,020
We're not suspicious.

288
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,355
Anyway, come this way.

289
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,358
Mrs. Miyabi is here too.

290
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,564
She said it's important.

291
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:36,635
I wonder if Ms. Tatsuko is finally
going to leave this store?

292
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,810
Sorry to make you wait.

293
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,679
Hey, wait!

294
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,515
Ma'am…

295
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,351
Ms. Tatsuko, who are these people?

296
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:57,289
I am Haie, an inheritance detective.

297
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,193
An inheritance detective?

298
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,695
What is going on?

299
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:06,565
I was hired by Ms. Tatsuko to investigate

300
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,167
the authenticity of this will.

301
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,369
That is right.

302
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,237
What?!

303
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,073
Excuse me, Ms. Tatsuko?

304
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,210
Discussions about the inheritance
are finished already.

305
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,379
Why are you bringing these people in now?

306
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,351
I'm still grieving
and everything makes me cry.

307
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,553
Me too.

308
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,522
Shameless people
sure do things differently.

309
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,426
I'd never be able to
do something like this.

310
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,394
Seriously.

311
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:40,232
How could you rub salt into the wound
when she is already grieving?

312
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,135
Let's have them leave. Come on.

313
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,072
You too, Mr. Detective.

314
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,675
Did you take everything
Ms. Tatsuko claimed

315
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,643
at face value?

316
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,280
Nobody else heard
what she claims to have heard.

317
00:16:55,914 --> 00:17:00,152
I'm sorry you wasted your time
coming all the way here.

318
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,987
Shall I make you some tea?

319
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,155
Yes, please.

320
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,556
In Kyoto, that means "leave."

321
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:07,059
Well then, have a safe trip home.

322
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:11,063
Sorry, but you're not my client.

323
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,535
Ms. Tatsuko, do you really want to

324
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,970
back down?

325
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:20,772
Mom.

326
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,477
You've been enduring it all
for a long time.

327
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,213
You should do what you wish this time.

328
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,886
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

329
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:40,225
Inheritance always leads to conflict,
so much so that people spell it

330
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,694
with the characters meaning,
"a fighting clan."

331
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,831
Ms. Tatsuko, what will you do?

332
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,468
Don't you want to respect

333
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,203
the late Mr. Koichi's real wish?

334
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,106
-What are you saying? How rude!
-What are you saying? How rude!

335
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,578
It's the doctrine of laches.

336
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,916
In other words, if you don't assert
your rights, the law won't help you.

337
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,418
When it comes to inheritance,

338
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,788
if you don't fight,
you don't attain anything.

339
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,096
But if you tell me to leave, I will leave.

340
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,335
Houou's confectionery

341
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:27,406
and tradition must be protected
no matter what happens.

342
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,589
Are you okay?

343
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,392
I'm okay.

344
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,300
Mr. Haie.

345
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,437
I will fight.

346
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,173
Understood.

347
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,842
Well, well…

348
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,512
You're taking advantage
of someone else's misfortune.

349
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,348
What a brazen little thief.

350
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:14,319
Well then, let's see what you're made of.

351
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,423
Wow, the upside down broom!

352
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,626
That's a legendary way
of signaling someone to leave.

353
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,663
I've only seen people do it
in manga and dramas.

354
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,503
Well then,

355
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,505
I'll make sure to enjoy

356
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:38,343
every minute of this away game.

357
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,919
TWO DAYS LATER

358
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,121
This is delicious.

359
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,991
When I'm in Kyoto,
I realize the importance of tradition.

360
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,961
Everything from the design of this room
to this flavor.

361
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,996
-It's all beyond amazing.
-Yup.

362
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,965
Osaka's famous motto, "eat till you drop"

363
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,534
must've been meant for Kyoto instead.

364
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,938
"Eat till you drop"?

365
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,807
I'm about to drop from starvation.

366
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,476
It's a bigger issue
that you're late to our meeting.

367
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,113
Thank you for your work.
We can hold the meeting while you eat.

368
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,549
Okay, thank you.

369
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,954
It's not much,
but I've collected some information.

370
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:27,059
The truth is, ever since the owner died,

371
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,696
Ms. Miyabi and Mr. Yohei
have been running Houou.

372
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,998
<i>Mr. Masaomi, the eldest son,</i>

373
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,367
<i>-doesn't even show up at the store.</i>
-Cheers!

374
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,002
<i>He spends all his time in Ponto-cho.</i>

375
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,706
<i>Rumor has it that</i>
<i>because he's getting the inheritance,</i>

376
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,808
<i>he's been traveling everywhere,</i>

377
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,943
<i>staying at expensive hotels,</i>

378
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,545
<i>and playing around.</i>

379
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,048
All that during his own father's
mourning period.

380
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,117
The owner's will

381
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,720
didn't leave any of his inheritance
for Mr. Yashin.

382
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:59,057
Mr. Yashin was already an outcast,

383
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,226
<i>but because of that,</i>

384
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,895
<i>Madam and Mr. Yohei have been</i>
<i>bullying him even more.</i>

385
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:07,899
-And yet he's so arrogant.
-So arrogant.

386
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,938
<i>Mr. Yashin</i>

387
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,741
isn't ambitious at all,
even though his name means, "ambition."

388
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:19,378
He's down-to-earth
and a true, hard-working craftsman.

389
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,514
<i>And he's the only one who has skills</i>

390
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,082
<i>that are on par with the owner's.</i>

391
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,585
<i>He's a great craftsman.</i>

392
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,254
That's why it's so sad…

393
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,924
At this rate, who knows

394
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,827
how long Houou can survive.

395
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,065
However, all the people
who agreed to talk to me

396
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,703
were the minority within Houou
who are sympathetic to you two.

397
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,072
So it's just one-sided information.

398
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,742
But it was enough to make me
believe the owner's words

399
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,378
that you claim to have heard.

400
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,447
Well, of course.

401
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,550
Mr. Masaomi doesn't show up
at the store at all.

402
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,786
Who would sympathize with
a good-for-nothing rich boy?

403
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,220
Um…

404
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,525
There is one thing that I'm curious about.

405
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,895
To my surprise,

406
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,797
Mr. Masaomi is apparently

407
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,900
opening up a branch of the store
in the newly built

408
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,401
Kiyomizu-Gojo Building.

409
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,969
What? A Houou store?

410
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,139
Supposedly, Mr. Yohei, the head clerk,

411
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,576
is going to be in charge of the branch,

412
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,845
kind of like a franchise agreement.

413
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:30,749
The 49-day mourning period for
the previous owner hasn't even finished,

414
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,951
<i>and yet they're so quick to take action.</i>

415
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,087
Was it Mrs. Miyabi's idea?

416
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,455
I don't know.

417
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,524
First of all,

418
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,027
why Mr. Yohei?

419
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,329
What do you mean?

420
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,064
Originally, Mr. Yohei

421
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:49,201
never had a good relationship with

422
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,204
Mr. Masaomi or Mrs. Miyabi.

423
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,809
Well, that's interesting.

424
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,592
They don't get along,
but they're teaming up…

425
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:17,362
That leads to one hypothesis.

426
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,667
There must be special circumstances…

427
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,036
Huh? What do you mean?

428
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:30,876
They're putting the head clerk,
who they don't get along with, in charge

429
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,879
of Houou's very first branching out store
or franchise or whatever.

430
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,149
Which means, there must be some kind of

431
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,384
special circumstance.

432
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,790
In other words,
Yohei has something on Miyabi.

433
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,925
I think it's safe to say that.

434
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,027
I see.

435
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,165
Well then, what does he have on her?

436
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,571
I know! The existence of the real will.

437
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:03,842
Yes. One that is unfavorable
for Miyabi and Masaomi at that.

438
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,712
If you think about it like that,
it all makes sense.

439
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,382
-Which means--
-Our next mission.

440
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,117
It's to find the real one.

441
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:17,489
But wouldn't they have already
disposed of the real one?

442
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:20,792
I'm sure Miyabi wants to dispose of it.

443
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:24,863
But remember,
we are in the capital of deception.

444
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,231
If Yohei

445
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,668
disposes of the real will,
Miyabi might betray him.

446
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,137
I see. That's true.

447
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,171
Which means,

448
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,708
there is no way Yohei has
disposed of the will.

449
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,878
I'm sure he has it hidden somewhere.

450
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,180
After all, that's how he can
threaten Miyabi at any time.

451
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,849
So, where is it?

452
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,318
Who knows?

453
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,857
Don't worry.

454
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,593
A very simple trick

455
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,763
will get Yohei to voluntarily
hand it over to us.

456
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,907
That detective from yesterday.

457
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,076
-Was he telling the truth?
-It's time to open the store.

458
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,844
About them finding the real will?

459
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,179
The real will?

460
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:16,982
That's right.

461
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,618
The detective apparently found it.

462
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,652
This is crazy.

463
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,421
What'll happen to Mr. Yohei's store?

464
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,924
If the owner was alive,

465
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,826
he would never have allowed that!

466
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,663
What is going on, Mr. Yohei!

467
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,834
Everyone at the store is saying that
the detective found the real will.

468
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,637
What?! That can't be!

469
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,040
You didn't throw away that will?

470
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,576
Give me a second!

471
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,984
Room 411, please.

472
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,265
WILL

473
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,502
What the heck! It's still here.

474
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,538
I was almost tricked by some stupid rumor.

475
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,075
So, this is the real will?

476
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,910
Give it back, you thief!

477
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,752
Hey! Detective!

478
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,522
Don't think you'll get off easy!

479
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,157
Come on, Mr. Yohei.

480
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,259
We just witnessed you concealing a will,

481
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,195
in other words, committing a crime
called Damaging Documents for Private Use.

482
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,196
That's right.

483
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,266
And because you attacked us,
we protected ourselves.

484
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:45,270
We used reasonable force,
so it is nothing but self-defense.

485
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,038
We have video proof.

486
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:52,877
Damn it!

487
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,646
Ms. Tatsuko.

488
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:03,622
Does this match the handwriting

489
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:04,856
of the late Mr. Koichi?

490
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,259
Yes. I'm pretty sure.

491
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,563
His way of writing Houou in cursive

492
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,998
is very unique.

493
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,933
I will perform an official analysis later.

494
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,203
All right. Please contact the police
and those involved at Houou.

495
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,838
Damn it!

496
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,907
Hey, call my lawyer!

497
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,709
-Madam!
-I won't say anything!

498
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,012
-We just have a few questions.
-I won't say anything!

499
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,513
-Get in the car.
-Calm down.

500
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,348
-Come on.
-Madam!

501
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,751
-Calm down.
-What is going on…?

502
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,353
HOUOU

503
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,055
Listen up, everyone.

504
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:40,859
Because my mother did something
uncalled for, the police got involved.

505
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,496
But Houou's reputation
won't go down that easily.

506
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,565
I promise you.

507
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,001
Mr. Hyena?

508
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,072
Haie is my last name
and Nao is my first name.

509
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:58,476
I heard that after an analysis,
you found that it's my father's real will?

510
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:01,413
Subtle idiosyncrasies
and a plethora of Mr. Koichi's prints.

511
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,948
-Which prove that--
-Yashin, how about this?

512
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,886
For the sake of both of our reputations,
let's be open with our employees

513
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,055
and have a third party, Mr. Hyena,

514
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,891
reveal the details of the will.

515
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,363
If that's what you wish,

516
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,432
I'm glad to accept.

517
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,737
Well then, here is his will.

518
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:27,839
WILL

519
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,708
Um…

520
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,911
It's too fancy. Tomonaga, you read it.

521
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,358
"Financial assets,
such as cash and stocks…"

522
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,427
We can't hear!

523
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,833
"Financial assets,
such as cash and stocks,

524
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,268
and the trademark rights to
the confectionery Houou

525
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,104
will all go to Masaomi."

526
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:03,041
"Houou's workshop
and the store's real estate, along with

527
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,343
all personal property
within that real estate

528
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,979
will be inherited by Yashin."

529
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,118
Ms. Miyabi would have been able to
receive a good portion of legitime too,

530
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,287
but because she concealed and falsified
the will, she's disqualified. So…

531
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:21,292
As per the will, Houou will be completely
split between Mr. Masaomi and Mr. Yashin.

532
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,395
Completely split? In what way?

533
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:27,065
In simple terms… Excuse me.

534
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,801
Mr. Masaomi gets money and the brand name.

535
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,303
Mr. Yashin gets the workshop
to make the confectioneries.

536
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,872
The brand versus the workshop.

537
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,340
The name versus the substance.

538
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,308
Do you get it?

539
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,277
The name, or the brand,
goes to Mr. Masaomi.

540
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,081
The actual substance, or the workshop,
goes to Mr. Yashin.

541
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,616
That is what this will is saying.

542
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,485
That is

543
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,555
exactly what he told me when he was alive.

544
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,859
Mr. Haie, thank you very much.

545
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,362
But if

546
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,564
the trademark rights go to Mr. Masaomi,

547
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,799
the confectionery

548
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,635
that we will make here with Mr. Yashin

549
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,404
cannot be sold under the Houou name?

550
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,406
Yeah, I guess so.

551
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,475
-What?!
-That can't be!

552
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:14,679
Well, that's what makes this will so odd.

553
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:20,652
Usually, people pass down the brand
and workshop together to avoid disputes.

554
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,620
But the owner, who was a bit insane…

555
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,389
-Hey…
-Pardon me.

556
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:27,458
But the owner, who was very eccentric,

557
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:30,328
purposely split it up between these two.

558
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:35,466
Well, as the two parties who are involved,
what are your thoughts?

559
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,643
Don't worry, everyone.

560
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,246
We didn't make it this far

561
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:51,216
relying on Houou's brand name alone.

562
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,085
I am satisfied with
inheriting the substance

563
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,688
rather than just the name.

564
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,325
No problem.

565
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,893
I don't have any objections either.

566
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,530
Financial assets and the trademark rights
to Houou are enough for me.

567
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,833
So that means

568
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,470
the owner gave each of them
what they wanted.

569
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,039
-Yeah.
-The owner sure is something.

570
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:18,977
-He knew both of them so well.
-Yeah!

571
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:23,181
Thank goodness.

572
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,917
Those who want to own a franchise
will stick to Masaomi.

573
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,120
Those who want to train as craftsmen
will stick to Yashin.

574
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,189
Something like that, huh?

575
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:34,359
So it was a win-win situation
for everyone.

576
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,727
I guess the case is closed.

577
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:36,628
Actually…

578
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,797
I'm pretty sure the real hard part

579
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,266
is just about to begin.

580
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,972
HOUOU

581
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,409
It really is an odd will…

582
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:57,148
And yet you're still going to
close the case and return to Tokyo?

583
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,585
My job
as an inheritance detective is done.

584
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,122
You're inconsiderate as always.

585
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,726
By the way, where is Ms. Reiko?

586
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,129
Meeting with her professor, apparently.

587
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:20,004
Her father, Mr. Mitomi Takeshi, was
a professor of gastrointestinal surgery

588
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:23,808
who unexpectedly died while disputing
a medical malpractice accusation.

589
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,045
-Hey.
-It's easy to find a court case like this.

590
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,880
Despite not having evidence,

591
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,249
the tabloids and media
covered this case just for fun

592
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,484
and made it seem as if it was true.

593
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,419
PROFESSOR MITOMI DIES

594
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,320
HE WAS A MONSTER

595
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,223
"A monster professor who
just wanted to cut people open."

596
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,392
That's horrible.

597
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,697
Mitomi is an uncommon last name,
so I should've noticed.

598
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,534
The one who stood up
against popular opinion

599
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,469
and took Mitomi's side was

600
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,805
Attorney Haie,

601
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,873
who was practicing law at the time.

602
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,948
THREE YEARS AGO

603
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:09,387
THE MONSTER PROFESSOR'S WIFE

604
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,755
Excuse me.

605
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,326
Are you Attorney Haie?

606
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,162
I just finished reading it.

607
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,698
Have a seat.

608
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,067
Nobody…

609
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,004
believes us.

610
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,943
If I can't get you to accept this case…

611
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,047
I have nothing…

612
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,684
It seems like

613
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,453
the struggle for power
within the medical school

614
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,790
has led to some truths being distorted.

615
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,695
But I've been turned down
by many lawyers already.

616
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,732
At my father's level,

617
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,368
there's no way he would make
such mistakes.

618
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,973
Any doctor should be able to see that.

619
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,209
It's as if…

620
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,382
they want to say,
"Dead men tell no tales."

621
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,221
It's so frustrating.

622
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,360
Even my mother…

623
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,331
is starting to doubt my father.

624
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,905
Dead men tell no tales…

625
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,612
There's no doubt that
medical lawsuits are difficult.

626
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,415
But…

627
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,587
"dead men tell no tales"

628
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,056
is a phrase I detest.

629
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,527
Ms. Mitomi,

630
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,697
let's work together to settle the score

631
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,099
for your father.

632
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,305
Thank you very much.

633
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,143
<i>It's been three years since then, huh?</i>

634
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,213
It's time for me to move forward.

635
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,153
KYOTO MEDICAL AND DENTAL UNIVERSITY

636
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,924
Sup, Professor Hasegawa.

637
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,798
I thought you were in Tokyo now.

638
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:34,832
I am.

639
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,368
I'm saving up money to return to school.

640
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,471
Actually, I've saved up enough,
so I want to return soon.

641
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,374
I'll support you.

642
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,144
But…

643
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:50,248
it hasn't been very long
since your father passed away.

644
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:58,689
The accusations against my father
were proved to be false,

645
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,527
but they're still refusing to accept
his daughter, huh?

646
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,996
In Japan,

647
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,033
people are very prejudiced
against false charges.

648
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,102
Even if the court says you're innocent,

649
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:15,573
there will always be insensitive people
who will say, "Is it really true?"

650
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,343
I have

651
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:21,879
noticed that.

652
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:25,616
Our students here tend to be
free and independent,

653
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,152
so you probably won't
encounter prejudice on campus.

654
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,654
What will be tricky

655
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,691
are the patients who will spread rumors
and have prejudices.

656
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,094
It will only hurt you,

657
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:41,699
so why don't you think about it
a little more?

658
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,904
Okay. I'll do that.

659
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,408
The job I'm doing right now
is actually pretty fun.

660
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,077
It's just that becoming a doctor
has always been my dream.

661
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,468
Reiko?

662
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:24,709
Reiko.

663
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,078
Mom.

664
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,553
By the way,

665
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,857
I heard that punk named Haie

666
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,928
has an assistant named Mitomi.

667
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,599
You know?

668
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:51,369
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
JIDORI KENGO

669
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,971
The case involving Professor Mitomi

670
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,107
from Kyoto Medical and Dental University

671
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,678
was Attorney Haie's
last court case, after all.

672
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:05,416
Is that right?

673
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:10,921
I heard he is currently
making a ruckus in Kyoto.

674
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,093
Taking on such meaningless jobs.

675
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:19,530
Fukushi,

676
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,502
if you notice anything different
about him,

677
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,972
you must tell me no matter what.

678
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:30,374
Yes.

679
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,279
I'll make sure to teach him
what will happen…

680
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,418
if he does anything unnecessary.

681
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,198
I want to thank all of you

682
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,133
for choosing me.

683
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,307
We can't use

684
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,576
the name Houou anymore,

685
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:10,448
but I believe it was the late owner's wish

686
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:14,118
for us to take on a new name
and surpass Houou.

687
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,789
Yashin, or ambition,

688
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,193
was his favorite word.

689
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:27,565
If you are a craftsman,
you must have ambition.

690
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,633
Regardless of whether it's my name or not,

691
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,836
I want to succeed that spirit of his.

692
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,305
So I want our new name to be…

693
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:40,244
YASHIN

694
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,746
Yashin.

695
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:44,882
What do you think?

696
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,101
CLOSED ON TUESDAYS AND WEDNESDAYS

697
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,336
Um…

698
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,608
Is it true that you will allow us to use

699
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:11,642
the name Houou?

700
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,778
Yes, but under

701
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,613
one condition.

702
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,616
Can we have the designer
who designed Houou

703
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,818
come in to renovate this place?

704
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:25,322
But that would cost quite a lot and--

705
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,358
I'm sorry,

706
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,060
but this store is lacking

707
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,763
Houou's personality,
in other words, brand management.

708
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,800
We can wait for our payment

709
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,335
until you recoup the renovation fees.

710
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,872
Make sure you use the same designer.

711
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,775
Thank you very much!

712
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:45,676
Well then.

713
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,781
Isn't that going a little too far…

714
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,517
No problem. Trust me.

715
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,286
The most important thing right now

716
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,389
is to make each store succeed,
no matter what.

717
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,457
Am I wrong?

718
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,460
Okay, to the next one.

719
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,028
Yes.

720
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,366
I think

721
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,136
it's about time for Reiko's update.

722
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:16,340
People in Kyoto treat 100 years
like it's just a decade.

723
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,677
Customers of long-standing stores
are supporting their history.

724
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,412
In conclusion,

725
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,583
those who can distinguish what is real
will support Yashin.

726
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,651
I agree with you.

727
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,524
Hello, Reiko. We've been waiting.

728
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,026
The gossipy people in Kyoto are saying

729
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,728
that he just gave the brand

730
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,231
to the lazy son so that he could have

731
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:43,033
his mistress' son, Yashin,
succeed the store.

732
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,036
By the way, what will happen
to Ms. Miyabi and Mr. Yohei?

733
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:51,742
Well, counterfeiting private documents is
as heinous as fraud, but there is no fine.

734
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:55,145
This time,
they might just dismiss charges.

735
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,616
So, how are the two sons doing?

736
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,018
The price is still the same.

737
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:04,388
That's pretty bold for being
a no-name brand.

738
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:07,458
The Yashin confectionery

739
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:11,228
is getting just a tad fewer customers
compared to the Houou days.

740
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,129
Excuse me?

741
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,300
Come on everyone, let's support him…

742
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:19,703
I'll go check out
Mr. Masaomi's place next.

743
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,338
Mr. Masaomi opened

744
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:26,243
an affordable and readily accessible
confectionery store called Houou Bekkan.

745
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:31,916
And as you can see, it's going crazy.

746
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,784
Here you go.

747
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,720
<i>They're selling at abnormal speed</i>
<i>with all the tourists coming in.</i>

748
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:37,955
Just one.

749
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,658
Please try one, everyone.

750
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,159
It's affordable,

751
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,328
but it's the same Houou flavor.

752
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,732
What the heck…

753
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,803
The employees didn't seem
enthusiastic at first,

754
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,873
but after seeing Mr. Masaomi
proactively serving customers,

755
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,974
they're warming up to him.

756
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,742
Not bad for a good-for-nothing rich boy.

757
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,477
Interesting.

758
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:03,747
They do say that someone's value
can change in just one day.

759
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:07,184
As they say, "If you haven't seen a boy
in three days, prepare to be in awe."

760
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,886
First of all, who was the first one

761
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,088
to call him a good-for-nothing rich boy?

762
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,656
Huh?

763
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,626
Whoa… Mr. Haie.

764
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,094
Look at this.

765
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,565
It's Houou's website.

766
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,067
HOUOU BEKKAN

767
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,069
"As we mentioned in the letter

768
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,605
that was sent out
to all of our customers…"

769
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:30,674
So they're even sending direct mail, huh?

770
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,610
There is a lot of animosity.

771
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:35,346
<i>I guess Mrs. Miyabi is on the attack.</i>

772
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,317
I expected the opposite to happen.

773
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,288
Does this mean you can't survive
with skills alone?

774
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,559
Even in Kyoto, where people are
thinking 100 years into the future?

775
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,162
By the way, Tomonaga,

776
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,166
do you know
the previous owner's background?

777
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:59,436
All I know is that he started training
after he graduated college.

778
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,372
They say he had a late start.

779
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,941
It's not on his Wikipedia page,

780
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:06,243
but according to my own research,

781
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,879
he majored in psychology
at Kyoto University.

782
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:10,714
Are you serious?

783
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,684
He refined his expertise in psychology

784
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,720
in that melting pot of deception
called Kyoto.

785
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:20,457
<i>The brand and workshop.</i>
<i>The name and substance.</i>

786
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,127
<i>Houou's confectionery</i>
<i>and tradition must be</i>

787
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,230
<i>protected no matter what happens.</i>

788
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,743
It's like Laplace's demon.

789
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,881
Maybe Mr. Koichi

790
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:47,785
could see the future.

791
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,255
‪I hope you go out of business!‬

792
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:52,489
‪-What did you say?‬
‪-You're one to talk!‬

793
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:54,892
<i>&lrm;-He took drastic measures.</i>
‪-Please save my mother's life.‬

794
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:55,826
