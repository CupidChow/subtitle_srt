-Sensei!
-Ouch!

6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,282
Can you work, please?

7
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,951
I would if I had work to do.

8
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:22,489
<i>This episode's case involves a university</i>

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,598
I'm going to die!

14
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,133
Don't die, Hyena.

15
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:42,876
Here.

16
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,978
I made your personalized coffee blend,

17
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,446
just the way you like it.

18
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,418
It smells amazing, like always.

19
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:54,521
I'll have another cup of this blend
and take my time--

20
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,991
I finally found you, Hyena.

21
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:01,761
Master,

22
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,797
never mind.

23
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,469
I have my eyes on a scoop right now,

24
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,472
and I have a feeling I will need to get

25
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,841
information from you too, down the line.

26
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,877
My journalist instincts are telling me.

27
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,412
Move.

28
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,881
There's nothing I can do about that,

29
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,917
so I thought I'd say hi while I can.

30
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,019
Aren't you ashamed of yourself
for taking advantage

31
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,720
of other people's misfortunes?

32
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,159
All I'm doing is trying to reform society

33
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:36,029
in the public interest.

34
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,867
What a lie.

00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,938
<i>You make up crimes and write about them</i>
<i>as if they're true.</i>

37
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,707
And you put family and friends

38
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,975
"Journalism," my ass.

39
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,616
The day

40
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,686

41
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,889

44
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,406
Throw salt at me. Salt.

45
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,208
Huh?

46
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,013
I just have a bad feeling.

47
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,418
I'm so sorry!

48
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,356
Well, if it isn't Professor Ogikubo.
Long time no see.

49
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,290
PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
TOKYO FACULTY OF LAW OGIKUBO SHINICHIRO

50
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,491
I thought it'd be nice

51
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,127
to have some wine with you.

52
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,696
I'm sorry. Sorry.

53
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:44,998
-Please, come in.
-It's okay.

54
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,432
-I'm so sorry!
-Don't worry.

55
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,140
The scent of forest soil after the rain.

56
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,777
It's robust,
yet at the same time ethereal,

57
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,346
as if an angel's wings are stirring up
my taste buds.

58
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,215
No wonder this is considered

59
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,617
one of the treasures of Bordeaux.

60
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,086
-Stirring up your what?
-I said it's really good!

61
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,956
Professor Ogikubo teaches at
the University of Tokyo's Faculty of Law.

62
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,059
He's treated my ex-girlfriend and I
to wine a few times,

63
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,094
and so we meet up once in a while…

64
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,629
That being said,

65
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,731
why bring such expensive wine
out of the blue?

66
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,233
What's this about?

67
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,605
-Sorry, but can you turn on the TV please?
-Okay.

68
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,041
<i>Professor Emeritus Hareru Yabuuchi</i>

69
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,576
<i>from the University of Tokyo</i>

70
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,212
<i>was an authority</i>
<i>in child and adolescent education</i>

71
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,080
<i>who was awarded</i>
<i>the Medal with Purple Ribbon,</i>

72
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,749
<i>and also served as</i>
<i>a commentator on this show.</i>

73
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,818
<i>He passed away two months ago,</i>

74
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,487
<i>but to our surprise, he is reported</i>
<i>to have seven illegitimate children.</i>

75
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,624
<i>The fact that he caused</i>
<i>this sort of scandal</i>

76
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,192
<i>while holding the position</i>

77
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,095
<i>of Minister of State for Gender Equality</i>

78
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,597
<i>makes me feel ashamed</i>

79
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,265
<i>for being a fellow man.</i>

80
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,634
<i>Those were his own words,</i>

81
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,270
<i>but they came back to bite him.</i>

82
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,506
<i>According to</i> Josei Eight's <i>advance article</i>
<i>regarding these allegations,</i>

83
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,242
<i>they performed DNA tests</i>

84
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,210
<i>which proved that</i>
<i>Professor Emeritus Yabuuchi</i>

85
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,713
<i>is the biological father</i>
<i>of these seven children.</i>

86
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,415
<i>However, his wife, Mrs. Sagami Yabuuchi,</i>

87
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,883
<i>is saying that it is false,</i>

88
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,620
<i>and they are making up stories</i>
<i>to inherit his assets.</i>

89
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,189
<i>What are the legal aspects of this,</i>
<i>Attorney Fukushi?</i>

90
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,392
ATTORNEY HARUKA FUKUSHI

91
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,563
I understand Mrs. Sagami's feelings,

92
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,066
but the Civil Code allows you to establish
posthumous paternity.

93
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,637
A posthumous paternity action
is a procedure in which

94
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,071
illegitimate children

95
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,840
can legally establish

96
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,009
parentage after the father's death.

97
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,045
By proving to the court
their biological connection

98
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,813
through things like DNA tests,

99
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,915
they can become his legal children.

100
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,052
As a result,
they receive the right of inheritance.

101
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:50,089
It has a retroactive effect that goes back
to the time of the child's birth,

102
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,658
so the child has right of inheritance

103
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,826
even if the father didn't claim paternity.

104
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,596
<i>In that case,</i>
<i>do the children in and out of wedlock</i>

105
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,797
inherit different shares?

106
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,767
In terms of inheritance,
there is no difference between

107
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,669
children in wedlock and out of wedlock.

108
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:03,936
That's surprisingly fair.

109
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:04,837
<i>Yes.</i>

110
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,108
<i>In Professor Yabuuchi's case,</i>
<i>he has no children,</i>

111
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,710
<i>so the inheritance process will be…</i>

112
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:14,247
<i>His wife, Mrs. Sagami, will receive half.</i>

113
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:19,018
<i>The rest will be divided equally</i>
<i>between the seven illegitimate children.</i>

114
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:23,389
<i>In other words, they each will inherit</i>
<i>1/14 of his total assets.</i>

115
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,592
So basically,
if posthumous paternity is established,

116
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,828
his illegitimate children
can inherit his assets.

117
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,396
This time there are seven of them,

118
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,232
so 1/14 of 500 million yen is…

119
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,903
They each get 35 million yen.
That's what this is about?

120
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,106
This issue involves
quite a lot of money, doesn't it?

121
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,208
That's enough.

122
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,643
So?

123
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,512
The thing is, I have a favor to ask.

124
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,217
As you know, Yabuuchi is my coworker.

125
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,286
Our families have been close

126
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,487
for a long time.

127
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:59,025
I know him much better
than those media people.

128
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,929
He is the last person who would have
an illegitimate child.

129
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,131
Let alone seven of them.

130
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,500
It's complete nonsense.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,769
But what I'm worried about

132
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,472
is his wife.

133
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,341
Mrs. Yabuuchi, may we speak with you?

134
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,577
We just want a word with you.

135
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,979
Mrs. Yabuuchi!

136
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,180
Are you there?

137
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,519
<i>The press are surrounding her house,</i>

138
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,789
<i>and nobody is able to</i>
<i>get in touch with her now.</i>

139
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,258
<i>At this rate…</i>

140
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,693
HARERU YABUUCHI'S WIFE
SAGAMI YABUUCHI

141
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,561
She might even…

142
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,832
take her own life…

143
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,235
I understand…

144
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,637
The thing is,

145
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,206
when I visited Yabuuchi in the hospital,

146
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,409
he had told me,

147
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,411
"If anything happens,

148
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,679
please take care of my wife."

149
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,182
Haie,

150
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,018
I want you to save his wife.

151
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,087
And I want you to dispel

152
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,323
these ridiculous allegations
for the sake of Yabuuchi's honor.

153
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,259
But…

154
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,829
If a major magazine company posted

155
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,965
an advance article about it
before printing the actual magazine,

156
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,601
they must have pretty good evidence.

157
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,404
This wine

158
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,240
costs 500,000 yen per bottle.

159
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,209
That's almost 70,000 yen per glass.

160
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,144
I'm not surprised. This is this wine's

161
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,512
best year, after all.

162
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,448
-You knew and didn't tell us?
-It's common knowledge.

163
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,918
I thought you'd turn me down
if I asked you head-on.

164
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,219
I see.

165
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:35,788
Haie,

166
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,025
you are the only one I can rely on.

167
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,228
Please.

168
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:45,932
One thing…

169
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,267
Investigating people can lead to

170
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,869
uncovering unnecessary facts as well.

171
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,537
Do you still want to do it?

172
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,573
Of course.

173
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,809
Everybody has a skeleton or two
in their closet.

174
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,679
Hopefully that's all we find.

175
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,047
It's okay.

176
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,850
Like I said, there is no way
a devoted husband like Yabuuchi

177
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,384
would have illegitimate children.

178
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,587
Let me just make sure.

179
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,522
This investigation request

180
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,791
is coming from you, Professor Ogikubo?

181
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,192
His wife doesn't know about it?

182
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:19,398
It's a major topic of concern
within the legal profession,

183
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,301
but freedom of the press does not give you

184
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,170
an excuse to do whatever you want.

185
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,607
I want to thrust evidence in their faces,
proving that this story

186
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,442
is completely baseless

187
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,279
and put a stop to the press
that's gone out of control.

188
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,381
As a person of law,

189
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,551
I can't back down.

190
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,520
You understand, right?

191
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,240
Okay.

192
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,576
It's a request from a third party,

193
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,778
but I will accept this case.

194
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,381
Let's crack down hard
on worthless journalists!

195
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,882
Hey, be careful with that.

196
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,084
All right, well then…

197
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,354
To Yabuuchi.

198
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,255
May he rest in peace.

199
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:17,690
May he rest in peace.

200
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,875
None of our theories can be true.

201
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:36,876
Don't teach your grandmother to suck eggs!

202
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,678
<i>So now you know</i>

203
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,546
<i>my abilities, right?</i>

204
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:44,083
<i>We might find a clue to solve this case.</i>

205
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,189
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

206
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,291
Both of you pulled an all-nighter?

207
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,226
Considering Professor Yabuuchi's wife,

208
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,195
we should hurry with this case.

209
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,396
Want some coffee, Reiko?

210
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,931
-Thank you.
-Okay.

211
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,066
Here, I'm done.

212
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,934
I'll drop by my main job.

213
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:03,836
Huh?

214
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,172
Is this a list
of the seven illegitimate children?

215
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,008
In one night, you got their
addresses, photos,

216
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,743
and even their cell phone numbers? How?

217
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,179
I won't go into detail,
but storing data in a cloud

218
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,947
that's barely maintained is the same as

219
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,048
hanging all of your

220
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,383
belongings on your front door.

221
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,220
That's why analog is the way to go.

222
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,223
Mr. Haie, you can fall behind the times
as much as you want.

223
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:28,060
So we just have to go down this list
of seven people?

224
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,528
We'll be done in no time.

225
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,764
Unfortunately, it won't be that easy.

226
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,566
Not with this list of people.

227
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,567
What do you mean?

228
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,403
Well, you'll see very soon.

229
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,305
KIHACHI ICHIHASHI

230
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,310
Are you a salesperson? You're cute.

231
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,746
Sup. Thanks for the compliment.

232
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,115
But I'm not a salesperson.

233
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,717
Hello. This explains who we are.

234
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,720
Mr. Ichihashi, we wanted to know if

235
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,023
you're really going to file
a posthumous paternity action

236
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,025
regarding Professor Yabuuchi.

237
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:00,359
What are you saying?

238
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,028
You should know!

239
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,498
I'm talking about
his seven alleged illegitimate children.

240
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,366
Who told you?

241
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,502
They didn't mention my name online.

242
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,939
Let's just say,
it's exactly what you're thinking.

243
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:15,775
Damn it.

244
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,943
That Vulture leaked my information?

245
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,578
Never trust people from Kansai.

246
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,947
Interesting.
The Vulture is connected to this, huh?

247
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,717
Huh? Damn it, you tricked me?

248
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,452
Hey, don't blame me.

249
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,654
By the way, I heard DNA tests

250
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,856
showed that Professor Yabuuchi
was your father.

251
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,992
Just in case, will you let us do

252
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,228
another DNA test on our end?

253
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,564
Also, I'm sure you know,

254
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,100
but to file a posthumous paternity action,

255
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,370
you must go to court,
provide a government-issued ID,

256
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,205
and have your DNA collected
right then and there.

257
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,374
So whatever trick you used

258
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,543
against a layman like Hageta

259
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,545
won't fly in court at all.

260
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,779
Shut up!

261
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,449
You have no right to test me.

262
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,850
That's it. Leave.

263
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,255
He's obviously suspicious.

264
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:07,093
Well, we found out
that it was the Vulture's article.

265
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,694
We can also get…

266
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,263
-Where to?
-The garbage dump.

267
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,236
These people
don't sort their waste at all.

268
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,004
KIHACHI ICHIHASHI
IMPORTANT NOTICE

269
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,107
Found it!

270
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,576
Now let me take this bottle…

271
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:24,477
Watch out!

272
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,218
He pulled a knife on us.

273
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,286
Better take this opportunity…

274
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,358
Sensei, is this case a little dangerous?

275
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,727
I told you it wouldn't be easy, remember?

276
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,696
-Let's hurry.
-Yes.

277
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,169
We're back.

278
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,104
Wow.

279
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,273
Did a storm catch you or what?

280
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,009
I guess you can call it a storm.

281
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,978
Those seven illegitimate children

282
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,813
are a bunch of scoundrels.

283
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,315
Wait, wait!

284
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,617
THE SECOND ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

285
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,252
-Crap!
-Hey!

286
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,520
Behind you! Watch out!

287
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,921
Hey, wait.

288
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,389
THE THIRD ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

289
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,391
RESTAURANT TAISUKE

290
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,726
THE FOURTH ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

291
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,960
How dare you!

292
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,264
Stop! How dare you run!

293
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,498
Huh?

294
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,866
THE SIXTH ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

295
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,835
Hey, come on…

296
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,574
THE SEVENTH ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

297
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,609
-Down you go!
-Sensei!

298
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,845
I'm going to die!

299
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,182
All seven of them refused to do a DNA test

300
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,683
and they all look like bad news,

301
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,119
but Sensei said to not call the police.

302
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,987
Why won't you report them to the police

303
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,522
after what they did?

304
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,858
But I somehow brought back things

305
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,460
that we can collect their DNA from.

306
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,266
Can you do a DNA test
with things like that?

307
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,901
We'll have to try.

308
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,204
I'll go test these.

309
00:13:59,004 --> 00:13:59,872
Ouch!

310
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,841
-Stay still!
-It hurts.

311
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,176
I looked up the owners of their houses,

312
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,144
like you asked.

313
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,013
They were all renting,
so this is info about their landlords.

314
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,482
And these are the bank accounts
for all seven of them.

315
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,951
Ouch!

316
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,887
-Thanks.
-Bye.

317
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,022
How did he get these?

318
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:19,725
Huh?

319
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,826
What?

320
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,596
They all have a period of time when they

321
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,631
didn't pay a water or electricity bill.

322
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,233
More like,

323
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,969
their bank accounts have several years
of no activity.

324
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,340
Sensei,

325
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,675
their landlords
are all volunteer probation officers.

326
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,410
Is this a coincidence?

327
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,146
I see. Which means… Ouch!

328
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,183
Volunteer probation officers
help people who've committed crimes

329
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,851
get their lives back together.

330
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,387
Which means…

331
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,458
all seven of them may have been in prison?

332
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,394
-Bingo.
-Nobody says "bingo" anymore.

333
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,865
The DNA tests aren't done yet,

334
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,301
but I guess we completed
our initial mission.

335
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,802
Initial mission?

336
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,705
Debunking the article that accused him

337
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,340
of having illegitimate children.

338
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,278
-You're all set.
-Ouch!

339
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,312
JOSEI EIGHT

340
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,681
Allegedly having
seven illegitimate children…

341
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,383
<i>JOSEI EIGHT</i> EDITOR IN CHIEF
MICHI SUENAGA

342
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,918
This will hit it big!

343
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,956
So now you know my abilities, right?

344
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,860
Editor in chief, this is bad!

345
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,329
The seven children
want us to take down the article.

346
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,897
They're really angry!

347
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:32,932
-What?
-We need you.

348
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,569
Seeing how flustered they were today,

349
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,138
the seven illegitimate children

350
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:42,341
most likely called the magazine
to take down the article,

351
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,910
not wanting to be arrested yet again.

352
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,246
That's why you didn't call the police

353
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,714
and let them go instead?

354
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,083
-That's right.
-Please stop!

355
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,018
What is going on?

356
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,522
I set aside a spot in our magazine
for this for the next four weeks!

357
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,057
What are you going to do?

358
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,427
They're the ones who tipped me off
about this.

359
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,196
Please tell me you fact-checked.

360
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,399
Of course. The DNA test proves it.

361
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,802
Just do something about this!

362
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:13,372
If we lose this headline,
I'll charge you for compensation!

363
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,841
If all seven of those
scary guys threaten him,

364
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,811
I'm sure even that vulture won't
be able to publish the article.

365
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,114
The real battle starts now.

366
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,450
Huh?

367
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,120
Damn it!

368
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,022
What a bunch of crap.

369
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,330
What is it? I'm not in the mood…

370
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,512
This is why I don't get tired
of doing my job.

371
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,419
Just you wait.

372
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,689
The real battle starts now.

373
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,961
And that is all we have for now.

374
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,061
<i>I see.</i>

375
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:12,664
So you're able to do something
about that advance article?

376
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,733
We can't let our guard down until

377
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,535
they publish a correction, though.

378
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:18,971
That's exactly right.

379
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
<i>By the way,</i>

380
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,040
how is Professor Yabuuchi's wife doing?

381
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,210
<i>I still can't get in touch with her.</i>

382
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,280
She won't reply to
my phone calls or emails.

383
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,548
<i>She's probably</i>

384
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,452
<i>too scared to even touch</i>
<i>her phone and computer.</i>

385
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,521
Mrs. Yabuuchi.

386
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,322
How long are you going to stay cooped up?

387
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,333
The tests are done.

388
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,869
All seven of them have completely
different DNA.

389
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,073
And none of them were biologically related
to Professor Yabuuchi.

390
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,674
Just as we thought.

391
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,011
But how did they
get the fake DNA test results?

392
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,547
The self-proclaimed illegitimate children

393
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,450
all did time in Fuchu Prison
around the same time.

394
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,751
That's their only connection.

395
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,955
Assuming that Hageta fact-checked
by doing a DNA test,

396
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,924
they would need his real DNA.

397
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,525
Let me sort it out.

398
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,994
For someone to be
Professor Yabuuchi's son,

399
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,897
half of their DNA
must be inherited from him.

400
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,567
The other half of their DNA
is from their mother.

401
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,936
Hence, the logical explanation is,

402
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,171
that Professor Yabuuchi has a child--

403
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,140
Professor Yabuuchi has no children.

404
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,909
-Zero.
-Then he has a brother--

405
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,945
-He has no brothers.
-And his son--

406
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,314
-There is no son.
-How do you know?

407
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,915
Because I secretly checked his

408
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,017
family register
using ways I cannot disclose.

409
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,619
I checked all his relatives.

410
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,254
That's terrifying.

411
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,223
Why don't I call my informer to get

412
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,258
information about the prison

413
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,826
during that period of time?

414
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,761
-Informer?
-Like a former guard?

415
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,530
-Then I'll go too.
-No.

416
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,266
They don't want to be seen by anybody.

417
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,579
You have it?

418
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,991
-Kanayama?
-Pay first.

419
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,699
It's a list of prisoners
from that period of time.

420
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,201
All I could get were

421
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,537
their names, birthdates,
and permanent addresses.

422
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,343
-Received.
-I need double.

423
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,545
What?

424
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,880
If you can't pay now,
you can write an I.O.U.

425
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:50,889
Nice doing business.

426
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,360
Don't die, Hyena.

427
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,030
Or else you can't pay back your debt

428
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,932
and I'll lose out on money.

429
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,583
You pulled a fast one on me.

430
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,388
Because a hyena went sniffing around,

431
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,925
all seven of them got scared

432
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,027
and stopped the article.

433
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,397
Thanks to that,

434
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,900
I was completely humiliated.

435
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,470
You just didn't do enough research,
that's all.

436
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,147
You know,

437
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,285
once I set my eyes on a target,

438
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,454
I never miss.

439
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,657
A freelance journalist

440
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,727
is the same as a hitman.

441
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,031
Your article was stopped, wasn't it?

442
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,300
You've already missed your target.

443
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,338
You're so naive.

444
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,410
When an article dies…

445
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,544
Actually,

446
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,814
when an article is killed…

447
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,387
it sells for an even higher price
the second time around.

448
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,300
HAIE INHERITANCE INVESTIGATION OFFICE

449
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,403
Not a single relative or acquaintance
of Professor Yabuuchi

450
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,804
is in the list of prisoners

451
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,040
who did time with the seven of them.

452
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,475
Which means,

453
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,844
none of our theories can be true.

454
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,819
You're there, right?

455
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,899
This would be a lot easier if

456
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,867
the professor had a twin or something.

457
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,437
Identical twins share the same DNA, right?

458
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,507
Then, if you use the DNA
of that twin's child,

459
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,177
it'll be seen as
Professor Yabuuchi's child.

460
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,312
By the way, it can't be the twin's DNA.

461
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,381
It has to be the twin's child.

462
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,117
Because to prove that it's
the professors child, it needs

463
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,085
the mother's DNA.

464
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,654
Like I said,
I already did research and found out

465
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,322
that he doesn't have any brothers!

466
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,990
Don't teach your grandmother to suck eggs!

467
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,828
You're short-tempered
and that's why you're short-winded!

468
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,097
You're completely out of breath.

469
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,933
Why don't you try speaking
from the diaphragm?

470
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,235
Come on! Try it!

471
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,771
-Use your voice!
-Twins?

472
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:54,973
Illegitimate child?

473
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,945
That's right! Twins!

474
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,047
Mr. Haie, are you trying to kill me too?

475
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,683
No, no! It's a "child adopted from straw."

476
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,718
A child adopted from straw?

477
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,653
It derives from the fact that midwives

478
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,655
used to lay down straw during delivery.

479
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,558
Found it. "A child that is entered
into a family register

480
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,594
right after birth, without following

481
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,229
the legal procedure for adoption."

482
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:21,032
Wait, so the parents
submit a false birth certificate?

483
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,068
Supposedly, it used to happen a lot.

484
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,471
On top of that, some regions
believed ridiculous superstitions

485
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,306
that twins were bad luck.

486
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,574
Huh? What the heck?

487
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,576
So some parents would give one of

488
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,879
their twins to someone else,
and that person

489
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,147
would enter that child

490
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,649
into their family register
as their real child.

491
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,317
Maybe

492
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:42,120
that is what happened in this case.

493
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,257
-So the Yabuuchi family had twins?
-Tomonaga.

494
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,259
The prisoner list had
their birthdates, right?

495
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,262
Are there any with the same birthdate
as Professor Yabuuchi?

496
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:56,668
There is one. Shijimi Goda has the same
birthdate and is the same age as him.

497
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,170
What's his criminal record?

498
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,747
A repeat offender of theft.
His photo is from when he was arrested.

499
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,416
Bingo!

500
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,820
His nose, cheekbones, and jaw
are identical to Professor Yabuuchi!

501
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,555
Reiko, I thought nobody says "bingo"?

502
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,589
Young people can say it.

503
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,459
So he planted
the fake illegitimate children?

504
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,462
It seems so.
The Vulture might find out soon too.

505
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,330
I'll search his current address.

506
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,033
No, before that,
check the list of patients at

507
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,901
Tokyo Bokusei University Hospital.

508
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,137
Sure, but why… I actually found him.

509
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,006
Shijimi Goda has been hospitalized here
for a month.

510
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,308
Bingo.

511
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,877
What is going on, Mr. Haie?

512
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,879
I'll explain later. Let's hurry.

513
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,848
Reiko. I'm counting on you.

514
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,649
Yes, sir!

515
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,053
Reiko, slow down!

516
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,456
TOKYO BOKUSEI UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL.

517
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,999
Excuse me.

518
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,536
I guess Vulture isn't here.

519
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,045
You're Mr. Shijimi Goda, right?

520
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,617
That was faster than expected.

521
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,185
SHIJIMI GODA

522
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,420
You found me already.

523
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,258
Arrest me if you want.

524
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,194
I'm already prepared.

525
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:32,397
No, I'm not a police officer.

526
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,599
Here's my business card.

527
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,940
Inheritance detective?

528
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:46,244
That's an actual job?

529
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,213
Yes. My name is Haie.

530
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,153
You found me before the police did.

531
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,189
So I guess you're pretty capable.

532
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,560
I was just lucky, that's all.

533
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,429
Lucky, huh?

534
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,035
Luck was not on my side.

535
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,304
First, I want to confirm one thing.

536
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:17,075
Mr. Goda, you
and the late Professor Hareru Yabuuchi

537
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,177
were identical twins, right?

538
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,614
However,

539
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,383
you were a child adopted from straw

540
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,185
and taken in by the Goda family.

541
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,220
You grew up as a total stranger

542
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,323
and never interacted
with the Yabuuchi family.

543
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,192
‪Yeah.‬

544
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,096
I'm surprised you're so honest.

545
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,965
What's the point in denying it?

546
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,701
My face gives it away.

547
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:44,669
But then again…

548
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,407
Not a single person has ever realized

549
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,576
that we were twins.

550
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,580
Isn't it ironic?

551
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,884
Even if you have the same DNA,

552
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,855
if you're raised
in completely opposite environments,

553
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,858
nobody sees any connection.

554
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,264
Want me to tell you how unlucky I am?

555
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,467
There are people
suffering because of you--

556
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,136
Please

557
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,438
tell us.

558
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,246
Now that I'm about to die,

559
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,017
maybe luck has finally come around to me.

560
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,490
First,

561
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:43,328
right after I was born, I was taken in
by the Goda family.

562
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,398
But they were dirt poor.

563
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,703
They only agreed to accept a baby

564
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,674
to receive a small amount of money.

565
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,710
On top of that,

566
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,213
even though
they weren't able to get pregnant

567
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,548
for a long time,

568
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,085
the moment they adopted me,
they had four babies

569
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,754
one after another.

570
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:15,026
By the fourth one,
my dad finally became suspicious

571
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,628
and looked into it.

572
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,497
It turns out

573
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,600
my dad had no sperm.

574
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,868
‪What?‬

575
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,103
Sure enough,

576
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,505
my mother was having an affair.

577
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,209
She gave birth to and was raising
four children

578
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,577
she had with another man.

579
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,114
Like a brood parasite?

580
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,619
My father

581
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,957
couldn't forgive my mother
and started beating her.

582
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,095
He would drink alcohol and make a ruckus.

583
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,598
My mother went off the deep end

584
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,602
and started beating just me,
for some reason.

585
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:04,075
I was told that I was an adopted child

586
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,111
<i>when I was ten years old.</i>

587
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,981
Adopted kids like you don't need to study.

588
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,149
You need to work!

589
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,419
-Adopted?
-That's right.

590
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,455
You're just half of a twin
who was thrown out

591
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,491
because you bring bad luck!

592
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,193
<i>Ever since then,</i>

593
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,329
life was a living hell.

594
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,600
So when I graduated middle school,

595
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,402
I got a job right away.

596
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,173
I was poor, but I was able to get married

597
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,909
and was even blessed with a child.

598
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,915
Right when I felt like I finally
found happiness…

599
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:47,786
This time,

600
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,455
my wife died.

601
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,592
Then one day,

602
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,062
I was watching TV

603
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,365
<i>and I saw my other self</i>

604
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,434
<i>on the screen,</i>
<i>trying to act all intelligent.</i>

605
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,672
<i>I couldn't believe my eyes.</i>

606
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,607
<i>He was</i>

607
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:12,577
<i>raised in our family home</i>
<i>without any worries,</i>

608
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,614
<i>went to the University of Tokyo,</i>
<i>and was recognized by society.</i>

609
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,783
<i>He looked exactly like me,</i>

610
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,152
<i>but he was receiving everyone's praise.</i>

611
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,656
We have the same DNA,

612
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,993
but just because I wasn't chosen
by the Yabuuchi family,

613
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,796
our lives ended up this different.

614
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,802
I understand how you feel.

615
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,238
However,

616
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,140
you lost your moral compass.

617
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,109
You were arrested for theft many times.

618
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:56,921
I…

619
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,258
resented my upbringing.

620
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,529
Why am I the only one
who has to go through this?

621
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,501
That's why

622
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,605
I kept resenting and kept cursing

623
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,140
that self-important man, Yabuuchi.

624
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,777
That's the only thing
that has kept me sane.

625
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,981
Otherwise,
I would've done more than theft!

626
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,153
When I heard that Yabuuchi died,

627
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,558
I knew that it was my chance.

628
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:35,693
So,

629
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,529
I told my young friends from prison

630
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,634
that if they use my son's DNA,

631
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,604
they can inherit a huge amount of money.

632
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,841
At the same time,

633
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,509
<i>I paid a good amount of money</i>

634
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,778
<i>to find a journalist named Hageta.</i>

635
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,317
But Hageta must have asked for proof
during the interview.

636
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,085
You knew he would,

637
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,654
so you gave all seven of them

638
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,390
your son's DNA, am I right?

639
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:07,859
Bingo.

640
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,695
-Oh, is that outdated?
-Yes.

641
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,465
Bingo.

642
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,304
I… I see.

643
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:21,973
Why did you

644
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,109
start this in the first place?

645
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,782
Why did you start this in the first place?

646
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,354
The thing is,

647
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,223
something has been bothering me
this whole time.

648
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:44,629
To file a posthumous paternity action,
you must go to court,

649
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,899
confirm your identity,
and have them collect your DNA.

650
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,836
In other words,
the system can't be tricked.

651
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,072
So even if you lie in the tabloids

652
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,074
and stir up the public,

653
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,910
the truth will come out sooner or later.

654
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,946
So I wondered why you chose this method

655
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,149
to make a fuss about
his illegitimate children, when it's not

656
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,050
worth it.

657
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,152
But…

658
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,723
now that I've met you, I understand.

659
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,260
What you're really after

660
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,529
is not Mr. Yabuuchi's inheritance.

661
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,732
You just wanted to use

662
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,401
this scandal to tarnish
Professor Yabuuchi's reputation.

663
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,004
That was your only objective, right?

664
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:34,846
However, even then,
the profit doesn't outweigh the loss.

665
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,982
Normally, people wouldn't

666
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,985
do things that will get them in prison

667
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,954
just to defame somebody.

668
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:43,921
That's true.

669
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,657
That's how you figured out

670
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,028
that I was at this hospital?

671
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,363
Yes.

672
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:56,634
Professor Yabuuchi died
at this university hospital.

673
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,804
Why not the University of Tokyo Hospital,
if he was a professor there?

674
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,973
I was curious, so I looked into that.

675
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,376
And I found something
that only this hospital has.

676
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,045
A doctor who specializes in
Patricia's disease,

677
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,748
a disease that affects
one in a million people.

678
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,018
The cause is still unknown,

679
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,521
but it only appears in certain bloodlines,

680
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,090
so it's thought to be a heredity disease.

681
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:22,126
Professor Yabuuchi died because of it.

682
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,728
That's when I finally realized

683
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,864
that if the culprit has inherited the same

684
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,666
genetic factors as Professor Yabuuchi,

685
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,036
that person may be suffering from
Patricia's disease as well.

686
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,507
So in other words, I mean no disrespect,

687
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,775
but you are on the brink of death

688
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:41,344
and in a state of invincibility.

689
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,380
Sensei.

690
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,362
The same sickness,

691
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,265
the same hospital,

692
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,002
but he gets a VIP room

693
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,773
and I'm in a shared room, as you can see.

694
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,642
Even when I'm about to die,

695
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,678
I'm still out of luck.

696
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,818
But with this scandal,

697
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,088
his reputation has hit rock bottom.

698
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,992
Because he's more famous than me,

699
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,794
he suffered a bigger blow.

700
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,866
I can drop dead at any time,

701
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,768
but at the last minute,

702
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:42,173
I was finally able to find my happiness.

703
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,908
Take that!

704
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,616
Are you okay?

705
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:55,920
Mr. Goda.

706
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,323
I've recorded our entire conversation.

707
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,726
With this, I will make <i>Josei Eight</i>

708
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,128
publish a correction article.

709
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,496
Because

710
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,299
Professor Yabuuchi's wife
has done nothing wrong.

711
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,806
Now there is no evidence.

712
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,875
You are…

713
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,412
You must be Mr. Mekabu, Mr. Goda's son.

714
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:22,947
SHIJIMI GODA'S SON
MEKABU GODA

715
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,249
Sorry, but that was just a pen.

716
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,150
What?

717
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,685
Did you think I would show

718
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,854
my real recorder when his accomplice
might be around?

719
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,522
Damn…

720
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:39,964
-I can't breathe!
-Okay!

721
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,399
Okay! I'll let it go!

722
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,935
Just tell me one thing.

723
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,337
Why did you help
your father commit a crime?

724
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,974
Please, I just want to know why.

725
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,925
Because I couldn't forgive him.

726
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,262
You've met Professor Yabuuchi before?

727
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,565
When I was still a kid.

728
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,069
Dad just wanted

729
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,272
to talk to him at least once

730
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,242
as his brother.

731
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,645
He tried to be fancy

732
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,115
<i>and even bought a gift.</i>

733
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,085
<i>But… that man…</i>

734
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,421
You do look a lot like me.

735
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,996
This is my son, Mekabu.

736
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,711
Why did you come to see me?

737
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,484
Is it for money?

738
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,587
Why would you say that?

739
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,591
I know you're just after my money.

740
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,662
-Here.
-That's not why.

741
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,467
Never show up in front of me again!

742
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,780
That's the kind of man he was?

743
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,284
Dad

744
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,821
barely ate anything

745
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,590
and worked day-labor jobs every day

746
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:48,759
and told me

747
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,696
to eat until I was full.

748
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,799
He only stole

749
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,801
because he was scammed

750
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:59,003
and we had no other choice!

751
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,276
Yabuuchi didn't know anything.

752
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,649
I'll never forget.

753
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:18,856
Hey, detective.

754
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,759
You got one thing wrong.

755
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,496
Dad isn't the one who
planned this entire thing.

756
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:26,964
It was me!

757
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,935
I've always wanted to

758
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,905
show the world Yabuuchi's true colors!

759
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,709
-So you did all of this?
-That's right.

760
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,181
I see.

761
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,751
I understand

762
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:51,088
that you've suffered
many hardships unfairly.

763
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,394
If your father stayed
with the Yabuuchi family,

764
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,629
he may have gone
to the University of Tokyo

765
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,265
and become a professor as well.

766
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,235
That's right.

767
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,239
Don't you agree?

768
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,440
But

769
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,176
you shouldn't lie.

770
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,046
He's right.

771
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,750
You shouldn't lie.

772
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,555
I am the one who planned everything.

773
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:27,691
But

774
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,763
I regret one thing, and that is that
I made you help me.

775
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,231
I'm sorry.

776
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,936
Dad, what are you saying?

777
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,711
Let me ask you.

778
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,782
What were we supposed to do then?

779
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,223
This is what most people say…

780
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,626
"It's not that luck wasn't on your side."

781
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,496
"It's true that what happened
after your birth

782
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,965
and how you were raised were not ideal."

783
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,869
"But even then, you are responsible for

784
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:16,941
forging your own path in life."

785
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,477
Are you serious?

786
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,647
Haie, was it?

787
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:28,786
Yes.

788
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,588
That is

789
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:36,360
the kind of nonsense that
hypocritical law people like to say.

790
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:41,565
To be a victim of such unjust abuse

791
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,803
and still have hope in this world…

792
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,839
you'd have to be absurdly strong.

793
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,242
Otherwise,

794
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,678
it's just a bunch of crap

795
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:58,682
that happy people
who don't know true misfortune say.

796
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,020
True…

797
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,322
You might be right.

798
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,694
There are barely any people of law
in this country who are

799
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,063
truly from disadvantaged backgrounds.

800
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,235
You said

801
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:22,606
that you were going to make the magazine
publish a correction article.

802
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,409
Yes.

803
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,944
That's the request we got.

804
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,716
What's wrong?

805
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:34,919
Nothing…

806
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,023
It's true that

807
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,427
I am clearly a guilty criminal.

808
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:45,863
But

809
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,567
are there any people in this world

810
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,536
who are not guilty of anything?

811
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:53,971
Huh?

812
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,841
You know, once I set my eyes on a target,

813
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,244
I never miss.

814
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,648
Did Hageta tell you anything?

815
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,618
Aren't you a detective?

816
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,556
Go ahead and investigate it yourself.

817
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,734
I'm so happy.

818
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,438
After all,

819
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,442
I have Mekabu, the best son in the world.

820
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,014
That's the only thing I beat him at.

821
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,886
I'm so glad I was born!

822
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,592
You're proof that I was alive!

823
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,867
My do-over is just getting started.

824
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,736
Just you wait,

825
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,371
Hyena.

826
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,573
