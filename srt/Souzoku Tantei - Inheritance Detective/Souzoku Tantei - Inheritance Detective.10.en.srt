<i>The unforgivable man who blamed</i>

<i>falling asleep at the wheel</i>
<i>and causing the bus accident</i>

<i>Despite being a Supreme Court justice</i>

<i>he is guilty of corruption</i>

9
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:27,894
<i>and is trying to climb the ladder</i>

10
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,196
<i>My fight against this large enemy</i>

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,900
<i>was dragging my friends into harm's way.</i>

12
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:34,901
WILL

13
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:35,902
KAORU HAGETA

14
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,242
<i>I am about to take a gamble.</i>

15
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,880
<i>Just in case something happens,</i>
<i>I entrust the following to Hyena.</i>

16
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:50,417
<i>First, analyze the video footage</i>
<i>that I've left behind</i>

17
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:53,420
<i>and make the culprit's face known.</i>

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,290
<i>Second, publicize that under my name.</i>

19
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,126
<i>In this generation,</i>
<i>where the media no longer</i>

20
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,228
<i>monitors authorities</i>
<i>like they're supposed to,</i>

21
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,864
<i>I want you to blast this scoop</i>
<i>like huge fireworks.</i>

22
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,301
<i>Of course, this is only if I die.</i>

23
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,504
<i>If I'm alive,</i>
<i>you'll have to help me, okay?</i>

24
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,008
Where are you and what are you doing?

25
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,179
If you die on your own,

26
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,314
I'll never forgive you.

27
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,399
<i>Thanks to your article,</i>
<i>we're gaining momentum.</i>

28
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,633
Find him!

29
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,168
Just one single lie

30
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,437
<i>can easily break someone.</i>

31
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,974
Going up against Justice Jidori
is too reckless.

32
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,616
I know. I'm just going to
look into Mr. Susuda.

33
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,562
What happened?

34
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,600
I'll explain later.
I'll plan three more mixers for you, so--

35
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,268
-Okay!
-Please get me a hideout

36
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,469
that nobody will find.

37
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,344
NO CALLER ID

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,816
<i>Hey, it's Kanayama.</i>

39
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,752
I found the whereabouts of the vulture

40
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,786
you're looking for.

41
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,859
We'd like to hear his side of the story.

42
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:44,164
He isn't responding at all
even when we call out to him.

43
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,965
So he's unconscious?

44
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,467
Yes.

45
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,777
You idiot.

46
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,782
Why did you do this on your own?

47
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,589
You fool…

48
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,965
If we make them think
that I'm unconscious,

49
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,268
our enemy will let their guard down.

50
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,905
Vulture, you're…

51
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,141
My laptop

52
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,344
is inside that bag.

53
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,946
Also…

54
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,050
"An egg dish I want to eat

55
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,686
on my day off."

56
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,088
I…

57
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,924
won the bet.

58
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,795
I am unconscious.

59
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,798
Got it?

60
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:23,096
I owe you one, old man.

61
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,397
Listen, Hyena.

62
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,037
You can risk your life,
but don't waste it.

63
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,477
WILL

64
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,646
Mr. Hage left this will, huh?

65
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:44,183
The only clues we have
are this broken laptop and the quote:

66
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,052
"An egg dish I want to eat on my day off."

67
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,920
This is blood.

68
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,789
Why is it here?

69
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,303
The SSD is still working.

70
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:07,307
Vulture let the culprit attack him
on purpose

71
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,310
and caught it on camera.

72
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:11,911
On purpose?

73
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,814
He risked his life.

74
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,955
<i>This might be enough to turn the tables.</i>

75
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,095
If former Prime Minister Asaba's grandson,

76
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,564
Daiya, is caught on camera,

77
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,299
this can turn the tables

78
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,068
just like Vulture said.

79
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,170
If you thought wearing a ski mask

80
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,539
at night would make you unidentifiable,
you're wrong.

81
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,541
The genius Tomonaga

82
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,843
can analyze your eyeball

83
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,346
and make your iris clearer

84
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,648
to do iris recognition.

85
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,049
‪START‬
‪MATCH: RECOGNIZE TWO IRISES AS IDENTICAL‬

86
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,284
All right.

87
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,053
In conclusion,

88
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,556
this is former Prime Minister Asaba's
idiot grandson,

89
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,890
Daiya Asaba.

90
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,897
There's an "eggs Benedict"

91
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,100
in our cloud.

92
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,169
This must be the "egg dish
I want to eat on my day off."

93
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,071
I see.

94
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,107
Mr. Hage must've uploaded it
onto our cloud,

95
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,008
just in case his laptop didn't work.

96
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:20,380
The contents seem to be photos
related to that drug party.

97
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,782
<i>Mr. Hage's scoop about the secret meeting</i>

98
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,485
<i>between Asaba, Jidori,</i>
<i>and people from the media</i>

99
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,388
<i>was held in order to cover up this case.</i>

100
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,490
Vulture

101
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,893
purposely let the enemy know about this,

102
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,661
lured them out,

103
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,130
and let them attack him.

104
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,833
He really risked his life
for this huge scoop.

105
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,704
As expected of Mr. Vulture.

106
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,506
I will call him Hage Sensei from now on.

107
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,307
Why are you here?

108
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,143
Go back to Fukushi's office now.

109
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,178
I resigned. I won't go back anymore.

110
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,780
Whatever, just get out!

111
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,518
I convinced Mr. Susuda.

112
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,455
He promised me that he will

113
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,457
testify the truth.

114
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,727
You can sue the state
if you have his testimony, right?

115
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,562
Please let me

116
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,631
help you in that battle.

117
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,475
What are you doing?

118
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,479
Either way,

119
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,748
this has nothing to do with you.

120
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,590
Don't get involved ever again.
You're getting in my way.

121
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,742
Tomonaga, where is Susuda now?

122
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,178
He's waiting in my hobby room.

123
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,047
-Can I talk to him?
-Anytime.

124
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,415
All right.

125
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,485
First, I want you to
analyze Vulture's video.

126
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,358
<i>This is when they abandoned the woman</i>
<i>and ran away.</i>

127
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:17,363
He looked at the security camera once,
so I was able to use iris recognition.

128
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,501
In conclusion, on the night
of the drug party in question,

129
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,504
Daiya Asaba was undoubtedly

130
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,105
at the scene.

131
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,474
<i>He tried to eliminate evidence</i>

132
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,643
<i>of the abandonment</i>
<i>along with the annoying reporter,</i>

133
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,013
<i>but in the end,</i>
<i>all he did was find himself</i>

134
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,481
<i>caught in a trap.</i>

135
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,484
As expected of an idiot grandson.
He's so easy.

136
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,820
He abandoned the woman

137
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:44,256
and attacked Vulture
in order to destroy evidence.

138
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,526
If Jidori is involved in covering up

139
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,327
both of these incidents by Daiya…

140
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,463
Jidori, the Supreme Court justice,

141
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,465
will hit rock bottom.

142
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,966
At the same time,

143
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,035
Asaba and Jidori's relationship
will falter.

144
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,371
Actually, they'll both go down together.

145
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,706
Exactly.

146
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,676
If we sue the state once
Jidori's power has weakened,

147
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,711
it'll give us momentum.

148
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,680
Tomonaga,

149
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,783
please upload those along with
the article in the folder.

150
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,518
Just uploading it won't create buzz.

151
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,687
To get more views,

152
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:18,858
let me fidget
with the platform a little bit…

153
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:20,626
DAIYA ASABA ON THE RUN

154
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,728
<i>This is a huge scoop</i>

155
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,131
<i>that could cost him his life!</i>

156
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,501
<i>Like I mentioned the other day,</i>

157
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,004
I am prepared to crack down on

158
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,707
the platform itself

159
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,610
regarding posts about
baseless lies like these.

160
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:42,248
<i>The thing is, the post in question</i>
<i>is multiplying endlessly.</i>

161
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,550
<i>We're trying to find the cause.</i>

162
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,994
Did you find Susuda?

163
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:56,929
Well,

164
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,899
we're doing our best to search for him.

165
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,169
Search?

166
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,771
Find him!

167
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,740
I'm terribly sorry.

168
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,846
It's them, isn't it?

169
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,155
TO MR. TOMONAGA

170
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,537
You are…

171
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:43,009
I apologize for being rough with you
the other day

172
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,644
without even introducing myself.

173
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,719
I apologize too.

174
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,890
May I ask you why

175
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,593
you changed your mind about testifying?

176
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,896
It's because…

177
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,167
your assistant…

178
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,537
told me to hold on to this

179
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,606
until the trial ends.

180
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:16,609
WILL

181
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,643
This…

182
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,621
<i>In regard to the misjudgment</i>
<i>concerning the Minamiboso bus accident</i>

183
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,356
<i>which happened 18 years ago,</i>

184
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,658
<i>I will die in protest.</i>

185
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,695
<i>What I'm doing isn't right</i>

186
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,563
<i>and I know it's unforgivable.</i>

187
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,768
<i>However,</i>
<i>I couldn't think of any other way.</i>

188
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,638
<i>The judicial system,</i>
<i>which should uphold justice,</i>

189
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,605
<i>is warped and disgusting.</i>

190
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,341
<i>And because of that,</i>

191
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,210
<i>people are hurting and suffering.</i>

192
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,479
<i>If…</i>

193
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,816
<i>it's for the person who</i>
<i>healed my heart and saved my life,</i>

194
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,453
<i>I am willing to fight.</i>

195
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,296
Just one single lie…

196
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,768
can easily break someone.

197
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,505
Despite that,

198
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:24,076
he has been mustering up the courage
to keep fighting for years.

199
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,781
For the sake of his late father.

200
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,418
Will you please…

201
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,556
tell the truth during the trial?

202
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,328
If you don't promise me that,

203
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,563
I'll have to…

204
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,969
What are you doing?

205
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,007
I will…

206
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,046
die right here.

207
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,716
What are you saying? Hey!

208
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,518
Stop!

209
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,286
Stop it!

210
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,121
<i>The defendant, Miyuki Haie,</i>

211
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,657
<i>and the defendant, Haie Kotsu Co. Ltd.,</i>

212
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,994
<i>are jointly and severally liable</i>
<i>for paying the plaintiff, Kumiko Sasaki,</i>

213
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,331
<i>16,026,345 yen in regard to</i>

214
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:23,135
<i>the December 15th, 2006 accident…</i>

215
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,438
Hey! Hey! Stop!

216
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,474
I won't…

217
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,576
I won't let you die!

218
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,721
I'll testify.

219
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,896
<i>I really am blessed with good friends.</i>

220
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,600
Thanks to your article,

221
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,936
we're gaining momentum.

222
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,906
If two second-rates get together,

223
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,909
our force still doubles.

224
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,815
Let's win no matter what

225
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,452
and light up a grand firework show.

226
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,730
Listen…

227
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,468
for elites
who've never experienced defeat,

228
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,773
you need to mock them in public.

229
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,342
Shake them up.

230
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,847
<i>Hyena, you've got to use</i>

231
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,916
<i>your fangs.</i>

232
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,799
Are you ready to invite Ms. Reiko back?

233
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,702
Is Mr. Nao Haie here?

234
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,440
Mr. Nao Haie?

235
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,142
That is me.

236
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,744
An arrest warrant was issued for you

237
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,712
on suspicion of
violating the Attorneys Act.

238
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,950
Mr. Hideki Tomonaga,

239
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,487
an arrest warrant was issued for you
on suspicion of being a co-principal.

240
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,490
<i>Former lawyer Nao Haie has been</i>

241
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,525
<i>arrested on suspicion of violating</i>

242
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,726
<i>the Attorneys Act.</i>

243
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,396
<i>He was calling himself</i>
<i>an inheritance detective.</i>

244
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,264
<i>-And was…</i>
-This…

245
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,367
<i>…allegedly giving legal advice</i>
<i>despite being unlicensed,</i>

246
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,970
<i>moving the Metropolitan Police Department</i>
<i>to make the arrest.</i>

247
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,606
<i>According to investigators,</i>

248
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,710
<i>Haie opened his detective office</i>
<i>here in Shinagawa City two years ago,</i>

249
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,878
<i>conducting detective work…</i>

250
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,530
How was it?

251
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:08,300
<i>We searched Haie's office,</i>
<i>but could not find any</i>

252
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:12,037
<i>information on Susuda's whereabouts</i>
<i>or that article.</i>

253
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,178
NOW RECRUITING POLICE AND STAFF

254
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,349
They finally released me.

255
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,787
Is it okay for
a renowned attorney like you

256
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,322
to help me out?

257
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,993
I heard you kicked Ms. Reiko out.

258
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,561
That was the right choice.

259
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,596
Where's Tomonaga?

260
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,498
He was released as well.

261
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,502
Did you learn your lesson?

262
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,638
Going up against Justice Jidori
is too reckless.

263
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,974
It will bring misfortune not only to you

264
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,909
but also to the people around you.

265
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,915
You're trying to take the state to court.

266
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,485
Frankly speaking,

267
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,687
you're making
all of the judges your enemy.

268
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,223
It'll be a complete away game.

269
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,595
<i>There is no way you can win.</i>

270
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,137
<i>I know</i>

271
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,473
<i>very well now, that you are just like</i>

272
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,546
the father who raised you,
and you can only think of trivial things.

273
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,522
Mom?

274
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,397
I'm sorry for making you worry.

275
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,808
I will help you.

276
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,278
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

277
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,680
More importantly,

278
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,882
what brings you here?

279
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:19,998
Here…

280
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,205
Your father left them behind.

281
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,206
WILL

282
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,046
I thought it would be too painful for you,

283
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,483
<i>so I've been hiding them this whole time.</i>

284
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,820
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

285
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,324
<i>But I want you to know</i>

286
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,061
<i>how your father truly felt.</i>

287
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,831
If it doesn't change

288
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,168
your will to stand up against that man,

289
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,872
I won't say anything anymore.

290
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,848
WILL

291
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,128
Why is a hyena curled up
like a chinchilla?

292
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,630
If this is enough to bring you down,

293
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,632
you're lacking resolve!

294
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,337
No matter what you say, I will not leave.

295
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,806
I am the one who decides
what to do with my life.

296
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,942
As a woman who has written a will already,

297
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,844
a raid like this is as harmless
as a little fart.

298
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,680
Come on, get moving.

299
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,617
Since when were you there?

300
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,852
I thought something like this
would happen,

301
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,488
so I short-circuited the computers
the moment they raided us.

302
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,592
<i>Our important information</i>
<i>is in a safe in my secret room.</i>

303
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,096
Also,

304
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,332
the one who was taking care of

305
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,134
Mr. Susuda while we were detained

306
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,669
was Ms. Reiko.

307
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,838
If it wasn't for me, Mr. Susuda

308
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,841
would've starved to death
in that perverted room.

309
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,646
You two…

310
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,259
You're un-bee-lievable.

311
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,335
So, what will you do?

312
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,806
Finally, all the requirements are met.

313
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,644
I'll file a lawsuit for state redress.

314
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,582
A lawsuit for state redress…

315
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,485
"When a public employee's unlawful act
causes you loss or damage,

316
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,520
you cannot sue the public employee,

317
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:31,023
so instead, you sue the state."

318
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,026
There's no doubt
that it's much more difficult

319
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,029
than claiming compensation
from a regular civilian.

320
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,231
But right now, with both

321
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,400
Asaba and Jidori under fire,

322
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,934
it's our chance to file the lawsuit.

323
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,270
Thanks to Mr. Hage.

324
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,674
First we need to draft a complaint.

325
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,518
Is writing a complaint that complicated?

326
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,890
First of all, how can you sue the state
without an attorney?

327
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,860
I don't know about this…

328
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,073
Good evening.

329
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,475
Attorney Fukushi!

330
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,278
Are you here to lecture me again?

331
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,913
Jeez…

332
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,749
A useless former attorney is
trying to represent himself in court?

333
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,051
How overconfident can you be?

334
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,723
I'll proofread your complaint.

335
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,159
However…

336
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,697
I am a coward,

337
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:49,000
so please keep my involvement a secret.

338
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,537
Thank you very much.

339
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,543
Thank you.

340
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,079
That'll really help.

341
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,622
I'm still alive today.

342
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,960
Hurry up, Hyena.

343
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,531
I don't have much time.

344
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,702
HOW SAD FOR THE VICTIMS AND DRIVER.
HOW POWERFUL IS JIDORI?

345
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:24,603
‪IS JIDORI BEHIND HIS ARREST TOO?‬

346
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:25,570
WHY IS JIDORI OBSESSED WITH MR. HAIE?

347
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:26,705
I HOPE HE WINS THE LAWSUIT!
I'M ROOTING FOR MR. HAIE

348
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:28,874
<i>&lrm;You can do it.</i>

349
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,417
<i>The trial against the state</i>

350
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,953
<i>demanding 900 million yen</i>
<i>in compensation has begun.</i>

351
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,756
<i>However, there is</i>
<i>a tall hurdle to overcome</i>

352
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:45,991
<i>in order to win this trial.</i>

353
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:48,960
<i>Unless Jidori himself admits</i>

354
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,162
<i>that he pressured…</i>

355
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,297
<i>…Mr. Susuda into doing it,</i>

356
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,398
<i>we can't win.</i>

357
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:58,437
<i>The testimony of former judge Susuda,</i>
<i>the one who</i>

358
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:01,106
<i>rendered the original judgment</i>
<i>for the bus accident,</i>

359
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,008
<i>will be the first key to open</i>

360
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,376
<i>the doors to the truth.</i>

361
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,281
<i>However, Mr. Susuda was trembling.</i>

362
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,087
<i>That's because Jidori appeared</i>
<i>in the gallery.</i>

363
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:29,434
The fact that Mr. Kazuhiro Haie,
the driver, did not fall asleep

364
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,369
was clearly evident at the time.

365
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,705
So why did you

366
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,974
write that there was a possibility

367
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,510
that he fell asleep at the wheel
despite that?

368
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,180
Will you please tell us the truth?

369
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,056
I…

370
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,395
was invited out by Judge Jidori

371
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,366
<i>after the trial</i>
<i>for the bus accident began.</i>

372
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,770
About that bus accident…

373
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:07,939
Yes?

374
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,575
I don't think it can be settled

375
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,545
as a simple weather-related accident.

376
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:21,786
For this accident, we should consider
the feelings of the victims.

377
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,789
If you render a lousy judgment

378
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,659
and it is overturned by the Supreme Court,

379
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,597
you might not be able to return

380
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,634
to Tokyo ever again.

381
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,438
DRIVER MAY HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL

382
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,873
POSSIBLY OVERWORKED

383
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,980
I understood him to mean,
"Consider the newspaper article about

384
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,883
the driver falling asleep at the wheel

385
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,919
when rendering judgment."

386
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:56,821
Order.

387
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,858
Regarding this trial,

388
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,061
did Justice Jidori pressure you
in any way?

389
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:09,200
After Mr. Haie and reporter Hageta
visited my house,

390
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,636
Justice Jidori

391
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,506
called me to tell me,

392
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,775
"Don't say anything."

393
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,911
Did you feel pressured?

394
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,481
Yes.

395
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,017
I took that as a threat.

396
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,687
Order!

397
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,523
Why is that?

398
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,559
Before the conclusion of the trial

399
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,629
for the bus accident,

400
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,967
I told Judge Jidori how I felt,

401
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,971
and he in turn looked at me

402
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,073
as if

403
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,875
he was a furious demon

404
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,712
and said, "Don't you dare upset me."

405
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,147
More than myself,

406
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,685
I was afraid that my family
would be torn apart.

407
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,523
<i>Mr. Susuda courageously</i>

408
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,525
<i>testified the truth.</i>

409
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,262
It's starting to look hopeful.

410
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,165
No, we can't be sure yet.

411
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,434
Knowing Jidori,

412
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,536
I'm sure he pressured

413
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,071
the judges in some way.

414
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:28,346
-During the examination of evidence…
<i>-Sensei's hunch was right.</i>

415
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,281
<i>It looked like the judges</i>

416
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,883
<i>were intimidated by Jidori.</i>

417
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,485
…pressured him during the trial.

418
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,286
By no means

419
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,723
did I ever pressure

420
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,825
Mr. Susuda in any way

421
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,794
regarding the trial.

422
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:45,597
I have absolutely

423
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,332
no idea

424
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,168
why Mr. Susuda is

425
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,738
testifying as such all of a sudden,

426
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,307
after all these years.

427
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,445
Can you think of any reason why Mr. Susuda

428
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,746
would testify that way?

429
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,349
No.

430
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,152
It's beyond me.

431
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,890
I find it very unfortunate.

432
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,665
The plaintiff
may cross-examine the witness.

433
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,014
At the time, you were

434
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,384
Appointment Section Chief of the
Supreme Court Personnel Affairs Bureau.

435
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,354
I've heard that personnel affairs
exercises a lot of influence in courts.

436
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:46,091
Isn't it true that Mr. Susuda was not able

437
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,859
to go against you?

438
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,061
The plaintiff's question is misleading.

439
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,230
That's a false accusation.

440
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,499
First of all,

441
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,468
I have no

442
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:58,570
motive.

443
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,677
Recently, I have been

444
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,613
subject to all sorts of

445
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,317
defamation online over things
that are not backed by evidence.

446
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:15,887
It is my understanding that this lawsuit
was initiated

447
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,791
to take advantage of my current situation.

448
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,731
By the way…

449
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:34,873
you are my biological father.

450
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,840
Is that true?

451
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,079
That is true.

452
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,884
Order in the courtroom.

453
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:50,288
Twenty-nine years ago,
before I entered elementary school,

454
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,525
you visited my father, the driver
in the bus accident, for the first time

455
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,294
and told him that you wanted to
take custody of me.

456
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,796
Is this true?

457
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,097
That is true.

458
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,533
For three years, you persistently

459
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,401
kept trying to take custody of me.

460
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,504
But because you were turned down,
you resented my father.

461
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,707
Isn't that why you tried to
ruin my family?

462
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,309
Objection, that is an assumption.

463
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,343
Presiding Judge.

464
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:17,182
That is explained in detail
in my father's diary.

465
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,017
The plaintiff may continue.

466
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,020
It has been submitted as evidence,

467
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,722
so I'm sure you've read it already.

468
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,562
I am showing plaintiff’s exhibit 15.

469
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:39,337
"November 4th, 1996 at 4 p.m.

470
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,473
Jidori told me that he wants
custody over Nao.

471
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,809
He said he will pay money in exchange.

472
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,312
Hearing that

473
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,714
made my blood boil."

474
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,985
Absolutely not.
Don't ever show up here again.

475
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,126
"December 13th, 1996.

476
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,629
Jidori showed up again.

477
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,532
He found out that my bus company
is struggling with finances

478
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,100
and said he wants to help.

479
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,770
He still hasn't given up on Nao."

480
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,309
Isn't it true that you began to
resent my father,

481
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,912
who adamantly refused to give me up?

482
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:23,615
Of course not.

483
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,253
Why would I be resentful?

484
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:33,191
All I did was offer financial help.

485
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,027
For the sake of my child.

486
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,997
Financial help?

487
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,466
Oh, please stop joking.

488
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:44,402
You tried to buy your child with money.

489
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,371
For your career, you married the daughter

490
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:49,540
of Asaba, the boss of the political world,
but you were childless.

491
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,276
That's why

492
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,345
you remembered the existence of
the child you abandoned.

493
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,149
On February 7th of the following year,

494
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,086
my father impulsively insulted you.

495
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,888
The reason is written here.

496
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,125
"He said,
'How much will you give Nao up for?'

497
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,660
I told him,

498
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:12,030
'If you're that adamant, show me proof
that he's really your son.'

499
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,132
And he replied,

500
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:18,336
'I refuse. I want to adopt
a child from an underprivileged family.'

501
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,105
It's all for his public image.

502
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,642
As if I'd give my precious Nao
to someone like him.

503
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,010
"Don't be ridiculous!"

504
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,287
Despite being extremely self-centered,

505
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,424
you finally gave up.

506
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,394
On April 23rd, 1999…

507
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,596
His birthday?

508
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,438
It wasn't fancy,
but we were able to celebrate it.

509
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,473
Nao is

510
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,876
growing up to be a good kid,
as you can see.

511
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,422
No matter how much money you offer…

512
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,060
Even if I'm not related to him by blood,

513
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,832
we are a family.

514
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:29,907
I'm ready to pay.

515
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,709
Thank you very much.

516
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,245
-One moment, please.
-Okay.

517
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,221
<i>"At that moment he looked like a demon.</i>

518
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:47,425
<i>That was</i>
<i>the first time I felt scared of Jidori."</i>

519
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,194
A demon…

520
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,232
Mr. Susuda likened you to a demon too.

521
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,535
He was scared that you would
rip his family apart.

522
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,437
You have been terrorizing people

523
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,205
like this, haven't you?

524
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,541
Objection,
the question insults the witness.

525
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,010
I'll change the question.
After the bus accident trial,

526
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,646
Mr. Susuda became an associate judge
at Tokyo High Court.

527
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,947
What a great promotion.

528
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,016
Do you remember what you said to him

529
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,551
to congratulate him?

530
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:15,953
I don't remember.

531
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,289
Mr. Susuda remembers clearly.

532
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,224
"Now you know that listening to

533
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,826
my advice is for your benefit."

534
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,628
That is what you said.

535
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,762
Who cares?

536
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,764
Did you hear that, everyone?

537
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:31,235
A Supreme Court justice just said,
"Who cares?"

538
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,405
Did you start this trial
just to ridicule me?

539
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,908
Is this how you intimidated Mr. Susuda?

540
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,377
The future top-ranking officer
of the judicial system

541
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,080
sure is talented at pressuring
us common people.

542
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,147
With the face of a demon.

543
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,415
Shut up!

544
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,917
I need to teach fools like you

545
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,452
about what is right.

546
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,253
What's wrong with using pressure!

547
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,096
So you admit to pressuring people?

548
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,999
That is all.

549
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,575
CLOSING ARGUMENT

550
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,844
Now for the closing arguments.

551
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,487
The paper I proofread…

552
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,022
What's wrong with Sensei?

553
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,596
There is a quote that goes,
"Dead men tell no tales."

554
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,532
When the person involved passes away,

555
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,367
the truth becomes unknown.

556
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:41,038
It's even possible to
blame the dead for crimes.

557
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,307
In the case of my father's trial,

558
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,811
that was done by the judicial system.

559
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,514
I am sure of that.

560
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,019
Should something like that be permitted?

561
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,090
My father lost control of the bus
and had no choice

562
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,858
but to die along with many other people.

563
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,095
Think of how many regrets he had.

564
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:09,233
And to think that he was forced
to take the blame after his death.

565
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,202
You are truly

566
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,404
a demon.

567
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,645
My father may not be the only one.

568
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:24,115
Certain people with authority over others

569
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,652
are hurting people who are living
ordinary lives

570
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,987
and trampling on their feelings.

571
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,822
I…

572
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,526
will not forgive such a thing.

573
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,130
Even if

574
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,033
I lose this trial,

575
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,701
I will spend the rest of my life

576
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,470
settling the score for my father.

577
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,342
Please, think about it.

578
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,912
Right becomes wrong

579
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,582
and the innocent become guilty.

580
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,550
How can we allow such a world!

581
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,752
Plaintiff, please calm down.

582
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,855
People who are in a position to
uphold the law and judge others

583
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,424
are breaking the law

584
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,459
to fulfill their own desires.

585
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,963
Those people should be punished.

586
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,567
The voices of the dead should be heard.

587
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,703
Otherwise,

588
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,906
you will continue to suffer.

589
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,775
The victims of the bus accident will
continue to suffer.

590
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:25,710
No,

591
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,913
every citizen of Japan will.

592
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,354
I won't let the wishes of the deceased

593
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,490
be dishonored.

594
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,371
You're no guardians of the law.

595
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,541
You're just watchdogs for people
with power. To hell with that!

596
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:00,611
That is all.

597
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,483
Order!

598
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,885
Order!

599
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,562
Our verdict is as follows…

600
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,232
Main claim, point one.

601
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:25,670
The defendant will pay the plaintiff
900 million yen,

602
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:29,974
in addition to
a 3% annual interest rate that will be

603
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:33,678
applied from March 6th, 2025
until the entire amount is paid.

604
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:37,181
Point two. The defendant is liable
for bearing the court costs.

605
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,723
Someone's coming out.

606
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,791
Someone's here.

607
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,895
WIN

608
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,530
They won!

609
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,132
The state lost the lawsuit.

610
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,168
The judge who was in charge of the trial

611
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,070
for the Minamiboso bus accident testified

612
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,472
that the driver did not
fall asleep at the wheel.

613
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,476
It was proven that the judge
in charge of the case was pressured

614
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,279
into rendering
an incorrect ruling by another judge.

615
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,882
<i>This judgement has brought</i>
<i>people's attention</i>

616
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,752
<i>to the bus accident,</i>
<i>with many wanting to know what happened.</i>

617
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,392
Good job.

618
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,605
Do you think you won against me?

619
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,708
If we held a National Review right now,

620
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:42,213
you would receive
your very first vote of no confidence.

621
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,915
I guess you're right.

622
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:49,120
Do you

623
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:53,824
know what kind of a person
a real fixer is?

624
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,963
One who is never in the limelight,

625
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,501
laments the future of Japan
in the shadows of history,

626
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,770
and devotes himself

627
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,205
for the sake of Japan
and the greater good.

628
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,043
That is what I have become.

629
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:18,115
I can destroy you…

630
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,820
if I need to.

631
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,295
Still,

632
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,732
I won't resent you.

633
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,602
Not as long as I have Dad's will.

634
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,840
I'll let you read it.

635
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,752
<i>I wonder how old you will be</i>

636
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,854
<i>by the time you read this letter?</i>

637
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,924
<i>I've been wanting to tell you</i>

638
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:03,327
<i>about your real father someday,</i>

639
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,197
<i>but before I knew it,</i>
<i>you were already in middle school.</i>

640
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,532
<i>No human</i>

641
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,368
<i>can predict what will happen</i>
<i>in the future.</i>

642
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,339
<i>That's why I've decided to</i>

643
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,776
<i>entrust your mother with this will.</i>

644
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,714
<i>Nao, your real father</i>

645
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,550
<i>is someone named Kengo Jidori.</i>

646
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,456
<i>In a desperate attempt</i>
<i>to protect our family,</i>

647
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,226
<i>I insulted that person</i>

648
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,028
<i>and possibly hurt him.</i>

649
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,699
<i>That's why</i>

650
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,336
<i>I want you to be kind to people,</i>
<i>no matter who they are.</i>

651
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,073
<i>You cannot hold a grudge</i>
<i>against someone forever.</i>

652
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,708
<i>That will only</i>

653
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,011
<i>make you miserable.</i>

654
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,314
<i>Nao,</i>

655
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,351
<i>please keep smiling.</i>

656
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,288
<i>And live a wonderful life.</i>

657
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,725
<i>I wish my son all the best.</i>

658
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,294
<i>Love, your father.</i>

659
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,645
I'm not sure if cherry blossoms

660
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,080
suit Vulture or not.

661
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,983
It doesn't suit him,

662
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,019
but it'll remind us of him every year.

663
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,189
I will

664
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,425
return to medical school.

665
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,562
I'm going to a forensics department
in France.

666
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,331
Both of you,

667
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,366
good luck.

668
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:00,110
Bye.

669
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,616
Pour me a cup too.

670
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,022
Kanayama?

671
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,191
Don't run, you idiot.

672
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,064
I'm going to need your advice.

673
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,302
Inheritance detective.

674
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,239
WILL

675
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,111
Well…

676
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,550
