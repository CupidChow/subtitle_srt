<i>Nao Haie has been solving</i>

3

<i>involve inheritance.</i>

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,979
<i>I will solve the mystery.</i>

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,081
That's the Hyena we know.

6
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:18,385
<i>In the past, he was</i>
<i>shunned by the legal community.</i>

7
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,321
<i>But you had to pay a huge amount of money</i>
<i>as compensation</i>

8
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,655
<i>for your dad's bus accident,</i>

9
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,291
<i>so I can understand</i>
<i>why you would want to embezzle money.</i>

<i>Dad, I'll settle the score for you,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

12
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,165
I'll make sure to teach him
what will happen

13
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,968
<i>if he does anything unnecessary.</i>

14
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,473
Delicious!

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,209
The sea urchin just melts in your mouth.

16
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,479
I'm so glad I'm Japanese.

17
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,916
Sensei, why are you treating me to such

18
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,284
expensive sushi?

19
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:55,889
I thought it'd be nice once in a while,
since you're taking care of your mother.

20
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,257
Just kidding.

21
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,193
I actually won these free meal vouchers
through some lottery.

22
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,096
I didn't know you were the type
to play the lottery.

23
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,833
I thought you were the one
who signed me up.

24
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:10,703
We don't issue meal vouchers here.

25
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,811
I was waiting for you, Hyena.

26
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,613
Kanayama?

27
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,451
I will have you pay us back today,
once and for all.

28
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,686
This was a trap, huh?

29
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,322
Why would you set up
a stupid trap like this?

30
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,559
You're the one who fell
for this "stupid trap."

31
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,593
One second!

32
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,801
He will pay our bill.

33
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,170
-Wait!
-Hey!

34
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:54,481
Hey, Reiko! Over here!

35
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,982
Hey!

36
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,326
Sensei! I'm sorry!

37
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,877
This retro, Showa-era aesthetic is so in.

38
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:28,148
<i>Did you know that</i>
<i>"big baths nurture fulfilled people"?</i>

39
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,149

45
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,703
Mr. Haie, here.

46
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,639
It's from Ms. Reiko.

47
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,575
Long time no see, Mao.

48
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,077
-You're helping out Grandpa Ken?
-Something like that.

49
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,846
How is art school?

50
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,482
I have to start looking for a job now.

51
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,383
I see.

52
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,952
Boy am I thankful
for being right in front of

53
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,122
Grandpa Ken's bathhouse
after getting drenched in cold water.

54
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,123
I'm so lucky.

55
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,358
What's up, Hyena?

56
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,395
Did you come here looking for
old people who are about to die?

57
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,131
Darn you, inheritance detective.

58
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,901
Oh, Grandpa Ken!
I'm glad you seem to be doing good.

59
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,237
That tickles. Stop that!

60
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,873
That's right, I am still full of energy.

61
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,808
‪Can I get milk?‬

62
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,711
-Here you go.
-These are my elementary school friends.

63
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,479
Right?

64
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,448
That's so nice.

65
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,051
Childhood friends hanging out
at a bathhouse.

66
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,258
-Good night.
-All right. See you.

67
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,192
Good night.

68
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,361
You can't sit here and chat all day.

69
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,896
Time to leave.

70
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,631
-We have to close. See you.
-Thanks.

71
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,665
-See you.
-Good night.

72
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,566
Get home safe.

73
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,968
-Bye.
-Good night.

74
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,669
Sensei!

75
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,440
Hyena, it's been so long
since the last time you came.

76
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,408
Help me clean the baths while you're here.

77
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,211
After that, let's have some drinks.

78
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,013
-Yes, I'd love to!
-Okay!

79
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,582
This is my assistant…

80
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,417
Reiko Mitomi.

81
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,390
This retro, Showa-era aesthetic is so in.
I love it.

82
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,260
We opened in the 14th year
of the Taisho era.

83
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:25,131
After Tokyo was completely burned down
with the great Kanto earthquake,

84
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,801
our founder opened this business,
wanting to make a bathhouse

85
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,737
that was spacious and clean.

86
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,273
And I'm the fourth generation owner.

87
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,943
By the way, bathhouses reached
their peak popularity in 1968.

88
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,145
There were more than
2,500 of them in Tokyo.

89
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,548
That's almost as much as
how many 7-Heavens are in Tokyo.

90
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,852
Interesting…
Why are you so knowledgeable about this?

91
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,421
My ex-girlfriend
was writing a blog about that.

92
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,590
We even went on dates like "Kandagawa."

93
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,792
Oh, that song where the guy makes the girl

94
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,295
wait in front of the bathhouse
in the cold?

95
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,765
<i>The backstreet bathhouse</i>
<i>We went to together</i>

96
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,602
But then,

97
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,005
during the economic boom,
they started building baths in every house

98
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,142
and people stopped bonding with
their neighbors at bathhouses.

99
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,279
And now, the cost of fuel has skyrocketed.

100
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,784
I don't care what happens
to my other properties.

101
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:25,024
But I want to do whatever I can
to protect this bathhouse

102
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,860
that our ancestors left for us.

103
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,296
But honestly,

104
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:33,700
this industry is only going downhill

105
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,769
and there's nothing we can do about it.

106
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,679
-Good work.
-Good work.

107
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,481
SWEET SHOP

108
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,153
So, your daughter and her husband
won't take over the business?

109
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,288
Nope.

110
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,291
My son-in-law married

111
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,528
my daughter on the condition that
he won't have to take over the bathhouse.

112
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,897
I had a little bit of hope
for my daughter,

113
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,266
so I switched from a wood-fired boiler

114
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,770
to an oil boiler ten years ago.

115
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,139
But she says that

116
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,643
she has no intention of keeping
the bathhouse open in this economy.

117
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,479
And so,

118
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:24,183
as long as I am alive,

119
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,653
I will keep working.

120
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,192
May I say something
that's none of my business?

121
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,127
What?

122
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,366
Have you thought seriously about

123
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,635
what'll happen after you die?

124
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,170
Excuse me?

125
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,572
Everyone dies one day.

126
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,207
For the sake of your family,

127
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,043
it's important to manage
your inheritance while you're alive.

128
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,248
That's just morbid.

129
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,450
It's up to you whether you see it as

130
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,452
something morbid or something positive.

131
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,353
However,

132
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,156
if you happen to die right now,

133
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,858
this bathhouse will die with you.

134
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,661
<i>…die with you…</i>

135
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,130
<i>…die with you…</i>

136
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,976
Hey. Wait, Hyena…

137
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,412
I mean…

138
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,115
Inheritance Detective.

139
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,884
If you're that sure about it,

140
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,287
use your knowledge

141
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,557
to try to protect this bathhouse!

142
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,796
If you can…

143
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:47,700
please…

144
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,838
help me.

145
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:58,377
My goodness,
you just need to be more honest.

146
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,086
Long time no see, Attorney Fukushi.

147
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,187
Ms. Reiko!

148
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,857
You were gone for a while.

149
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,325
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:17,029
But it seems like you've been able to
keep a balanced diet and exercise plan.

151
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,064
Yes.

152
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,665
Ever since you gave me tips,

153
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,100
I've been doing great.

154
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,702
When I work out like this

155
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,404
and take a bath before going to work,

156
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,173
I'm so much more productive.

157
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,774
-Please continue.
-Yes.

158
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,145
Attorney Fukushi,
do you use the bath at the gym?

159
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,081
Yes.

160
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,984
What about it?

161
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,020
Retro bathhouses are nice too.

162
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,221
Have you ever been?

163
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,190
No.

164
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,528
I'll tell you one that I recommend later.

165
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,934
Are you okay?

166
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,036
Yes.

167
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:58,804
Let's do more.

168
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,040
-Let's.
-Okay.

169
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,542
All right.

170
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:05,978
FUKUDA

171
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,314
My dad, the third generation owner,

172
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,217
opened the sweet shop next door.

173
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,921
When I took over, we were right
in the middle of an economic bubble.

174
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:19,158
I built things like laundromats
and studio apartments,

175
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,028
so I actually own

176
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,996
land here and there.

177
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,665
-Wow.
-I see.

178
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,367
Dad, what are you talking about?

179
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,570
That apartment is so janky.

180
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,473
I feel bad kicking out the people
who live there.

181
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,376
There are so many empty rooms
because you don't have

182
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,179
money to do repairs, let alone remodel it.

183
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,181
Really?

184
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,016
As long as we're running this bathhouse,

185
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,485
we can't even go on
family vacations together.

186
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,822
I don't know anything about
business management,

187
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,025
but my husband says that
it will be hard to stay in business.

188
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,560
Your husband, huh?

189
00:09:56,696 --> 00:10:00,499
Mr. Haie, I know this will be
quite complicated,

190
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,234
but we'll be in your care.

191
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,737
I know it would be best if we could

192
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,940
keep the bathhouse
just as my father wishes but…

193
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:12,645
Anyway, we want to close the bathhouse
when the time is right.

194
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,181
So please help us out.

195
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,315
Well…

196
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,856
Ever since she was a child,

197
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,892
she hated that I ran a bathhouse
because she would get

198
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,128
embarrassed when her classmates
would come.

199
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:32,565
Her husband, works at some
big fancy company.

200
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,234
-He says the cast-performance--
-You mean, cost-performance?

201
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,704
Well, no matter what kind of
household it is,

202
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,474
there are always disagreements
when it comes to inheritance.

203
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,709
When I die…

204
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,581
you can sell my land
and use that to pay the inheritance tax.

205
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,351
I won't be a burden on you guys!

206
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,787
The thing is, Grandpa Ken,

207
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,223
life isn't that easy.

208
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,460
Listen carefully.

209
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,098
Inheritance taxes are very complicated.

210
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,134
First, the tax must be declared

211
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,537
within ten months of you passing away,

212
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,173
and it must be paid in cash,
in one payment.

213
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,743
You don't even get time
to grieve in peace?

214
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,545
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

215
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,581
That's why,
some people can't sell the land

216
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,717
in time before the due date.

217
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,986
And when they try to sell it quickly,

218
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,954
they're forced to
sell it at a lower price.

219
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,624
-What in the world…
-That is why.

220
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,627
You have to choose what to prioritize

221
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,730
and begin preparing things
in order of importance.

222
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,933
I already know what I want to prioritize.

223
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,501
-What?
-What?

224
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,206
I don't want to sell our ancestors' land.

225
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,976
I want to keep the bathhouse in business.
That is all!

226
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,179
Dang!

227
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,180
Um,

228
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,049
I hate to break it to you,

229
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,887
but you unfortunately
don't have enough ready money

230
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,656
to keep the bathhouse open.

231
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:08,094
First of all, there's nothing you can do
without an heir who can take over.

232
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,104
-You okay? Are you dead?
-Don't say that!

233
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,706
All I want

234
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:25,711
is to protect this bathhouse
that our ancestors…

235
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,117
gave to us.

236
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,554
<i>We have customers who've been</i>
<i>coming here since</i>

237
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,256
<i>they were kids.</i>

238
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,593
<i>For old people</i>
<i>who have nobody to talk to all day,</i>

239
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,062
<i>coming here and chatting with people</i>

240
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,064
<i>is their reason to live.</i>

241
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,667
I don't know anything about things like

242
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,803
economic efficiency or inheritance tax.

243
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,806
But these simple pleasures
that the common people enjoy…

244
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,909
These traditions that our ancestors

245
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,378
broke their backs to pass down…

246
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,581
To think that

247
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:08,954
they will all disappear
and end the moment I die…

248
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,692
I can't die like this,

249
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,896
even if I wanted to.

250
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,407
People keep their eyes fixed on
small things like smartphones

251
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,509
and even take baths in small bathtubs.

252
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,879
This world has become such a boring place!

253
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,350
Is this how it's supposed to be?

254
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,190
It's not.

255
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,662
I also wish that we could
live in a world where your bathhouse

256
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,063
could stay in business.

257
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,399
I wish that too.

258
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:10,449
That being said, there is nobody
who can take over the bathhouse.

259
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,919
There isn't? Then it's impossible.

260
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,155
That's right. Shofukuyu

261
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,557
is in a real bind right now.

262
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,026
Excuse me.

263
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:22,828
Oh!

264
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,264
Who is it?

265
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,766
Mao! Welcome.

266
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,635
-Come this way.
-Excuse me.

267
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,475
C…

268
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,210
C…

269
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:39,845
Cute…

270
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,315
What? Huh?

271
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,751
Huh?

272
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,757
I do this kind of contemporary art.

273
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,330
-I don't really care for contemporary art.
-Me neither.

274
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,599
I will buy it for 30 million
with a date included.

275
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,338
Of course, I know that I can't
make a living with this.

276
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,508
That's why I'm thinking of finding a job.

277
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,143
One second.

278
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,879
Mao, what did you come here to talk about?

279
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,649
The thing is…

280
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,153
I want to take over the bathhouse.

281
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,288
-What?
-What?

282
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,422
Really?

283
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,258
I was eavesdropping
on your conversation with my grandfather.

284
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,227
-I knew it.
-Huh?

285
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,331
I didn't come up with this idea
because I pity him.

286
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,569
It's going to be a long story,
but do you mind?

287
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,104
-Go ahead.
-Go ahead.

288
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,908
I grew up

289
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,046
being doted on by the customers
at the bathhouse.

290
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,683
Look, look. Tada!

291
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,685
-<i>When I got a perfect score on my test,</i>
-Wow, a perfect score!

292
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:55,220
<i>the customers would buy me ice cream</i>

293
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,023
<i>and my test would be showcased</i>
<i>by the front desk.</i>

294
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,929
On sports day, I had the most supporters
in the entire school.

295
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,831
We had a huge crowd that day.

296
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,633
That's so nice.

297
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:13,138
Did you know that
"big baths nurture fulfilled people"?

298
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,910
"Big baths nurture fulfilled people.

299
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,079
<i>There dwells laughter and fortune.</i>

300
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,481
<i>Shofukuyu."</i>

301
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,150
Those are our founder's words,

302
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:29,154
and sure enough, the bathhouse
attracts so many interesting people.

303
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:33,192
I think that's why you can learn to be
a fulfilled person there.

304
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,461
I see.

305
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,697
If I'm fulfilled in any way,

306
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,400
it's because I'm able to
get along with all sorts of people.

307
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,535
That's it. If only Mr. Tomonaga grew up
there.

308
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,804
-Near a bathhouse.
-What is that supposed to mean?

309
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,339
Now, now…

310
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,240
And then?

311
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,575
And so,

312
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,578
my interactions with our customers have

313
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,780
helped me through a lot.

314
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,883
That's why I want to take over
the bathhouse.

315
00:16:58,817 --> 00:16:59,685
But…

316
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,787
But?

317
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,624
A part of me

318
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:09,661
feels like I'm just
giving myself a way out because I know

319
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,396
I can't make it as an artist.

320
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:14,233
So I couldn't tell my parents.

321
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,503
Plus, I understand that
the bathhouse industry is going downhill.

322
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,308
Mr. Haie,

323
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,613
am I being too naive?

324
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,484
But you know,

325
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,120
you are a grown adult now,

326
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,489
so shouldn't you choose
how to live your life,

327
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,659
no matter what your parents
or grandparents say?

328
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,200
As someone who grew up in a bathhouse,

329
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,770
you are a fulfilled person,
and that is your strength.

330
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,872
Why not believe in your senses?

331
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:01,880
Okay.

332
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,583
I will

333
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,452
make up my mind.

334
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,520
-All right!
-All right!

335
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:10,889
All right!

336
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:12,925
-So cute…
-Huh?

337
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,227
What?

338
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,695
Are you serious?

339
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,530
Mao?

340
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,836
-Did he die?
-I'm not dead!

341
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:24,970
Don't mind him.

342
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:30,609
But what will Akiko and her husband say?

343
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,119
I knew it. I was able to sniff it out.

344
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,487
What?

345
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,890
The first to die out of all of us.

346
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,359
-It's Grandpa Ken!
-Sensei!

347
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,594
Ouch!

348
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,962
So

349
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,931
what are you trying to say, Hyena?

350
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,735
Right now, all of the real estate
and personal property,

351
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,072
including this land and building,
are owned by Grandpa Ken.

352
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,342
Shofukuyu is a corporation that
rents that property,

353
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,611
and Grandpa Ken is its sole shareholder

354
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,847
and the representative director.

355
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,550
Therefore,

356
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,086
you own all of the assets.

357
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,256
I know that. What about it?

358
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,757
In other words,

359
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,261
you are free to write your will
however you want.

360
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,696
If you want to keep Shofukuyu alive,

361
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,499
why don't you take a chance
and leave everything

362
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,969
to your grandchild, Mao, in your will?

363
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:37,676
But…

364
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,078
taking over the business

365
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,814
will require commitment.

366
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,951
I know.

367
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,332
All right. In that case,

368
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:01,900
I pass down

369
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,337
this bathhouse's tradition

370
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,407
to you.

371
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:11,910
Yes.

372
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,115
I will take good care of it.

373
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,793
Thank you.

374
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:44,610
SHOFUKUYU

375
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,779
Oh, Grandpa Ken?

376
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,848
Aren't you open from the afternoon?

377
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,383
Sorry, Iiyama.

378
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,719
Can you give me ten minutes?

379
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,355
-I'll go run around there for ten minutes.
-Okay.

380
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,360
What a refreshing customer.
Unlike someone else we know.

381
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,894
Who are you talking about?

382
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,230
We even have young people like him

383
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,966
coming to our bathhouse regularly.

384
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,571
That's all the more reason
for me to work harder.

385
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,909
Well then, please talk about it
as a family first.

386
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,111
We can start after that.

387
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,078
-Okay.
-Okay.

388
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,384
Hello?

389
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,287
Sensei.

390
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:33,125
Mr. Haie, the discussion
is not going well--

391
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,327
Forget it!

392
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,096
I've been protecting this land,

393
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:42,334
so I will do as I please
for as long as I live!

394
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,970
-The end!
-Dad!

395
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,472
Did you hear that?

396
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,508
All of it.

397
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,109
FUKUDA

398
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:54,046
Now that we have sorted through
all of your assets,

399
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:57,449
let's begin to take countermeasures
against the inheritance tax

400
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,551
for the sake of your successor.

401
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:03,088
So that I can kick the bucket at any time.

402
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,556
Let's get it done ASAP.

403
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,792
Don't say it like that.

404
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:11,296
First, we'll make Grandpa Ken a director

405
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,266
and make Mao the representative director.

406
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,736
In addition to that,
we'll have Grandpa Ken write a will

407
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,639
that bequeaths his personal assets to Mao.

408
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,376
Then let's sell any unnecessary
real estate.

409
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,246
Understanding the current state
of your real estate and selling it

410
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,549
is all part of estate planning,
but it'll also

411
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,818
secure the funds you'll need
in order to pay the tax.

412
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,686
I see.

413
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,289
The parking lot in Takenocho

414
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,857
can be sold.

415
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,961
Then let's take that into consideration.

416
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,997
Is there a specific real estate agent
you work with?

417
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,899
There used to be.

418
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,835
But the owner died

419
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,505
and he didn't have a successor,
so it went out of business.

420
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,273
Then I'll look for one online.

421
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,309
I can search for some on our end too.

422
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,811
That reminds me.

423
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,980
Iiyama, our regular customer,

424
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,083
<i>was also a real estate agent,</i>
<i>if I remember correctly.</i>

425
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,485
Oh, really?

426
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,122
This must be some kind of fate.

427
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,857
Let me ask him.

428
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:18,230
You can't go wrong with
athletes and bath enthusiasts.

429
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,601
I am Iiyama from Kurashieito Real Estate.

430
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,469
KURASHIEITO REAL ESTATE
IIYAMA SATOSHI

431
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,472
Thank you very much
for choosing me to be your

432
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,473
exclusive broker.

433
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,142
We'll be in your care.

434
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,811
You don't have to act so formal.

435
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,814
Just act like your usual self, Iiyama.

436
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,751
I will be working along with Iiyama.

437
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,219
My name is Uchida.

438
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:47,092
I am Haie, a friend of Grandpa Ken.

439
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:48,860
Inheritance detective?

440
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,463
I've heard rumors about you.

441
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,765
Wow… Nice to meet you.

442
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,333
Hello.

443
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,936
I am Mitomi, Haie's assistant.

444
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,972
Let's get right to it
and check the paperwork for the land

445
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,774
you want to sell.

446
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,211
Thank you very much.

447
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:14,219
Last but not least, we will inspect
the land just in case.

448
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,556
Once that is done,
we can move on to the next step.

449
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,690
Is that all right?

450
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,892
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

451
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,566
What is happening here?

452
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,535
Just in case, we're doing
a soil boring test to see how strong

453
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,671
the foundation is
and check for contamination.

454
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,807
If there is no soil contamination,
this land can most likely

455
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,743
be sold for quite a lot
as a residential lot.

456
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,447
Considering this location
and the size of this lot,

457
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:46,017
it'll be the biggest deal our company
has made in a while.

458
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:49,821
I'm glad you guys work so fast.

459
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:53,124
Well, you always take good care of me,
and this is your precious land.

460
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:01,733
<i>Why don't you put tiles on the counters</i>
<i>and floor to liven things up?</i>

461
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,201
Good idea.

462
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,437
We don't have the money to do a remodel,

463
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,906
but there are other things
we can do on our own like…

464
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:08,940
MAO'S FATHER
FUKUDA YUSUKE

465
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,543
Oh, right. The outside and inside…

466
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,979
She's been staying up all night
working on it.

467
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,181
We all know it's a waste of time.

468
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,682
I know…

469
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,351
Make sure you talk to her too.

470
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,621
A fusion of modern and retro?

471
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,456
That sounds interesting.

472
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,726
<i>-Doesn't it sound fun? I like the idea.</i>
-Oh, sorry.

473
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,262
Can you wait like five minutes? Sorry.

474
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:35,033
Grandpa, Mr. Iiyama got the test results
for the soil.

475
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,202
-Oh, it's done?
-Thanks.

476
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,773
It pains me to say this,

477
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,911
but we found a high concentration
of arsenic in the property in question.

478
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,045
What?

479
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,446
Arsenic?

480
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,648
Arsenic?

481
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,283
A poison found in contaminated soil.

482
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,419
I don't know why it's there.

483
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,589
These levels don't meet
environmental standards at all.

484
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,025
ARSENIC

485
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:00,959
Grandpa Ken,

486
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,663
what was on that land
before it became a parking lot?

487
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,132
A lumber dealer called Komatsu Lumber.

488
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,102
Would they even
use something like arsenic?

489
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,707
In the past, arsenic was used
for wood preservation.

490
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,145
If this land used to be a lumberyard,
it's not surprising to find traces of it.

491
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,114
So we can't sell that parking lot?

492
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,952
A lot of things need to be done,
like removing the contaminated soil…

493
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,621
So its asset value will drop quite a bit.

494
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:33,325
-No way…
-But don't worry.

495
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:36,294
Our company will take responsibility
and buy out

496
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,929
that land.

497
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,166
And we'll make sure that Grandpa Ken…

498
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,270
I mean, Mr. Fukuda doesn't have to
stress about it too much.

499
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,577
What are your thoughts?

500
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,214
I will

501
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,451
talk about it with my parents too.

502
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:03,154
Of course.
Please just keep our offer in mind.

503
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,356
Excuse me.

504
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,626
May I keep this data?

505
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,161
Go ahead.

506
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,472
I told you, didn't I?

507
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,010
I understand that you want to
fulfill Grandpa's wish.

508
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,345
But I am

509
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,314
against you taking over the bathhouse.

510
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,584
How could I possibly encourage

511
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,987
my only daughter to
willingly choose a difficult path?

512
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,155
That's right.

513
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,791
And because you had them do that test,
now we can't

514
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,626
build an apartment there anymore.

515
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:45,030
You didn't even tell us that you were
going to sell the land this quickly.

516
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,967
You have to face reality.

517
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,070
Anyway, let's get together with everyone

518
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,239
and talk about this again.

519
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,666
Reality, huh?

520
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,437
<i>All I want</i>

521
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,872
is to protect

522
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,241
this bathhouse that our ancestors…

523
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,480
gave to us.

524
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,786
All right.

525
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,055
HAIE INHERITANCE INVESTIGATION OFFICE

526
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:44,989
Grandpa Ken

527
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,791
is saying, "I am going to

528
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,693
get rid of that plot of land

529
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,196
that's been jinxed with poison!"

530
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,872
Do you not agree with the test results?

531
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,208
The locals speak highly
of that real estate agency,

532
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,043
so I think they're trustworthy.

533
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,745
Just in case, I also tested

534
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,147
the hole that they drilled
for soil boring.

535
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,883
I found the same amount of arsenic
as their data.

536
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,851
That was fast!

537
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,153
I get work done before I'm asked to do it.

538
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,655
It's a very high concentration.

539
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:20,125
They'll have to replace all of the soil.

540
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,862
I don't know about this…

541
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,233
Are you dissatisfied with my analysis?

542
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,836
I'll go buy some coffee.

543
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,651
Mao.

544
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:48,920
Mr. Haie?

545
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:50,555
Why are you here?

546
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,859
I asked Grandpa where
Komatsu Lumber moved to.

547
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,029
I wanted to know
if it's normal to use that much arsenic.

548
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,865
That was bothering me too.

549
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,067
Since when has Mr. Iiyama been a customer?

550
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:06,538
I was wondering about that too,
so I asked Grandpa.

551
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,473
He said since six months ago.

552
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,441
Oh, you were wondering about that?

553
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:15,547
Because I grew up in a bathhouse,
I rarely meet people I don't like.

554
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:19,951
But for some reason,
I just don't like those people.

555
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,191
Whatever the case may be,
we'll need to do some investigating.

556
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,192
Let's hurry.

557
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,527
-Yes!
-Hello.

558
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,729
This is my husband.

559
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,331
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

560
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:34,833
And your granddaughter?

561
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,235
She said she's running late.

562
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,937
Ms. Mao is with Sensei.

563
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,707
We don't want to take up your time,
Mr. Iiyama.

564
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,810
We talked about it as a family

565
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,545
and decided that

566
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,949
we want to sell the parking lot,
just as he wishes.

567
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,751
What's the point in holding onto
land poisoned with arsenic?

568
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,520
Yeah, that's right.

569
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,990
Well then, I am assuming that
you are considering

570
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,892
decontaminating the soil?

571
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,694
Yes, that's right.

572
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,964
Actually, we've prepared
a comparison chart.

573
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,198
-Comparison?
-Comparison?

574
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:08,099
Yes.

575
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,668
To put it concisely,

576
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,071
if you sell that land to us first

577
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,240
before you decontaminate that land,

578
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,742
it will be very cost-effective.

579
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,911
Cost-effective?

580
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,946
Even if you decontaminate it yourselves,

581
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,682
it will take time to find a buyer.

582
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,485
During that time, you'll be paying
a massive amount

583
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,520
in taxes and maintenance fees.

584
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:33,024
Moreover, it will put a pause
on your estate planning.

585
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,325
I can't have that.

586
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,394
If you sell it to us,

587
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:40,164
we will make sure to fulfill our share
of the payments like property tax.

588
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,599
We will also cover

589
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,336
the maintenance and decontamination fees
incurred after the purchase.

590
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,505
Additionally, we will consider offering

591
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,508
a price that is
higher than the current appraised value.

592
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,045
So, you will end up saving
somewhere between

593
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,648
a few million to ten million yen.

594
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:59,183
Wow! That would be really helpful!

595
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,952
-Right, dear?
-That's true.

596
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,663
We're actually thinking about
closing the bathhouse

597
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:15,934
and building something like an apartment
somewhere down the line.

598
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,637
Mao says she is almost here.

599
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,940
Well then, are we all in agreement

600
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,275
about this purchase?

601
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,177
Wait a second!

602
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,949
It is highly likely that

603
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,384
this soil contamination survey was forged.

604
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,019
-Forged?
-Forged?

605
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,525
It is highly likely that

606
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,994
this soil contamination survey was forged.

607
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,529
What is this all of a sudden?

608
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,597
We undoubtedly found arsenic.

609
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,733
You can test it again if you want to.

610
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,570
You dug a hole for testing
and created a false testing ground.

611
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,572
You put arsenic into that hole, right?

612
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,575
How can you accuse us like that
based on assumption?

613
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,910
Do you have proof?

614
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,979
According to your explanation,

615
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,448
the arsenic most likely
came from the preservatives

616
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,718
used by the lumber dealer
that used to be there, right?

617
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:07,885
That is correct.

618
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:11,589
First of all, they don't use preservatives
that include arsenic anymore.

619
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,557
I'm aware of that.

620
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,260
Therefore, there is no way
that you will find arsenic

621
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,463
in such high concentration
in this day and age.

622
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,631
Well, don't ask me…

623
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,667
Just in case, I went to Komatsu Lumber

624
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,269
and got scrap wood that was left over
from those days.

625
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,505
My staff member is analyzing it right now.

626
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,308
We are also testing the soil from the hole
that you drilled

627
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,044
and soil from another spot
within the same parking lot.

628
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,313
That is because at an atomic level,

629
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,515
there are different types of arsenic.

630
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:41,352
Each arsenical compound is
slightly different from the other.

631
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,156
When you analyze them in detail,
you can see these differences.

632
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,825
-Is that true?
-Yes.

633
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,163
It is called a "chemical fingerprint."

634
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,266
Tomonaga, how is it?

635
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,167
<i>It's done.</i>

636
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,636
The highly concentrated arsenic

637
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,038
found in the parking lot

638
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,506
and the arsenic found in

639
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:05,276
the preservatives that Komatsu Lumber
used to use are totally different.

640
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,544
-Different?
-Different?

641
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,181
By the way, the soil that was
retrieved from a different

642
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,916
spot within the parking lot

643
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,053
did indeed have traces of arsenic
from the lumber preservative,

644
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,255
but it was well below standard levels.

645
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,625
In conclusion, there's not enough
to call it "contaminated."

646
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,994
Plus, Mr. Komatsu told me

647
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,897
that they did a soil remediation
before selling that land.

648
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,466
Of course! I wouldn't want to
cause Grandpa Ken

649
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,601
any trouble after all he's done for us.

650
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,507
As you can see, I borrowed documents
from them as proof.

651
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,110
SOIL CONTAMINATION SURVEY
JULY 1987

652
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:42,813
As you heard, Mr. Iiyama and Ms. Uchida,
we know that

653
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,050
you're trying to trick Grandpa Ken
into selling that land for cheap,

654
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,985
just to resell it for a higher price.

655
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,688
You're malicious scammers.

656
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,656
-What?
-What?

657
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,032
I have all of that on record.

658
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,235
We will contact our company
and take action

659
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,736
against this defamation--

660
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:11,876
When you say, "company," are you
talking about Kurashieito Real Estate?

661
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,780
The thing is, my ex-girlfriend's friend

662
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,949
works at Kurashieito Real Estate.

663
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,450
I had that friend look you up,

664
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,819
and to my surprise, I was told that

665
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,020
there were no employees

666
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,723
named Iiyama Satoshi or Uchida Miho!

667
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,428
Mao, the time you spent at the bathhouse

668
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,597
made you a good judge of character.

669
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,465
Mr. Haie…

670
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,434
Our company does not share

671
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,437
personal information
about employees to outsiders.

672
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:43,040
<i>The email address on your business card</i>
<i>uses a different domain than the company.</i>

673
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,979
<i>By the way, the cellphone you're using</i>
<i>is under someone else's name.</i>

674
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,948
<i>It's what people call a burner phone.</i>

675
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,584
You heard him.

676
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,655
Actually, just to be extra sure,
I used my connections to

677
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:02,326
run your faces through the database
at the Metropolitan Police Department.

678
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,629
And there was a match.

679
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,398
You're scammers
with two prior convictions,

680
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,934
Sakairi Tadashi and Fukaura Shinobu,

681
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,402
am I right?

682
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,938
FUKAURA SHINOBU

683
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:18,776
Move!

684
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,751
Ouch!

685
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,756
Ow…

686
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:38,429
SHOFUKUYU

687
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,499
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT

688
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,206
I can't believe

689
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,308
a regular customer like Iiyama

690
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,643
was a scammer.

691
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,911
Actually,

692
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,680
he was only coming to this bathhouse

693
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,182
because he was after your assets.

694
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:02,186
Ever since they started developing
the land by the station half a year ago.

695
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,555
So you're saying

696
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:08,259
that I fell right into his trap?

697
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,161
It doesn't mean

698
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,097
that you were careless.

699
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,533
They cleverly trick you.

700
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,401
That's what scammers do.

701
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,272
I kind of

702
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,874
feel exhausted.

703
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,478
I guess I'm just getting old.

704
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:39,991
My goodness!

705
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,792
That was a really close call.

706
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,327
But now you understand, right?

707
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,263
You aren't cut out to be a business owner.

708
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,732
We're lucky this issue got solved.

709
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,569
But take this as a lesson
and stop pretending to be an entrepreneur.

710
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,538
Pretending?

711
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,574
It's not too late.

712
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:00,044
Go and find a decent job.

713
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,212
Dad.

714
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,581
Mom.

715
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,818
I'm really sorry

716
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,955
for making you worry.

717
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,493
But

718
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:17,795
I'm not

719
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,332
a child who plays pretend anymore.

720
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,941
Please look at this.

721
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,445
I told my friends from art school
about the bathhouse,

722
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,214
and they said they want to
work on it with me.

723
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,152
We'll make it into
a bathhouse museum that will treasure

724
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,721
old bathhouse features like
the <i>miyazukuri</i> architecture

725
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,656
and murals of Mt. Fuji.

726
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,792
I want to create a space where we can

727
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,760
showcase both contemporary art

728
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,029
and traditional handicrafts.

729
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,368
For example, the braided cords
on a traditional suit of armor

730
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,171
are a part of Japanese culture that is
on the verge of extinction,

731
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:01,872
and I want to help showcase those things.

732
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,141
You're being overambitious.

733
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,943
I calculated the renovation cost

734
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,546
and we can manage to keep it under budget.

735
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,314
We'll utilize social media and videos

736
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:11,916
to get visitors from overseas,

737
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,151
and not just local customers.

738
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,821
In order to do that,
at the sweet shop next door,

739
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,056
we will sell a variety of craft beers
from all over Japan,

740
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,624
as well as a "miracle dessert."

741
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,992
"Miracle dessert"?

742
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,629
A shaved ice shop called Secret-do

743
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,100
and a <i>zenzai</i> shop called Makuai from Kyoto
will collaborate.

744
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,836
-To make this.
-That looks amazing!

745
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,304
People will travel far to eat

746
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,072
a Secret-do and Makuai collaboration.

747
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,008
A senior from my art school
works at Secret-do

748
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,611
and Makuai
is owned by my professor's family.

749
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,080
I pitched this idea
and they showed interest.

750
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,385
You two, stay out of this.

751
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,019
If this fails,

752
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,723
you won't come out of it unscathed,
like you did this time.

753
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:55,993
But

754
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,062
unlike when you were young,

755
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,065
getting a regular job at a company
doesn't guarantee anything.

756
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,635
In that case, taking this chance
may have its risks,

757
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,337
but I think it's worth a try.

758
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:11,108
Of course, I don't expect everything
to be smooth sailing.

759
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,043
But

760
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,846
this bathhouse taught me…

761
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,282
SHOFUKUYU

762
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,618
As long as you're alive,
bad things will happen.

763
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,788
But when you soak in a big bathtub,

764
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,424
you will miraculously feel refreshed.

765
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,894
It makes your troubles seem small.

766
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,900
I don't want
this beautiful bathhouse culture,

767
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,203
this treasure that
Grandpa has been protecting,

768
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,238
to come to an end

769
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,873
without me even trying.

770
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,509
So please…

771
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,845
You don't have to support me,

772
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,113
but will you please

773
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,615
just watch how things go?

774
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,919
Please.

775
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,462
Well said!

776
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:06,430
Mao!

777
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,399
I'll invest.

778
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:16,874
Dear?

779
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,110
This plan…

780
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,647
I can tell you are serious about this,
in your own way.

781
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,486
I'm sorry for calling it "pretend."

782
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,823
Thank you!

783
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,494
I should be

784
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,264
the one thanking you.

785
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:44,001
I guess you take after
Grandpa's stubbornness.

786
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,938
That's a good thing.

787
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,007
You dummy!

788
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,648
SHOFUKUYU

789
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:01,151
-Shofukuyu? They had a renovation?
-Yes.

790
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,487
It's Sensei's favorite bathhouse.

791
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,990
I don't care about him.

792
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,325
Um…

793
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,461
Would you

794
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,596
go out to eat with me?

795
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,532
Don't get the wrong idea.

796
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:17,334
I just want to talk to you about
nutrition management.

797
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,270
-I'd love to.
-Great.

798
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,073
Um…

799
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,314
Ms. Reiko Mitomi!

800
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,817
Why don't you choose me?

801
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:38,088
I can welcome you as my personal trainer

802
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,958
or as a member of my office staff.

803
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,595
You can quit your job

804
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,030
at Haie's place.

805
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,600
I don't need

806
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,802
an answer right away.

807
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:53,504
Please,

808
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:55,806
think about it.

809
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,146
Almost… got it.

810
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,914
There.

811
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,082
SWEET SHOP

812
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,116
It's done. How is it?

813
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:09,853
How are things over there?

814
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,021
What do you think?

815
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,257
-Wow! That's cute.
-You like it?

816
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,025
-Yeah. This is great.
-Mao.

817
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,126
Where do I put this?

818
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,828
On that wall.

819
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,432
-Sorry for making you work too. Thank you.
-No worries.

820
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:22,633
I'll treat you to a beer.

821
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,301
Thanks!

822
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,103
Are you okay? To the left!

823
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,806
-To the right.
-Okay.

824
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,241
There.

825
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:45,189
Big baths
nurture big hearts too, don't they?

826
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,127
I can't wait to drink a beer after this.

827
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,831
This feels amazing.

828
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,104
Looks like you're in good spirits, Hyena.

829
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,573
K… Kanayama?

830
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,674
Calm down.

831
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,143
Here, I'm just a regular civilian.

832
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:07,811
Oh really?

833
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,581
I've been indebted to Grandpa Ken
since I was young.

834
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,150
I heard that you saved this bathhouse,
and for that

835
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,051
I'm thankful.

836
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:17,321
Is that right? I don't quite follow but…

837
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:18,689
Excuse me.

838
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,067
I'll have a beer next time.

839
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,605
The one who contributed the most

840
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,374
just bolted.

841
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,179
<i>There’s no way he has</i>
<i>illegitimate children.</i>

842
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:43,213
<i>My do-over has just begun.</i>

843
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,015
"Journalism" my ass.

844
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:46,050
