00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:07,907
FUNERAL VENUE FOR IMAHATA NINZABURO

2
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,702
Unbelievable…

3
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,705
Look at him scarfing down food at a wake.

4
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,975
To think that we won't be able to read

5
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,110
his novels anymore…

6
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,780
No words can express my sadness.

7
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,482
But he has left us with
countless masterpieces.

8
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,053
And I am so grateful for that.

9
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,323
<i>May his soul rest in peace.</i>

10
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,141
-Um…
-Let me take that for you.

11
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,343
Sorry, but I'm still eating.

12
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,348
-Can I get a refill?
-Of course.

13
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,950
-Thank you.
-Um…

14
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,420
Excuse me,
but how do you know the deceased?

15
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,990
Me? You're asking me?

16
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,828
Actually, my ex-girlfriend and I were
in the wine club

17
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,663
that Mr. Imahata organized.

18
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,433
The cellar in his home
was filled with precious wines,

19
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,202
which he generously shared with us.

20
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,603
My ex-girlfriend

21
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,905
used to always get rowdy
when she got drunk,

22
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,908
but he would always
handle the situation calmly.

23
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,977
He was a wonderful person

24
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,779
with a very big heart.

25
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,182
This happened all too soon…

26
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,787
I wanted to drink more wine with him!

27
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,091
Um…

28
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,927
Would you mind exchanging business cards?

29
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:12,432
I am Sakuraba, Imahata's secretary.

30
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,535
Thank you very much.
I'll get mine right now…

31
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,871
Let's see…

32
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:26,012
Why don't you go over there
and take your time looking for it?

33
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,380
Over here, please.

34
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,682
-Ah!
-Oh, that reminds me.

35
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,452
I think I put it in here.

36
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,656
What? Where did it go?

37
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,994
Oh, it was here.

38
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:46,299
I am Haie Nao, an inheritance detective.

39
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,381
-<i>It's fake.</i>
-<i>Is there a will</i>

40
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,649
<i>or not?</i>

41
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,752
I won't allow you to get involved
in the inheritance.

42
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,955
<i>Mr. Imahata, I won't let</i>
<i>your inheritance be dishonored.</i>

43
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,793
This is so delicious, I can't stop eating.

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,062
"Inheritance detective"?

45
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,132
-Yes?
-Well…

46
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,670
Did someone from the family call you here?

47
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,171
No.

48
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,441
I am here today,
as nothing but his wine buddy.

49
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,943
I see…

50
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:31,778
Um…

51
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,182
There are more guests coming in,
so maybe it's time for you to…

52
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,953
That reminds me. Where is his usual maid?

53
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,789
I believe her name was Ms. Shimojima.

54
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,693
Pardon me.

55
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,529
Do we still have Iberico pork?

56
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,465
-Yes. Shall I bring some out?
-Yeah.

57
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:56,102
<i>He was always mild when speaking</i>
<i>to Ms. Shimojima too.</i>

58
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,706
She is in charge of taking care of
his house today.

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,241
Oh!

60
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:06,279
I believe the main character in one of
his novels was named Sakurada Shinji.

61
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,148
Was he perhaps modeled on you?

62
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,120
Mr. Sakuraba.

63
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,890
-Ms. Ichika is asking for you.
-I'll be there.

64
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,926
I believe it's time for you to leave.

65
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,463
I'm sorry, but this wine is just too good.

66
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,665
It's a Burgundy Pinot noir, right?

67
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,368
It's his favorite "La Rose," right?

68
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,004
Just as I thought.

69
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,508
I can't get enough of this deep aroma.

70
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,144
I am glad you appreciate it.

71
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,080
He had ordered them himself.

72
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,448
They're the favors as well.

73
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,117
What!

74
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,388
That's the man that I know.

75
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,290
He is so classy.

76
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,061
Sakuraba! Hurry!

77
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,829
Yes, I'll be right there!

78
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,632
Well then, excuse me.

79
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,041
<i>You're a fortunate man to be able to drink</i>

80
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,176
such precious wines at any time.

81
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,212
Is that how I appear to you?

82
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,123
Where did <i>Sensei</i> go?

83
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:31,264
He just slipped out the door saying that
he was going to buy coffee beans,

84
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,433
and now he won't even pick up his phone.

85
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,369
We have to write up the report by today

86
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,404
or we won't get paid again,

87
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,773
and we'll be chased by
debt collectors again.

88
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,409
And my paycheck is yet again…

89
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,347
I'm supposed to be paid
on the 25th of every month,

90
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,681
but it's only happened once!

91
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,021
HAIE'S ASSISTANT, MEDICAL STUDENT ON BREAK
MITOMI REIKO

92
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,658
He's an unmatched genius when it comes to
dealing with inheritance,

93
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:02,595
but why does he have to be so poor?

94
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,531
Are you stupid?

95
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,668
Why are you passing out wine
that costs 50,000 yen per bottle?

96
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,737
You're giving it as the favors too?

97
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,005
-How much is the total cost?
-However.

98
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,974
This was his wish--

99
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,977
The cost is coming out of
the Imahata family's pocket.

100
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,314
It's coming from his company funds…

101
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,648
Oh really now?

102
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,250
Oh?

103
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,786
It's nothing compared to the fortune

104
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,287
you squander away, Ichika.

105
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:32,859
Ever since you were in school,
you've spent money like it grows on trees.

106
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,261
You even made Father
pay off the debt that you

107
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,530
incurred from the company
you started for fun.

108
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,967
Futaba, you made father pay
for all your living expenses

109
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,002
ever since you got divorced.

110
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,838
You say it's for your children's tuition,

111
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,942
but you're using it for yourself.
You're just a parasite.

112
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,377
Excuse me?

113
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm sorry I'm late.

114
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,716
There was some trouble
with the airplane in Paris.

115
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,851
Here comes
the biggest parasite of them all.

116
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,156
You made him pay for your music school
and even an apartment in Paris.

117
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,893
I had no choice.
I'm still a student, after all.

118
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,528
A music student who is

119
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,263
over 30 with no prospects

120
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,231
is nothing but a freeloader.

121
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,935
We'll have to deduct that
from your inheritance

122
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:16,836
or it's not fair.

123
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,505
<i>Mr. Imahata's inheritors</i>

124
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,474
-We must do something about the company.
-<i>are these three daughters.</i>

125
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,743
Let's get the inheritance paperwork

126
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,911
over with quickly.

127
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:29,115
If you insist… I understand.

128
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,618
There is something I need you to see.

129
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,320
This way, please.

130
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,198
This is his office at home.

131
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:48,734
I thought he was
in the hospital the whole time.

132
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,370
He would sometimes return to his home

133
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,573
for a change of pace.

134
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,377
<i>Today is September 10th, 2024.</i>

135
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,414
<i>I…</i>

136
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,517
<i>have terminal cancer</i>

137
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,654
<i>and don't have much time to live.</i>

138
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,725
<i>Before I die,</i>

139
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,729
<i>I am recording this video</i>

140
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,534
<i>to clearly leave a message about my assets</i>

141
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:25,638
<i>so that nobody can forge</i>
<i>a will or anything</i>

142
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,807
<i>of that sort.</i>

143
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,477
<i>Now then…</i>

144
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,515
<i>This is how I am dividing my inheritance.</i>

145
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,590
<i>All of my assets</i>

146
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,660
<i>will go</i>

147
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,564
<i>to the one who took care of everything</i>

148
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,068
<i>for me in my old age, my secretary,</i>

149
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,706
<i>Sakuraba Shinichi.</i>

150
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,310
<i>He will inherit it all.</i>

151
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,383
Wh… What?

152
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,184
What is going on?

153
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,221
Sakuraba! Did you force him to do this?

154
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,424
What are you talking about?

155
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,927
<i>My eldest daughter, Ichika,</i>

156
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:25,932
<i>was receiving</i>
<i>three million yen per month from me</i>

157
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,168
<i>as living expenses.</i>

158
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,004
<i>But while I was hospitalized,</i>

159
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,507
<i>she did not visit me</i>

160
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,342
<i>even once.</i>

161
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,346
<i>My second daughter, Futaba,</i>

162
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,348
<i>has already received</i>

163
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,150
<i>my villa in Chiba.</i>

164
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,686
<i>By the way,</i>

165
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,357
<i>Futaba did not visit me</i>
<i>a single time either.</i>

166
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,926
<i>My third daughter, Miki,</i>

167
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:57,163
<i>has already received</i>
<i>a Stradivarius from me.</i>

168
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:03,469
<i>By the way, Miki did not visit me</i>
<i>a single time either.</i>

169
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,739
<i>The three of them</i>

170
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,709
<i>received more than enough</i>

171
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,277
<i>of my assets</i>

172
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,879
<i>while I was alive.</i>

173
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,849
<i>That is my reason.</i>

174
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,552
What?

175
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,521
I don't need that villa in Chiba!

176
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,758
More like, S…

177
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,094
Stradivarius? What is that?!

178
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,263
More importantly,
what happens to my living expenses?

179
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,733
You can sell that violin for millions.

180
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,134
What about me?

181
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,403
I don't get anything at all?

182
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,942
Oops, sorry.

183
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,177
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

184
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,779
Detective…

185
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,181
You were still here?

186
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,120
Excuse me, but why are you here?

187
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,321
Detective?

188
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,225
Wait, was he just secretly filming us?

189
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,960
-What?
-Excuse me?

190
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,395
Oh, I'm sorry.

191
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,796
He was so good to me

192
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,564
when he was alive, but I never

193
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,299
got the chance to take a photo of him.

194
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,869
Of course, I won't misuse it.

195
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,671
HAIE INHERITANCE INVESTIGATION OFFICE

196
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,873
A detective, huh?

197
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,748
In that case, I have a request.

198
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:26,285
First, promise me that you will not
publicize that video.

199
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,088
Of course, I promise.

200
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,690
Well then,

201
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,626
I would like your opinion
on that video of my father

202
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,428
speaking about the inheritance.

203
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,466
My opinion, my opinion…

204
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,670
Well, if there was anything suspicious…

205
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:45,838
There isn't.

206
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,874
Sakuraba, you stay quiet.
I'm asking the detective.

207
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,510
Mr. Haie, don't worry,
I will pay for your services.

208
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,947
Oh, this won't cost a thing.

209
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,750
All of you probably
noticed it already anyway.

210
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:03,155
-This part.
-<i>Sakuraba Shinichi.</i>

211
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,858
-<i>He will inherit it all.</i>
-You see?

212
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,626
Look at his eye movement.

213
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,629
By the way, when people speak
using their own words,

214
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,198
they don't move their eyes so much.

215
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,134
If anything,
they look to the upper left corner

216
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,970
when searching for the right words.
However,

217
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,374
his eyes are slowly moving from
the upper right to bottom right.

218
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,178
That's because he is reading a cue card
that's next to the camera.

219
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,281
Or he is being forced to read it.

220
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,684
That is a possibility.

221
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,555
Thank you.

222
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,325
Mr. Haie, I will contact you later.

223
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,994
Please keep this between us.

224
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,499
This room is only for family.

225
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:47,466
Please leave.

226
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,568
Sorry.

227
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,404
I will leave once I finish this wine.

228
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,408
Does he even know anything about wine?

229
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,785
I feel like La Rose, the wine that

230
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,622
he loved so much,
is trying to tell me something.

231
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,497
Sakuraba.

232
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,901
Who is to say you didn't
force him to read that?

233
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,136
What are you saying?

234
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,173
Why would he even listen to

235
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,874
what I say?

236
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,343
Must be tough…

237
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,914
The word for "inheritance" is sometimes

238
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,717
spelled with the characters meaning,
"a fighting clan."

239
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,553
It always leads to conflict.

240
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,329
I'm back.

241
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,937
Don't scare me, Reiko.

242
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,539
Where in the world were you… ugh!

243
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,441
You reek of alcohol!

244
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,009
You don't have time to be drinking.

245
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,278
We have to submit our reports
for last month by today

246
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,646
or we have to pay compensation.

247
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,749
Do you think we have the money
to pay for that?

248
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,219
Don't tell me…

249
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,255
-You're going to keep drinking?
-Yeah, yeah.

250
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,991
Hey, are you listening to me?

251
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,493
First of all,

252
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,095
whose wake was it?

253
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,800
Imahata Ninzaburo?

254
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,702
That famous mystery author?

255
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,738
Why didn't you take me with you?

256
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,707
More like,

257
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,509
can't you at least pick up your phone?
I was worried

258
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,144
that you were in an accident.

259
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,251
Mr. Tomonaga, when did you get here?

260
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,151
FORMER TOP FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR
TOMONAGA HIDEKI

261
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,354
-I was here the whole time…
-Huh?

262
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,991
Huh? I can't hear what you're saying.

263
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,125
I said…

264
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,561
-Huh?
-I was there the whole time.

265
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,563
Please stop saying meaningless things

266
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,965
in such a soft whisper.

267
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,036
What is it now?

268
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,438
The wine I got as a favor
tastes different!

269
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,843
The label says "La Rose,"

270
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,844
but it's fake.

271
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,379
Fake?

272
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,383
When he was alive, Mr. Imahata said
he would generously give out

273
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,785
his favorite Burgundy wine, La Rose,
at his wake

274
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,887
and give them as favors as well.

275
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,058
What is going on?

276
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,773
La Rose is a rare wine.

277
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,908
So the label is obviously applied by hand.

278
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,877
Which means the maker's fingerprints

279
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,578
should be all over it.

280
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,114
As expected from the former MPD's
top forensic investigator.

281
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,049
You're so fast!

282
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,017
Is he that great? He's just

283
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,953
a money-grubber
who moved to a private company

284
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,221
because he wasn't getting paid enough.

285
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,824
My personal research
just costs a lot of money.

286
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,928
More like, why don't you diss me
after you pay off your debt to me?

287
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,099
Under the forensic light,

288
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,901
there are barely any fingerprints.

289
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,305
We can conclude that this label was
automatically placed

290
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,907
by a mass production machine.

291
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,241
Which means,

292
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,211
it is a poorly-made fake wine.

293
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,853
It's probably worth 5,000 yen.

294
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,888
Who knows if it was intentional

295
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,024
or if they were tricked by their supplier.

296
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,727
You only enunciate
when it's something important.

297
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,195
MS. REIKO SAYS A LOT OF USELESS THINGS

298
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,896
I can't hear, so I'll ignore that.

299
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,932
Someone,

300
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,635
or maybe he himself, chose a fake wine.

301
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:44,970
And someone,

302
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,141
or maybe he himself,
left a video as his will.

303
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,378
A video will?

304
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,447
Would a professional mystery writer
do something like that?

305
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,816
<i>…to clearly leave a message…</i>

306
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,786
<i>Would a professional mystery writer…</i>

307
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,957
I see!

308
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,192
So that's why it was a video?

309
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,928
Something that seems meaningless at first

310
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,897
can actually be important.

311
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:14,665
Reiko.

312
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,337
I'm sorry, but can I ask you
to run some errands?

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,698
MESSAGE FROM REIKO

315
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,805
Reiko is amazing, as always.

316
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,340
What a capable med student.

317
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,623
I see.
Things are starting to get interesting.

318
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,128
Coffee beans…

319
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,798
He must really be invested in this.

320
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,601
Well then, later.

321
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,571
The mystery around the favors

322
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,973
might've been according to his wish.

323
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,845
It didn't go unnoticed by me.

324
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,648
Mr. Imahata,

325
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,052
I won't let
your inheritance be dishonored.

As usual, here comes the Hyena.

328
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,630
Oops, I mean Haie.

00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,531
LAWYER FUKUSHI HARUKA

330
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,434
I won't allow you to get involved
in the Imahata family's

331
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,335
inheritance.

332
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,072
Well, if it isn't Attorney Fukushi.
What right do you have?

333
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,373
Excuse me?

334
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,309
You're just a de facto unlicensed lawyer.

335
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,614
A de facto unlicensed lawyer?

336
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,483
That's right. Haie used to be a lawyer,

337
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,052
but he embezzled
an elderly person's fortune

338
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,055
and was shunned by the legal community.
He's a scumbag.

339
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,056
A scumbag?

340
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,826
-My goodness…
-Scumbag…

341
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,463
He's apparently a detective now,
specializing in inheritance.

342
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,767
He is literally like a hyena
who sniffs out dead bodies

343
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,269
and comes to devour them.

344
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,806
And I heard…

345
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,143
you watched the video will?

346
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,548
Then why didn't you point out
the most important thing?

347
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,753
Video wills are legally invalid.

348
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,556
Any lawyer should know that.

349
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,824
What did you say?!

350
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,359
That isn't valid?

351
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,897
-That's a good thing!
-Yeah!

352
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,499
In that case,

353
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,268
is there a will or not?

354
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,103
An official will

355
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,906
was entrusted to me, his legal adviser.

356
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,577
We don't need a hyena around. Get out.

357
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,514
Well then, we will leave the rest

358
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,249
to Attorney Fukushi.

359
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,585
So, Mr. Hyena, you can leave now.

360
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,691
But the thing is,

361
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,161
I can't just leave.

362
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,029
I mean, you haven't even

363
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,332
noticed what's hidden in that video.

364
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,133
No.

365
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,436
Nobody cares about that video.

366
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,072
The real will

367
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,374
is here.

368
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,644
-So that's the real one?
-Haie.

369
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,280
Outsiders can shoo-shoo.

370
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,248
No.

371
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,217
Let's have him be a witness as well.

372
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,353
He's the one who pointed out that

373
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,355
Father might've been forced to read it.

374
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,223
He might be useful.

375
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,905
"All of my assets

376
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,575
will go to the one
who took care of everything

377
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,378
for me in my old age, my secretary,
Sakuraba Shinichi."

378
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,381
-It's the same thing!
-It's the same thing!

379
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,083
"My eldest daughter, Ichika, was receiving

380
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,953
three million yen per month
from me as living expenses.

381
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,524
But while I was hospitalized,
she did not visit me even once.

382
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,892
My second daughter, Futaba,

383
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,627
has already received

384
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,663
my villa in Chiba.

385
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,197
By the way,

386
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,633
Futaba did not visit me
a single time either.

387
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,368
The three of them have received…"

388
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,703
And that is all.

389
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,039
It has met the requirements
to be considered

390
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:50,175
a holographic will,
which is a type of will.

391
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,877
This will is legitimate.

392
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:52,878
REQUIREMENTS FOR HOLOGRAPHIC WILLS
1. MUST BE HAND-WRITTEN, 2. MUST HAVE DATE

393
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,012
3. MUST HAVE NAME WRITTEN ON IT
4. MUST HAVE SEAL AFFIXED TO IT

394
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,448
It's the exact same thing as the video.

395
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,885
You made him write this too, Sakuraba?

396
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,253
How horrible!

397
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,521
Father can't rest in peace!

398
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,657
What… You're saying that
I made him write that?

399
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,825
I would never!

400
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,195
Attorney Fukushi, please help us.

401
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,697
-Please!
-Please.

402
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:12,597
Oh?

403
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,133
Don't tell me that's written
with a ballpoint pen.

404
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,136
WILL

405
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,671
ALL OF MY ASSETS

406
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:23,508
-So what?
-Not the fountain pen he always uses?

407
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,281
Maybe he didn't want it to smudge.

408
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,586
I guess a popular lawyer like you
who's busy making TV appearances

409
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,255
doesn't have the time to notice
important details.

410
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,658
What's with the sarcasm?

411
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:45,764
I'm telling you,
that Mr. Imahata was well aware

412
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,600
of the fact that video wills
are not valid.

413
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,435
-What?
-What?

414
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,804
And yet,

415
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:57,008
he still left behind a video
repeating the same thing as his will.

416
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,511
<i>He is trying to say something important.</i>

417
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,414
I mean,
he's a great mystery writer, after all.

418
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:03,982
And the truth is,

419
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,652
it comes out in a line from his novel.

420
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,821
I brought it just in case.

421
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,091
Here it is. Right here.

422
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,994
VIDEO WILLS ARE "INVALID"

423
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,299
-You're right.
-So what?

424
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,201
That reminds me,
he also modeled characters

425
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,736
after you three as well.

426
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:28,106
Icchan, Fuchan, Miitan.

427
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,476
<i>The Three Bumbling Detective Sisters.</i>

428
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,311
One of Mr. Imahata's greatest hits.

429
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,547
<i>THE THREE BUMBLING DETECTIVE SISTERS</i>

430
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,449
Don't remind us of that.

431
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,585
I was bullied at school because of that.

432
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,354
Miki even had to transfer schools.

433
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,458
Our father ruined our lives

434
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,226
like it was nothing.

435
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:53,031
That's why we deserve the inheritance.

436
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,634
We're his biggest victims, after all.

437
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,304
In that sense, there is another

438
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,807
victim who deserves something too then.

439
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:03,742
Right here.

440
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,045
-Huh?
-Huh?

441
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:07,946
What do you mean?

442
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:11,283
What are you trying to say?

443
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,452
This is all irrelevant.

444
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,954
Well, you see,
none of you read his novels,

445
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,523
so you might not know,

446
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,091
but Mr. Imahata

447
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,093
got out of his slump with his popular

448
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,795
<i>SM Detective Couple</i> series.

449
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,163
And the main character was modeled

450
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:26,965
after Mr. Sakuraba.

451
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,568
<i>SM DETECTIVE COUPLE</i>

452
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,569
SM?

453
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,505
Sakuraba,
you were into that kind of stuff?

454
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,242
I can't even imagine
what you went through.

455
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,313
You were a victim too, huh?

456
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:43,715
Mr. Haie,

457
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,818
it's just as you said.

458
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,387
<i>The main character, Sakurada Shinji,</i>

459
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,156
was modeled on me.

460
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,457
I knew it.

461
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,828
He can't drink wine either, just like you.

462
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,465
At the time, when that novel was released,

463
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,800
life was hell.

464
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,136
My wife divorced me

465
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,739
and my kids turned their backs on me.

466
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,342
But

467
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,311
who cares about that?

468
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,580
Unlike

469
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:19,417
his daughters, I love his works.

470
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,621
I've always admired him.

471
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,589
You wouldn't understand.

472
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,592
The euphoria that you feel when you see

473
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,628
yourself as an actual character.

474
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,465
The fact that you are
living inside a universe

475
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,767
created by your favorite author.

476
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,003
When I look back,

477
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,772
I can say that

478
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,375
it was all worth it.

479
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,313
Well then, good for you.

480
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,350
You don't need

481
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,252
the entire inheritance, right?

482
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,220
However,

483
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,489
to me,

484
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,624
his words

485
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,360
are absolute.

486
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,199
So you are trying to say that
there is no way

487
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,101
that you would threaten Mr. Imahata

488
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,139
to write that will or film him reading it?

489
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,107
Of course.

490
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:19,377
There is no way I would threaten him.

491
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,745
Haie,

492
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,581
will you stop pestering him?

493
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,416
Do you even have

494
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,851
proof that Mr. Sakuraba threatened him

495
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,520
in that video?

496
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:33,758
Oh, excuse me.

497
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,062
SENSEI, IT'S CONFIRMED

498
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,030
THERE'S PROOF?

499
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,732
OF COURSE…

500
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,850
I do have proof,

501
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,552
of course.

502
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,797
The funeral is starting soon.

503
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,499
Oh, it won't take too long.

504
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,534
My goodness…

505
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,104
It is cleaned very well.

506
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,740
Ms. Shimojima really is amazing.

507
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,909
Mr. Imahata

508
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,912
was sitting here.

509
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,319
As I thought, Mr. Imahata's
hand placement isn't normal.

510
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:38,089
He was unnaturally
trying to show the top of his arm.

511
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,459
To show the wounds he had around here.

512
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,228
-Wounds?
-Yes.

513
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,529
Defense wounds.

514
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,399
Unique wounds
that you receive when you're attacked.

515
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:51,102
It might be that Mr. Imahata
was being abused

516
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,338
by his caretaker.

517
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,476
Wasn't Mr. Imahata

518
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:01,846
trying to inform us through that video?

519
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,682
That's ridiculous.

520
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:08,253
What a wild accusation. Around the time
we took the video, he tripped a lot.

521
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,487
That's when he got injured.

522
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,356
This is why this scumbag was

523
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,058
shut out from the legal community.

524
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:17,929
First of all, there were no reports
of abuse on his death certificate.

525
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,732
Mr. Imahata was
thought to have been experiencing

526
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,101
delirium because of his pancreatic cancer.

527
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,737
There was a possibility
that he would forget,

528
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:26,771
and that's why

529
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,140
he left the same will in a video.

530
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:33,578
Mr. Sakuraba just did
as he was told by Mr. Imahata.

531
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,780
That is right.

532
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:36,815
Haie.

533
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,719
I can't believe you had the balls
to call this "proof."

534
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,925
Oh, here it comes.

535
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:50,228
The sound of
a four-stroke four-valve DOHC engine!

536
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,446
Sorry we're late.

537
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,852
These are my assistants,
Mitomi and Tomonaga.

538
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:14,986
S'up.

539
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:15,987
So casual…

540
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,123
How dare you call me an assistant.

541
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:23,728
She is a student at
the Kyoto Medical and Dental University.

542
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,363
Although, she's on break right now.

543
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,264
Hello.

544
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,367
I felt bad about it,
but I took the liberty

545
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,103
of examining
Mr. Imahata's body last night.

546
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,905
And that is where

547
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,407
I found proof.

548
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,980
FUNERAL VENUE FOR IMAHATA NINZABURO

549
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,184
Please don't haunt me.

550
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,590
Other than his wounds here,
we unfortunately found…

551
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,394
Several straight bruises on
his upper arm and shin that look like

552
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,829
they were made by a stick.

553
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,431
He has many old injuries as well,
so I can't say for certain,

554
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,168
but these cannot all result from
just tripping.

555
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,602
What…

556
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,505
Which means, he was abused.

557
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,808
You should get it checked officially.

558
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,744
There is no need.
The death certificate is already done.

559
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,780
A med student's opinion isn't any

560
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:16,781
different from a layman's.

561
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:21,286
Too bad Japan doesn't do autopsies
unless it's an unnatural death.

562
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:24,155
I'm sure you're trying to
nullify the will by

563
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,524
claiming that he was threatened.

564
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,360
But with such little evidence,
can you even prove

565
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,829
who he was threatened by?

566
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:35,266
These wounds which are
thought to be sustained by a hard stick…

567
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,302
Judging from its angle,

568
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,637
he was attacked with a stick from above

569
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:41,906
by a left-handed person.

570
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:53,218
He has his watch on his right arm.

571
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,554
I see that Mr. Sakuraba is left-handed.

572
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,857
Well, well, well…

573
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,892
That is just an assumption.

574
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,861
10% of humans are left-handed.

575
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,562
You mean, only 10%.

576
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,298
As expected of a lawyer,
you're good at making excuses.

577
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,400
To protect your master,
you'd say black is white.

578
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,902
What an exemplary dog.

579
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,905
What's important is whether anyone
near Mr. Imahata is left-handed.

580
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,541
You're the one who is
trying to make excuses!

581
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,811
First of all, I cared about Mr. Imahata
more than my own family.

582
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,213
I would never be able to
hit him with a cane!

583
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,448
A cane?

584
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,384
Who said anything about a cane?

585
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,554
You said cane…

586
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,357
They only said, "hard stick."

587
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,194
It was a slip of the tongue.

588
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,930
All right! Now let's try to remember

589
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,199
his eye movements.

590
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,936
While he was being forced
to read the cue card,

591
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,505
he sometimes looked elsewhere.

592
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,809
Oh!

593
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,947
My goodness, though.
Ms. Shimojima is amazing.

594
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,083
She is such a professional maid.

595
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,752
Not a single trace of dust.

596
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,889
Sakuraba, he had a maid?

597
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:06,724
<i>Yes.</i>

598
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,228
-Mr. Haie, what are you trying to say?
-Whoa!

599
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:14,465
Can you believe?
I just found this in here.

600
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:15,566
-What!
-What!

601
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:16,834
What!

602
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,973
Let's inspect this carefully

603
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,309
in front of everyone who is involved.

604
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:31,749
This is Shimojima Miyoko,
whom we mentioned.

605
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,484
Who?

606
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,220
After his wife passed away,

607
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,223
she took care of him daily.

608
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:43,061
I assumed you did everything for him.

609
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,162
But I guess not.

610
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:45,830
Anyway,

611
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:49,000
now everyone involved with
the Imahata family has assembled.

612
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,002
Even Attorney Fukushi,
the legal adviser, is here.

613
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,704
Legally, we're all set.

614
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,173
She has nothing to do with this.
She's just a maid--

615
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,742
Who cares?!
Just hurry up and check the will.

616
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,911
We won't make it to the funeral.

617
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,447
Well then, I will read it.

618
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,716
"My will is as follows.

619
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:09,387
Ichika, Futaba, Miki
will not receive a single yen.

620
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,724
Of course, my secretary Sakuraba
will not receive a single yen.

621
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,561
I will leave 100 million yen to
Shimojima Miyoko,

622
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,964
who took care of me
for the past eight years.

623
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,600
The rest of my entire fortune will be

624
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,136
donated to the Ainston Foundation,

625
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,273
a foundation that is building
vineyards and wineries in

626
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,842
impoverished nations like South Sudan

627
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,511
to improve living standards."

628
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,813
-Entire fortune?
-No way!

629
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:39,050
That's ridiculous! She's just a maid!

630
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,519
How did you trick him into doing this!

631
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,591
Excuse me.

632
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,293
This will is ridiculous!

633
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,194
That's right!

634
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:53,031
Well, inheritances
usually end up like this.

635
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,265
-Huh?
-Huh?

636
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,400
How irresponsible.

637
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,603
Mr. Imahata earned this money himself
when he was alive.

638
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,171
So he chooses how to use it.

639
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,472
That's all.

640
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,976
Well then, Mr. Lawyer.

641
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,344
Take care of the rest.

642
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,179
-Take care of it.
-Thank you.

643
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,690
Wait! They were written on the same day.

644
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:22,994
That's right. The date is the same.

645
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,330
But legally, the most recent will holds

646
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,364
the most power.

647
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:32,036
Then this must be the most recent will.

648
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,571
Ladies,

649
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,741
if you confirm this one as valid,
I'll split it four ways.

650
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,510
We should take up his offer

651
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,646
and get at least a quarter
of the inheritance.

652
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:42,813
That's right. We can't let

653
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,449
some maid take it all!

654
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:47,085
There is no way I am leaving Paris.

655
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,987
Fine. Let's do that.

656
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,224
If the surviving family members
are in agreement,

657
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,659
why don't we keep the original will?

658
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,963
I agree too.

659
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,398
Of course.

660
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,933
I already told you!

661
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:07,438
This inheritance is money that
Mr. Imahata earned.

662
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:12,243
I will not allow anyone
to dishonor his inheritance.

663
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,482
By the way,

664
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,350
Mr. Imahata already knew that

665
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,352
something like this would happen.

666
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,187
Excuse me…

667
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,322
What?

668
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,127
When you shine a light on this…

669
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,429
Let's see what appears.

670
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,700
This is the one that says
everything will go to Mr. Sakuraba.

671
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:39,570
Why did he write it with a ballpoint pen,
when he always uses a fountain pen?

672
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,938
Like I said…

673
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,039
-Oh!
-Oh!

674
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,646
After using a ballpoint pen to write

675
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,649
a will that gives everything
to Mr. Sakuraba, he used

676
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,017
the paper underneath

677
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,753
to write a will leaving
100 million to Ms. Shimojima.

678
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,021
This is the proof.

679
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,445
Go get a professional analysis
for more details.

680
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,713
In other words,

681
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:26,184
this will that we just found here

682
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,119
is Mr. Imahata's

683
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,654
final wish.

684
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:34,025
We know that because Mr. Imahata had left

685
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,427
this voice recording.

686
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:41,699
<i>He went around telling everyone that I am</i>

687
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,000
<i>going senile</i>

688
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:46,737
<i>and before I knew it, I was isolated.</i>

689
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,473
<i>That is why I cannot go against</i>

690
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,109
<i>what Sakuraba Shinichi tells me to do.</i>

691
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:55,012
<i>I will think of what I can do</i>

692
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,783
<i>for Ms. Shimojima Miyoko.</i>

693
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,552
<i>I appreciate everything she did.</i>

694
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,289
Do you understand now?

695
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,558
All of this is so sudden…

696
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,930
Damn it!

697
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,434
Damn that man!
Until the very end, he was such a…

698
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,739
Why do you think I have been
working for him all these years?!

699
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,750
I will put these files here for you.

700
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:39,991
So, where will Mr. and Mrs. Sakurada

701
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,993
have their next SM session?

702
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,765
No more of the <i>SM Detective Couple</i> series.

703
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,166
Huh?

704
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,936
Who knew I would regain this feeling.

705
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,171
I can almost forget about my illness.

706
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:55,806
Um…

707
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,175
What do you mean, "No more"?

708
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,579
I've thought up of a great idea.

709
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,115
I can't stop writing.

710
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,784
What about the next story for

711
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:07,885
<i>SM Detective Couple?</i>

712
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,387
That's over.

713
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,024
Why?

714
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,459
I got tired of it.

715
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,930
Both the readers and I are
looking for something

716
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,465
new and exciting.

717
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:25,102
Just you wait. I am going to

718
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,338
take the world by storm again.

719
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,976
Dying will have to wait until after that.

720
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,115
What are you doing!

721
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,366
<i>No matter how much</i>
<i>you dedicate yourself to him,</i>

722
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,371
he only views

723
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,042
the people around him

724
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,480
as nothing but toys.

725
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,518
Mr. Sakuraba,

726
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:19,056
even if there is room
for some sort of sympathy,

727
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,993
Mr. Imahata has the right

728
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,995
to live his own life.

729
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,965
The fact that you deprived him of that

730
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,035
is unforgivable.

731
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,971
But

732
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,873
at the same time,

733
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,376
you still have a long time to live.

734
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,111
From now on, try to

735
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,079
live your own life.

736
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,288
You will

737
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,458
understand one day.

738
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,635
So bitter…

739
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,455
By the way, I became

740
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,190
his fan after reading this.

741
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:29,894
Goodbye.

742
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,399
<i>THE THREE BUMBLING DETECTIVE SISTERS</i>

743
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,634
EVERY CASE TURNS INTO CHAOS?!

744
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:43,541
Now that I think about it,
he's always put us

745
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,709
through tests since we were little.

746
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,745
Like how he'd make us decode pin numbers.

747
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,514
And find hidden keys.

748
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:54,418
I remember not being able to
get inside the house.

749
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,555
Maybe he was

750
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,324
trying to teach us to stand

751
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,659
on our own two feet.

752
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:07,932
Through that will…

753
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:18,309
And so, a few housekeepers and I

754
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,910
are talking about

755
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,612
starting our own company.

756
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,547
But we're all new to this,

757
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,549
so if you could help…

758
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,552
If I do anything, people will think that

759
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,387
I'm illegally giving you legal advice.

760
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,623
So I can help you with anything
other than that.

761
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,958
Yes.

762
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:38,429
There's one more thing. Mr. Sakuraba

763
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,697
told me

764
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,601
to give this to you

765
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,369
if I ever saw you.

766
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,119
HYENA THE INHERITANCE DETECTIVE

767
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,121
Jeez!

768
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,756
<i>Hyena the Inheritance Detective.</i>

769
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,559
This story is
exactly what happened this time.

770
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,328
Authors are so good
at predicting the future.

771
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:14,298
"A gloomy man
who looked like the Grim Reaper"?

772
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,933
He's totally dissing me.

773
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,601
If this was the case,

774
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:20,037
I should've drank more of his
expensive wine.

775
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:23,140
No, he is also praising you.

776
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,209
"I knew that the mystery of the will

777
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,877
would be solved the moment

778
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,914
Hyena noticed that the wine was fake."

779
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,624
Mr. Imahata,

780
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,861
I already knew before that.

781
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:50,100
Why are you an "inheritance" detective?

782
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,872
Because I hate the phrase,
"Dead men tell no tales."

783
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:55,973
Oh…

784
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:17,094
I finally got my hands on it.
How do you like <i>kopi luwak?</i>

785
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:21,398
It's so rare to see
the real thing from Indonesia.

786
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:23,500
I can't get enough of this deep flavor.

787
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,136
Asian palm civet droppings.

788
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,739
Who would think the coffee beans
were taken from droppings?

789
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:32,576
But hardcore coffee lovers
just can't resist.

790
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,213
Will you sell me ten grams?

791
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,184
There is someone who I wish

792
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,219
could've tried this before they died.

793
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,661
HAIE FAMILY GRAVE

794
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:03,273
Who knew I would be invited
by you one day.

795
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,515
By the way, I heard you were outsmarted

796
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,184
by that punk Haie?

797
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,754
Do you know Haie?

798
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,903
Dad, I'll settle the score for you,

799
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,140
no matter what.

800
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,043
<i>She is a "black widow."</i>

801
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,210
<i>She is a monster.</i>

802
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,679
<i>It's her perfect modus operandi.</i>

803
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:42,880
So shitty.

804
