00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,773
<i>There was a confectioner in Kyoto</i>
<i>who was known</i>

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,109
<i>as a Living National Treasure</i>
<i>of the culinary world.</i>

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,478
<i>He was the fourth generation owner</i>
<i>of the famous</i>

5
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,279
<i>confectionery Houou.</i>

6
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,081
<i>That is Hyakumanben Koichi.</i>

7
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,851
<i>Mr. Koichi passed away suddenly</i>

8
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:21,054
<i>and left behind the oddest will.</i>

9
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:25,592
<i>He gave his legitimate son, Masaomi,</i>
<i>Houou's brand name and financial assets.</i>

00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:26,292
KOICHI'S MISTRESS' CHILD
MIYAKOSHI YASHIN

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,396
<i>He gave his mistress' son, Yashin,</i>
<i>his real estate,</i>

12
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,664
<i>including his confectionery workshop.</i>

13
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,001
<i>He purposely split up</i>
<i>the shop's name and substance.</i>

14
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,837
<i>But the world of business</i>
<i>is quite mysterious.</i>

15
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,040
<i>In just one month, things started to</i>

16
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,808
<i>take an unexpected turn.</i>

17
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,710
<i>Houou's genius craftsman, Yashin,</i>

18
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,112
<i>has a store that's not doing so well.</i>

19
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,849
<i>But people are lining up for Masaomi,</i>
<i>the "good-for-nothing rich boy."</i>

20
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:54,587
<i>What will happen to Houou and its</i>
<i>100 years of history and tradition?</i>

21
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,063
Is Ms. Reiko still in Kyoto?

22
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,332
Reiko

23
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:10,036
has her own set of problems
that are more complicated than Houou.

24
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,505
Mom.

25
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,041
I knew it was you…

26
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,612
You were in Kyoto?

27
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:26,986
Wait.

28
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,388
I want to talk.

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,376
<i>It turns out that Mr. Masaomi</i>
<i>wasn't just a playboy.</i>

30
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,444
Stop talking nonsense.

31
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,814
Why don't you try talking to your mother?

32
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,816
<i>Dad knew this would happen.</i>

33
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,985
<i>That's why he snatched the brand</i>
<i>away from me.</i>

HAIE INHERITANCE INVESTIGATION OFFICE

35
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,458
I am back.

36
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,927
Welcome back. How was it?

37
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:11,998
It's terrible.
Yashin is on a downward spiral.

38
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,833
Who knows what will happen.

39
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,369
If they go out of business,
I will resent you forever,

40
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,504
Mr. Haie.

41
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,839
How scary! He's suddenly speaking loudly.

42
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,809
So is Houou Bekkan doing the same?

43
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,145
It's smooth sailing for them.

44
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,546
As you can see…

45
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,781
From the moment they opened,
they've been very popular.

46
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,153
Go ahead and try them.

47
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,656
They have four stores,
including one in the Suzaku Oji Building

48
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,625
and even one in Osaka.

49
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,027
At the moment, each one is successful.

50
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,997
He opened this many branches

51
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:47,000
and achieved this much success
in such a short period of time.

52
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,835
I guess he had management skills.

53
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,971
But the thing is,
even though each branch is popular,

54
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,673
the flavor isn't that great.

55
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,545
He's purposely not using the name "Houou"
and instead,

56
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,080
calling them Houou Annex and Houou Bekkan.

57
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,550
I wonder what Mr. Masaomi is going to do

58
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,252
with the brand name "Houou"
that he was bequeathed?

59
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,388
I wonder if he has a plan?

60
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,689
Ms. Reiko,

61
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,760
you bought Yashin's confectioneries,
didn't you?

62
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,061
Yes, I did.

63
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:19,432
Even though you've never given me any.

64
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,351
It's so soft and subtly sweet.

65
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,986
Look at it a little more.

66
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,522
My tongue and stomach are saying,

67
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,723
"Thanks for the good food."

68
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,425
Mr. Haie, we don't need your comments.

69
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,760
Why are people not buying this
just because

70
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,362
it's not called Houou anymore?

71
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,465
That is how important a brand's name is.

72
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,502
This is for sure the work of a genius.

73
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,071
I agree.

74
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,105
And…

75
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,809
this one is from Mr. Masaomi's store.

76
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,751
Nothing special about it.

77
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,687
But when you're told
it's from Houou Bekkan,

78
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,055
it starts to taste good.

79
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,156
But is this enough to convince
the Kyoto people

80
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,192
and their refined taste buds?

81
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,795
If most of their customers in Kyoto
are tourists,

82
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,430
their popularity won't die down.

83
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,669
But if that happens,
the will would lose its odd factor.

84
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,771
What do you mean?

85
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,239
I…

86
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,542
predict that business will
slow down in time.

87
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,880
<i>The Houou brand will go to Masaomi,</i>

88
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,082
<i>while the workshop</i>

89
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,552
<i>and the store will go to Yashin.</i>

90
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,455
That was the owner's will.

91
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,258
The wife and the mistress…

92
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,360
Each of their sons…

93
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,096
They were already
a complicated family to begin with.

94
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,566
Just like a broken bowl,

95
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,671
it probably can't go back to how it was.

96
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,454
What do you think?

97
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,623
I thought up of a good new item.

98
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,391
The colors are beautiful.

99
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,494
It's <i>joyo nerikiri</i> made with
white adzuki beans.

100
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,733
If you use such expensive ingredients,
we won't make a profit.

101
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,669
Then we have no choice
but to raise the price.

102
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,339
Mr. Yashin.

103
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,710
I hate to say this, but maybe

104
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,512
we should consider lowering the price.

105
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,349
Why? The quality hasn't gone down.

106
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,686
Well, we got another complaint
from a customer.

107
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,757
People are happy to receive
confectioneries from Houou,

108
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,792
but Yashin is a no-name brand,

109
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,662
so 1,000 yen each for a gift

110
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,031
is a little expensive, don't you think?

111
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,067
Who was the one who said that

112
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,436
anything under 1,000 yen
would be unprofitable?

113
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,839
That was me.

114
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,273
But at this rate,

115
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,476
we will run out of funds in no time

116
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,079
and our store will go bankrupt.

117
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,652
Don't worry.

118
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,122
I'll be able to find money somehow.

119
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,058
Who do you think I am?

120
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:35,995
Please…

121
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,663
Please…

122
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,566
protect us.

123
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,969
Help us.

-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

126
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,746
Have a seat.

127
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,885
I've seen you a few times on TV.

128
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,919
Thank you.

129
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,223
The thing is,

130
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,894
I'm here to borrow money
for our store's operating funds.

131
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,730
All right,
then did you bring a business plan

132
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,598
or a trial balance with you?

133
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,102
A business plan?

134
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,370
What is that?

135
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,541
Mr. Yashin,
you really are a natural-born craftsman.

136
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,476
So I'm not surprised…

137
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:27,079
Do you plan on hiring
a business management professional?

138
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,982
I am the owner.

139
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,386
Are you trying to say that
I am not fit to manage my own store?

140
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,956
Yes. In terms of business management,
that is the case.

141
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,095
By the way, is Yashin and Houou

142
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,264
not affiliated at all?

143
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,934
Why do you ask?

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,770
Well, that is what was written
on Houou's website.

145
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:54,674
<i>Yashin doesn't seem to have a website yet.</i>

146
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,909
Who cares

147
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,778
about something like that?

148
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,348
I hate to say this,

149
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:07,587
but it's not like we're lending money
to your skills.

150
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:12,792
We have been and will continue to
lend money to the Houou brand.

CONGRATULATIONS
FROM KYOTO HEIAN CREDIT BANK

00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,367
Who wants a Houou sandwich cookie?

153
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,746
<i>Houou's spirit is in its flavor.</i>

154
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,283
Its spirit that has
been passed down for 100 years.

155
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,986
<i>You must not let it die.</i>

156
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,291
Sorry for calling so suddenly.

157
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,494
I just happened to
have a conference in Tokyo.

158
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,062
What did you want to talk about?

159
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:56,235
Even if you are going to
hold off on returning to school,

160
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:01,173
why don't you try talking to your mother?

161
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,209
Did my mother

162
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,444
ask you?

163
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,283
She seemed to be very remorseful.

164
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,817
So…

165
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:19,525
You were able to settle the score
for your father in court.

166
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,828
Maybe it's about time
that you forgive and forget

167
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,430
what your mother did.

168
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,665
I just

169
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,100
can't believe it.

170
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,636
She was swayed by the internet and TV

171
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,338
and thought my father was guilty.

172
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,240
The circumstances during that time

173
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,374
were exceptional.

174
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,478
If it was my husband's mistake…

175
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,150
I am terribly sorry.

176
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,251
I AM TERRIBLY SORRY

177
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,555
<i>Why would you say that?</i>

178
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,793
<i>We don't know anything yet!</i>

179
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,966
You were a medical student,

180
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,702
so you knew that your father
would never do that.

181
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,804
But your mother is a layperson.

182
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,608
She lost her husband suddenly

183
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,210
and was experiencing
so many distressing things.

184
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,512
So when the media attacked her,
she succumbed to fear.

185
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,480
Even still…

186
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,050
She didn't have to share that
with the tabloids.

187
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,486
-Reiko…
-You too.

188
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,757
You were my father's apprentice,
so you could've stood up for him

189
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,293
in the tabloids or on social media.

190
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,162
That's…

191
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,000
entirely true. I'm very sorry.

192
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,770
The media kept bombarding the school
and I didn't know what to do.

193
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,438
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,307
I need to leave.

195
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:42,875
The truth is…

196
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,578
your mother

197
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,980
is in the hospital right now.

198
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,386
She's not my patient,

199
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,622
but it seems she's been sick for a while,

200
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,659
so she got tests done…

201
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh?

202
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,568
Where's Ms. Reiko?

203
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,604
Out for a ride.

204
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,706
Or so she says…

205
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,182
You were trying to make Ms. Reiko

206
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,685
move on during her time in Kyoto, right?

207
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,322
Maybe it was too early for that.

208
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,526
But all I know is that

209
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,429
she can't settle here forever.

210
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,933
When the time comes
for your counterattack,

211
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,805
she will be targeted by
those worthless journalists again.

212
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,242
That is exactly right.

213
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,128
Mr. Haie.

214
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,063
Have you seen this?

215
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,833
More people are dissing Yashin?

216
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,302
No, this time it's about
Mr. Masaomi's store.

217
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,970
IT DOESN'T LIVE UP TO THE NAME

218
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,638
What in the world?!

219
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,574
This isn't good! This isn't good!

220
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,275
Calm down, Mom.

221
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,911
I'll do something about it,
so don't worry.

222
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,813
Masaomi…

223
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,925
It would've been better
if we never found the real will.

224
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,996
At this rate, both of them
are going to fail.

225
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,233
Why would he write that kind of will?

226
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,801
He's an idiot Living National Treasure.

227
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,737
Now, now, just hold your horses.

228
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,510
Although, I am tired of looking at

229
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,745
your angry face. And so…

230
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,781
Let's go to Kyoto.

231
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,250
Even though it's not our job
and we won't get paid?

232
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,985
-Of course.
-Good for you!

233
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,922
In exchange,
find me a globe-trotting businessman.

234
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,590
Huh? What for?

235
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,400
What's wrong?

236
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:25,938
My mother…

237
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,611
is in the hospital for gastric cancer.

238
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,717
Are you, her only daughter,
not going to visit her?

239
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,222
We're in luck.

240
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,291
There's a gastric cancer specialist
in Kyoto.

241
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,193
Gastrointestinal surgeon,
Professor Haruo Hasegawa.

242
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,160
HARUO HASEGAWA

243
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,596
Reiko.

244
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,133
Everybody makes mistakes.

245
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,602
If that person is genuinely repentant,

246
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,404
not forgiving them may be

247
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,772
a mistake in itself.

248
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,709
Hurry up and just go.

249
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,344
If all of that hadn't happened,

250
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,046
she would've been a good mother, right?

251
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,193
See you.

252
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,867
-Go, go!
-Go, go!

253
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,303
-Reiko! Go, go, Reiko!
-Reiko! Go, go, Reiko!

254
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,806
-Go, go, Reiko!
-Go, go, Reiko!

255
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,278
All right, let's do what we need to do.

256
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,049
-When did she cough up blood?
-Two minutes ago.

257
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,384
-Prepare for gastric lavage.
-Yes.

258
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,119
And check for an open operating room.

259
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,022
I am her daughter. What happened?

260
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,457
I am Kihara, her doctor.

261
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,925
She just coughed up blood.

262
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,928
It might be a gastrointestinal
perforation, so we'll prepare for surgery.

263
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,631
-What's her blood pressure?
-102 over 70.

264
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,899
Try to keep it there.

265
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,201
YASHIN

266
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,707
I guess the real good-for-nothing rich boy
was Mr. Yashin.

267
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:13,913
Damn it…

268
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,716
Dad knew this would happen.

269
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,552
That's why he snatched the brand
away from me.

270
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,821
Stop being ridiculous.

271
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,457
I am sure that one day,

272
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,594
the real victor will be chosen
based on flavor.

273
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,195
We just have to wait until then.

274
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,765
It's because…

275
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,267
It's because you're his mistress

276
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,802
that everything gets in my way.

277
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,876
I'm sorry.

278
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,444
Well, well…

279
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:49,281
You're ignoring your own incompetence
and lashing out at others?

280
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,052
And of all people, at your mother
who raised you all by herself?

281
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,353
Unbelievable…

282
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,221
Mr. Haie?

283
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,556
Inheritance detective…

284
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,026
Why are you here?

285
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,761
Don't tell me

286
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,664
you came all the way here to lecture me.

287
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,132
Actually…

288
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,768
I'm sure you've already noticed.

289
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,404
You do not have

290
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,974
a knack for business or any social skills.

291
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,443
You're nothing but a confectionery artist.

292
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,611
He does not mince his words.

293
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,117
On the other hand, Mr. Masaomi has
overturned his reputation

294
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,419
and is starting off successfully.

295
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,122
Now you're being snarky?

296
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,559
I hate to admit it, but it's true.

297
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,362
I knew you would understand.

298
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,931
Actually, I did some research

299
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,801
and it turns out that Mr. Masaomi
wasn't just a playboy.

300
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,339
While Mr. Yashin was training
in the workshop,

301
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,608
Mr. Masaomi was meeting with entrepreneurs

302
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,176
within and outside of Japan.

303
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,846
He even studied abroad
and got an MBA degree.

304
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:57,483
He is an elite businessman.

305
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:03,055
Although, everybody at Houou assumed
that he was a good-for-nothing rich boy.

306
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,892
So, Mr. Hyena, you're saying that

307
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,561
I should bow down and beg for his help?

308
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,964
Bow down and beg?

309
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,901
Interesting! I didn't think about that!

310
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,970
Just kidding.

311
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,339
But that means
you were considering that too, huh?

312
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,442
-I was not.
-Mr. Haie.

313
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,944
I appreciate your concern.

314
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:31,617
But I don't care if he has an NBA
or an MLB or whatever it's called.

315
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,720
I will find someone else
who is knowledgeable in business.

316
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,724
I have no intention
of bowing down to someone

317
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,193
who is tarnishing Houou's reputation

318
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,895
with such cheap products like him.

319
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,000
As a mistress
who has bowed down countless times

320
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,370
and begged for them to keep my son here,

321
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,704
my pride won't allow it.

322
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:54,706
Listen, Yashin.

323
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,443
We will change

324
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,344
every adversity into opportunity.

325
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,547
Mom…

326
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,256
My goodness… A mistress' pride, huh?

327
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,293
That was enough to convince me.

328
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,196
But the situation has worsened.
What will you do?

329
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,231
That's why I told you

330
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,500
to hurry up and find a businessman.

331
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,735
What are you planning to do?

332
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,804
I have no idea what you're thinking.

333
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,911
YASHIN

334
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,485
We have to do emergency surgery right now.

335
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,453
Okay. If she's stable,

336
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,554
a complete recovery--

337
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,989
Professor Hasegawa!

338
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,994
I want my mother's operation

339
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,998
to be done by you,

340
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,334
my father's most trusted doctor.

341
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,703
Please

342
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,139
save my mother's life.

343
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,641
Please!

344
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,382
Mitomi,

345
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,686
thank you for asking me.

346
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,990
As someone who was trained by your father,

347
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,826
I will do my very best.

348
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,363
Thank you so much.

349
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,241
Mom…

350
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,785
HOUOU BEKKAN

351
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,787
DRY AND BLAND
TASTES LIKE IT'S BEEN OUT FOR A WHILE

352
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,255
AREN'T THEY DISGRACING HOUOU'S NAME?

353
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,790
Excuse me?

354
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,159
-Isn't this pretty bad?
-Yeah…

355
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,996
Young master, you have a guest.

356
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,999
Long time no see.

357
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,501
-Inheritance detective!
-Inheritance detective!

358
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,069
I'm not.

359
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,905
Wow, what a great success!

360
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,541
Up until now, that is.

361
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,476
But you still have so many worries.

362
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,780
That's the vibe I'm getting from
Mrs. Miyabi and Mr. Masaomi.

363
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:15,781
Of course not.

364
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,050
-Stop talking nonsense.
-What?

365
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,686
We're overstocked and it won't fit
in the refrigerator?

366
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,955
But if we have to throw them away--

367
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,189
I'll call you back!

368
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,959
As expected…

369
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,728
However,
Mr. Yashin's situation is even worse.

370
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,031
I really feel bad for them.

371
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,167
Excuse me.

372
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,769
What do you want, Mr. Hyena?

373
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,104
It's Haie.

374
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,507
The current situation
is caused by none other than

375
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,143
the late owner's will, am I right?

376
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,279
Because he split the name and substance.

377
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,449
So why did he leave a will like that?

378
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,684
Don't you want to know the truth?

379
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,820
The truth?

380
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:56,822
I am

381
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,124
interested.

382
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,637
He even named his shop after his own name.

383
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,373
He must have had a lot of confidence.

384
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,376
But business seems to be quite slow.

385
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,377
YASHIN

386
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,182
Mr. Yashin!

387
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,084
The young master…

388
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:27,853
What?

389
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,927
Mr. Haie? Why?

390
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,664
"Why"? This used to be ours.

391
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,666
I'll let myself in.

392
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,368
I was planning on coming
even if it wasn't for him.

393
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,605
You're on their side now?

394
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,540
No way.

395
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,376
My job is done already.

396
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,444
This is

397
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,846
part of my after-sales service.

398
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:59,217
Today, I gathered everyone together
in order to

399
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,386
reveal the truth about the will.

400
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,622
But before I do that,

401
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,158
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

402
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,094
I'll start with Mr. Masaomi,
the legitimate son.

403
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,699
How do you view Houou's current situation
and its future?

404
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,468
-What would an outsider like you know?
-Mom.

405
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,703
It's a good opportunity.

406
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:22,240
Having a third party here will help
Yashin hear me out calmly.

407
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:23,842
That's true.

408
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,510
Yashin.

409
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,714
I know you're having a hard time
managing this business.

410
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,184
So why don't we join forces?

411
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,086
I knew it.

412
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,655
It was Hyena's idea, right?

413
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,224
He wants me to bow down and beg.

414
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,393
Of course not. And it's Haie.

415
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,263
Why would we ever listen to Mr. Hyena?

416
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,600
This is Houou's decision.

417
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,302
It's Haie.

418
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,238
Mr. Yashin,

419
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:56,975
why don't you bow
that stubborn little head of yours

420
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,578
and become our subsidiary?

421
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,214
We aren't cold-blooded, you know?

422
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,619
If your confectionery was to
disappear from this world, it would

423
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,654
pain my heart ever so slightly.

424
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,289
I don't know

425
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,493
how you can say such nasty things.

426
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,128
Nasty?

427
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,731
You're the nasty one.

428
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,633
You're a mistress
who tried to take control,

429
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,602
made a fuss about the inheritance,

430
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,904
and completely ruined Houou.

431
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,541
The predicament you're in right now
was brought upon yourself!

432
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,946
But we are being merciful

433
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,184
and trying to save you.

434
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,686
Did you say, "merciful"?

435
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,722
Who was the one who used

436
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,425
dirty tricks to try to
sabotage Mr. Koichi's wish?

437
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,760
Yashin,

438
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,363
you must not bow down, no matter what.

439
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,966
These people are just trying to
take advantage of your skills.

440
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:58,303
They're adding words like
"Bekkan" and "Annex" to the name

441
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,605
because they can't make
Houou's confectionery.

442
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:04,075
At this rate, they are going to
go out of business too.

443
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,411
They know that
and that's why they showed up.

444
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:10,649
Yashin will surpass Houou one day.

445
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:14,352
Even if we need help from someone,
it won't be you.

446
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,989
We have no intention of
bowing down to you.

447
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,127
Now, now…

448
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:26,264
Reminder number one,
both mothers should not butt in.

449
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,334
The previous owner left Houou's future
in the hands of his sons,

450
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,669
so you have no say.

451
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,405
Reminder number two,

452
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:37,142
both Mr. Yashin and Mr. Masaomi
are already well aware.

453
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:38,977
Isn't that right?

454
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:43,782
You know it's only a matter of time
before both stores go bankrupt.

455
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,017
That's what you have to say?

456
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:49,488
Houou Bekkan's gross sales for today

457
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,624
was over three million yen.

458
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,328
You just don't want to admit it.

459
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,197
Everyone on the internet
is bashing on you.

460
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,000
"Famous for nothing.

461
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,570
It's nothing like the old Houou.
Not even worth 100 yen.

462
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,905
Convenience stores are better."

463
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,407
Man, that's harsh.

464
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,212
Right now, customers are still being
swayed by the brand name.

465
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,014
But the future is not bright.

466
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:20,285
In other words, both of his sons' stores
will go out of business.

467
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,988
And that was all planned

468
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,656
by the previous owner.

469
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,792
He used his will as a weapon.

470
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,228
And I will--

471
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,598
Oh, good timing.

472
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,102
-How is it?
<i>-It looks promising.</i>

473
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,904
All right.

474
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,809
It is time for me to solve

475
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,313
the mystery behind the owner's odd will.

476
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,223
I asked Professor Hasegawa
to do your operation.

477
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,624
So don't worry, Mom.

478
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,861
We can sit down and talk
once the operation is done.

479
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:16,841
Tomonaga, over here,
is actually a big fan of Houou.

480
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,710
So he has been doing whatever he can

481
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,745
to save Yashin's confectioneries.

482
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,848
The thing is,
a certain investor from China

483
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,184
wants to buy both of your rights.

484
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,519
Why all of a sudden?

485
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:31,423
This investor is willing to pay
two billion yen to each of you.

486
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,658
Two billion?

487
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,693
Each?

488
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,465
Both of you are going to go
out of business soon anyway.

489
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,701
So why not turn them into cash now

490
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,470
and have a fresh start?

491
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,239
I think that is your best option.

492
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,375
What a great offer.

493
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,878
However, how is that investor planning on
getting a return

494
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,547
on a four-billion-yen investment?

495
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,882
There are plenty of ways.

496
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,484
Like opening branches worldwide

497
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,820
and making things like Houou meat buns

498
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,890
and Houou fortune ice cream.

499
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,693
They'll get a return on their investment
within five years.

500
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,228
Houou meat buns?

501
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,064
Our ancestors will never accept
something like that.

502
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,265
Huh?

503
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,736
Watching Houou go out of business would be

504
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,939
a lot more "unacceptable"
for your ancestors, don't you think?

505
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,209
That's true.
At least you'll leave here with money

506
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,378
and you'll be able to
preserve Houou's name.

507
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:30,482
If you succeed, you might be able to
buy back Houou's name too.

508
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,017
Exactly.

509
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,386
As if I can accept
such a ridiculous offer!

510
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,389
Is that deal really reliable?

511
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,325
The investor was Mr. Masaomi's

512
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,494
schoolmate.

513
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,730
Xin.

514
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:54,973
It's true that he is a big fan
of Houou's confectioneries.

515
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,876
I can't do this. Scrap this idea.

516
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:58,877
-That's right!
-That's right!

517
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,212
It's out of the question.

518
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,923
I guess neither of you

519
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,526
want to sell your stores.

520
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:15,960
What happens then?

521
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,297
Will you just watch
as it goes out of business?

522
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,467
Do you even have to ask?

523
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,370
Mr. Yashin just has to let go
of his useless pride

524
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,539
and come to our store, that's all.

525
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:28,640
No.

526
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,144
For people like you who can only produce
disappointing confectionery,

527
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,547
Houou's name is too heavy of a burden.

528
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,183
That is why we will buy

529
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,085
Houou's name.

530
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,388
You don't even have any funds.

531
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,989
I will take care of that too.

532
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,325
This isn't something
you can fix that easily!

533
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,627
Whoa, there…

534
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,097
Whoa…

535
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,967
So here's a question.

536
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,137
Please answer me honestly.

537
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,573
Have you two ever

538
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,209
had a conversation with each other,
heart-to-heart?

539
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:07,979
No.

540
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,950
I didn't want to upset my mother.

541
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:13,451
What?

542
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,856
My father was awful
at business management,

543
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,093
so my mother was the one
who had to go around and beg

544
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,862
banks and relatives for help.

545
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:25,930
So…

546
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,667
if I became close with Yashin…

547
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:32,971
You felt bad because it felt like
you were betraying your mother?

548
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,240
That

549
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,443
goes for you as well, right?

550
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,577
‪What?‬

551
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,351
I also grew up seeing my mother crying

552
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,554
because people would talk about her
behind her back.

553
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,122
How rude.

554
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,960
Well, I guess it's only natural
that you two can't get along.

555
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,328
I agree.

556
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,464
Yashin.

557
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,768
Will you compromise
and become our subsidiary?

558
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,136
Excuse me?

559
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,009
There is something I want to ask you.

560
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,046
Are you satisfied with making that

561
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,315
cheap little store of yours?

562
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:18,983
Yes.

563
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,854
We're opening seven more branch stores
in the Kansai region.

564
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,757
We're even opening stores
in Tokyo, France, Italy, and Thailand.

565
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,395
You are a disgrace to this brand.

566
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,430
I hope you go out of business!

567
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,431
What did you say?

568
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,667
You're one to talk!

569
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,135
I have had enough!

570
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,737
I will push you off the Shijo Bridge

571
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:42,841
and into the Kamo River!

572
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,310
What?

573
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,288
In the end,

574
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,725
what is most important to you two?

575
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,666
HYAKUMANBEN KOICHI

576
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,903
HOUOU

577
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,173
-Houou's…
-Houou's…

578
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,545
tradition.

579
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:26,017
Tradition is trust.

580
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,820
It's centuries' worth of

581
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,290
hard work and hardships that
your ancestors experienced through

582
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,392
wars and changes in economy and culture.

583
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,863
It's the history of trust between you
and the customers who've supported you.

584
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,366
And right now,

585
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,836
your pride, arrogance, negligence,

586
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,672
and most of all, the lack of understanding
between you two,

587
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,641
are about to destroy that trust.

588
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,443
Is that really what Mr. Koichi wanted?

589
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:01,319
If this miraculous confectionery
that tradition has preserved goes away,

590
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,821
it would be a huge loss for Japan…

591
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,458
No, a huge loss for humankind.

592
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,036
What are you…?

593
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,420
What?

594
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:38,056
Are you going to laugh at
the confectionery that I made?

595
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,492
I have one more question.

596
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,897
What are you going to do
with Houou's time-honored sign?

597
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,898
The thing is,

598
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,167
you keep opening stores
called Bekkan and Annex,

599
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,670
so I was wondering what you were
going to do with the original sign.

600
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:00,878
That…

601
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:11,589
HOUOU

602
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,225
You were hiding it here?

603
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:20,698
There is a reason why I didn't
call my new stores "Houou."

604
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,034
Because you had no confidence?

605
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,370
No.

606
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,572
Because I was

607
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:32,310
planning on using this sign
when I found a craftsman who was

608
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,113
worthy of becoming Dad's successor.

609
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,717
The main store which will be
deserving of this sign,

610
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,522
will pursue quality over anything.
No matter how much deficit it produces,

611
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,691
the other Houou branches will support it.

612
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,192
In other words,

613
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,130
I opened those branch stores
to create a solid business structure.

614
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,199
The name "Houou" is one of a kind.

615
00:33:56,934 --> 00:34:00,138
I am only going to give it to a store
that is worthy of it.

616
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,807
After Dad died,

617
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,576
in order to protect Japan's…

618
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:06,477
No,

619
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,014
the world's best confectionery, Houou,

620
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,216
I searched far and wide
for master craftsmen.

621
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,485
You weren't just playing around?

622
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,056
But unfortunately…

623
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,458
Or should I say luckily,

624
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:25,996
I couldn't find a craftsman
who was better than you.

625
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,801
I ate your confectionery
for the first time in a while,

626
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:31,969
and I was convinced.

627
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,609
That tasted

628
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,346
just like Dad's.

629
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,918
That's why I can say with confidence

630
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,290
that this sign should be

631
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:56,460
yours, Yashin.

632
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,100
-But…
-I pursued business management.

633
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:06,437
Because I didn't have
a knack for making confectionery.

634
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,207
At first, it was just a way out,

635
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,943
but I thought that I could

636
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,847
support you and Dad one day
if I learned about business.

637
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,519
I…

638
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,088
was envious

639
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,724
of you for no reason.

640
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,328
I thought I had to dedicate my life

641
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,064
to making confectionery

642
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,398
in order to belong.

643
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,173
It's going to become very busy now.

644
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,277
You'll be responsible for the products
sold at the branch stores too.

645
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,514
That way, in time, the branch stores will

646
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,016
become the foundation of our business

647
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,985
and help Houou pursue even better quality.

648
00:35:58,589 --> 00:35:59,724
My name means

649
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,726
"a proper retainer."

650
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,563
I want you to hire me
as your second-in-command

651
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,166
who will serve you properly.

652
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,402
You'll be an ambitious owner

653
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,437
and I'll be your proper retainer.

654
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,206
Let's both

655
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,342
make Houou the best confectionery
in the world.

656
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,386
I gladly accept, young master.

657
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,128
Please don't call me
"young master" anymore.

658
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,433
I…

659
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,370
had no idea Mr. Masaomi
was thinking about something like that.

660
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,173
Ms. Tatsuko.

661
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,109
The truth is,

662
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,312
I was also in a lot of pain.

663
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,649
I felt like I was always second place.

664
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,688
I thought that I could never be
better than you.

665
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,058
That's how I've always felt…

666
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:15,299
We should learn from our sons

667
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,470
and help each other from now on.

668
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,107
If we keep fighting,

669
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,710
we will only

670
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,346
hinder their success.

671
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,649
That's true.

672
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:34,418
Mom.

673
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,591
Congratulations

674
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,493
to the owner.

675
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,104
Thank goodness.

676
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,978
Mom?

677
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,985
Your surgery was successful.

678
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,321
How are you feeling?

679
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,558
Good, thank you.

680
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:18,663
Professor…

681
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,233
Thank you very much.

682
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,937
I learned from Professor Mitomi,
after all.

683
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:35,646
Reiko.

684
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,417
-About back then--
-It's fine.

685
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,420
More like…

686
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,791
I may have been venting
my anger and frustration

687
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,395
on you by holding a grudge against you.

688
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,702
I should be the one…

689
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:01,205
to say sorry.

690
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,908
Mom.

691
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,426
When you mentioned the truth
about the will…

692
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,729
Were you talking about this?

693
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:28,265
Yes. He really took drastic measures.

694
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,636
He put you two in a situation
that would push Houou

695
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,172
to the brink of extinction and hoped that

696
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:39,176
you two would cooperate.
That's why he wrote that will.

697
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,178
That is my guess.

698
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:44,181
I mean, your mothers were fighting
and causing trouble, right?

699
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:47,251
<i>The late owner couldn't do</i>
<i>anything about it.</i>

700
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:50,688
<i>That's why he took a chance</i>
<i>and wrote that will.</i>

701
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:54,291
I must say, he was quite cunning,
or more like,

702
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,294
capable of predicting
other people's thoughts.

703
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,529
Well,

704
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,399
I'm sure he entrusted the future of Houou
to you two,

705
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,267
knowing your strengths and weaknesses.

706
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,872
We fell right into our father's trap.

707
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,442
Seriously…

708
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,648
I wonder if he even

709
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,184
named us with that in mind?

710
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:22,820
Probably.

711
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,389
Well,

712
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,392
let's do this together, Owner.

713
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,762
Wait, I change my mind…

714
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,366
Can I call you…

715
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:41,939
Brother?

716
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,764
<i>Both of you, remember this.</i>

717
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,834
Houou's confectioneries taste the best

718
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,436
when you eat it under this sign.

719
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,810
That will was befitting of someone

720
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,746
who studied psychology
in the capital of deception.

721
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,420
Welcome back.

722
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,156
She suddenly

723
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,392
needed surgery today.

724
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,062
But…

725
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,165
thankfully,

726
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,034
it went well.

727
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,303
Sorry for making you worry.

728
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,372
I see.

729
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,475
Want some coffee?

730
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,745
Sorry, I have some business to do. Bye.

731
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,480
Okay.

732
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,424
Sensei…

733
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,462
I'm…

734
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,566
glad I could talk to my mother.

735
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:17,935
I was about to make

736
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,273
a decision I would regret forever.

737
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,710
Thank you for helping me.

738
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,682
Oh, it was nothing.

739
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,152
Next time…

740
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,757
I will help you.

741
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,530
Bye.

742
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,570
Thank goodness.

743
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,584
I heard that

744
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,352
the hyena was stirring things up

745
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,055
regarding Houou's inheritance.

746
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,223
My goodness,

747
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,294
this is the perfect job for a hyena
who devours flesh and blood.

748
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,265
This funeral detective job.

749
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,001
I have no business with you.

750
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,942
Seeing you so lively

751
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,545
makes me irritated for some reason.

752
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,549
So I just came to pick on you.

753
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,453
I don't mind

754
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,255
if you report me to the police
as your stalker.

755
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,759
But I don't think you can.

756
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:54,198
You're a former lawyer with a history
of embezzlement after all.

757
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,905
But you had to pay a huge amount of money

758
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,208
as compensation
for your dad's bus accident,

759
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,879
so I can understand
why you would want to embezzle money.

760
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:18,355
30 PASSENGERS DEAD
900 MILLION IN COMPENSATION

761
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:19,356
DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES

762
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,458
DRIVER FELL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL
OVERWORKED

763
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,123
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION

764
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,892
ALL ORGANIZATIONS, TITLES,
AND PERSONS ARE FICTITIOUS

765
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:55,926
