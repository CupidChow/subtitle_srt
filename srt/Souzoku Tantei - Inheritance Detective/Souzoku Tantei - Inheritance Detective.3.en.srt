00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,906
<i>I am Haie Nao, an inheritance detective.</i>

2
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,208
<i>Haie used to be a lawyer.</i>

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:11,411
<i>He's apparently a detective now,</i>
<i>specializing in inheritance.</i>

4
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:14,848
<i>Why did he write it with a ballpoint pen,</i>
<i>when he always uses a fountain pen?</i>

5
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:16,082
<i>-This is the proof.</i>
-Damn it!

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,219
You forged them, didn't you?
Just like you did

7
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,687
this Monet painting.

8
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,523
<i>Because I hate the phrase,</i>
<i>"Dead men tell no tales."</i>

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,759
<i>I heard you were outsmarted</i>

10
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,128
<i>by that punk named Haie?</i>

11
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,196
If you pull the same
dirty tricks as before,

12
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,665
<i>I wouldn't mind writing</i>
<i>an article about you again.</i>

13
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,635
<i>Dad, I'll settle the score for you,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,473
HAIE INHERITANCE INVESTIGATION OFFICE

15
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,347
Mr. Tomonaga.

16
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,017
Your pizza is all cold now.

17
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,053
Mr. Tomonaga.

18
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,691
Must be nice to not have any worries.

19
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,660
I don’t know what you’re saying,
but it’s creepy.

20
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,700
Isn’t Mr. Tomonaga acting weird lately?

21
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,602
He doesn’t show up as much

22
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,538
and when he does,
he doesn’t even play his games.

23
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,874
Reiko, you’re not very sharp, are you?

24
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,543
Huh?

25
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,780
Tomonaga is in love.

26
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,248
What!

27
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,184
Love?

28
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:32,959
I’ve known Tomonaga for a long time,

29
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,528
but I’ve never seen him like that before.

30
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:40,133
<i>So I followed him two days ago</i>
<i>because I was worried.</i>

31
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,977
Rescued Cat Café?

32
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,517
Mr. Tomonaga, thanks for always coming
so early and waiting until opening time.

33
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,953
Here’s your usual coffee

34
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:01,488
and…

35
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,823
something extra.

36
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,867
I didn’t want to pry any further,

37
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,668
so I left.

38
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,770
We’re out of coffee.

39
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,772
The ten million yen from the other day

40
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,408
was basically used up
to pay off your debt, after all.

41
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:26,980
-Oh?
-Oh?

42
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,382
Have you two

43
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:07,086
ever had a soul-stirring experience

44
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,054
before?

45
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:09,956
-Soul?
-Soul?

46
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,493
It’s stirring out of fear right now.

47
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,129
Oh, is it work?

48
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,597
Hello, this is Haie Inheritance…

49
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,867
"Pathetic detective"?

50
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,803
Grandpa Kyosha, huh?

51
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:26,906
Hello?

52
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,776
Hey, are you alive?

53
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:33,046
Believe it or not…

54
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:33,980
KATO'S SHOGI SHOP OWNER
KATO KYOSHA

55
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,717
I got my hands on some Black Ivory.

56
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,620
What? Black Ivory? Are you serious?

57
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,821
<i>Bring over that</i>

58
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,824
bowl-cut boy of yours too.

59
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,694
I'll let you guys try it.

60
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,330
I’ll be right there.

61
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,799
Tomonaga,

62
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,436
Grandpa Kyosha is going to
treat us to some Black Ivory.

63
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,141
My chest hurts.

64
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,046
Maybe I’ll go to clear my mind.

65
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,753
KING

66
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:16,956
S'up.

67
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:18,891
What?

68
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,394
Well, if it isn’t the pathetic detective.

69
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,063
What a surprise. Why are you here?

70
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,531
-Huh?
-Huh?

71
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,369
You just called and told us to come

72
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,037
because you got some Black Ivory.

73
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,839
What?

74
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:34,907
Did I?

75
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,616
Sorry, I just remembered.

76
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,585
Well, come in,

77
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,654
Haida.

78
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,255
Bowl Cut, you're here too?

79
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,724
I’m Haie.

80
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,659
"Bowl Cut"?

81
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,295
He’s going senile, isn't he?

82
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:59,032
I had heard that he was
getting pretty weak…

83
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,035
Well, as long as we get to drink
rare coffee, it’s fine.

84
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,006
Yes! This is it!

85
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,420
There we go.

86
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,594
What is this?

87
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,730
It’s amazing.

88
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,931
Isn't it?

89
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:33,866
This coffee

90
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,236
is made in Thailand.

91
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,140
They feed the coffee beans to elephants

92
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,343
and let it ferment in their stomachs.

93
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,178
That's how it's made.

94
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,481
So basically, the coffee beans
were taken from their waste,

95
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,749
like kopi luwak.

96
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,851
Coffee lovers are such weirdos.

97
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,490
It’s irresistible.

98
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,096
Well then…

99
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,233
It’s been a while, but let’s play a game.

100
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,603
Did you get any better?

101
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,507
I did, thanks to the <i>shogi</i> app
that my ex-girlfriend recommended.

102
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,346
There you are, Maribo.

103
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,848
Does it want food?

104
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,717
I just fed it.

105
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:26,819
Wait…

106
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,455
Did I?

107
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,525
Mr. Kato.

108
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,728
I’m here to drop off Maribo’s food.

109
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,764
Thank you, as always.

110
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,532
Oh, you have guests?

111
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,267
What?

112
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,003
…something extra.

113
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,472
Mr. Tomonaga.

114
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,441
Thank you for earlier.

115
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,776
You know each other?

116
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,212
Who knew…

117
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,149
we’d meet here…

118
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,685
This must be…

119
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,521
fate!

120
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,858
Will you ma…

121
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:07,760
ma…

122
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,764
ma… ma… marry…

123
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:17,970
He’s fine.

124
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:22,175
He overused his diaphragm, and his brain
suffered from a lack of oxygen.

125
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,776
He’ll recover soon.

126
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,483
So, how did your proposal go?

127
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,719
He didn’t even say it all the way.
Only I noticed.

128
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,888
So it didn’t reach her, huh?

129
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,056
But my mind is already set.

130
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,158
Fate brought us together
two times in one day.

131
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,059
We must marry!

132
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,828
What kind of person is Ms. Sophie?

133
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,163
I can see why Tomonaga
is acting like this.

134
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,365
She’s bright and beautiful.

135
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,837
She even proactively

136
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,172
rescues cats as a volunteer.

137
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,807
<i>She rescues abandoned cats</i>

138
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,442
<i>and has them spayed and neutered.</i>

139
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,444
<i>The main reason why she runs a cat café</i>

140
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,347
<i>is to let people meet them</i>
<i>and adopt them if they wish to.</i>

141
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,417
Interesting…

142
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:09,021
Grandpa Kyosha wanted to support
her cause and frequented her cat café.

143
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,257
But then Maribo became
really attached to him.

144
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,527
<i>So Ms. Sophie offered to be his guarantor</i>

145
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,329
<i>so he could adopt the cat.</i>

146
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,766
What if he was after Ms. Sophie
and not the cat?

147
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,768
Huh?

148
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,205
THREE DAYS LATER

149
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,742
Hello, this is
Haie Inheritance Investigation Office.

150
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,312
What?

151
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,414
Sensei.

152
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,821
Mr. Kyosha…

153
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,228
Don’t tell me…

154
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,043
<i>I bequeath all of my assets</i>
<i>to Marie Antoinette.</i>

155
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:05,978
Show some respect!

156
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,248
Your company sure is amazing.

157
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,416
<i>Grandpa Kyosha,</i>

158
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,885
I won't let your inheritance
be dishonored!

159
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,025
<i>He had coronary artery disease.</i>

160
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,961
<i>They said it was sudden.</i>

161
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,097
FUNERAL VENUE FOR KATO KYOSHA

162
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,333
KATO'S SHOGI SHOP

163
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,404
He was completely fine four days ago.

164
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,975
You lose.

165
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,146
You are pathetic, after all!

166
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,086
Grandpa Kyosha, you shouldn’t be
this quick-witted at your age.

167
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,962
<i>I see.</i>

168
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,997
Bowl Cut was a regular too?

169
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,133
I don’t go to the café as much.

170
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,837
Ever since Maribo came,
I’ve been more of a homebody.

171
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,039
Good for you, Maribo.

172
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,317
I will support

173
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,354
Ms. Sophie in your place, Grandpa Kyosha.

174
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,099
This is delicious.

175
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,634
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

176
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,238
This one too…

177
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,542
Oh, Mr. Kinto.

178
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,312
Long time no see.

179
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,348
GRANDPA KYOSHA’S ONLY SON
KATO KINTO

180
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,351
Sorry I’m late.
I had a meeting I couldn’t cancel.

181
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,788
Well, you are the company president,
after all.

182
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,358
Thank you for taking care
of everything, Ms. Saito.

183
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,394
It's nothing.

184
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,630
Who knew this would happen so suddenly.

185
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,267
Mr. Kyosha’s son seems respectable.

186
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,402
Yeah.

187
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,412
That’s Ms. Sophie.

188
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,320
Ms. Sophie, please come this way.

189
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,260
This is his son, Mr. Kinto.

190
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,834
Mr. Kato really helped me out a lot.

191
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,603
I can’t believe this happened so suddenly.

192
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,072
Kyo loved it

193
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:50,376
when she would visit
from time to time for Maribo.

194
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,343
Make sure you thank her.

195
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,412
Maribo?

196
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,548
Oh, you don’t know? His cat.

197
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,816
-Cat?
-Yes.

198
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,884
Is that right?

199
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,888
My father must've been a pain to deal with
since he’s so stubborn.

200
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,557
He seemed to be going senile too.

201
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,559
Not at all.

202
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,129
If you need help regarding Maribo,

203
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,466
please contact me anytime.

204
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,267
Thank you very much.

205
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,368
RESCUED CAT CAFÉ
LOUIS XVI

206
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:25,044
What the heck! This is a will!

207
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,746
What?

208
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,786
Kyo had written a will?

209
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,254
But Kinto

210
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,156
is his only heir.

211
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,225
-Let’s just take a look.
-Yeah.

212
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,562
WILL

213
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,968
"I bequeath all of my assets including
my property, building, and savings

214
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,671
to Marie Antoinette."

215
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,875
<i>Marie Antoinette?</i>

216
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,743
What is this, the French Revolution?

217
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,677
WILL

218
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,313
He would forget to take his medicine,

219
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,215
and he was starting to go senile.

220
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,085
Maybe that’s why he wrote
this strange will.

221
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,757
The format is correct
and his handwriting is steady.

222
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,426
It's hard to say that he wrote this
because he was senile.

223
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,262
Who is he?

224
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,198
Excuse me, you are…?

225
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,067
I forgot to introduce myself.

226
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,502
Let’s see…

227
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,972
The late Mr. Kyosha was a good <i>shogi</i>

228
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,041
and coffee buddy of mine.

229
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:29,942
Here it is.

230
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,411
My name…

231
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,446
is Haie.

232
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,415
And I am Tomonaga.

233
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,717
I am Haie’s assistant, Mitomi Reiko.

234
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,654
Inheritance detective?

235
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,655
Yes.

236
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,258
Did my father hire you?

237
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,529
No, not at all.
I came here today as his friend.

238
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,699
Well then, you don’t have to get
involved with this.

239
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,438
Whoa, there…

240
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,607
It is illegal even for

241
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,976
bereaved family members
to throw away a will.

242
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:04,944
-What?
-What?

243
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,681
Article 259 of the Penal Code,
Damaging Documents for Private Use.

244
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:12,284
There is no fine, but you can be
imprisoned for five years or less.

245
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,086
-That’s surprisingly harsh.
-Yes.

246
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,322
Mr. Haie, may I speak with you?

247
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:27,766
What is this?

248
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,735
A fee.

249
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,938
Will you stay out of our business, please?

250
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,139
I’m busy.

251
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,476
I cannot accept your money. I’m leaving.

252
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,578
But may I ask you one thing?

253
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:41,780
What is it?

254
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,115
Well,

255
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:47,987
I was wondering if you knew anything about
this mysterious "Marie Antoinette,"

256
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,356
since you’re his son.

257
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:51,824
I don’t know.

258
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,960
I haven’t come back
to this house for a while.

259
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:58,230
I see. So you were estranged
from your father?

260
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,602
Mr. Haie, you don’t need to worry.

261
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,674
I won’t throw away his will.
I will talk about it with my lawyer.

262
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,276
You can leave now.

263
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,078
Excuse me then.

264
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,547
Time to go.

265
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,422
Excuse me.

266
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,624
Thank you for the food.

267
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,130
MARIE ANTOINETTE

268
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,667
That is one crazy will.

269
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,537
I mean, she’s a historical figure.

270
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,339
He must have been senile.

271
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,908
I find that hard to believe.

272
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,911
But he forgot that he invited us over.

273
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,048
But his mind was as sharp as ever
when playing <i>shogi</i>.

274
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,183
So did he do it to spite his son?

275
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,584
He wouldn’t do that.

276
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,087
He’s stubborn, but he’s not mean.

277
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,823
Just like his name,
he was a straightforward man

278
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,558
who couldn’t stand injustice.

279
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:04,163
The ever so brilliant Sophie trusted him
and left Maribo in his care

280
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,799
before I started going to that café.

281
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,701
HARU, RIBBON, KAI, BINON
JIJI, KOKO, CHOCO, SORA

282
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,809
I feel like there is a reason.

283
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,011
Is your detective’s instinct telling you?

284
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,325
I might have

285
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,595
figured it out.

286
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,230
-Huh?
-Huh?

287
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,101
Grandpa Kyosha,

288
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,803
I won't let your inheritance
be dishonored!

289
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,383
Mr. Tomonaga?

290
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,818
Why are you here so early?

291
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:00,786
Hey, wait!

292
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,788
Mr. Tomonaga? Hey…

293
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,823
FROM TODAY, WE’LL BE TOGETHER

294
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,769
-Ms. Sophie.
-Yes?

295
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,470
There’s something I’d like to know.

296
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,239
What?

297
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,707
KING

298
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:23,575
So…

299
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,111
what is Mr. Tomonaga’s conclusion?

300
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,413
That is…

301
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,116
Whoa!
Why is the great Attorney Fukushi here?

302
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,051
Right back at you.

303
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:32,985
S'up.

304
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:33,986
S'up?

305
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,354
Show some respect!

306
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,357
I’m impressed that you sniffed this out,

307
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,726
even though he died so suddenly.

308
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,860
However,

309
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,196
I’m acquainted with Mr. Kinto,

310
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,833
because I’m the legal adviser
for his company, Honest App.

311
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,869
So I will be taking care
of his father’s will.

312
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,705
I see. How will you take care of it?

313
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,242
Marie Antoinette

314
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,345
may be a real historical figure,

315
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,082
but we cannot bequeath assets
to a decedent.

316
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,085
Even a pathetic detective like you
knows that, right?

317
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:11,190
That’s all you can think of?
You really are a pathetic lawyer.

318
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,325
Isn’t it time for your evening talk show?

319
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,129
MOURNING

320
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,297
Everyone…

321
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,399
I, Tomonaga,

322
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,367
will provide an explanation.

323
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:28,474
Well then,

324
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,643
here is the conclusion
that our investigation office

325
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,680
came to regarding Kato Kyosha’s will.

326
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,081
Tomonaga.

327
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,019
Grandpa Kyosha adopted Maribo
from a rescued cat café called Louis XVI.

328
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,955
And Maribo’s real name is…

329
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:48,160
You guessed it, Marie Antoinette!

330
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,795
What?

331
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,915
Pardon me.

332
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,851
However, it’s just too funny.

333
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,088
Bequeathed to a cat? How stupid.

334
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,357
Isn’t that going a little too far?

335
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,527
No, not exactly.

336
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:25,931
Legally, it may be complicated,
but there are ways to go around it.

337
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,634
There are ways to leave
your assets to a caregiver

338
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,104
under the condition that they
take care of your pet.

339
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,872
-Indeed.
-One.

340
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,607
Testamentary Gift with Burden.

341
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,876
Two. Gift Causa Mortis With Burden.

342
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,178
Three. A pet trust.

343
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,147
These are such options.
Right, Attorney Fukushi?

344
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,951
However, unless he has
specified that caregiver,

345
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,121
we don’t even know who to
bequeath Marie Antoinette to.

346
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,090
Even if pets are like family
to their owners,

347
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,792
legally, they are

348
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,594
nothing but property.

349
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,564
Don’t call cats "property."

350
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,133
Pardon me.

351
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,736
I may not look like it,
but I love animals.

352
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,305
I’m just talking in legal terms.

353
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,573
In other words,

354
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,908
my father chose his cat

355
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,344
over his actual son.

356
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,515
I’m worth less than a cat, huh?

357
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,118
Who knew he hated me that much?

358
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,388
That’s not true.

359
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,727
If Mr. Kyosha hated you,

360
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,996
he could have sold his land and house

361
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,232
and spent it all while he was alive.

362
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:37,169
I’ve seen many people do that.

363
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,772
But he didn’t do that
and wrote this will instead.

364
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,076
I think he was trying to
tell someone something.

365
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,681
After all, wills are

366
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,484
the last letters

367
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,319
we send to our loved ones.

368
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,596
You must be very pleased with yourself
and your poetic quotes.

369
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,732
But he just wrote this will

370
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:07,799
to make sure

371
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,636
that Mr. Kinto takes care
of Maribo, right?

372
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:14,773
Do you think he would leave his cat
with Mr. Kinto, his estranged son?

373
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,809
If it were me, I wouldn’t.

374
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,278
Then what is it?

375
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:20,912
In other words…

376
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,049
I think there is something
behind this will,

377
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,551
like a hidden meaning.

378
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,220
A hidden meaning?

379
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,088
I’m asking what that is.

380
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,658
Yeah, I don’t know.

381
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,625
What!

382
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,260
You’re useless!

383
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,596
Of course he doesn't know.

384
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,766
I’m his only son.

385
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,669
I couldn’t leave him alone,
so I hired professional

386
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,071
visiting nurses and housekeepers
to take care of my dad.

387
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,707
And I had his neighbor, Ms. Saito,
check on him every day.

388
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,677
Ever since he got Maribo,

389
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,679
he smiled more.

390
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,014
Ms. Saito,

391
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,550
I’m going back to work.

392
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,786
If you need anything,
ask my secretary, Yamauchi.

393
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,855
Attorney Fukushi, I’ll give you a ride.

394
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,062
Jeez, I don’t have time to waste
on useless people.

395
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,731
Well, at least we found out who

396
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,601
Marie Antoinette is. You’re probably
thinking too deeply about it.

397
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,316
Give me some kind of clue,

398
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,352
Grandpa Kyosha.

399
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,427
So bitter…

400
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,333
KATO'S SHOGI SHOP

401
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,237
Okay, time for food.

402
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,775
Mr. Haie.

403
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,112
Perfect timing.

404
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,347
Thank you for yesterday.

405
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,884
I wanted to ask you about
Mr. Kyosha and Mr. Kinto.

406
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:06,918
What is it?

407
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,021
Ms. Saito, you like coffee, right?

408
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,879
Is 80kg my limit?

409
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,920
Attorney Fukushi,

410
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,457
if you build up your pectoralis major
first, you’ll be able to lift more.

411
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,859
You’re from Hyena’s place…

412
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,428
S'up.

413
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,030
I’m Mitomi Reiko, an expert trainer.

414
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,933
My job at Haie Sensei’s place isn’t
enough, so I have two jobs.

415
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,602
I request a different expert trainer.

416
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,838
Well, well…

417
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:03,708
You have some nice muscles.

418
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:08,880
By the way, when doing the bench press,
sticking out your chest makes it easier.

419
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,050
Lower the bar right above your chest.

420
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,118
Let’s try.

421
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,794
-Like this?
-Very good.

422
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,533
You did it!

423
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,703
That’s a new record!

424
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,406
-Yay!
-Yay!

425
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,577
I can also give you advice
on your daily diet.

426
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,446
You can get in touch with me here.

427
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,781
Okay.

428
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,250
Thank you.

429
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,788
Hey, you’re moving. It won’t scan.

430
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,591
It should be around here…

431
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,193
Here it is.

432
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,832
Oh, that.

433
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,668
He showed me that once too.

434
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,605
Even though he didn’t get to see him much,

435
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,306
he was

436
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,709
so proud of Mr. Kinto.

437
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,677
I know, right?

438
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,099
TO MARIE ANTOINETTE

439
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,171
How did I not notice this?

440
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:46,811
What’s wrong?

441
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,979
Ms. Sophie,

442
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,615
does your real name…

443
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,084
happen to be…

444
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,221
Can it be…

445
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,571
Don’t touch that.

446
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,472
You scared me.

447
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,907
Did that scare you?

448
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,909
Are there really precious beans in there?

449
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,481
It’s not like that.

450
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,687
Please don’t get mad at me.

451
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,469
Oh…

452
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:48,373
Grandpa Kyosha was surprisingly classy.

453
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,412
TOMONAGA HIDEKI

454
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,514
Hello?

455
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,352
This way, please.

456
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,854
President.

457
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,324
Mr. Haie, how can I help you?

458
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,095
Your company sure is amazing.

459
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:13,231
Among your wide range of apps,
from taxi to food services,

460
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,133
you even have a <i>shogi</i> app.

461
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,967
HONEST SHOGI

462
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,871
I use it too, after I heard about it from
my ex-girlfriend who's good at <i>shogi.</i>

463
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,339
I even make in-app purchases.

464
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,341
Please make this quick.

465
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,944
I just wanted to

466
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,313
clear up one misunderstanding.

467
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,348
About what?

468
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,819
About the fact that Mr. Kyosha hated you.

469
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,790
You think that's a misunderstanding?

470
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,028
You started your company
while you were in school

471
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,697
and have been in this business
for 25 years.

472
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,067
This is something

473
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,869
Mr. Kyosha showed me the other day

474
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,204
when I went over to play <i>shogi</i> with him.

475
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:54,839
LANCE

476
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,307
DRAGON KING

477
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,011
You win.

478
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:04,082
You can never win against me, can you?

479
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,320
I have a high rank
on this <i>shogi</i> app, though.

480
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,555
What a useless app.

481
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:11,856
What?

482
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,892
Wait a second.

483
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,304
That's my son's company.

484
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,605
HONEST APP

485
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:31,443
How dare you call
the app my son developed "useless."

486
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,545
Unforgivable.

487
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,414
That is why

488
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,484
you will always be a pathetic detective.

489
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,589
My father

490
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,158
said that?

491
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,427
You seem surprised.

492
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,530
Every time I'd see him…

493
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,835
Hey.

494
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,974
Don't get so caught up in work
that you forget about your health.

495
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,546
I always thought he was just
a nagging dad.

496
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,886
Actually, there is something
even more surprising…

497
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:20,725
The thing is, I finally figured out
the meaning behind that will.

498
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,730
Can I borrow you for a minute?

499
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,298
It won't take long.

500
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,639
Sensei, Ms. Saito from next door
unlocked the door for us.

501
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,640
Thanks for coming.

502
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,510
Alrighty.

503
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,447
Attorney Fukushi!

504
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,948
How are things going?

505
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,750
Ms. Reiko!

506
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,719
-Thanks to you, I'm doing great!
-Nice.

507
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:49,988
What is going on?

508
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,590
He is a VIP member at the gym I work at.

509
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,530
This better be good,
since you made me come all the way here.

510
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:01,432
I'll tell you the meaning

511
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:05,503
behind the will that a certain
useless legal adviser wasn't able to see.

512
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,340
First, let me ask Mr. Kinto one thing.

513
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,009
The relationship between

514
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:14,412
you and your father became strained
31 years ago,

515
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,548
when you were 14, am I right?

516
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:18,883
How do you know?

517
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,587
Something comes to mind, I assume?

518
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,789
Around that time, there was a woman

519
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,926
Mr. Kyosha wanted to remarry.

520
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,396
<i>Do you have a second?</i>

521
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:33,798
What?

522
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:34,766
I'm…

523
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,069
thinking about getting remarried.

524
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,737
Huh?

525
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,474
How can you forget about Mom!

526
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,252
Is that true?

527
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,189
Yes, I remember that happening.

528
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,028
Well then, Reiko.

529
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:05,830
Come in.

530
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,203
Excuse me.

531
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,108
Allow me to
introduce you again to Tomonaga

532
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:20,478
and Ms. Sophie, the manager of Louis XVI,
the rescued cat café

533
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,248
where Mr. Kyosha adopted Maribo.

534
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,684
Thank you for coming to his funeral.

535
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,859
Ms. Sophie! Please tell us your real name.

536
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,263
My name is Honjo Miyuki.

537
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,698
In other words, "Sophie"

538
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,167
is a nickname
that her family members have been

539
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,236
using since she was small.

540
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,504
I see.

541
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:51,175
If I remember correctly, Louis XVI
had a daughter named Sophie.

542
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,644
Hence, the name of your café…

543
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,579
That's right.

544
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,348
Impressive, Attorney Fukushi!
You're so knowledgeable.

545
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,350
S'up…

546
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,753
Although, the first one
who noticed was Tomonaga.

547
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,521
Indeed.

548
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:07,458
And the wife of Louis XVI

549
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:10,295
and the mother of Sophie was…

550
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:14,132
-Marie Antoinette.
-Marie Antoinette.

551
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:21,039
Don't tell me my father

552
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,208
mistook you for being Marie Antoinette.

553
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,210
I see.

554
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,379
Whether he was a pervert
or he was serious,

555
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,814
it's a possibility.

556
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,849
He's not a pervert. How rude.

557
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,785
You are wrong.

558
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,286
Ms. Sophie.

559
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,690
Please tell us your mother's real name.

560
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:39,624
Okay.

561
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:44,262
My mother's name is
Honjo Marie Antoinette.

562
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:45,997
I see…

563
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,132
Huh?

564
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,803
It always surprises everyone.

565
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,373
So usually, she just goes by "Marie."

566
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:58,676
One moment.

567
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,085
This can right here…

568
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:08,987
Once,

569
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,523
I tried to open it,
but Mr. Kyosha stopped me very firmly.

570
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,596
What an old photo…

571
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,434
Oh…

572
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,636
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION
OCTOBER 1993

573
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:26,838
Yes.

574
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:30,108
It's Mr. Kyosha and Ms. Marie Antoinette's
marriage registration.

575
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,377
The date is 31 years ago.

576
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:36,547
It's from when
Mr. Kyosha was 39 and Mr. Kinto was 14.

577
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:37,949
Most likely,

578
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:41,452
he considered the fact that
you were at an impressionable age

579
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,755
and gave up on marrying.

580
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,657
Ms. Marie agreed to that,

581
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,127
and in time, got married to someone else.

582
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,094
Ms. Miyuki was born

583
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,830
and people called her Sophie.

584
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,933
You have a great imagination, as usual.

585
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,236
They could have had a fight and broke up

586
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,837
right before getting married.

587
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,039
In that case,

588
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,342
would he have kept the papers
this whole time,

589
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,678
as if putting it in a time capsule?

590
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,252
Additionally, even after that,

591
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,954
Grandpa Kyosha and Ms. Marie

592
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,556
stayed somewhat connected.

593
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:20,792
What?

594
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:27,197
By supporting
her animal conservation efforts.

595
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:33,971
Her mother runs the parent organization
that owns Ms. Sophie's café.

596
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:37,007
Mr. Kyosha supported
that organization as well.

597
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,243
But he did so anonymously.

598
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,012
Really?

599
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:45,083
Not just my café,
but my mother's place as well?

600
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:52,223
My mother never mentioned
anything about Mr. Kato.

601
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,458
I see.

602
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,668
I…

603
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,504
didn't know anything.

604
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,813
Thank you for everything you've done

605
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:17,648
for my father.

606
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,983
I didn't do anything.

607
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,818
I should be thanking him.

608
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:22,753
Um…

609
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,691
Where is Ms. Marie Antoinette right now?

610
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,694
She's at a conservation center

611
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,630
in Shizuoka with my husband
who is a veterinarian.

612
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,065
Husband?

613
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,867
Yes.

614
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:09,634
Long time no see.

615
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,136
You didn't go to Shizuoka?

616
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,205
I have my other job to do.

617
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,742
We aren't getting paid
a single yen this time either.

618
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,878
How can he work so tirelessly
for dead people

619
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,781
when he's not going to
make any profit out of it?

620
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:26,984
What?

621
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,688
Thank you.

622
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,664
He said he hates the phrase,
"Dead men tell no tales."

623
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,765
What's the reason?

624
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,066
Ask him.

625
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,168
I'm asking
because he always evades the question.

626
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,638
Well, why are <i>you</i> here
even though we make no money?

627
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,574
That's…

628
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,479
Well Mr. Tomonaga, you also

629
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,248
stick around Sensei even though

630
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:00,952
he doesn't pay you back and keeps
borrowing money from you.

631
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,520
Exactly!

632
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:03,721
That was loud.

633
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,924
He can never pay back the amount
I lent him in his lifetime.

634
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,092
That much?

635
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,026
But…

636
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,430
I believe that he is

637
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,533
worth the money I lent him.

638
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,500
Huh?

639
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,303
You guys have some kind of bromance?

640
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,039
No, the money is to fund our war.

641
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,441
War?

642
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,776
His enemy…

643
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,714
is also my enemy.

644
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,130
Thank you.

645
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,969
Come here.

646
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:00,111
This is…

647
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,046
The animal conservation center that

648
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,383
Ms. Sophie's mother, Ms. Marie,
built from scratch.

649
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,087
Welcome!

650
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:11,889
SOPHIE'S MOTHER
HONJO MARIE ANTOINETTE

651
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,125
You must be Kinto.

652
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,296
Nice to meet you. I'm Marie.

653
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,298
Hello.

654
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,139
I finally get to meet you.

655
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,908
So you knew my father…

656
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:32,843
I need to

657
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:36,781
thank your father for his support.

658
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,983
-For so many years.
-It's nothing…

659
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,753
I was so surprised when
I heard from my daughter.

660
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,357
I can't believe the one who was
donating anonymously

661
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,159
was Mr. Kyosha.

662
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,660
He was classy like that.

663
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:54,932
I've…

664
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,669
always been worried.

665
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,339
That I might have

666
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,741
hurt your feelings when you were

667
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,978
still at an impressionable age.

668
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,814
No, back then…

669
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,752
I was just a brat. It's embarrassing.

670
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:15,953
Not at all.

671
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,389
You were always

672
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,257
the most important thing to him

673
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,793
from back then.

674
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,063
Is that so?

675
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,336
That reminds me,

676
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,473
I almost forgot to report one thing.

677
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,776
The other day,

678
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,945
with Mr. Kinto's approval,

679
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:44,815
I had Tomonaga look through
Mr. Kyosha's bank accounts.

680
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,984
And we discovered something new.

681
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:51,555
Mr. Kyosha

682
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:55,793
had been buying your company's stock
under his relative's name.

683
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,261
What?

684
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,630
TRANSACTIONS

685
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,198
TRANSFER - KATO KAKUGYO

686
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,967
Ms. Saito from next door

687
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,669
remembers overhearing him
talking about that

688
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,405
on the phone.

689
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,108
I have to use your name instead of mine,

690
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,911
or else Kinto isn't going to like it.

691
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,184
Even when his own store…

692
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,089
was on the verge of going bankrupt…

693
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,329
He was supporting me…

694
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,301
without saying a word.

695
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,194
It all makes sense to me now.

696
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,497
Thanks to the will,

697
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,033
I was able to meet you, Ms. Marie.

698
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,039
I will respect my father's wish.

699
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,776
As per his will,

700
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:20,611
the inheritance

701
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,080
will go to Ms. Marie Antoinette.

702
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,449
-Oh my!
-But…

703
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,020
May I keep Marie Antoinette, the cat?

704
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:33,424
Of course.

705
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,995
If I remember correctly,
you like cats, right?

706
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,407
Grandpa Kyosha…

707
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,446
your last letter

708
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,982
reached them all right.

709
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,826
But man,

710
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,762
that sure was an interesting will.

711
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,400
Even I, his son,
thought he had gone senile.

712
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,705
This mystery was solved because you were
the only one who believed him.

713
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:22,773
I can't thank you enough.

714
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,643
It's nothing…

715
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,414
To be honest,
I feel partly responsible for this.

716
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,985
Before he got Maribo…

717
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:38,822
A will?

718
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,990
Yeah.

719
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:43,694
You're still healthy
and you only have one son,

720
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,263
so you might not have
anything to worry about,

721
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,533
but wills are the last love letters
we send to the living.

722
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,603
-Love letters?
-Yes.

723
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,272
Then write one for me.

724
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,576
There's no point in a love letter
unless you write it yourself.

725
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,780
<i>After that,</i>

726
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,115
Mr. Kyosha adopted Maribo.

727
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,751
And he probably thought,

728
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:11,589
<i>he didn't want to hurt his son</i>
<i>by writing Ms. Marie's name.</i>

729
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:15,292
<i>But he wanted to support her cause</i>
<i>even after his death.</i>

730
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,162
<i>And his son didn't need</i>
<i>any financial help.</i>

731
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:21,732
<i>In that case, he would follow his heart.</i>

732
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:23,601
‪All right!‬

733
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:25,736
I've made up my mind.

734
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,272
This is the best way.

735
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,079
<i>I think he was</i>

736
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,114
too shy to express his feelings.

737
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:41,752
You might be right.

738
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,859
I don't know if it was just me

739
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:52,363
trying to be rebellious,
but I didn't want to touch <i>shogi.</i>

740
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,332
Does that mean

741
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,802
you had your employees work on that
<i>shogi</i> app for you?

742
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:07,177
Just like I made others
take care of my dad.

743
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,917
I hoped that one day…

744
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:17,321
I would be able…

745
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,425
to understand my father.

746
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,460
I thought I could.

747
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:32,736
By the time you wish

748
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:36,273
to show filial love,
your parents are gone.

749
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,577
I totally agree.

750
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,414
KING

751
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,188
<i>-Dad!</i>
-Grandpa!

752
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:52,723
<i>-What is going on?</i>
<i>-I will fight.</i>

753
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,458
<i>To the Eternal Capital we go!</i>

754
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,559
