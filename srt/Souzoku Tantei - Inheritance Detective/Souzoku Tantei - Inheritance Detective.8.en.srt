00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:08,675
<i>The scoop was about Professor Yabuuchi</i>
<i>having seven illegitimate children.</i>

2
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,643
<i>-It sent the public into a frenzy.</i>
-Mrs. Yabuuchi!

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,711
<i>Involved in this was…</i>

4
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:15,682
<i>You're a former lawyer with a history</i>
<i>of embezzlement after all.</i>

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,784
<i>-That was when…</i>
-Professor Ogikubo.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,687
<i>I want you to dispel</i>
<i>these ridiculous allegations.</i>

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:24,657
<i>As we investigated this case,</i>
<i>we uncovered the shocking truth.</i>

8
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,092
-Twins?
-Bingo!

9
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,927
That was faster than expected.

10
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,997
<i>The reason Goda instigated</i>
<i>the illegitimate children allegations</i>

11
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,999
<i>was to tarnish</i>
<i>Professor Yabuuchi's reputation.</i>

12
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,236
<i>But what I’m worried about is his wife.</i>

13
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,771
<i>She might even…</i>

14
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,939
Are there any people in this world

15
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,275
<i>who are not guilty of anything?</i>

16
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,010

20

I see.

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,766
His twin brother used his son's DNA, huh?

26
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,337
He must have led a very turbulent life.

27
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,241
You will publish
a correction article, right?

28
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,810
Of course.

29
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,578
We will publish a correction article

30
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,281
about the seven illegitimate children.

31
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,585

I'm glad you understand.

33

We completed our mission,

34
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,693
but it's still not a happy ending.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,928
Even if it was just a rumor,

36
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:38,264
we can't undo the damage done
to Professor Yabuuchi's reputation.

37
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,901
But if you think about
Mr. Goda's unfortunate background…

38
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,638
You know, once I set my eyes on a target,

39
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,208
I never miss.

40
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,477
What's the matter?

41
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,313
Nothing.

Yes?

50
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,339
Um, I found you online,

51
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,407
but are you appointment only?

52
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,376

-Come in.

54
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,914
I'm Haie.

55
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,350
My name is Masaki Shimada.

-Is coffee okay?
-Yes.

57
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,388
-Thank you.
-No problem.

58
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:37,724
Masaki,

59
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,226
what brings you here today?

60
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,028
Um…

61
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,998
You know how

62
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,300
talk shows are all talking about

63
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,135
Professor Yabuuchi's
illegitimate children?

64
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,437
All seven of them were fake.

65
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,872
A correction just came out.

66
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,910
Oh, really?

67
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,378
What about that?

68
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,379
Well…

69
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,281
the truth is…

70
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,351
my mother, who died, had told me that

71
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,820
Professor Yabuuchi was my father.

72
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,489
-What?
-What?

73
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,991
-What?
-No, um…

74
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,294
It's not like I have
any proof or anything.

75
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:19,032
It's just that, when I saw the article
about his illegitimate children,

76
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,833
I thought that maybe

77
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,937
my mother was telling the truth.

78
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,273
I became curious,

79
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,843
and when I did a search online,
I found your website.

80
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,214
Online, huh?

81
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,082
More like, we had a website?

82
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,484
I secretly made one
that will come up whenever you search

83
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,919
anything related to inheritance.

84
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,521
An ad agency would've charged a fortune.

85
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,932
Do you perhaps think that
I'm after his money?

86
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,101
We didn't say that--

87
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,836
-Honestly, that's what I think.
-Stop.

88
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,504
I thought so.

89
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,747
This is my mother's cellphone.

90
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,917
All that's left is this wallpaper.

91
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,487
That is, indeed, Professor Yabuuchi,

92
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,089
but that doesn't prove much.

93
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,827
He looks peaceful.

94
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,269
Can I borrow this cellphone?

95
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,538
-I want to look into it.
-Huh?

96
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,208
Mr. Haie, are you serious?

97
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,712
Also, just in case, will you let us
collect your DNA?

98
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,381
Do you have an ID too?

99
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,951
Yes. Thank you.

100
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,776
Sensei, this is bad. Really bad.

101
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,278
What am I supposed to do now?

102
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,514
That's enough.

103
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,583
<i>Sometimes the truth can be the most simple</i>

104
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,919
<i>and most cruel outcome.</i>

105
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,630
<i>When an article dies…</i>

106
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,597
<i>Actually,</i>

107
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,001
when an article is killed…

108
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,039
it sells for an even higher price
the second time around.

109
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,081
Welcome back.

110
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,917
How was it?

111
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:55,221
The paternity test says
the probability of paternity is 99.9%.

112
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,457
It is very likely that Mr. Masaki Shimada

113
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,292
is Professor Yabuuchi's child.

114
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,395
Of course, it is also possible
that Goda is the father.

115
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,529
Seriously?

116
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,198
I see.

117
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,900
Also, I don't know
if you already looked it up but…

118
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,370
You mean the joint guarantor
for Masaki's house?

119
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,471
-What?
-Yes.

120
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,440
His joint guarantor is Hareru Yabuuchi.

121
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,175
What! That's…

122
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:20,446
In other words, it proves that he was
very close to Mr. Masaki's mother.

123
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,348
Like a lover?

124
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,917
This might be enough to prove to the court

125
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,153
that Mr. Masaki is
Professor Yabuuchi's child.

126
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,324
We found a skeleton in the closet

127
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,460
along with some other unsavory truths.

128
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,130
We sure did.

129
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,501
Thanks to you, we were able to prove

130
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,935
Yabuuchi's innocence.

131
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,407
I'm so glad I asked you.

132
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,843
Actually, I can't really celebrate.

133
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,546
The truth is,

134
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,483
Professor Yabuuchi's
real illegitimate child appeared.

135
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,554
-No way.
-Masaki Shimada.

136
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,924
He's 20 years old.

137
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,192
MASAKI SHIMADA

138
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,463
It must be some mistake…

139
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,166
right?

140
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,334
No?

141
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,272
We confirmed it.

142
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,446
Doing this job makes me realize that

143
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,183
sometimes the truth can be the most simple

144
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,517
and yet

145
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,453
most cruel outcome.

146
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,125
What are we supposed to do?

147
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,427
That is

148
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,163
not something we should decide.

149
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,032
First and foremost,

150
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,267
I'll go report back
to the person this involves.

151
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,672
So my mother was telling the truth?

152
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,073
Yeah.

153
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,875
It was true.

154
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,745
I see…

155
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,485
So what am I supposed to do now?

156
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,620
There are two ways to go about it.

157
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,624
One is to start
a posthumous paternity action.

158
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:16,262
Another is to accept a settlement
and not start an action.

159
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,598
I see.

160
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,436
Which one do you recommend, Mr. Haie?

161
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,472
That is something you need to decide.

162
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,508
Plus, I am not a lawyer,

163
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,244
so all I can do is
share my personal opinion.

164
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,613
Please share that with me.

165
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,315
Of course,

166
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,251
if it's true, it is only logical

167
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:42,087
to start a posthumous paternity action,
in accordance with the law.

168
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,289
It's just that

169
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,225
this situation is a little special.

170
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:50,029
Right now,
Professor Yabuuchi's rumor is still

171
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,098
fresh in people's memory.

172
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,967
If you start
a posthumous paternity action now,

173
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,337
the media will most definitely
make a big fuss about it.

174
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,306
They might write stories

175
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,643
about you and your mother,
regardless of whether

176
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,378
it's true or not.

177
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,313
Not to mention social media,

178
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,650
which can irresponsibly hurt you
like a weapon.

179
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,755
But if you still want to
publicize the truth

180
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,824
for you and your mother's honor,
despite all of that,

181
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,059
that's an option.

182
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,395
I won't stop you.

183
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,779
My mother

184
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,915
<i>said that Professor Yabuuchi…</i>

185
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,050
Say hello.

186
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,117
<i>…was a relative.</i>

187
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,052
Hello.

188
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,956
<i>-I’d see him only once every few years.</i>
-You've grown up.

189
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,291
-Wow.
<i>-But then…</i>

190
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,962
<i>right before she died, she told me</i>

191
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,065
<i>for the first time that</i>
<i>Professor Yabuuchi was my father.</i>

192
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,868
At her funeral,

193
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,439
I mustered up courage
and told my relatives.

194
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,506
MASAMI SHIMADA

195
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,774
<i>But they told me,</i>

196
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,178
<i>"That's nonsense. She was just a caddie</i>
<i>and he was a member of the golf club."</i>

197
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,180
You're not a child anymore.

198
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,282
<i>Nobody believed her</i>

199
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,085
and they even called me a liar.

200
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:29,328
Professor Yabuuchi was known for his
squeaky-clean reputation, after all.

201
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,398
Honestly,

202
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,768
part of me didn't believe her either.

203
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:39,872
But

204
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,842
I didn't want to

205
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,811
doubt my mother, who raised me

206
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,281
all on her own.

207
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,518
I'm sorry for keeping it a secret

208
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,787
all this time.

209
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,804
Your mother

210
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,408
must have been contemplating
for a long time

211
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,511
whether or not to tell you the truth.

212
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,856
You must have gone through hardships
and endured a lot too.

213
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,159
If you think about it that way,

214
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,162
you have nothing to feel bad about.

215
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,798
Think hard about it

216
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,701
and make a decision that
you can be happy with.

217
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,038
Okay.

218
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,342
I will think about it

219
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,080
overnight with my late mother.

220
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,390
Thank you very much.

221
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,159
I'll contact you again.

222
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,060
Okay.

223
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,236
Bye.

224
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,888
HAIE INHERITANCE INVESTIGATION OFFICE

225
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,657
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

226
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,928
I made a decision.

227
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,133
I will not start a posthumous paternity

228
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,234
action.

229
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,270
I also don't need any money.

230
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,471
Huh?

231
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,673
What made you decide on that?

232
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,748
I was looking at this photo

233
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:06,185
and thought,
"Maybe my mother was happy as is."

234
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:11,590
But

235
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,593
if I make the truth known,

236
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,130
I felt like I would dim my mother's smile.

237
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,901
I see.

238
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,271
But is that what you want?

239
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,205
Yes.

240
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,543
Because you guys confirmed the truth,

241
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,913
I feel like my mother's words
and my own existence

242
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,549
have been heard and recognized.

243
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,717
So that's enough.

244
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,020
Thank you very much.

245
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,291
Okay.

246
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,259
But

247
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,229
I think you should receive whatever money

248
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,697
you're entitled to.

249
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,302
That house that's filled with
memories of you and your mother

250
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,772
needs to be maintained,
and that requires money.

251
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,275
Like repair costs for wear and tear.

252
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,846
Just inheriting that house alone
may lead to inheritance taxes.

253
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,814
-That's right.
-Exactly.

254
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:13,752
In our case,

255
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,488
I was told that we were below

256
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:20,059
the standard deduction amount
for inheritance taxes or something,

257
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,965
so it seems like
I don't have to pay any taxes.

258
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,069
But the house itself is pretty old,

259
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,538
so it would be helpful

260
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,074
if I could receive
a reasonable amount of money

261
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,109
just for repairs.

262
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,414
A real illegitimate child?

263
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,486
You're right…

264
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,388
He looks just like Yabuuchi.

265
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,896
Please don't worry about me.

266
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,264
I'm so sorry.

267
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,667
I was trying to subdue the situation,

268
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,770
but I ended up uncovering truths
that we didn't need to know.

269
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,144
Mr. Haie.

270
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,380
You know,

271
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,984
I want to give Mr. Masaki

272
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,053
all of Yabuuchi's assets.

273
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,622
All of it?

274
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,459
-Mrs. Sagami, calm down.
-I am calm.

275
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,498
More like,

276
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,234
I had an inkling

277
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,569
that someone like

278
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,139
Mr. Masaki existed.

279
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,575
You can call it

280
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,844
a wife's instincts.

281
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,218
Is that right…

282
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,555
So I was already thinking about
throwing away all of

283
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,991
Yabuuchi's things
even before all of this happened.

284
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:04,430
His important little awards and medals,
inheritance, and everything.

285
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,569
You said that

286
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,806
you were going to keep the fact that
Mr. Masaki is

287
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,142
his real illegitimate son a secret.

288
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:18,744
But…

289
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,281
is that really okay?

290
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,918
I feel like

291
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,220
the right thing to do

292
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,725
is to make Yabuuchi's scandal
known to the public.

293
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,892
-Excuse me.
-But…

294
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,563
I know I'm in no place to say this,

295
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,365
but I believe a family's memories,

296
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,068
whether they're positive or negative,

297
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,006
are best kept within the family.

298
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,443
You have every right to be mad,

299
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,545
but this issue is going to be
an easy target

300
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,414
for the press and public.

301
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,717
I think it's best that you avoid
getting even more

302
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,753
insensitive reporters interviewing you.

303
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,498
That's true.

304
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,968
I guess

305
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,304
you're right, Mr. Haie.

306
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:25,344
I am sorry for upsetting you.

307
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,412
It's nothing.

308
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,516
You know,

309
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,519
something has always been bothering me.

310
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,726
This photo…

311
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,730
I wondered who took it.

312
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,502
His eyes look so kind, don't they?

313
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,413
Well,

314
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,215
I actually feel relieved

315
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,584
now that the mystery is solved.

316
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,122
Professor Ogikubo,

317
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,958
thank you very much

318
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,626
for thinking about me.

319
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,403
You know…

320
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,438
Nowadays,

321
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,575
they say it's normal to live until 100.

322
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,145
Although,

323
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,715
the amount of time
you can spend healthy is limited.

324
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,286
I want to enjoy

325
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,725
that limited amount of time
to the best of my ability.

326
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,763
Not as Yabuuchi's wife,

327
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,299
but a free…

328
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,005
new life.

329
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,745
-Again?
-Again.

330
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,180
Ready…

331
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,152
30 PASSENGERS DEAD
900 MILLION YEN IN COMPENSATION

332
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,754
DRIVER FELL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL
OVERWORKED

333
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,961
Mom,

334
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,898
were you happy?

335
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,404
We found a malignant tumor
in your pancreas.

336
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,439
You have cancer.

337
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,543
We need to admit you into the hospital

338
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,111
and check the metastasis--

339
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,012
Doctor.

340
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,948
Please be honest with me.

341
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,485
If I get hospitalized now,

342
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,254
as you say,

343
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,057
when will I be able to

344
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,426
go back to work?

345
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,729
-That is…
-In one month?

346
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,199
In three months?

347
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,134
I can't say for sure.

348
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,670
Well then…

349
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:11,577
I'd better do what I need to do
before that, right?

350
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:12,778
But…

351
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,349
Do you have any family members
who can come?

352
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,984
Anybody who can support you--

353
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,220
I told you I don't have anyone!

354
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,023
So tell me…

355
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,894
If I'm not hospitalized now,

356
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,095
how long

357
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,664
will I have to live?

358
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,935
How long will I live?

359
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,706
Unless you start treatment right away,
you might only have

360
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,307
three months to live.

361
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,789
That's enough.

362
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,965
What the heck?

363
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,434
What's the point in uncovering

364
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,837
the deeds of someone who is dead?

365
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:17,175
Is this the kind of journalism
I wanted to do?

366
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,861
Reiko?

367
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,996
Sensei, this is bad. Really bad.

368
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,132
Calm down, will you?

369
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,335

‪SODEN PUBLISHING‬

379
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:38,590
What was that for?

380
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,631
Is bullying the weak

381
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,334
what you call "journalism"?

382
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,872
In what way is that article
in the public interest?

383
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,441
Shame on you.

384
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,614
I don't want to hear it from a hyena.

385
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,590
You damn vulture!

386
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,058
-What?
-A fight?

387
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,161
It's a fight.

-Damn you!

389

Sensei!

393
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,246
If Ms. Reiko hadn't called me,

394
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,281
you would've been in trouble.

395
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,250
Hageta was taken to the hospital,

396
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,118
but he only had minor injuries.

397
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,320
Sensei, are you okay?

398
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,523
Yeah, somewhat.

399
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,893
Harming the media is viewed as a threat

400
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,561
to freedom of expression--

401
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,463
Who was the one who truly

402
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,799
did harm?

403
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,905
Reiko, lend me your bike.

404
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,340
Hey. I'm still talking to you.

405
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,058
Do you feel a little better now?

406
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,405
My father who raised me

407
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,374
was a bus driver.

408
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:41,012
He started a small bus company

409
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,682
and was working hard.

410
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,919
Up until 18 years ago,

411
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,556
when he died during a driving accident,

412
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,994
I thought that he was my real father.

413
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,364
That's how much

414
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,767
of a good father he was.

415
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,306
It was an unfortunate accident
caused by strong winds.

416
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,709
But

417
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,878
before we knew it…

418
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,415
the media started to spread stories about

419
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,484
how my father fell asleep at the wheel.

420
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,320
At his court case…

421
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,658
they even manipulated his verdict.

422
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,394
That's terrible.

423
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,065
The one who pressured
the judge into doing that…

424
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,637
was a big shot in the legal world,

425
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,105
Kengo Jidori.

426
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:43,942
<i>My…</i>

427
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,379
biological father.

428
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,582
What?

429
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,252
I…

430
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:58,056
became a lawyer in order to clear

431
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,624
my father's name.

432
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:01,860
However,

433
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,796
the moment I got a hold of evidence that

434
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,298
proved Jidori's involvement,

435
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,400
they silenced me…

436
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,405
by spouting a bunch of lies about me.

437
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,441
That's why you were
shunned by the legal community?

438
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:17,909
Yeah.

439
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,815
Is your debt…?

440
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:28,587
<i>Maybe we should've renounced inheritance</i>
<i>like the lawyer said?</i>

441
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,058
I…

442
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,061
don't want to run away.

443
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,832
I don't want to back down.

444
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,103
Because

445
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,472
I believe your father.

446
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,310
Part of it was paid
by the insurance company.

447
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,715
But still, the remaining compensation
was an enormous amount.

448
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,218
Jidori wanted my mother and I to

449
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,989
be burdened by that
for the rest of our lives.

450
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,563
Mom…

451
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,166
would've been able to live

452
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,737
a happier life if I wasn't born.

453
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,775
I don't think that's true.

454
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,147
Look at my mother…

455
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,617
In the end, mothers

456
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,454
love their children.

457
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:38,957
Plus,

458
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,494
if you were to ask me,

459
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,165
I would not be

460
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,136
alive now if I hadn't met you.

461
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,511
This might sound weird but…

462
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,686
thank you for being born.

463
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,714
Good morning.

464
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,590
Hello, this is
Haie Inheritance Investigation Office.

465
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,358
<i>Attorney Fukushi?</i>

466
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,860
Is Haie there?

467
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,297
Sensei…

468
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,301
might be out for a while.
What do you need?

469
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,538
It seems like…

470
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:01,439
HAIE FAMILY GRAVE

471
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,808
…I've reached a turning point,

472
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:05,944
Dad.

473
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:07,812
Nao?

474
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,249
Mom?

475
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,051
HAIE'S MOTHER
MIYUKI HAIE

476
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,521
How have you been?

477
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,323
How about you?

478
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,892
Are you eating?

479
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,761
That again?

480
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,329
I am eating just fine.

481
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:38,676
Thank you.

482
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,662
Mom.

483
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,800
I've never told you this before,

484
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,234
but there is

485
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,803
something I want you to know.

486
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,376
When I'm done with
what I'm working on right now,

487
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,011
I plan

488
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,080
to settle the score for Dad.

489
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,552
That man will do

490
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,054
anything to put me, you,

491
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,356
and Dad through anguish.

492
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,292
But

493
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,196
if I make the truth
about Dad's accident known,

494
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,399
I can end Jidori.

495
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:39,938
-Then you'll be able to live more freely.
-Nao.

496
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,042
I am

497
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:48,279
happy enough just seeing you

498
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,748
alive and well.

499
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:52,517
What?

500
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,987
You are the only thing

501
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,423
I look forward to in life.

502
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,493
You are

503
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,663
the only reason why

504
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,566
I am living right now.

505
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:11,870
So…

506
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,874
you don't have to fight anyone.

507
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,845
Stop being haunted by the past.

508
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,150
I want you to be free.

509
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,188
Mom…

510
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,529
But I…

511
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,135
want to protect Dad's honor.

512
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,206
If I don't do it, who else will?

513
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,008
Nao.

514
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,545
Dad…

515
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,316
I promise to settle the score

516
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,984
for you.

517
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,741
Shaking off reporters is a piece of cake.

518
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:33,885
Hello.

519
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,988
Thank you for your invitation.

520
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,157
This is Masaki.

521
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:42,860
Nice to meet you.

522
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,029
I'm Masaki Shimada.

523
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,133
I'm Yabuuchi.

524
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,702
Please come in.

525
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,805
Thank you.

526
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,076
Thank you

527
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,812
for agreeing to meet me.

528
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,548
I'm sorry my mother caused you trouble.

529
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,719
No, I should be the one to apologize.

530
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,557
I'm terribly sorry for what Yabuuchi did.

531
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,060
I'm sure

532
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,464
you went through a lot of pain.

533
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,034
It's okay,
I was always told that my father was dead.

534
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,776
Go ahead and eat while it's hot.

535
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,177
-Come on.
-Okay.

536
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,278
Thank you for the food.

537
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,948
I hope you like it.

538
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,053
It's delicious.

539
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,658
Oh, I'm so glad.

540
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,361
The bread is freshly baked too!

541
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,397
-Everything tastes amazing!
-Stop.

542
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,966
You suck at describing food, Sensei.

543
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,003
I've never had meat that was this tender.

544
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,142
It's called Shinshu Wagyu.

545
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:06,711
Go ahead

546
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,413
and have this one too.

547
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,081
Really?

548
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,350
-Here.
-Thank you.

549
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,484
Enjoy.

550
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:24,629
What's wrong?

551
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:30,802
I wish I could let my mother eat this too.

552
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,476
Oh, I'm sorry. That was weird.

553
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:49,987
Come back for a meal anytime.

554
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,121
Okay?

555
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:52,590
I'll make anything.

556
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:57,528
It'll be

557
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,298
lonely all by myself, anyway.

558
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,769
Thank you.

559
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,444
I'm glad it worked out.

560
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,714
Even if it's a complicated relationship,

561
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,916
sometimes people just get along.

562
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,086
On the other hand,
some can never get along.

563
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,856
Are you talking about you and me?

564
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,557
-Oh!
-Ugh!

565
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,260
To what do I owe this honor,

566
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,496
Great Attorney Fukushi?

567
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,066
I made time out of my busy schedule.

568
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,770
Vulture, for some reason,

569
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:43,040
is not going to press charges
for your assault.

570
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,742
Vulture said that?

571
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,545
Does he finally feel a little sorry?

572
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,579
You idiot.

573
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,217
Vulture apparently asked
the editor in chief

574
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,453
to not publish his article.

575
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,088
However,

576
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,524
the article made it out.

577
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,425
-Huh?
-Really?

578
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,461
Yes.

579
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,030
-Then why…
-…did the article get published?

580
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,635
<i>I'll make sure to teach him</i>
<i>what will happen</i>

581
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,604
if he does anything unnecessary.

582
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,309
Maybe

583
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,812
they were pressured to do so by somebody.

584
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:30,821
Haie,

585
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,325
I've been recruiting
Ms. Reiko for a while.

586
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,726
Even if she stays with you,

587
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,196
there is nothing she can gain.

588
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,133
I want her to come to my office.

589
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,034
How about it?

590
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,438
Attorney Fukushi,
I will have to turn down your offer--

591
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,673
No.

592
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,742
Reiko

593
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,345
is a super capable assistant.

594
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,414
Please offer her
the best working conditions.

595
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,017
-Sensei, what are you…?
-Of course.

596
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,421
I plan to give Ms. Reiko
whatever she asks for.

597
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,256
Well then, that's settled.

598
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,658
Why? Why are you making decisions for me?

599
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,493
Now, calm down.

600
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,230
Great Attorney Fukushi,

601
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,232
will you leave us alone for a bit?

602
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,814
Sensei, I'm not going, all right?

603
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,085
Reiko…

604
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,188
The thing is…

605
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,959
I decided to close this office.

606
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,332
Huh?

607
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,903
Why is that?

608
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:57,308
There's something I want to
really focus on.

609
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,077
So I want you

610
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,446
to go to Fukushi's place.

611
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,515
Wait a second!

612
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,550
The thing you want to focus on…

613
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,787
I can be of help to you.

614
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:10,855
No…

615
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:12,690
It's okay.

616
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,593
Plus,

617
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,995
I'm sure you'll be able to

618
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,166
do more at Fukushi's office.

619
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,570
You'll be able to save money
to go back to medical school.

620
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,639
You have your mother to worry about too.

621
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,559
Fine.

622
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,995
I don't agree with you, but I'll comply.

623
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,735
-Reiko.
-Yes?

624
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,572
Thank you,

625
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,709
you’re un-bee-lievable.

626
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:07,778
How cheesy.

627
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,668
HAIE INHERITANCE INVESTIGATION OFFICE

628
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,052
Ms. Reiko really quit, huh?

629
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,522
It's better that way.

630
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:54,859
I guess.

631
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,396
Well then,

632
00:39:59,029 --> 00:39:59,930
what shall we do?

633
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,367
First, we'll reveal who used their power

634
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,770
to force the publishing
of Vulture's article.

635
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,071
Then…

636
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,508
I'll settle the score for my Dad.

637
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:16,680
But how will we find new evidence?

638
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:26,390
Ms. Reiko.

639
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,459
SEBUMI LAW OFFICE

640
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:29,794
Welcome.

641
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,795
Sup.

642
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,230
Everyone,

643
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,533
this is our new secretary,

644
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,535
Ms. Reiko Mitomi.

645
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,803
Applause.

646
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:39,804
She looks cool.

647
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,506
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

648
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,420
The difference is like heaven and hell.

649
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,256
Or a luxury hotel and a stable.

650
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,195
My goodness, without Ms. Reiko around,

651
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,464
this place is worse than a stable.

652
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,370
Hello, this is
Haie Inheritance Investigation Office.

653
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,439
I'm sorry, but we're closing this office--

654
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:16,507
<i>Hey.</i>

655
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,542
Hyena.

656
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,345
Oh, it's just a vulture.

657
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,882
<i>I haven't forgotten</i>
<i>how you punched me the other day.</i>

658
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:25,783
That…

659
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:27,985
You don't have to apologize.

660
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,821
But in exchange, I want to talk.

661
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,291
<i>I see that some judge named Jidori</i>

662
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,026
<i>really hates you.</i>

663
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,663
I know what happened
to your dad's bus accident.

664
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,065
You…

665
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,534
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

666
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,636
I have information that will

667
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,404
overthrow Jidori.

668
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,674
It's a huge scoop.

669
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:51,976
First of all,

670
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,645
the one who pressured the magazine

671
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,081
<i>to publish my article that I tried to stop</i>

672
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,849
<i>was Jidori.</i>

673
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,086
I knew it.

674
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:05,823
He might have done that
because he really hates you.

675
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,093
His skills at gathering information
are impressive.

676
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,495
But why now?

677
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,231
Hyena, what do you think

678
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:16,967
about joining forces with me?

679
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,004
<i>Even if I make a fuss on my own,</i>

680
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,405
the enemy is too powerful

681
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,140
and I'll be silenced right away.

682
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,945
You want to avenge

683
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,747
your dad, don't you?

684
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:37,721
Humans can die at any moment.

685
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:40,357
If that's the case, I thought

686
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,026
it was time to show the public

687
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,528
my passion for journalism,

688
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,430
so that I can die at any time

689
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,631
without regrets.

690
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,035
I want to go up against

691
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,270
real evil this time.

692
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,139
What people would call

693
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,942
"the corruption of the judicial system."

694
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:02,179
A useless second-rate reporter
like you, huh?

695
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:06,250
<i>You're one to talk,</i>
<i>pathetic second-rate detective.</i>

696
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,921
If two second-rates get together,

697
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,657
our force still doubles.

698
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,905
I have 50 million yen in savings.

699
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,374
I have no family.

700
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,810
I'll hire you

701
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,411
for 50 million yen.

702
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,747
I want you to

703
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,717
back me up until the end.

704
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,056
I'm willing to listen.

705
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,558
Come to my office.

706
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:50,294
Idiot.

707
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,429
I'm already here.

708
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,325
Answer me!

709
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,360
And the mutual enemy is Jidori.

710
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:24,995
Please save Sensei.

711
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:25,996
