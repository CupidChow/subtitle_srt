1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:05,638
<i>I decided</i>

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,207
<i>to close this office.</i>

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:10,443
So I want you to go to Fukushi's place.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,445
I don't agree with you, but I'll comply.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,749
<i>I have information that will</i>
<i>overthrow Jidori.</i>

6
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:18,284
<i>Hyena, what do you think</i>

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,919
about joining forces with me?

8
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:22,822
<i>You want to avenge your dad, don't you?</i>

9
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:25,158
<i>If two second-rates get together,</i>

10
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,860
<i>our force still doubles.</i>

11
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:31,464
<i>This moment marked the beginning</i>
<i>of a living hell.</i>

12
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,702
<i>And I would end up being entrusted with</i>
<i>three wills.</i>

13
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,570
<i>Just like a hyena,</i>

14
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,773
<i>I can't help but trace the scent of death.</i>

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,143
<i>This may be my fate</i>
<i>as an inheritance detective.</i>

16
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,177
HAIE FAMILY GRAVE

17
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,349
What is this "scoop"

18
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,283
that you have?

19
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,986
As if I'd tell you, fool.

20
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,555
Answer my questions first.

21
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,725
These are files

22
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,861
on your father, Kazuhiro's Haie,
bus accident.

23
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,397
I'll tell you what I found.

24
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,468
If anything is wrong,
speak up and correct me.

25
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,940
On December 15th, 2006,

26
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,777
a temporary highway bus
fell and crashed in Minamiboso.

27
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,646
<i>At first, everyone thought that</i>

28
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,515
<i>the court would agree</i>
<i>with the defendant's claim</i>

29
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:27,053
<i>that the driver, Mr. Kazuhiro Haie,</i>
<i>was not at fault,</i>

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,889
<i>because that area was famous</i>
<i>for having strong winds.</i>

31
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,826
However…

32
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,763
the moment a newspaper article

33
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,034
suggested that the driver
fell asleep at the wheel,

34
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,937
the public was instantly stirred up

35
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,639
and it even affected
the decision of the court.

36
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,141
DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES

37
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,944
In June 2008,

38
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,680
the court found him guilty
of falling asleep at the wheel.

39
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,882
It's an obvious misjudgment.

40
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:00,420
That is why
Hyena just couldn't accept it,

41
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:04,824
and asked a certain <i>chigyu</i> to verify it.

42
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,993
How dare you call me a <i>chigyu.</i>

43
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:10,964
You're Tomonaga, right?

44
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,101
I read your blog.

45
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,670
You investigate the truth behind

46
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,540
all sorts of criminal cases using science.

47
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,308
Honestly, I think you're a genius.

48
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:25,612
Of course, I am.

49
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,680
Will you cooperate with me?

50
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,219
My dad was accused

51
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,421
of falling asleep at the wheel
and I want to clear his name.

52
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,526
BUS FELL IN MINAMIBOSO

53
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:44,130
I can't just let them say,
"dead men tell no tales" and give up.

54
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,633
This is the reason why

55
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,668
I became a lawyer.

56
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,409
Isn't this the reason why
you were fired from forensics?

57
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,915
Listen,

58
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,385
if he was asleep,
these skid marks wouldn't look like this.

59
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,687
This is proof that Mr. Haie's father was

60
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,689
trying to control the bus
against the wind.

61
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,927
The results
from my reevaluation are flawless.

62
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,598
It's absolutely unacceptable
to use science for injustice.

63
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:23,269
This video proves that the judgment
was wrong.

64
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:24,704
But

65
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,774
this isn't enough to request

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,375
a retrial.

67
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,411
And more importantly,

68
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,845
a retrial would mean suing

69
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,248
the families of the people
who died in the accident.

70
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,783
I can't do that.

71
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,618
And so,

72
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,354
that is why you and your mother

73
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,225
are still paying 900 million yen
in compensation

74
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,161
for the 30 victims who died.

75
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,464
Why

76
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,900
didn't you renounce inheritance?

77
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,738
If you did,
you wouldn't have to pay anything.

78
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,210
If you're trying to trick me,

79
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:05,812
I won't forgive you.

80
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,148
Whoa, that's a threat.
You can get arrested for that.

81
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,917
Answer me!

82
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,822
If I was trying to trick a fool,

83
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,825
I wouldn't do it like this.

84
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:26,866
My mother

85
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,270
believed in my dad.

86
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,341
So she had no doubt that
he would be found not liable.

87
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,144
She thought that renouncing inheritance

88
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,782
<i>would mean that we would be denying my dad</i>

89
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,784
<i>and his dedication to his job.</i>

90
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,156
But…

91
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,994
your father was forced
to take the blame for everything…

92
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,037
by the hands of a judge named Susuda.

93
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,077
The one who pressured Susuda to do that

94
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,079
is currently a Supreme Court justice.

95
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,983
Kengo Jidori.

96
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,487
If you look at this man's career,

97
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:25,158
he has taken the fast track to success.

98
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,662
During the trial in question,

99
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,933
he was the Appointment Section chief of
the Supreme Court Personnel Affairs Bureau

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,304
and from there he became the director
of the Personnel Affairs Bureau and so on.

101
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,708
He then went on to become
the President of the Tokyo High Court

102
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,876
and a Supreme Court justice.

103
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:48,681
There's no doubt that he is going to
become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

104
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,985
Elites who have influence
in personnel affairs while they're young

105
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,488
end up having the most power.

106
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,423
According to my research,

107
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,625
Jidori is the one who
"leaked" info to the media

108
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,828
about your father
falling asleep at the wheel.

109
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,697
I knew it.

110
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,300
It takes a thief to catch a thief.

111
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,269
Now, here is the part that I don't get.

112
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,208
What does Jidori gain from bothering

113
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,377
a poor family like the Haies?

114
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,078
I've been

115
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,082
thoroughly digging up dirt on Jidori,
that villain who is

116
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,017
posing as a good guy.

117
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,756
Besides you guys, everyone else
he's involved with are politicians.

118
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,892
What in the world is the connection

119
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,827
between you and Jidori?

120
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,868
You resent Jidori too, right?

121
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,804
Be honest with me.

122
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,173
I'll help you.

123
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,541
So when that's done,

124
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,511
help me too.

125
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,420
Kengo Jidori

126
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,757
is my real father.

127
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:08,995
What?

128
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,297
My mother

129
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,334
dated Jidori when they were in school.

130
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:21,073
But Jidori
married a politician's daughter.

131
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,877
That politician
was the then Minister of Finance

132
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,513
<i>who later became Prime Minister,</i>

133
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,815
<i>Shigemori Asaba.</i>

134
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,552
My mother moved back in with her parents

135
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,388
and gave birth to me all by herself.

136
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,558
When I was three years old,

137
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,393
she got married to

138
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,528
<i>my late father.</i>

139
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,335
I guess I was pretty dense.

140
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,605
<i>I had no idea until…</i>

141
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:53,506
NAME: NAO

142
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,241
<i>…I saw the family register…</i>

143
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,342
ADOPTIVE FATHER: KAZUHIRO HAIE
RELATIONSHIP: ADOPTED CHILD

144
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,678
<i>…when doing my dad's</i>
<i>inheritance paperwork.</i>

145
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,481
The fact that you didn't notice until then

146
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,251
means he was a good dad.

147
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:07,720
‪Yeah.‬

148
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,724
When we went to Tokyo District Court
for the trial…

149
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:23,102
My sincere condolences.

150
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,661
That's him…

151
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,169
When Jidori

152
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,673
found out that I became a lawyer and was

153
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,875
trying to prove my father's innocence,

154
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,612
he falsely accused me of embezzling money.

155
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,950
That embezzlement scandal that got you
shunned from the legal community?

156
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,685
That was Jidori's trap too?

157
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:13,786
That's right.

158
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,323
I was processing a conservatorship
for an older wealthy individual

159
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,759
when the family suddenly
accused me of embezzling.

160
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,894
Unbeknownst to me, five million yen

161
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,996
was wired to my personal bank account.

162
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,732
I have no idea where this came from!

163
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,868
You can't just make excuses like that

164
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,536
when there's hard evidence.

165
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,873
<i>I can't believe he'd go that far…</i>

166
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:36,976
Even if

167
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,412
I'm not a lawyer anymore,

168
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,049
I want to settle the score for my dad,
no matter what.

169
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,485
If I can't,

170
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,889
what would I be living for?

171
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,097
They say, "dead men tell no tales,"

172
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,866
but science can tell their tales for them.

173
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,070
The power of science
presents persuasive truths

174
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,740
and proves their accuracy.

175
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,446
I can't sit back and let them
bring shame on it like that.

176
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,719
So that is <i>Chigyu's</i> raison d'être, huh?

177
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,689
To use science
to help this foolish hyena's

178
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,758
efforts to settle the score.

179
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,061
And

180
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,799
your mutual enemy is Jidori, right?

181
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,776
This is getting interesting.

182
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,849
First, we'll close in on Jidori
from the outside.

183
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,285
We'll slowly strangle Jidori

184
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:56,022
with fine silk threads.

185
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,296
Let me use the bathroom.

186
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,249
<i>Unless you start treatment right away,</i>

187
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,686
you might only have three months to live.

188
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,627
Come on…

189
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,762
We're just getting started.

190
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,532
Come on, my body…

191
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,671
That was a huge one!

192
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,111
We'll go after this guy.

193
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,749
The judge for the first trial
Komei Susuda.

194
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,719
He's still in his fifties,

195
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,722
but he retired a year ago
and is living a leisurely life.

196
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,256
You located him?

197
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,058
Even I couldn't find him.

198
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,794
Like you said,
it takes a thief to catch a thief.

199
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,966
Doesn't seem like a leisurely life.

200
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,202
He willingly retired because he either

201
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,104
was fed up with Jidori

202
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,206
or because he's being threatened.

203
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:23,042
He might be trembling out of fear
on the inside.

204
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,378
If we target him, even a hyena…

205
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:27,279
‪That's right.‬

206
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,448
I can fight.

207
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,563
So bitter! What the heck!

208
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,947
I am going to publish a huge scoop soon.

209
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,950
I have already
lived through that hell once.

210
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,253
You'll be ousted from the media.

211
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,621
Make sure you give me

212
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,923
<i>updates on Hyena.</i>

213
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,191
SEBUMI LAW OFFICE

214
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,993
-Thank you for your work.
-Thank you.

215
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,297
Excuse me.

216
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,370
Attorney Fukushi,

217
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,642
you recruited me
in order to protect me, right?

218
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,814
I heard that punk named Haie

219
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,151
has an assistant named Mitomi.

220
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,056
Will you please

221
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,259
protect Sensei as well?

222
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,833
There's probably nothing that I can do.

223
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,771
I'm sure that is why you
told me to come here.

224
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:01,640
But…

225
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,445
you are different.

226
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,050
Please…

227
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,985
Please help Sensei.

228
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,158
For you, Ms. Reiko, I will.

229
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,130
Thank you very much.

230
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:47,686
Let go!

231
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,457
Who are you?

232
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,858
KAORU HAGETA

233
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,595
I am going to publish a huge scoop soon.

234
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,632
In order to reform the Supreme Court

235
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,068
which controls
this country's judicial system.

236
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,371
I'll mention your name too.

237
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,872
FORMER JUDGE
KOMEI SUSUDA

238
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,507
That's why

239
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,511
I politely came here to introduce myself.

240
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,182
Well then, what do you think the scoop is?

241
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,718
Hint number one:

242
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,489
I'll also mention the names
of people who live in Nagatacho.

243
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,591
Hint number two:

244
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,628
I'll also mention a judge whose name
starts with the letter J.

245
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,134
Since he's a judge,
I guess we'll call him J.J.

246
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,142
Well, enough about the scoop.
I have something else

247
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,110
I want to ask you.

248
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,214
It's about this written judgment.

249
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,285
"Although evidence such as tachograph data
was submitted,

250
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,623
such evidence was
one-sidedly produced by the defendant

251
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,693
and holds no credibility whatsoever."

252
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,829
It is not conclusive enough to prove that

253
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,332
the driver
did not fall asleep at the wheel."

254
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,133
That's what it says.

255
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,602
It's impressive how you can

256
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,805
string words together just to make

257
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,873
something white seem like it's black.

258
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:16,942
Tell me,

259
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,647
didn't J.J., the Appointment Section chief
of the Personnel Affairs Bureau,

260
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,614
in other words

261
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,819
Kengo Jidori, tell you to do this?

262
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,956
If you have an objection,

263
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,126
you should speak up now.

264
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,866
Even if you don't say anything,

265
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,901
your facial expressions give it away.

266
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,572
If this video is released to the public,

267
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,207
it'll cause an uproar.

268
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,477
I have nothing to say.

269
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,815
The defendant never filed an appeal.

270
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,351
I still

271
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:00,919
firmly believe

272
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,390
that there was nothing wrong
with my judgment.

273
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,963
"Firmly believe"?

274
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,433
You obeyed Jidori and passed
a crappy judgment and were promoted,

275
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,636
only to quit being a judge
because you couldn't stand

276
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,105
to spend the rest of your life
buttering him up.

277
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,540
I was supposed to say that line.

278
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,708
In that case,

279
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,978
you can tell the truth now,

280
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,246
can't you?

281
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:30,983
‪That's right.‬

282
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,952
Or else, when my scoop is published,

283
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,689
the media will treat you like
some evil villain.

284
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:44,963
Go away!

285
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,111
First of all, what is this "huge scoop"
that you're talking about?

286
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:03,215
I won't tell you yet.
You're still too naive.

287
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:06,618
What did you say?

288
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,457
Just trust me,
you stupid half-witted fool.

289
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,992
That hurts.

290
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,127
Let go.

291
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,307
All right, here we go.

292
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:32,344
Let's have the whole world
take a good look at Susuda.

293
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,547
Once Susuda's name becomes known
all over Japan,

294
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,252
the bus accident will eventually
grab the public's attention.

295
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,689
That's when our battle begins.

296
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:44,590
BIGGEST MISJUDGMENT OF THE CENTURY

297
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,592
You can write an article on this

298
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,260
when we don't have any new evidence?

299
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,130
I'm just trying to stir things up.

300
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,333
Use your brain, <i>Chigyu.</i>

301
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,368
I'm not a <i>chigyu</i>
and that word is outdated.

302
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,138
But your writing is very compelling.

303
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:02,341
You could've become a successful swindler.

304
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,176
Thank you.

305
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,545
Right now, I'm not that different
from a swindler.

306
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:10,182
Publishing an article like this
will affect your credibility.

307
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,017
You'll be ousted from the media.

308
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,318
I don't care.

309
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:17,222
I'm not a small-timer like you guys.

310
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,692
Don't forget that.

311
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,629
TO: THE EDITOR IN CHIEF OF <i>WEEKLY BUNTO</i>
SEND

312
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,031
Justice Jidori.

313
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,933
We found this.

314
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,669
BIGGEST MISJUDGMENT OF THE CENTURY

315
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,671
ASKING KOMEI SUSUDA FOR THE TRUTH

316
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,011
I will crush them.

317
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,349
What? Rejected?

318
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,618
Why?

319
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:49,988
What happened?

320
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,858
They hung up on me.

321
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,993
How impressive…

322
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,462
Not only did he stop <i>Bunto,</i>
where I sent the article,

323
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,932
but he's even controlling minor magazines.

324
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:05,137
All 18 companies are saying that
they can't publish my article.

325
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:10,342
How far does Jidori's influence reach?

326
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,478
He's the son-in-law of Asaba,
the boss of the political world.

327
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,181
And Supreme Court justices are appointed
by the Cabinet.

328
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:20,018
Jidori chose a solid marriage mate
to secure his promotion.

329
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,287
Promotion, huh?

330
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,790
The title of
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

331
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,526
What a schemer.

332
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,895
But Jidori is desperate as well.

333
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,296
In a way,

334
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,433
you can say that Vulture succeeded
in stirring him up.

335
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,402
-He took the bait.
-That's true.

336
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,738
Bingo.

337
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,142
That word is outdated.

338
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,847
Our enemy will make a move, I'm sure.

339
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,550
It's becoming more exciting.

340
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,027
JIDORI

341
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:06,632
Hello.

342
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,600
You didn't

343
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:13,305
share anything with the media, did you?

344
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,574
Of course not.

345
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,809
I'm glad.

346
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,713
I can't emphasize enough

347
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,916
how disappointed I am
in your early retirement.

348
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,419
I'm grateful…

349
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,155
By the way,

350
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,824
how is your wife doing?

351
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,695
I hope you are able to see

352
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:40,299
the beautiful cherry blossoms
with her again this year.

353
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,215
Ishida, I am very glad that

354
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,384
you became company president.

355
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,924
Your TV station sets the example
for all the press in Japan.

356
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,493
Oh, you're too kind.

357
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,595
The truth is,

358
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,498
I'm counting on you to take care of

359
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,167
that issue concerning my grandchild.

360
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,070
I understand.

361
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,438
PRESIDENT OF TV STATION
TSUNEHIKO ISHIDA

362
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,073
There are plenty of other stories

363
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,175
to broadcast on the news instead.

364
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:28,280
Well, if worse comes to worst,
and it turns into a lawsuit,

365
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,117
I'm sure my son-in-law will
do something about that.

366
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,921
Right, Kengo?

367
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,198
Well then, we'll get that ready.

368
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,332
Okay.

369
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,138
Make sure you give me

370
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,707
updates on Hyena.

371
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:57,976
Yes…

372
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:03,148
But why are you so concerned about

373
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,850
a punk like him?

374
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,432
Thank you for your work.

375
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,267
Sorry for giving you work
at the last minute.

376
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,201
No worries.

377
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,311
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

378
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,415
<i>Hyena is plotting something.</i>

379
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,317
<i>But even if I ask him about that,</i>
<i>he'd never answer me.</i>

380
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:44,623
<i>For some reason, a Supreme Court justice</i>
<i>is trying to crush him.</i>

381
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,125
<i>I don't know the reason for that either.</i>

382
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,628
<i>But I'm trying to help Hyena</i>

383
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,830
<i>for her sake?</i>

384
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,332
<i>No, wait… No…</i>

385
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,367
<i>I…</i>

386
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,203
<i>I am so confused!</i>

387
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,439
Ms. Reiko!

388
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,607
Yes?

389
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,410
I take back what I said.

390
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,145
I believe

391
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,449
you should cut ties with Haie, after all.

392
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,617
If you keep associating with him,

393
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,353
you will be eliminated from society
along with him.

394
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,926
I have already

395
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,862
lived through that hell once.

396
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,965
During that time,

397
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,934
the one who fought with me,

398
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,770
gave me a place to belong,

399
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,006
and saved my life

400
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,510
was Sensei.

401
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:40,979
But

402
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,448
I appreciate your concern.

403
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:47,853
<i>Dang it!</i>

404
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,455
<i>That was the opposite of what I wanted!</i>

405
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,457
Good morning.

406
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,072
-What?
-This strange scent…

407
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,008
Someone cleaned up blood.

408
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,510
You dumbass vulture,

409
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:48,246
you're hiding something, aren't you?

410
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,188
Morphine hydrochloride hydrate.

411
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,823
It's a strong painkiller.

412
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,496
Tell us the truth.

413
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,903
Don't worry.

414
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,673
It can be treated.

415
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,882
I'll show you something cool.

416
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,653
The scoop I have

417
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,955
is this.

418
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,724
Asaba's grandchild was involved
in this case?

419
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,527
I've known that
Asaba's idiot grandson, Daiya,

420
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:39,331
has been frequenting illegal casinos
for a while now.

421
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:43,335
At a party where he was
enjoying poker and drugs…

422
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,235
WOMAN LEFT TO DIE

423
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,071
…a woman wound up dead.

424
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,238
CHARGES DROPPED
DUE TO INSUFFICIENT GROUNDS

425
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:48,673
That was two months ago.

426
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,812
Of course,
the police were involved too, but…

427
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,784
This shows the boss and his minions
having dinner around that time.

428
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,853
Jidori…

429
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,256
Ishida is the one who became
the president of a TV station.

430
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:10,895
From this day on, things started to change
and this case was swept under the rug.

431
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,935
Most likely due to the influence
of the boss and his son-in-law, Jidori.

432
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,671
It's basically a reign of terror.

433
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,306
Very likely.

434
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,942
But there's not enough evidence.

435
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,812
That's what we have to find now.

436
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,549
If old media is acting foolish,

437
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,252
we can use social media.

438
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,027
FORMER PRIME MINISTER ASABA'S GRANDCHILD

439
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,495
INVOLVED IN A DRUG PARTY

440
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:47,432
You'll never be able to go back
to being a reporter now.

441
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:52,137
Can you do accounting? I can hire you.

442
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,572
How about 1,500 yen per hour?

443
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,576
Stop talking in a creepy Kansai accent.

444
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,080
I'm starting

445
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,684
to figure out your plan as well.

446
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,789
<i>-What an idiot grandchild.</i>
<i>-Idiot grandchild.</i>

447
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,857
<i>He's a straight-up villain.</i>

448
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,393
<i>If that article is really true,</i>

449
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,796
<i>this is absolutely unforgiveable.</i>

450
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,965
The weirdoes
with a strong sense of justice

451
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,001
are starting to talk about it.

452
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,871
Some people are even connecting
Susuda and Daiya Asaba's articles.

453
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,239
<i>I'm really curious.</i>

454
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,276
BIGGEST MISJUDGMENT OF THE CENTURY

455
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:38,917
Susuda

456
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,252
is so terrified that he closed
all his storm shutters.

457
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,925
-How was it?
-I analyzed it using the newest program.

458
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,964
Look. Security cameras on the building
where the incident happened

459
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,401
clearly show Daiya Asaba's face.

460
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,205
Not just that, it coincides with
the victim's estimated time of death.

461
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,674
All right!

462
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,176
I've been listening to the prosecutors

463
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,812
and police on this case
complaining for long enough.

464
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,616
I'll write and write until there's nothing
to write about.

465
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,251
<i>-It turns out…</i>
<i>-If I worked there…</i>

466
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,953
<i>-…he's a Supreme Court justice.</i>
<i>-…I'd quit.</i>

467
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,429
What do you think?

468
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,232
The public is starting to latch on.

469
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,399
Look at this.

470
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,269
The bus accident is finally
catching people's attention.

471
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,372
There are influencers out there

472
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,975
who take note of my work, you know.

473
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:40,078
Putting an end to
the evil Asaba and Jidori…

474
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,347
That is my journalism.

475
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,985
With this, your enemy is as good as

476
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,487
a sitting duck.

477
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,659
‪I THOUGHT THE DRIVER FELL ASLEEP?‬
‪UNFORTUNATE FOR THE VICTIMS AND THE DRIVER‬

478
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,327
‪I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THE DRIVER‬
‪JIDORI WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, RIGHT?‬

479
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,903
Hyena,

480
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,208
want me to guess what you're thinking?

481
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,581
A lawsuit for state redress.

482
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:18,683
Right?

483
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,620
State Redress Act, Article 1.

484
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,156
When a public employee who exercises
public authority unlawfully

485
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,827
caused loss or damage to another
person intentionally or negligently,

486
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,496
the state or public entity assumes
the responsibility to compensate therefor.

487
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,866
So you want the state
to take responsibility

488
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,001
for former judge Susuda's misjudgment?

489
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:39,671
I'm surprised
a phony journalist like you was able to

490
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:43,041
catch on to what I have been
secretly planning this whole time.

491
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,376
However, in this case,

492
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,847
I'll need former judge Susuda's testimony

493
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,949
saying that he willingly
overlooked evidence

494
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,318
because he was pressured by Jidori.

495
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,355
Without that, I won't win
even if I sue them.

496
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,291
That's why you tried to provoke Susuda?

497
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,026
That's right.

498
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:06,064
But with the way things are now,
I doubt Susuda will testify.

499
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,439
TRENDING HASHTAGS

500
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:15,940
PRESSURED MANY TIMES

501
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,375
JIDORI DOING WHATEVER HE WANTS

502
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,011
This is bad…

503
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,121
What?

504
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,728
<i>I am sincerely grateful</i>

505
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,963
<i>for your concern for me.</i>

506
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,798
<i>Although it wasn't very long,</i>

507
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,367
<i>the time I spent here</i>

508
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,836
<i>was enjoyable and irreplaceable.</i>

509
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,238
<i>I, Reiko Mitomi, have decided to</i>

510
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:50,275
<i>resign due to personal reasons.</i>

511
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,481
Attorney Fukushi,
I just want to let you know

512
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,816
that when it comes to
a life-or-death battle,

513
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,718
I'm the type to charge head-on.

514
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,223
I have no intention of working under

515
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,259
a man who is a coward. Bye!

516
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,030
Ms. Reiko…

517
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,971
Come on, quickly tell me what's going on.

518
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,274
I'm telling you
that I don't know anything.

519
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,643
More like, I'm going to tell on you
to Mr. Haie.

520
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,580
Come on, don't say that!
Please, please, tell me

521
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,417
what Sensei is trying to do right now.

522
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,822
Fine.

523
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,160
These are my gym customers.
I'll plan three mixers with them.

524
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,262
-All right.
-That was fast.

525
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,298
So basically, in the end,

526
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,568
unless we get Susuda's testimony…

527
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,704
SUSUDA
WANT A TESTIMONY

528
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,938
…we can't win…

529
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,707
I WAS PRESSURED

530
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,843
…even if we sue the state.

531
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,548
-You owe me three mixers.
-I know.

532
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,783
Thank you very much.

533
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,654
You perverted science jerk.

534
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,557
Ms. Reiko.

535
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,560
Be careful.

536
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,597
I know. I'm just going to
look into Mr. Susuda.

537
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,352
Hello.

538
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,521
<i>It's me.</i>

539
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,998
Who is this?

540
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,367
The two of us should meet.

541
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,504
Kaneueda at eight o'clock.

542
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,473
They'll know once you get there.

543
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,897
What are you scheming?

544
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:28,666
What is it for?

545
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:33,371
To reveal the truth
about Dad's bus accident

546
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,339
and settle the score.

547
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,275
And

548
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,545
to expose your evil deeds.

549
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:45,149
How you're trying to become
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,

550
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:49,020
a position that gets paid just as much
as the Prime Minister,

551
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,089
but in reality, you're a lowlife villain

552
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,257
who twists the truth.

553
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,960
That should be easy then.

554
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,499
"I am Jidori's son.

555
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,402
My biological father

556
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,704
tried to deprive

557
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,440
my mother, me, and my adoptive father

558
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,709
of our happiness."

559
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,346
That's all you have to say

560
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,050
with tears in your eyes.

561
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,431
My friend told me the same thing

562
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,732
and laughed.

563
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,102
We are

564
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,771
trying to break the system of this country

565
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:44,208
that's being run by people
you gave power to.

566
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,045
The separation of powers
is a complete sham

567
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,248
and we say, "To hell with that."

568
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,329
Wonderful.

569
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,365
Go ahead and try.

570
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,968
It's like a kid playing pretend war.

571
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,408
However,

572
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:24,515
you should worry about the safety
of your friends.

573
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,884
Kaoru Hageta,

574
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:32,323
a freelance journalist who was fired
from Kyojo Tsushin.

575
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:37,495
I hear he's been hanging out
at your office since eight days ago.

576
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,999
Hideki Tomonaga is a capable scientist,

577
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,803
but I wonder why he left
the forensics department?

578
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,942
Japan is a dangerous place these days.

579
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,514
Many accidents happen as well.

580
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,818
What I'm trying to say is,

581
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,922
that you shouldn't let

582
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,860
your nonsense put your close friends

583
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:14,465
in harm's way, that's all.

584
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,271
I'll excuse myself now.

585
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,610
I'm glad we got to meet.

586
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,645
I know

587
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,282
very well now, that you are just like

588
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:37,355
the father who raised you,
and you can only think of trivial things.

589
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,047
How was it?

590
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,982
He threatened me like crazy.

591
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,551
He told me to treasure my friends.

592
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,487
It proves that Jidori is panicking.

593
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,456
It's finally happening.

594
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:13,991
‪Yeah.‬

595
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,562
Both you and Tomonaga should be careful.

596
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,933
Also, it's unlikely,

597
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,337
but if anything happens to me,

598
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,506
I'll leave the rest to you.

599
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,946
I will protect you.

600
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,484
Thank you.

601
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,987
I'll need 2,500 yen per hour.

602
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,392
Haie.

603
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,966
I'm sorry

604
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,636
about everything.

605
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,314
It'll be 500 yen per hour.

606
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,315
Excuse me.

607
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,766
Be quiet. Don't move.

608
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,069
My mind is already set
so I have nothing to fear.

609
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,007
You'll have to make up your mind too.

610
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,776
I'm a woman ready to risk my life.

611
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:19,517
A will?

612
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:30,461
<i>They found damning photographs</i>
<i>regarding Daiya Asaba's case.</i>

613
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,029
<i>I'm going to go check now.</i>

614
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,232
Why is he sending me the address?

615
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,068
COFFEE BEANS

616
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,539
It seems the time has finally come,

617
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,706
Dad.

618
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,513
HIDEKI TOMONAGA

619
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,684
-What's up?
-I got a strange email from Mr. Hage.

620
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:55,820
<i>Haie.</i>

621
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:57,955
<i>If anything happens to me,</i>

622
00:40:58,889 --> 00:40:59,990
<i>I'll leave the rest to you.</i>

623
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,672
I'm heading to that address now.

624
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,340
What's going on?

625
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,410
I have a bad feeling about this.

626
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,726
Come on, come on…

627
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:39,196
Let me get to a place
where there's nobody around.

628
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,638
WILL

629
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,507
Will you please

630
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,243
tell the truth during the trial?

631
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,046
If you don't promise me that,

632
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,382
I'll have to…

633
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,754
What are you doing?

634
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,489
Ms. Reiko,

635
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,291
why aren't you picking up?

636
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,562
I'm such a fool.

637
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,066
<i>I will</i>

638
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,235
die right here.

639
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,604
Hey, stop!

640
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:21,939
Stop it!

641
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,750
This might be enough to turn the tables.

642
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,637
WILL

643
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:40,951
EXPRESS DELIVERY

644
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,253
Mr. Haie, you have an express delivery.

645
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,007
WILL

646
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,009
KAORU HAGETA

647
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,282
-All by yourself…
-Find it!

648
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,484
<i>It's my battle as well.</i>

649
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,918
<i>Stay away from me.</i>

650
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:15,953
