00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,404
EPISODE 14

2
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,952
Dal-mi.

3
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,788
I mean, Ms. Seo. What happened?

4
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,539
You had a ransomware attack?

5
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,124
It's all good now.

6
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,127
We found the decryption key
and got all the files restored.

7
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,046
How?

8
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,674
Do-san was here.

9
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,596
Chul-san, Sa-ha, and Yong-san too.

10
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,807
They all came to help me.

11
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,438
So it's all been sorted out now?

12
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,857
Yes.

13
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,818
I'm glad.

14
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,240
Are you okay?

15
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,121
I've been asked that
more than a hundred times today.

16
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,997
So,

17
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,958
are you okay?

18
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,919
Yes, I'm okay.

19
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,839
I'm so relieved.

20
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,218
It's just…

21
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,179
I feel so ashamed.

22
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,975
Why? Even the Pentagon's
been attacked by ransomware.

23
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,518
It's just bad luck.

24
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,187
No.

25
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,107
That kind of excuse doesn't work.

26
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,777
I am so ashamed of myself.

27
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,823
I should've made sure everything was
backed up before the demonstration.

28
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,827
A problem occurred,
and I didn't even know what to do.

29
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,623
I couldn't be more pathetic.

30
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,506
Why now, of all times?

31
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,640
Why did he have to come now, of all times?

32
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,107
You know, right?

33
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,278
I'm not usually this pathetic.

34
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,323
You've never been pathetic.

35
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,951
Why is he on vacation now, of all times?

36
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,831
When I'm in the worst possible situation?

37
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,586
Couldn't he have at least given me
a heads-up?

38
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,590
This is humiliating.

39
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,689
I don't even deserve to cry.

40
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,580
Please don't tell anyone that I cried.

41
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,835
You didn't see me cry, either.

42
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,463
I don't want anyone to find out.

43
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,389
- Ms. Seo!
- Ms. Seo!

44
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,599
Is she not in?

45
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,768
Did she go home
after pulling an all-nighter?

46
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,240
Come out. Watch your head.

47
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,471
Stay here until you calm down.

48
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,265
Lock the door.

49
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,571
Mr. Han.

50
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,827
Thank you, as always.

51
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,700
Let's talk.

52
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,422
I have nothing to talk about with you.

53
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,591
Aren't you here to see Ms. Seo?

54
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,593
If you are, find another time, not today.

55
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,638
Do I need your permission
to meet Dal-mi, Director Han?

56
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,473
Yes.

57
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,314
What gives you the right?

58
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,235
I'm pretty sure I have the right.

59
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,159
- Don't tell me…
- Yes, that's right.

60
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,248
Three years is a long time.
Long enough for relationships

61
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,917
to change.

62
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,572
What have I done?

63
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,958
DIRECTOR HAN JI-PYEONG

64
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,422
Hello?

65
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,175
I just ran into Mr. Nam in the elevator.

66
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,387
I said something to stop him
from going to see you,

67
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,057
and he might have gotten
the wrong idea about us.

68
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,017
I apologize.

69
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,023
Well, that's fine.

70
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,275
You can still catch up with him.

71
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:55,326
That's unnecessary.
He's going back to the US anyway.

72
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,787
Also,

73
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,542
our relationship ended three years ago.

74
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,215
Thanks for saying that.

75
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,593
Okay, then.

76
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,978
Yes.

77
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,522
I'm doing the right thing.

78
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,162
DO-SAN

79
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,293
For three years,

80
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,131
I was half a world away,
trying to forget you.

81
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,015
POWER OFF

82
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,688
But it took you only three seconds

83
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,528
to make all that time and distance…

84
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,529
DAL-MI

85
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,326
The phone of the number you have dialed
is off. Please leave a message

86
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,996
after the beep. Additional fees may apply.

87
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,043
…meaningless.

88
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,371
TO NAM DO-SAN

89
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,338
One more thing.

90
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,632
Here's the signed ball.

91
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,467
Right.

92
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,679
That's nice.

93
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,332
Time doesn't

94
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,584
heal all wounds.

95
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:09,478
A BRIEF, PERSUASIVE SPEECH
DURING AN ELEVATOR RIDE

96
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,278
I never thought we'd be coming back here.

97
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,529
It's only temporary.

98
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,574
Once we're incorporated,
let's move to Gangnam or Yeouido.

99
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,075
Let's do that.

100
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,454
If the investors think this is our office,
they'll look down on us.

101
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,291
We should pass on those who judge us
by our office, shouldn't we?

102
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,335
My, aren't you smart?
For once, you're saying something wise.

103
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,046
- Anyway, who should be the CEO?
- Who else?

104
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,256
You.

105
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,342
I won't. I've suffered enough
for the last three years.

106
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,053
If either of you wants the position,
it's all yours.

107
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,680
- I don't want to.
- Me neither.

108
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,809
Rock-paper-scissors.

109
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,318
- The loser becomes the CEO, right?
- No, the winner.

110
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,903
- Best of three?
- No, it's over.

111
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,447
This is unfair. Rock-paper--

112
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,866
Mr. CEO, what do we do next?

113
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,247
What should we do next?

114
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,585
- First, incorporation.
- Okay.

115
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,129
Should we enter a hackathon again?

116
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,174
Don't say such an awful thing.

117
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,884
I got goosebumps.

118
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,721
We're above that level now.

119
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,265
In addition to being number one
at Sand Box,

120
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,601
we worked at 2STO for three years.

121
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:37,024
To find investors,
shouldn't we do some advertising?

122
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,527
We should let the market know

123
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,029
we quit 2STO and
are starting a business in Korea.

124
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,448
That's right. Advertising is important.

125
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,869
But how do we do that?

126
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,581
Guys, why don't we talk to Cheon-ho?

127
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,918
STUDIO JAKDU
CEO NAM CHEON-HO

128
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,087
Smile, everyone.

129
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,382
Give me a big smile.
Now, look at each other's faces.

130
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,009
Okay, one more. A big smile. There you go.

131
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,386
Great.

132
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,930
Awesome.

133
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,890
Shout, "Let's do this!" Three, two, one.

134
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,433
- Let's do this!
- Great.

135
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,519
Hands up!

136
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,937
One more! Put your hands up!

137
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,523
- Relax.
- You look great.

138
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,985
Very nice.

139
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:25,614
This guy right here.
He's my little cousin.

140
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,699
Isn't he handsome?

141
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,659
You look amazing.

142
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,580
Try to relax more.

143
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,335
Now, try talking to each other casually.

144
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,670
- Okay.
- Okay.

145
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,673
Guys, we're RGB again.

146
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,633
You're right.

147
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,512
RGB should be our theme.

148
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,097
Should we name our company RGB?

149
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,223
- No.
- I don't think so.

150
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,685
Now, portraits. Let's start with the CEO.

151
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,686
- Sure.
- Okay.

152
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,694
- Oh, right.
- Let's switch.

153
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,905
- Get it together.
- Get it together.

154
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,448
- Gosh.
- Jeez.

155
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,283
Please do a good job.

156
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,660
Awesome job, guys.

157
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,495
You look fantastic.

158
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,125
Gosh, dressed up like this,
you guys totally look like big shots.

159
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,543
So stylish.

160
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,211
Stop it.

161
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,590
It's all thanks to the stylists here,

162
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:29,094
although I must admit,
I do have a nice body.

163
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,306
Am I right?

164
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,810
What are you doing?

165
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:44,193
Is that Mr. Han? I mean Director Han.

166
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,322
- This was published here.
- It seems like it.

167
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,991
I owe you big time.

168
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,201
Let me give you a hug.

169
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,412
I never imagined
we'd be doing a magazine interview.

170
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,415
Everything just fell into place.

171
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,125
The editor here and I are close,

172
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,628
he was looking for developers
to interview,

173
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,464
and I happen to have a cousin
who's a successful developer.

174
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,508
- Successful, my foot.
- But you are.

175
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,678
When I told the editor
that I knew developers from 2STO,

176
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,056
he canceled the interview
he already had planned

177
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,391
and scheduled to interview with you.

178
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,353
Are we that big a deal now?

179
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,355
Apparently, you are.

180
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,611
How is the business plan coming along?

181
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,988
We're working on it.

182
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,534
You know what I want
this time, too, right?

183
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,619
- One percent of the company?
- Yes.

184
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,039
- Sure.
- That's my boy.

185
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,084
Let me know if you need anything.
I can do anything for you.

186
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,335
I will.

187
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,046
- Next, Mr. Nam.
- Okay.

188
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,966
- Here we go.
- All right.

189
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,386
- You look cool.
- You were terrible.

190
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,014
- Really?
- Smile.

191
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,641
Relax and try striking a pose.

192
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,685
- Put on a smile.
- Smile.

193
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,687
- You look amazing.
- Nice.

194
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,067
Try to relax.

195
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,739
I mean, why didn't you tell us
that the interview had been canceled?

196
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,324
My assistant was supposed to contact you,

197
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,619
but there must have been a mistake.

198
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,329
I'm really sorry.

199
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,665
- Let me ask you one thing.
- Okay.

200
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,459
Why was it canceled, anyway?

201
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,918
It's no big deal.

202
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,296
I couldn't be bothered, anyway.

203
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,340
I know. We only came here
to promote our company. Unbelievable.

204
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,051
Try to relax.

205
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,011
Relax. Put on a smile.

206
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,767
Nam Do-san?

207
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,019
Do you guys know each other?

208
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,648
Did we get replaced by them?

209
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,150
Well…

210
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:52,696
They've worked at 2STO, so…

211
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,034
Gosh, not those morons again.

212
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,497
Damn it.

213
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,918
Goodbye.

214
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,420
I'm really sorry.

215
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,930
AFTER SAND BOX AND 2STO,
THE BOYS ARE BACK

216
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,902
Q: ARE YOU STARTING A BUSINESS THEN?
DO-SAN: YES, OF COURSE.

217
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,577
The ritual is starting soon.

218
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,957
Count me out. It's not like
the ritual is going to prevent anything.

219
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,211
How could you say that? You'll jinx it.

220
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,796
Hold wood and spit three times.

221
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,882
I can't believe we're doing this.

222
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,759
Come along.

223
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:18,073
RITUAL FOR A SUCCESSFUL TEST DRIVE

224
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:33,714
It's Sand Box's first self-driving car.

225
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,132
I can't wait.

226
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,508
Thank you.

227
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,303
By the way, why is it called Tarzan?

228
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,513
Tarzan doesn't drive a car.

229
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,390
Oh, it means…

230
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:48,937
Well, "tar" sounds like "car,"

231
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,522
and I liked the sound of it.

232
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,734
Don't you think that's a little lame?

233
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,153
- I think it's original.
- What?

234
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,906
You prepared all this food?

235
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,407
My grandma did.

236
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,825
I thought she was Catholic.

237
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,744
She's flexible.

238
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,956
Ms. Won, Ms. Seo.

239
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,716
MORNING AI'S SELF-DRIVING CAR,
MOMO, WINS TEMPORARY PERMIT

240
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,637
What are Shin Hyeon and Shin Jeong
doing there?

241
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,683
No way.

242
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,895
What?

243
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,439
Thank you.

244
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,900
You're back from lunch. Where did you go?

245
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,985
Do we have to tell you?

246
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,154
Well, I thought I saw you guys earlier.

247
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,114
We ate at the cafeteria at Sand Box.

248
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,496
Then Shin Hyeon and Shin Jeong really
met with Mr. Won at that time.

249
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,290
They denied it so adamantly,
so I thought I was mistaken.

250
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,835
That means they must have started
talking about it a while ago.

251
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,755
The ransomware was an excuse.
They quit to join Morning AI.

252
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,680
Ms. Won.

253
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,489
What do you think you're doing?

254
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,831
We haven't seen each other in a while.
Can't you greet us more nicely?

255
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,459
Are you not even going to ask how I am?
This isn't like you.

256
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,045
I'm not really in the mood.

257
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,800
In addition to my company, you took
my employees away, so why should I?

258
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,136
Calm down.

259
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,514
Listening to you,
I feel like I'm a big deal now.

260
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,685
In-jae, don't worry.

261
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,734
Why are you even bothered by me?

262
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,360
Don't I have enough reason to?

263
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,405
You're Morning Group chairman's son,
the CEO of Nature Morning,

264
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,992
and the manager of Morning AI,
and you're taking my employees away.

265
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:11,204
Still, I'm nothing more than an idiot.

266
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,040
Am I wrong?

267
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,499
I'm not going to the US.

268
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:19,755
You can have that idiot
manage the US branch if you want.

269
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,591
Is that what this is about?

270
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,845
- That one word?
- Maybe I'm petty.

271
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,972
But I can't seem to let that one word go.

272
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,143
Father, do you remember this?

273
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,936
About ten years ago,

274
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,648
Sang-su got a 500-million-won supercar
and it turned out he got ripped off.

275
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,485
Did he?

276
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:46,406
You swung a golf club at him,
so he had to get dental implants.

277
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,992
Hey, why are you bringing that up now?

278
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,495
I can't help but be reminded of that time.

279
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:55,248
You're paying hundreds of millions of won
to recruit mediocre developers.

280
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,668
What will Father say
about the consequences later?

281
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,921
It's not that I'm looking forward.

282
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,131
I'm concerned.

283
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,427
In-jae.

284
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,472
I've changed now.

285
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,352
Don't worry. You think I haven't?

286
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:27,948
Great job.

287
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,991
Serves him right.

288
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,246
I've done the bluffing,
so it's your job to sort things out now.

289
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,413
Yes, ma'am.

290
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,667
Wait, what?

291
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,421
In-jae. I mean, Ms. Won.
What are you talking about?

292
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,215
Hire developers before the demo.

293
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,718
More than seven years of experience.
Suitable for C-level positions.

294
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,970
That's impossible.

295
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,597
It takes time and effort
to hire such developers.

296
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,850
We don't have time to sort out candidates.

297
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,978
We have candidates. Nam Do-san,
Lee Chul-san, and Kim Yong-san.

298
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:07,070
That's not possible. They're only
staying in Korea for a short while.

299
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,738
They aren't, as far as I know.

300
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,366
They're starting over in Korea.

301
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,035
In Korea?

302
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,001
They've worked with
self-driving cars at 2STO,

303
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,919
and they're looking for partners.

304
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,671
Who could be better candidates?

305
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,925
You know them well.

306
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,510
Recruit them at all costs.

307
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,812
Come with me for a second.

308
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,114
In-jae, don't you remember
how Do-san and I broke up?

309
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:55,243
I do. "Go to 2STO."
"No, I want to stay with you."

310
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,621
Quite a tear-jerking story.

311
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,998
Then how could you do this?

312
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,669
You're telling me to be
the cruelest person to Do-san right now.

313
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,589
Cruel? How?

314
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,800
I said such harsh things to him
when I broke up with him.

315
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,137
I felt so miserable
being the one bogging him down,

316
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,599
so I pushed him away,
saying things that I didn't mean.

317
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,394
I can't be the one bogging him down again.

318
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,150
Never. I'm not that shameless.

319
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,737
Do you think recruiting Do-san here

320
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,989
will bog him down?

321
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,868
I'll find someone else. C-level, right?

322
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,579
It's a tall order, but I'll try.

323
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,999
No. Bring Nam Do-san,
Lee Chul-san, and Kim Yong-san.

324
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,834
Or else you're fired.

325
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,505
- In-jae.
- What? You don't think I can?

326
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,840
Injae Company owns
most of Cheongmyeong Company,

327
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,426
and I'm a major shareholder
of Injae Company.

328
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,639
Is this a threat?

329
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,351
No. I'm giving you a chance.

330
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,561
I was fired by a major shareholder

331
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,398
without a second chance
at Nature Morning three years ago.

332
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:09,067
But I'm different.
I'm giving you a chance.

333
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,444
Either recruit those three

334
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,906
or quit being the CEO of a company
that bogs its employees down.

335
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,701
It's your choice.

336
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,840
How is this a choice? It's a threat.

337
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,801
It's an impossible task.

338
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,137
If it's so easy,
why can't she do it herself?

339
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,055
Who are these developers, anyway?

340
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,730
They've worked
at this big, famous company.

341
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,232
A global company.
Not a tiny, obscure one like us.

342
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,319
She can't bully me
just because she's a major shareholder!

343
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,238
I'm not sure if she's bullying you.

344
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:59,075
Grandma, are you taking In-jae's side
in this situation?

345
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,618
Mom, can you believe her?

346
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,912
I can't agree with you this time, either.

347
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,082
What's with you guys?

348
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:10,295
She may be a major shareholder,
but she can't make personnel decisions!

349
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,589
Separation of ownership
and management, you know?

350
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,509
Gosh, I'm feeling really hurt.

351
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,596
Why are you both suddenly
taking In-jae's side?

352
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,973
I'm not taking anybody's side.

353
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,769
It's just that if I were In-jae,
I'd fire a CEO like you, too.

354
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,439
- Why?
- A "tiny, obscure company"?

355
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,608
What?

356
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:36,363
Does your company
bog its employees down? Does it?

357
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,573
Exactly.

358
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:41,618
I didn't know your company was so lousy.

359
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,373
What I mean is…

360
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,750
It's like selling corn dogs

361
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,544
and asking your customers,
"Why would you eat this garbage?"

362
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,547
Mother, your analogy is on point.

363
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:59,010
If that's what the CEO is thinking,
I'm sure it'll go great for the company.

364
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,806
Goodness, I can see how patient
In-jae has been.

365
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,851
She's exceptionally patient.
She takes after me.

366
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,478
Personnel matters mean everything.

367
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,731
If you can't handle that,
you shouldn't be the CEO.

368
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,116
She's hurt.

369
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,805
DROWSY DRIVING
TRAFFIC JAMS

370
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:26,765
SENIOR DRIVERS

371
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,292
Documents ready.

372
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,419
Perfect.

373
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,421
Why am I sweating, though?

374
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:01,925
It's too hot.

375
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,012
Setting the temperature to 23°C.

376
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,432
The temperature was too high. That was it.

377
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,936
Everything's perfect now.

378
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,966
SAMSAN TECH

379
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,026
Hold on. Which company are you from?

380
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,654
No cutting in line.

381
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,490
- Cutting in line?
- Yes.

382
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,994
Everyone's taking a number
and waiting in line to invest.

383
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,165
All these people are investors?

384
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,458
Yes.

385
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:21,504
Oh… Okay.

386
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:36,102
DAL-MI

387
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,065
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

388
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,777
We were planning to invest in you
even before you came back to Korea.

389
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,364
I'd like to ask you to consider
choosing us as your partner.

390
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,409
We don't have a business model yet.
You already want to invest?

391
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:56,706
We'd like to invest in the seed stage
and help you build a business model.

392
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,667
What's the use of technology?

393
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,961
We're clueless
when it comes to money-making.

394
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,797
Right. We don't know how to make sales.

395
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,008
No companies make sales from the get-go.

396
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,678
We'll support you
until you start making sales.

397
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,932
Do you have a minute?
I have something to tell you.

398
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,686
Give us some room to invest,

399
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,980
and we'll help you set up and everything.

400
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:26,653
- We'll discuss and let you know.
- We'll be waiting.

401
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,112
Goodbye.

402
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,906
- We'll get back to you.
- Thank you.

403
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,241
- Bye.
- Thank you.

404
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,416
My Gosh. I guess our experience
at 2STO does mean a lot.

405
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,794
Those people are ready to invest
in whatever we do.

406
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,340
Boss, what do you think?
Do any of them stand out to you?

407
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,383
Make your choice.

408
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,219
I'm not sure.

409
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,012
You guys decide.

410
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,722
You're the CEO. It's your job.

411
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,978
None of them really stand out.

412
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,275
Who's been calling you? Take it.

413
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,860
It's nothing.

414
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:28,089
She better recruit Nam Do-san.
Or else she's fired.

415
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,924
What does she take her company for?

416
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,635
"Bogging him down"?

417
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,597
Can you believe she actually said that?
She's the CEO of the company.

418
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,017
She shouldn't have said that.

419
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,310
It was an absurd thing to say.

420
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,688
There's no denying it.

421
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,816
What's with you?
You're not taking Dal-mi's side today?

422
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,444
Why would I take anyone's side?
You're both my daughters.

423
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,571
Here are your drinks.

424
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,822
What's this thing?

425
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,115
Thanks.

426
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,493
- Latte, right?
- Yes.

427
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,792
How cool. It drops off the drinks
and just leaves like that?

428
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,335
Is it controlled by a person?

429
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:10,715
No. It's self-driving.
It's what your daughters work on.

430
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,886
What brings you here, anyway?

431
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:18,347
I made some jeon and songpyeon for you.

432
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,727
Are you not coming for New Year's, either?

433
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,853
I'm busy.

434
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,939
Do you do all the work
in the world yourself?

435
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:32,028
That bastard has signed
the divorce papers.

436
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,739
- That's great.
- What do you want to do?

437
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,658
Do you want to keep "Won"
as your last name

438
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,037
or file a petition
and change it back to "Seo"?

439
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,999
What's your plan?

440
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,836
You've been paid alimony.
Move out of that house already.

441
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,256
I won't. And I'm using the money
for something else.

442
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,467
Are you going to continue
living off Grandma?

443
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,636
Do you enjoy living
with your mother-in-law?

444
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,763
Of course not.

445
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,557
I just made enough jeon
to feed dozens of people.

446
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,392
Then why are you not moving out?

447
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,770
Do you feel so sorry for Dal-mi?

448
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,606
I feel sorry for Mother.

449
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,777
I neglected my own daughter
for more than ten years,

450
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:16,239
and Mother raised her
with so much love and care.

451
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,701
I should pay her back.

452
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:25,706
How? You can't even do chores.
I'm sure you're only causing her trouble.

453
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,544
She can't even go out without me.

454
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,963
Not the other way around?

455
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,008
Her eyesight is getting bad.

456
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,222
Come over for New Year's.

457
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,268
Show her your face
before her eyesight gets worse.

458
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,588
Ms. Seo,
is there a special occasion today?

459
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,965
You look completely different
from the other day.

460
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,718
That was an unusual day.
This is how I usually look.

461
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,054
What brings you here, anyway?

462
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,600
Well… I never thanked you properly.

463
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:29,812
Also…

464
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,611
I'd like to recruit you.

465
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,741
Recruit us?

466
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,246
CEO SEO DAL-MI

467
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:58,966
Ms. Seo, please don't take this
the wrong way,

468
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,762
but compared to three years ago,

469
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,890
our situation has changed a little.
A lot, actually.

470
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,852
We don't mean to brag, but it's a fact.

471
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,854
Of course. I know that.

472
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,856
But I've changed since then, too.

473
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:20,112
I'm confident that my company
can fit your raised status.

474
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,614
So give me a chance.

475
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,034
- I'd like to introduce my company--
- I know what you do.

476
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,537
I saw your company video.

477
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,665
- Really?
- You did?

478
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,877
Chul-san, Yong-san,
can you excuse us for a second?

479
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,339
Okay.

480
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,967
Take as much time as you need.

481
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,654
What will Do-san say to her?

482
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,656
No idea.

483
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,741
Why did you bring them with you?

484
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:10,538
I mean… We don't have to show off
to Ms. Seo, do we?

485
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,249
We're not showing off. It's a fact.

486
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,169
I guess. We sure have come a long way.

487
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,175
Some of the investors that came today
used to look down on us.

488
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,677
Those bastards…

489
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,555
Do they even remember those times?

490
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,057
They'd better.

491
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,273
Chul-san, give me those business cards.

492
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,317
These? Why?

493
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,404
I'll be right back.

494
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,073
Where are you going?

495
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,968
Gosh, that's still there?

496
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,095
Do you remember?

497
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,473
Three years ago,

498
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:15,311
we had meetings about self-driving cars
right here.

499
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,401
Dal-mi.

500
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:25,946
Yes?

501
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,865
You said to me

502
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,204
that we shouldn't be unreasonable

503
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,666
and hold on to an illusion.

504
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,133
I did.

505
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,845
Back then, those words

506
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,726
hurt me so deeply.

507
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,358
But eventually,

508
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,902
I realized that…

509
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,493
you were right.

510
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,748
The person you loved

511
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,543
was not me.

512
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,800
The person I loved was not you, either.

513
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,352
I spent the last three years
accepting that.

514
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,609
I don't want to be confused anymore.

515
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,407
So I…

516
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,079
don't want to see you again.

517
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,012
Now that…

518
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,142
I'm the one hearing those words,

519
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,272
they hurt more than I thought.

520
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,740
This must have been
how you felt back then.

521
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,456
I know it's too late,

522
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,835
but I'm sorry.

523
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,955
Hello, Mr. Han.

524
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,207
Director Han, right?

525
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,252
Oh, hi. It's been a while.

526
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:55,132
- What brings you here?
- To see if we could rent an office.

527
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,925
We're starting a new business.

528
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:01,055
A new business?
I thought you were here on vacation.

529
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,973
We changed our minds.

530
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:07,311
Thanks to our experience at 2STO,
people want to invest in whatever we do.

531
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,439
So what are you trying to say?

532
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,024
I was just curious.

533
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,486
What are your thoughts?

534
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,739
That's great news.

535
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,867
Congratulations.
I wish you the best of luck.

536
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,621
- You've changed a lot.
- No, I haven't.

537
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,831
You have. You're a lot nicer now.

538
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:32,002
You know, I only say good things
to companies I'm not interested in.

539
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:35,172
Why bother to check and criticize
the condition of a car

540
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,133
if I'm not going to ride it?

541
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:43,889
See you.

542
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,659
They're not just visiting?

543
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,123
Your hair almost looks like a bird's nest.

544
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,044
Is something bothering you?

545
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,131
No, nothing.

546
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:03,218
Come on. Are you not telling me
because I'm not your mentor anymore?

547
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,513
No, it's not like that.

548
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,685
Morning AI took our developers away.

549
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,815
So we have to hire developers
to fill C-level positions.

550
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,945
We were thinking of Do-san and the guys.

551
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,869
I just made an offer to him.

552
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,123
But he flat-out turned it down.

553
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,294
He finally did something I approve of.

554
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,714
Mr. Han.

555
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,508
I should give you advice,

556
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,677
but I'm too personally involved.

557
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,930
So I won't.

558
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,519
This is why I wasn't going to tell you.

559
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,688
But you insisted that I should tell you.

560
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,150
Sorry. I guess I'm quite petty.

561
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,669
Do-san, I found this in the trash can.

562
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,129
It's a treasure. Don't lose it.

563
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,798
Oh, okay.

564
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,635
Thank goodness I saw it.

565
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,305
Dad.

566
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,307
Yes?

567
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,144
When I can neither throw away

568
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,065
nor forget something,

569
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,404
what am I supposed to do?

570
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,040
Once you get off the main road,

571
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:01,420
follow Jinsangmi-ro for about 6km.

572
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,381
- Take Geumyul-ro.
- Geumyul-ro?

573
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,882
That's after Imosan-ro.

574
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,385
At the end of this road,
you'll see a market street.

575
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,137
You could either take that or…

576
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,347
Dad said when he was young,

577
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:16,351
he biked to his uncle's house
whenever he was troubled.

578
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,021
The market street would be safer.

579
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,897
By the time he was exhausted,

580
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,609
all his problems seemed small.

581
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,861
It'll be about ten minutes faster.

582
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,029
So I…

583
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,242
- Put this on.
- Okay.

584
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,751
Take it easy. Make sure you eat.

585
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,793
I will.

586
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,420
All right.

587
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:46,632
Here.

588
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,383
See you.

589
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,511
I'll call you.

590
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,055
Be careful. Stay safe.

591
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,765
- Okay. I'll get going.
- All right.

592
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,600
- Have fun.
- Okay.

593
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,311
I followed his advice
and went for a bike ride,

594
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:04,274
hoping fatigue would
take all my problems away.

595
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,404
Desperately hoping to stop

596
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,909
filling my sleepless nights with you.

597
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,455
That was the only way I could start over.

598
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,628
But…

599
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,138
Now that I'm the one hearing those words,

600
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,391
they hurt more than I thought.

601
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,240
This must have been
how you felt back then.

602
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,204
I know it's too late,

603
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,540
but I'm sorry.

604
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,213
Dad was wrong.

605
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,424
The more exhausted I became,

606
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,469
the clearer my thoughts became.

607
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,528
Mother, stay here for a second.
I'm going to the bathroom real quick.

608
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:58,740
Hey, you should take your time.
It's dangerous to fall at your age.

609
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,450
Mother, please.

610
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,540
Oops.

611
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,376
Oh, no. My goodness.

612
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,468
My, thank you so much.

613
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,097
I appreciate it.

614
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,308
Gosh.

615
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,899
My goodness. Thank you.

616
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,568
Thank you so much.

617
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,169
This is nice.

618
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,642
Hello, Mr. Son. It's Won In-jae.

619
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,938
I want my adoption to be dissolved.

620
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,061
Is that a person?

621
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,243
I'm so hungry that I'm seeing things.

622
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,341
Do-san.

623
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,060
Dal-mi… What are you doing here?

624
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,564
Your parents told me

625
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,985
that you'd be here.

626
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,780
My parents? Why?

627
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,955
I begged them to tell me.

628
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,252
You left your jacket in my office.

629
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,587
I came to return it to you

630
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,215
and talk to you.

631
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,594
I thought we were done.

632
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,930
Why did you come all the way here?

633
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,306
You may be done,

634
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,102
but I'm not.

635
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,398
Why is this so hard?

636
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,568
We need to talk.

637
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,280
I've long forgotten the guys

638
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:28,033
I spent years together in the military.

639
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,455
Do-san.

640
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,624
Where are you going? It's late.
Are you crazy?

641
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,420
Out of my 30 years of life,
we only spent a few months together.

642
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,839
Why is it so hard to forget you?

643
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,020
Do you know how I came here?

644
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,563
Trying to forget you.

645
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:02,650
It took me five hours
to bike here from Seoul.

646
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,736
I was running away from you
for three years.

647
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:08,448
I had a long, painful journey,
falling and rolling on the unpaved road.

648
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,534
Why do you not fade even a little?

649
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,620
How could you show up here so easily?

650
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,413
You forgot me so easily.

651
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,749
So why can't I…

652
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,001
This is killing me.

653
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,380
Why is it so easy for you?

654
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,469
It wasn't easy for me, either.

655
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,519
I, too, had

656
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,233
quite a difficult journey.

657
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,781
So we need to talk.

658
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:17,433
I packed this just in case.
Looks like it was a good call.

659
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,774
It'll be ready in three minutes.

660
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,032
Go inside and sleep.

661
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,954
No. I'm going to stay out here all night.

662
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:43,168
I have a hard time sleeping
at someone else's place anyway.

663
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,273
Why Tarzan?

664
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:07,984
What?

665
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,528
Your self-driving car is called

666
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,698
Tarzan.

667
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:20,079
Then, what about machine learning?

668
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,918
This is a computer.
Let's say his name is Tarzan.

669
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:29,172
He gives Jane a rock,
and she doesn't like that.

670
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,675
But when he gives her a flower,
it makes her happy.

671
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,553
The Tarzan story you told me…

672
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,182
It was fascinating.

673
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,894
It was super cool.

674
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,149
What's cool about it? It was childish.

675
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,734
It was stupid.

676
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,908
It was cool.

677
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:02,288
Just how much could it learn?
The possibilities were endless.

678
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,668
That's why I named the car Tarzan.

679
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:14,509
What about you?

680
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:20,056
Why did you work with self-driving cars
at 2STO?

681
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,892
The company made me do it.

682
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,603
No special reason.

683
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:30,293
Security, medical diagnosis,
smart factories, and self-driving cars.

684
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:34,047
Samsan Tech will enable
all of these things,

685
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,591
and I am so elated to be
a part of their journey.

686
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:37,634
On Demo Day, we saw

687
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:41,054
that our algorithm can even work
on single-board computers.

688
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:44,265
If we managed to do it
with image recognition software,

689
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,392
maybe we can build a self-driving system.

690
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,066
Dal-mi.

691
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,778
Your idea

692
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,408
fascinated me, too.

693
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:45,636
KIYEONG LAW OFFICES

694
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:47,930
KIYEONG LAW OFFICES

695
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:51,309
This is it.

696
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,285
Hello? Yes, please go ahead.

697
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,078
I know. Gosh.

698
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:14,749
Really? Keep walking. Keep going.

699
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:29,680
Okay. Please review the contract
and send it to me.

700
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,682
Thank you.

701
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,226
What?

702
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,980
- What?
- Oh, my.

703
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,234
Ms. Jung, do you work here?

704
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:44,445
Yes. What are you doing here?

705
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:48,241
I'm here to get legal advice
on incorporation.

706
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:51,869
What a coincidence!

707
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,706
Incorporation?
Are you starting a new business?

708
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,166
That's right.

709
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:05,424
Have you decided on the name? You can't
use the name Samsan Tech anymore.

710
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,552
Oh, you're right.

711
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:10,304
Instead of Samsan Tech,

712
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:14,851
we're considering Sansam Tech.
Clever, right?

713
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:18,104
Are you serious?
That's even worse than Samsan Tech.

714
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:22,358
Not good? All right.

715
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:23,734
Off the list, then.

716
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:27,154
That wasn't our first choice, anyway.
Our first choice is TMT.

717
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:31,200
In this global age, we need
an English name. TMT.

718
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,259
You're right.

719
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,929
That's not good. What do we do, then?

720
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,222
Your English is good.

721
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,391
I don't need to tutor you, do I?

722
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,313
Why did you tell me it was bad?

723
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,064
Well, that's…

724
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:06,110
Tell me. Did you really come here
by chance?

725
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,574
What about you?

726
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:16,662
At the restaurant the other day…
Did you really run into us?

727
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,416
I asked you first.

728
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:22,793
- I didn't come by chance.
- I didn't, either.

729
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:26,255
I went there after watching your vlog.

730
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,018
Ms. Jung, by any chance--

731
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,312
Stop. Don't read too much into it.

732
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:45,942
I was just curious to know
how my ex-colleagues were doing.

733
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,985
I see. Sorry.

734
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,531
Ms. Jung.

735
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:57,495
Would you be interested
in working with me again, then?

736
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:03,292
You're not enjoying what you're doing now,

737
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:04,919
are you?

738
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:19,850
- Are you looking for someone?
- Oh, Mr. Park.

739
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,854
- I'm Manager Park now, by the way.
- I see. Hello, Manager Park.

740
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,233
I was wondering if I could see Ms. Yoon.

741
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,902
- Ms. Yoon?
- Yes, I need her advice on something.

742
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:38,536
All these people want to invest
in your company?

743
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:42,665
Yes, but we don't have any information
about the investors,

744
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:46,002
so we have no idea
which of these are reliable.

745
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,795
So you want a reference check.

746
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:53,300
Did you have an information session
for investors recently?

747
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:55,845
No, we aren't even incorporated yet.

748
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:58,681
They just showed up
after reading our magazine interview.

749
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:01,100
I'm guessing it's because
we've worked at 2STO.

750
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,769
They don't know anything
about your business plan?

751
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,565
Then it means they're ready
to pay for a product

752
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:09,775
without even knowing what it is.

753
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,610
Well, basically, yes.

754
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:15,740
Then it's safe to say
none of them are reliable investors.

755
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:21,078
They'll cheer you on even if
you're jumping into a fire by mistake.

756
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,207
You can throw them all away.

757
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,668
Instead of waiting for investors,

758
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,212
why don't you look for them yourselves?

759
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,298
If you get turned down,

760
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,925
ask why you got turned down.

761
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,260
By doing that,

762
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:40,056
you'll be able to find
the right investors.

763
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:45,478
I see. Thank you.

764
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,148
SH VENTURE CAPITAL

765
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:02,453
Mr. Han.

766
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,373
Do you have a minute?

767
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:15,341
Didn't I already tell you that
I'm only going to say good things to you?

768
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,134
I want to hear the bad things.

769
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,303
Can you tell me?

770
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:21,472
I'm not interested in your company.

771
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:25,226
I know. But please. I'm asking you.

772
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:26,936
What's this all about?

773
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:30,731
Didn't you say I was the one
who killed your brother?

774
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,820
Looking back,

775
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,783
I just needed someone to blame.

776
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,246
I apologize.

777
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:56,382
I apologize, too.

778
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:04,140
I thought I was being honest,
but in reality, I was being too harsh.

779
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,310
I'm sorry.

780
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:14,108
We don't need empty compliments right now.

781
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:17,903
What we need is your honest criticism.

782
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:26,412
Why did the three of you
launch a start-up?

783
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,831
To run a business or to write programs?

784
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,459
Well, I'm not sure.

785
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,545
Either way, the conclusion is simple.

786
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:37,423
If what excites you is writing programs
and seeing them run,

787
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,634
work as developers
at a company that pays you well.

788
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:43,804
If you're excited about
establishing and leading a company,

789
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,055
run your own company.

790
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:49,310
As you already know,

791
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:52,479
you'll face many hardships
while running a start-up.

792
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:56,150
The only thing that keeps you going
is the confidence

793
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:59,361
that you're doing what you love.

794
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,032
If you think about how it all started,

795
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,784
you won't need my criticism anymore.

796
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,248
There is a thing called
an elevator speech.

797
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:14,960
It's a pitch that is
brief and powerful enough

798
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,671
to change a person's mind

799
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:19,632
during a short, one-minute elevator ride.

800
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:22,760
I'm not interested in joining you.

801
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:24,261
Why not?

802
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,764
We're different from three years ago.

803
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:30,017
Investors are lining up
outside our office.

804
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:33,479
We can compensate you
better than any other company.

805
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,105
I already have enough money.

806
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:38,400
I didn't join Samsan Tech three years ago
for better compensation.

807
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:39,985
Then why did you?

808
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:46,784
Someone begged me so desperately.

809
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:49,703
Who? Do you mean Ms. Seo?

810
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:52,456
She was so desperate that she kneeled down

811
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:53,874
just to recruit me.

812
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:56,710
If she was ready to go that far,

813
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:59,630
at least it wouldn't be boring
to work with her.

814
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:02,549
That's right. It sure was eventful.

815
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:09,014
Is anyone at your company
as desperate as Ms. Seo?

816
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:13,936
In other words, sometimes,
it doesn't take long at all

817
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,814
to change a person's mind.

818
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:19,775
One minute is all it takes.

819
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,737
Maybe we should reconsider
starting a business.

820
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,755
What can I do to make you work with us?

821
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,507
At least tell me the terms you want.

822
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:45,301
Forget it.

823
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:47,928
Stock options, ten percent?

824
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,181
Dal-mi, forget it.

825
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,851
Or do you want shares now?

826
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,145
I can try and persuade In-jae.

827
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:02,359
Can you at least read our business plan?

828
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,281
Where did it go? I had it in my bag.

829
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:11,452
Maybe I left it in the house.
Wait here. I'll go get it.

830
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:12,786
Dal-mi.

831
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:17,583
You don't have to go get it. I have it.

832
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:22,087
Often, what changes a person's mind are
not eloquent words…

833
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:23,839
Really?

834
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:25,883
Did you read it?

835
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,846
…but the desperation in your eyes…

836
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:41,565
Today, let's focus on collecting
corner case data.

837
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:44,526
- Okay.
- I have a question for you guys.

838
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,990
I thought it'd take a while
to get you two on board.

839
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:53,035
But it was way easier than I expected.

840
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:57,081
Can you tell me
why you decided to join us?

841
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:58,415
It's simple.

842
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,044
We figured that we were all
in the same situation.

843
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:03,712
In the same situation?

844
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,924
We had to put up with being bossed around
by an incompetent moron

845
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,260
for a very long time.

846
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:13,347
…or sympathy for that person.

847
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,850
If we follow your advice,

848
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:20,020
we'd be better off finding partners

849
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,648
rather than starting our own business.

850
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,818
If that's your conclusion, yes.

851
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:29,405
- I have one more question.
- Are we not done yet?

852
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:33,826
If we were to find partners,
we'd rather work with

853
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,537
Ms. Seo's Cheongmyeong Company.

854
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,580
We've been offered the CTO position.

855
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,292
Do you think we should join them?

856
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:46,130
We'll all be working together
just like in the Samsan Tech days.

857
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:47,381
I don't like the idea.

858
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,719
As a man,

859
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,099
I want to stop you.

860
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:05,107
But as an investor…

861
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:09,153
But nothing can change
a person's mind more easily…

862
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:12,656
…I believe you'll be

863
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:15,617
great partners.

864
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,120
…than when you tell the truth

865
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,289
despite everything.

866
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,649
- Did you check everything thoroughly?
- Yes.

867
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,780
My father and Sang-su are here.
Do you see them?

868
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,036
Yes, I see them.

869
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:12,090
- Let's do this!
- Let's go!

870
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:17,971
Who will be the safety driver?

871
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,809
- Me.
- All right. Shall we start?

872
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:24,311
Sure.

873
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:49,711
Are you ready?

874
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,673
Yes. Let's start.

875
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,138
This is exciting.

876
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,792
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TEST DRIVE

877
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:22,179
We've been saving this
for a special occasion,

878
01:17:22,262 --> 01:17:24,306
but when will that be?

879
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,021
Who could it be?

880
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:36,026
Who is it?

881
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:39,988
Hello, Mr. Nam. It's Seo Dal-mi.

882
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:42,199
Do you remember me?

883
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:44,660
Who is it?

884
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:51,124
It's that girl.

885
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,752
Do-san's ex-girlfriend, Seo Dal-mi.

886
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:54,878
Why is she here?

887
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:57,381
Do-san is on a trip
to get over her right now.

888
01:17:57,964 --> 01:17:58,965
Is it not over yet?

889
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:01,468
I thought it was.

890
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:06,306
She came all the way here.

891
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:09,559
There's a 30-percent chance
that she still has feelings left.

892
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:10,686
Right?

893
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:12,312
And?

894
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:13,980
We should let her in first.

895
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:15,273
What?

896
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:19,653
If she insists
on going to where Do-san is,

897
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:22,114
- there's a 50-percent chance.
- And?

898
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,658
It's a long, difficult journey
to your uncle's house.

899
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:26,743
If she takes that journey,

900
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:28,578
there's a 70-percent chance.

901
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:34,084
What about the remaining 30 percent?

902
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:36,169
That's up to Do-san.

903
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:41,758
If she goes all the way to him
and he comes back alone,

904
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,093
everything's over.

905
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:53,854
If they come back together,

906
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,356
it's 100 percent certain.

907
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,863
The money I got
when 2STO took over Samsan Tech…

908
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:04,740
I still have it.

909
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:10,662
With that money, I want to acquire
shares in Cheongmyeong Company.

910
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,500
What are you talking about?
That should be your money.

911
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:19,713
Just join the company.
About shares, I'll talk to In-jae--

912
01:19:19,796 --> 01:19:21,006
That's my condition.

913
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,205
I don't want to lose them again.

914
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,790
That's my priority.

915
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,209
I think we have a shot at winning the bid.

916
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:01,087
I told you before. If you
sail off without a map, you'll die.

917
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:03,799
To me, sailing off without
a map was marvelous.

918
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:05,801
I might've failed, but I have no regrets.

919
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,470
Seo Dal-mi threatened us
once before, right?

920
01:20:08,553 --> 01:20:10,597
I think we should do the same.

921
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,308
She likes me because
I have big hands. That's it.

922
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:14,851
Stop feeling inferior to me

923
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:17,604
and look at Dal-mi again.

924
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:20,357
Why do you like me?

925
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:25,278
