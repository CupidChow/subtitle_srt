EPISODE 8

2
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,286
Mr. Kim, are you not leaving?

3
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,997
I need to back up what we worked on today.

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,791
Why do you back up so often?

5
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,001
You can never back up too often.

6
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,921
Exactly. At my previous job… I mean,

7
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,173
it was this huge company.
I forgot to back up,

8
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,425
and it almost cost me 100 million won.

9
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,304
You know the company,
Just One Day, on the second floor?

10
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,806
- Good luck, Mr. Kim.
- Thanks.

11
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,683
Of course.
They recently raised four billion won.

12
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,769
- See you, buddy.
- See you.

13
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:49,651
They lost 100 million won to a hacker
through a ransomware attack.

14
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,319
Really?

15
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,365
Those damn hackers make it even more
difficult for us to become successful.

16
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,618
We'd better lock the stable door
before the horse is stolen.

17
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,871
We don't even have any horses yet.
What's the point?

18
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,833
Why back up when there's nothing to steal?

19
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,960
It never hurts to be prepared.

20
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,088
Who knows if investments
will suddenly start pouring in?

21
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,257
Exactly. You never know.

22
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,511
Yes, you never know.

23
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,390
Even if you don't like someone now…
My backpack is open, Ms. Jung.

24
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,103
You might one day go crazy
for that person.

25
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,688
Stop it.

26
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,773
Sometimes, the opposite happens.

27
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,032
Who knows if your best friend
will one day become

28
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,368
your worst enemy?

29
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,498
People are unpredictable, and so is life.

30
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,418
There's no telling what might happen.

31
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,004
So is coding.

32
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,797
From a power outage to hacking,

33
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,717
all kinds of things can happen,
and there's nothing you can do.

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,094
The footage of Nam Do-san making a scene…

35
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,013
That's why we should…

36
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,057
Hand the CCTV footage
over to the legal team.

37
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,767
…always back up.

38
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,937
This looks bad.

39
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,444
I heard engineers should be as careful
with their hands as pianists.

40
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,487
Don't worry. It's not a big deal.

41
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,077
Should we go to the hospital?

42
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,623
No. It's just a little scratch.

43
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,001
Still…

44
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,268
- Dal-mi.
- Yes?

45
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,896
Can I ask you something?

46
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,439
What is it?

47
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,275
What do you like about me?

48
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,819
What?

49
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,700
Well…

50
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,039
You asked this question once before.

51
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,250
What?

52
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,460
Did I?

53
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,712
I don't remember it.

54
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,924
Your hand.

55
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,637
I like your hand.

56
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,813
You supported me completely today.

57
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,150
I'll never forget it.

58
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,700
It's done.

59
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:10,351
A COPY OF DATA STORED ELSEWHERE
TO PREPARE FOR WHEN THE ORIGINAL IS LOST

60
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,365
What the hell?

61
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,744
Why would anyone give flowers to a girl?
You can't even eat them.

62
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,330
I know. That guy's clueless.

63
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,249
An external hard drive
or a wireless keyboard would last longer.

64
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,585
Exactly. What an idiot.

65
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,839
Hold on. What's that moron doing now?

66
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,800
Is his body temperature 40°C or something?

67
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,927
Everyone has the same body temperature.

68
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,556
- Why would he give his jacket to her?
- That's completely pointless…

69
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,896
I guess it wasn't pointless, after all.

70
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,398
It totally makes sense.

71
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,858
Gosh. Look, Chul-san.

72
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:02,403
I guess this is a sign
that we live in a developed country.

73
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,448
I know. Do you think
we'll become like them one day?

74
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,908
Of course.

75
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,993
If this punk did, why can't we?

76
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,955
- Yong-san, I agree.
- Right?

77
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,832
It's all about the hands.

78
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,542
It really is.

79
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,212
- What?
- No idea.

80
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:24,050
Guys, don't you think
it's the perfect weather for coding?

81
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,012
Gosh, what's with the sky?
Why is it so beautiful?

82
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,014
What happened? Why is it so blue?

83
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,433
Click.

84
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,895
Hold on. Feel the wind. It's perfect.

85
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,690
The weather today is just crazy.

86
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,484
- Click.
- It's you that's crazy.

87
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,202
Is he really crazy? What's with him?

88
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,497
They're song lyrics. "Good Day" by IU.

89
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,415
He's so happy that he's going crazy.

90
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,337
Gosh. If that's what happens
when you become one of them,

91
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,506
Chul-san, I choose to not take that path.

92
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,758
But I do.

93
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,385
You stay here.

94
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,970
Click.

95
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,224
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

96
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,274
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

97
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,817
Let's keep in touch.

98
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,610
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

99
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,324
What did you talk about?

100
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,372
She told us what she'd like
in our solution.

101
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,001
Is that so? What might those things be,
Ms. Jung?

102
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,338
First of all, it needs excellent
image and text recognition ability

103
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,090
even when the image and text
are moving quickly.

104
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,635
Handwriting recognition is a must,
and so is money identification.

105
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,598
Apparently, the visually impaired
are often short-changed.

106
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,601
Can you make it work?

107
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,685
- No.
- Yes.

108
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,603
- Hey!
- Hey!

109
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,939
Most apps for the visually impaired
have these functions.

110
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,941
We need to provide
differentiated features.

111
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,612
Developers sound sexy
when they say they can do something.

112
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,908
- We can do it.
- You said you wouldn't take that path.

113
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,784
But it's the path to differentiation.

114
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,661
What features could we add?

115
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,379
Do you think
we could make guide dogs talk?

116
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,344
We can't because we're
developers, not gods.

117
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,597
You're right. I know it's impossible,

118
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,391
but if I were blind,
I'd need that more than anything.

119
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,897
"How many people are in front of me?
What do their expressions look like?

120
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,566
Where's the crosswalk?"

121
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,695
I'd wish my dog could answer
those questions.

122
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,324
But you can't make a dog talk.

123
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,535
Not even Tony Stark could do that.

124
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,038
Wait, we can do it.

125
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,042
Are you saying you can surpass Tony Stark?

126
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,460
- Dal-mi.
- Yes?

127
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,755
You're a genius. How did you
think of such a great idea?

128
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,008
Me? I don't think I am.

129
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,135
You are. You really are a genius.

130
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,137
What's so great about my idea?

131
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,765
Why am I suddenly a genius?

132
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,600
- Let's go. I'll explain to you.
- What?

133
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,186
- Come on.
- Me?

134
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,563
I'm a genius?

135
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,775
Am I the only one who doesn't understand
what's going on?

136
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,153
What is he talking about?
Why is she a genius?

137
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,781
Because she's exceptionally pretty?

138
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,743
But that's you, Ms. Jung.

139
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,710
All right. This will differentiate us.

140
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:49,088
It's an AI speaker, right?
What was its name again?

141
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,549
Hello. My name is Yeong-sil.

142
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,844
Yeong-sil, where's the crosswalk?

143
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,929
I'd tell you if I could see where it is.

144
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,224
See? It'd tell us if it could see it.

145
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,060
So let's show it to him.

146
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,355
- You're amazing!
- We'll show it?

147
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,609
- That sounds great.
- Am I the only one who doesn't understand?

148
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,651
How can we show it?

149
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,405
Ms. Jung, what's the technology

150
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,532
we have?

151
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,703
- Image recognition.
- Bingo.

152
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:25,249
What if we combine image recognition
with voice-processing technology?

153
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,254
You ask the speaker a question.

154
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,174
Then the camera sees.

155
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,054
And the speaker answers the question.

156
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,015
So the speaker enables
a two-way communication?

157
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,767
Exactly.

158
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,604
But how do we put Yeong-sil in this?

159
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,564
All we have to do is

160
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,150
use Yeong-sil's API in our app.

161
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,818
Is that even possible?

162
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,695
Real-time implementation might be hard.

163
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,158
Don't worry. We can make it work. We will.

164
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,951
I'll make sure we find a way.

165
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,124
Ms. Jung, join us.

166
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,088
It won't work.

167
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,841
Why do you say that
without even looking into it?

168
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,303
- This is a brilliant idea--
- I know. It is brilliant.

169
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,680
I like the name, too. "NoonGil."

170
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,848
BUSINESS PLAN

171
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,018
But if this were such a great idea,
why has no one done it yet?

172
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,147
- There are similar services, in the US.
- I know.

173
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,191
Google and MS are doing it.

174
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,153
And a mere start-up wants to do it?

175
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,198
Yes, we do.

176
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,908
Why? Do you think we can't?

177
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,412
Do you want facts
or a future filled with hopes and dreams?

178
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,623
A future filled with hopes and dreams.

179
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,918
That's never going to come.

180
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,506
Ms. Yoon, what are you doing here?

181
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,009
Why are you being so negative?

182
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,762
Have you calculated the API cost
of Yeong-sil?

183
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,597
Of course.

184
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,018
I've calculated the estimated cost
based on a similar solution in the US.

185
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:12,022
The API cost of Yeong-sil is
4 won per 15 seconds.

186
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,984
Let's say each user uses our service
for 5 minutes a day

187
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,193
and our DAU is 1,000.

188
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,114
That gives us a yearly API cost
of 29,200,000 won,

189
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,283
which is just under 30 million.

190
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,118
And where does that money come from?

191
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,037
- In-app advertising, of course--
- Are you sure?

192
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,039
Who is your app for again?

193
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,835
Then we'll find investors.

194
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,883
If your DAU is 1,000, it costs 30 million.
If it's 10,000, then 300 million.

195
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,760
The more users, the higher the cost.
Who'd invest in this?

196
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,971
I'm sure someone will.

197
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,183
Surely, there will be investors out there
who will be moved

198
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,518
- by our solution.
- No, there won't be.

199
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,520
Investors are moved by one thing.

200
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,231
- Money.
- No.

201
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,525
We can persuade them
with something else other--

202
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,568
No, you can't.

203
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,368
No one wants Samsan Tech to succeed
more than I do.

204
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,704
But even I'm not convinced.

205
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,498
How are you going to persuade others?

206
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,708
What if I convince you?

207
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,962
What if I try to persuade you,
and it works?

208
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,672
It won't.

209
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,176
Still, let me give it a try.

210
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,805
What? What are you doing?

211
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,182
What is this?

212
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,851
If I manage to convince you,
it'll light up.

213
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,396
I told you. It's not going to work.

214
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,903
Let me tell you about my childhood memory.

215
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,071
It's already wrong.

216
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:46,033
Don't be so mushy. Investors want to hear
about facts and data.

217
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,913
It was about 15 years ago.

218
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,624
One day,

219
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,211
Do-san sent me this letter.

220
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,090
And it taught me something.

221
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,717
I thought he'd always be with me.

222
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:08,430
How precious the things
that I take for granted actually are.

223
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,269
I took the time
we spent together for granted

224
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,188
when every moment was a gift.

225
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,315
And how valuable everyday life is.

226
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,069
That's what the letter taught me.

227
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,550
I'm not trying to achieve
something new and great here.

228
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,093
It's just…

229
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,806
For some people, what's ordinary to us
isn't ordinary at all.

230
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,267
I want our technology to help them.

231
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,728
Even just a little bit.

232
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,440
Even if it's just a tiny little bit,

233
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,692
if we can protect their everyday lives,

234
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,862
I think that's reason enough to do this.

235
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,992
I'm sure someone out there thinks like me.

236
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,296
Hold on. See? You're convinced, right?

237
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,466
What? Wait, what's going on? Gosh.

238
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,384
- What is this?
- Is your heart fluttering?

239
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,887
This is unfair. This is…

240
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,263
This is cheating.

241
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,223
Who says my heart is fluttering?

242
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,435
This thing is a failure.
It's malfunctioning. It's an error.

243
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,687
Deny it all you want,

244
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,814
but the heart never lies.

245
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,859
Thank you for your honest opinion.

246
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,527
No, wait. This is not right.

247
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,613
Hey. Wait, Ms. Seo.

248
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,579
Think again.

249
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,873
It's a path filled with hardship.

250
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:02,419
While trying to do good,
you'll fail everyone. You could get hurt.

251
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,381
Mr. Han.

252
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,134
I've given it a lot of thought,

253
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:14,223
and I think I actually enjoy hardship.

254
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,643
So don't worry too much.

255
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,728
And thanks for the coffee.

256
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,576
What do I do with her?

257
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,038
- I can see why your heart fluttered.
- No, it didn't…

258
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,249
Ms. Yoon.

259
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,420
The more success they have,
the harder the CEO will have to work,

260
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,505
since they have to rely on investments.

261
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,548
Please sit.

262
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,970
I ran a business like this myself
when I was young.

263
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,515
I had to beg for money day in, day out.

264
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,641
It was nerve-racking.

265
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,934
Exactly.

266
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,228
But the thing is,

267
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,899
they're at least clear about "why."

268
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,401
But that's about it.

269
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,445
They don't know what to do
or how to do it.

270
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,115
As long as they know why they do it,
the rest will follow.

271
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,328
Like the girl on the swing?

272
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,039
Exactly.

273
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,170
Well… Ms. Yoon.

274
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,382
- Let me tell you something.
- What is it?

275
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:35,387
Ms. Won In-jae and Ms. Seo Dal-mi
are sisters.

276
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,600
What?

277
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,561
Their last names are different.

278
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,521
Their parents got divorced,

279
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,231
and they grew up separately.

280
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,985
Ms. Seo lived with her father,
and Ms. Won her mother.

281
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,407
Does that mean…

282
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,702
Yes. The girl on the swing

283
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,413
might be Ms. Won,

284
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,999
but it might also be Ms. Seo.

285
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,427
All you do is sit on your ass all day.

286
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,098
Oh, are you actually standing?
I didn't know.

287
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,309
I thought you were sitting down
because you're so short.

288
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,229
Why didn't you say that to his face?

289
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,693
Don't worry. I did something
even worse to him.

290
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,781
I heard. Nam Do-san smashed his nameplate?

291
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,243
Why? I gave you that information
to help you.

292
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,790
It's just… I didn't want to let you
have your way this time.

293
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,041
Have my way?

294
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,671
You know, you used to dump
all the food you didn't like on me.

295
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,423
Bitter persimmons, sour apples…

296
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,885
Food that only looked good on the outside.
You don't remember?

297
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,013
I'm not sure.

298
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,893
You fooled me so many times,
but I still ate

299
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,521
the awful things you gave me.

300
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,065
I was so stupid.

301
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,779
But I don't want to be anymore.
That's why this time, I spat it out.

302
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,950
Ms. Seo.

303
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,956
I have a meeting to attend. See you.

304
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,794
Let's go.

305
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,304
PART-TIME HELP WANTED

306
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,896
No…

307
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,024
No matter how pinched I am,
I can't do that.

308
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,903
I'll get a herniated disc
if I lift heavy things at my age.

309
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,459
FINALE ADDICT

310
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,468
- Yes?
- You finally picked up.

311
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,220
Is your puberty over yet?

312
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,181
Can you reopen my credit cards?

313
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,516
Have you run out of cash now?

314
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,644
You lasted pretty long this time, though.

315
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,146
Yes.

316
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,358
I can't do that
unless you give me something in return.

317
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:35,943
Like what?

318
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,779
Bring In-jae back home,
and I'll reopen your cards.

319
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,907
Bring her back home?

320
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,867
Did she run away from home?

321
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,035
You didn't know that?

322
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,415
Oh, my. You two never cease to amaze me.

323
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,792
When did she leave?

324
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,378
Right after making a scene
at the shareholders' meeting.

325
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,505
Have you heard anything from…

326
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,799
Hello? A-hyeon?

327
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,094
Is this woman crazy?

328
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,563
Hello? In-jae?

329
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,697
I heard that you ran away from home.

330
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,825
Where are you staying? A hotel?

331
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,287
No. I'm renting a studio apartment
near Sand Box.

332
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:34,001
A studio apartment?
A CEO can't live in a studio apartment.

333
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,629
Many CEOs do that.
It's fully furnished and safe.

334
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,715
More than anything, I feel at home.

335
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,554
Why don't you just swallow your pride
and go back to your father's company--

336
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,391
- Mom.
- He seems to want you back.

337
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,144
- I also--
- If that's what this is about, I'm off.

338
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,938
No, wait. Fine.

339
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,815
Just finish your food.

340
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:12,956
So?

341
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,000
Are you satisfied?

342
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,877
Yes.

343
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,629
What? Do you think I'm not?

344
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,590
No.

345
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,800
You look satisfied.

346
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,604
This is a list of CSR teams.

347
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,982
You can't display advertisements
or charge your users.

348
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:43,278
The only way for you to make money is
through help from big companies.

349
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,033
I made a list of companies that have
a high CSR budget for this year.

350
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,702
Okay. Let me explain.

351
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,456
The ones in blue are interested
in the welfare of the handicapped.

352
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,251
The ones in red
need to work on their image

353
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,671
because of problematic owners,
tax evasion charges, and so on.

354
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,091
Bring that up, and they'll listen.

355
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,510
Thank you, Mr. Han.

356
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:13,767
For what?

357
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,394
You usually put the brakes on what we do,

358
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,814
but this time, you're stepping on the gas.

359
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,649
Cars without brakes can't speed

360
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,110
because they'd have to ram into a wall
to stop.

361
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,611
I know that.

362
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,782
I ask you to keep
putting the brakes on us.

363
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,077
All right.

364
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,288
Wait, Mr. Han.

365
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,792
May I ask when your birthday is?

366
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,001
Why?

367
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,712
I want to do something.
I think I'll continue to be nosy.

368
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,005
When is it?

369
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,177
It's May 7.

370
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,972
Gosh, I missed it.

371
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,936
Wait, did you say May 7?

372
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,480
Yes, it's the same as Do-san's.

373
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,481
My birthday.

374
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,516
We, Samsan Tech, developed NoonGil

375
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,727
for the visually impaired.

376
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,563
By combining image recognition
and AI voice-processing,

377
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,066
it's much more convenient for users.

378
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,610
If Me Group funds this service,

379
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,239
we believe it would help enhance
Me Group's public image.

380
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,992
- Can I get your business card?
- Sure. Here you go.

381
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,998
I'll discuss with the team
and let you know.

ME GROUP

NoonGil isn't only interested in profits.

384
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,849
We intend to promote the public good
by helping the visually impaired.

385
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,268
Funding the operation of this service

386
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,854
would greatly enhance
the image of World Oil.

387
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:50,608

00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,537
But I'm already in the lobby right now.

390
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,539
Can you spare five minutes?

391
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,376
I see.

00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,505
How about next week, then?

394
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,383
I won't have time next week, either.

395
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,718
Please just email me the information.

396
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,809
Excuse me.
Are you Ms. Lee Hye-won, by any chance?

397
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,770
Yes, that's me. Who are you?

398
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,440
I'm Seo Dal-mi, CEO of Samsan Tech,
the one on the phone with you.

399
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,525
Oh, I see.

400
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,824
I'm sorry, but something came up,
so I'm headed for Gapyeong right now.

401
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,242
Oh, really?

402
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,162
I happen to be headed there, too.

403
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:30,250
How about I join you and
brief you on our service on the way?

404
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,167
Let's go.

405
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:33,837
Sure.

406
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,930
Yeong-sil, turn on NoonGil.

407
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,349
Okay.

408
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,772
Try showing this to the camera.

409
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:58,111
Our service, NoonGil,
started with the question,

410
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,072
"What if guide dogs could talk?"

411
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,826
Oh, okay.

412
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,371
Samsan Tech was established
based on image recognition technology.

413
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,334
And that technology works
as the guide dog's eyes.

414
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,212
Yeong-sil, what is this?

415
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,092
There are two 10,000-won bills
and four 1,000-won bills.

416
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,636
- Yes! It worked!
- It's correct.

417
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,847
- It's accurate!
- It worked!

418
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,182
This is incredible.

419
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,435
I'm so thankful. I love it.

420
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,605
Using our technology,
it recognizes objects

421
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,107
and tells you the result.

422
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,944
NoonGil lets the visually impaired
read books,

423
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,613
get on the right buses,

424
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,991
and check the expiration date
on a milk carton

425
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,659
before buying it.

426
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,244
It might sound trivial,

427
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,580
but it can bring about amazing results.

428
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:54,375
Try showing other things, too.
Yeong-sil knows everything.

429
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,376
Try anything.

430
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,045
What? Me?

431
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:01,591
Yeong-sil, who is the person
in front of me?

432
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:05,845
It's a man in his 20s wearing
fake glasses to look stylish.

433
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,517
- That's accurate.
- It tells everything as it is.

434
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,482
I feel hurt.
It didn't have to be so specific.

435
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,995
The founder of Seonju Insurance Company
has always emphasized

436
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,081
the importance of building
a society for all.

437
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,458
NoonGil fully embodies the spirit of that…

438
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,252
You have arrived at your destination.

439
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,673
We're here. Where are you going?

440
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,472
It's not far from here.

441
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,473
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

442
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,155
Your service sounds great,

443
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:10,577
but we've already allotted our budget
for the year to this place.

444
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,454
I'm afraid we can't fund NoonGil.

445
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,208
Oh… I see.

446
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,169
- Then please consider it next year.
- Of course.

447
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,756
I'll include it in the list.
It sounds like a great service.

448
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,134
Thank you.

449
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,011
See you again, Ms. Seo.

450
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,762
Okay. See you.

Hi, Ji-pyeong. It's Hye-won.

454
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,088
I see telephone poles everywhere.

455
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,383
How can there be no reception?

456
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,597
I think I'm going deeper and deeper
into the mountains.

457
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,028
What is this?

458
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,197
Cow dung?

459
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,578
Gosh.

460
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,959
Unbelievable.

461
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,339
What should I do?

462
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,510
Seriously.

463
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,472
Darn it.

464
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,149
Mr. Han?

465
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,069
- Get in.
- What are you doing here?

466
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,324
I had some business nearby. Get in.

467
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,619
The thing is,

468
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,455
my shoe is covered in cow dung.

469
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,915
Cow dung?

470
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,962
It's pretty bad, right?

471
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,549
- What do we do with this?
- My, that's…

472
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,136
- Can you turn it a little?
- Hold the back…

473
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,014
Oh, my.

474
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,650
You haven't used that bag
for incombustible waste yet?

475
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,904
Oh, that. I don't need it anymore.

476
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,787
What were you doing here, anyway?

477
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,250
Well, I…

478
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,295
I come here quite often.

479
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,884
What's there to do out here in Gapyeong?

480
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,597
There are things to do. For example…

481
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,182
PINE NUT KALGUKSU

482
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,270
Pine nut kalguksu. I love it.

483
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,939
I come eat it every week.
Gapyeong is famous for it.

484
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,701
Take a nap. I hear you've been
pulling many all-nighters.

485
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,578
I'm okay.

486
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,665
I have trouble falling asleep
in someone else's car anyway.

487
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,502
Come on. I'll drive gently.

488
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,088
Try and get some sleep…

489
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,713
I ran a business like this myself
when I was young.

490
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,259
I had to beg for money day in, day out.

491
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,552
It was nerve-racking.

492
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,785
DISPLAY OFF

493
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,906
Did I fall asleep? No way.

494
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,909
You did. You completely passed out

495
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,745
in someone else's car.

496
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,084
Put on these sandals.
Your shoes are covered in cow dung.

497
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,258
Thank you so much.

498
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,427
This is embarrassing.

499
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,804
Gosh. Thank you.

500
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,226
Put them on.

501
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,519
Thank you.

502
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,200
Why don't you just exclude
voice-processing technology?

503
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,828
Combining it with image recognition
is difficult and expensive.

504
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,205
It'd be easier without it.

505
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,875
But Do-san is going to pull it off.

506
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,918
So am I.

507
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,587
I knew you'd say that.

508
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,882
Also, I have a favor to ask you.

509
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,885
Please don't tell

510
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,138
Do-san about this.

511
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:51,143
I want him to focus on his work
without worrying about money.

512
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,939
That's very touching.

513
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,401
- All right.
- Oh, my.

514
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,278
See you.

515
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,598
- Is this it? This one?
- Yes.

516
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,810
- Guys, let's do this!
- Here we go!

517
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,610
Where did my scrunchie go?

518
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,872
- Dal-mi is here!
- Come here!

519
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,957
- Come!
- What took you so long?

520
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,000
Welcome back.

521
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,710
Ms. Seo… What?

522
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,303
The final test went very well.

523
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,473
Really? How was the recognition rate?

524
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,142
It was over 97 percent.
Everyone was satisfied.

525
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,855
How did it go for you?

526
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,024
Everyone was enthusiastic.

527
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:24,070
I should have taken more business cards.
Everyone asked for one.

528
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,740
I knew it. Who wouldn't love this service?

529
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,785
- Right.
- Now that everyone's here,

530
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,578
I'll publish the app on the store.

531
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:36,248
Wait! Why don't we make a bet?

532
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,959
Guess how many times
our app will be downloaded in a week.

533
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,462
Okay, deal. The winner treats everyone.

534
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,006
I'll start small and guess
our DAU will be 100.

535
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,508
If I win, I'll buy tangsuyuk.

536
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,052
Come on. 100 is too small.

537
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,387
I say 1,000.

538
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,847
If I win, I'll buy you samgyeopsal.

539
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:55,393
If your DAU is 1,000, it costs 30 million.
If it's 10,000, then 300 million.

540
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:59,063
Come on. Be ambitious, guys.

541
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,732
That's too small.
We should aim for at least 10,000.

542
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,361
The more users, the higher the cost.
Who'd invest in this?

543
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,280
No, it's okay.

544
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,907
We can do it.

545
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,661
- Yes, we can do it!
- We can do it!

546
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,121
We can do this! 1, 2, 3…

547
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,455
- Chul-san…
- Yong-san…

548
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,416
Gosh, it never works.

549
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,252
If our DAU is over 1,000,
I'll treat you guys

550
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,212
to ten hours of karaoke!

551
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,672
- Yes!
- Let's do it!

552
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,465
Let's make this work.

553
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,843
Wait, should we upload it
to the global market?

554
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,302
Our app supports English.

555
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,639
Come on.
Don't you think it's too early to do that?

556
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,308
Why? It doesn't cost anything
to upload it.

557
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:37,935
Do it.

558
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,230
She's right. Our dream is to go global.
Do it.

559
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,150
Okay. Then I'll upload it.

560
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,902
Let's go! Okay.

561
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,280
SELECT A FILE TO UPLOAD

562
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,993
- Here we go! Karaoke!
- Drum roll.

563
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,287
- It's uploading!
- Here we go.

564
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,081
Lord, please.

565
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,625
Our DAU has to be lower than 1,000.

566
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,670
I know how selfish my prayer is.

567
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,006
But I'm desperate.

568
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:11,177
So please, the DAU of NoonGil

569
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,179
has to be lower than 1,000.

570
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,764
Please.

571
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:20,352
Hey, what are you praying for
so desperately?

572
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,897
It's a secret.

573
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,445
Lord.

574
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,156
I trust you.

575
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:53,052
Grandma, do Catholics not use talismans?
To make their prayers more effective?

576
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,096
What? Why don't you just go to a shaman?

577
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,182
I wish there were.

578
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,396
- Where did the digital door lock go?
- It broke, so I had it replaced.

579
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,732
Hey, take this key.

580
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,777
It's a hassle to carry around keys.

581
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,286
Why go back to the old ways?

582
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,039
- What?
- Technology is so convenient and awesome.

583
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,999
Let's just get another digital door lock.

584
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,378
I don't like technology.
It makes old people feel left out.

585
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,297
Why? Let me show you how great it is.

586
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,343
What are you doing?

587
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,265
Samsan Tech has finally launched
a service.

588
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,309
- What service?
- It's called NoonGil.

589
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,936
An app for the visually impaired.

590
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,900
Why the visually impaired out of the blue?

591
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,320
I thought you were working
on AI or something.

592
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,072
This app uses AI.

593
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,366
It was Do-san's idea.

594
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,704
- It was Do-san's idea?
- Yes.

595
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,665
Using voice and image recognition
technology,

596
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,084
this app becomes the eyes
for the visually impaired.

597
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,924
What? There's not much feedback yet.

598
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,011
Feedback?

599
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,388
What's that?

600
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,099
The users' opinions about our service.

601
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,685
There you go.

602
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:29,023
Grandma, call Yeong-sil's name
and ask a question.

603
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,524
- Here?
- Yes.

604
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,070
Yeong-sil.

605
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,741
Who is the person in front of me?

606
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,119
A woman in her 20s is smiling.

607
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,788
So? Isn't it cool?

608
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,666
Yes, it is pretty cool.

609
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,357
Yeong-sil.

610
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,777
Can you read this Bible passage for me?

611
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,328
"The fig tree ripens her green figs.

612
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:28,123
The blossoming vines
give out their fragrance.

613
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,252
Arise, my love, and come.

614
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,964
My beautiful one, come with me.

615
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,051
My dove in the clefts of the rock,

616
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,970
in the hiding places of the mountainside,

617
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,765
show me your face,

618
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,810
let me hear your voice,

619
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,146
for your voice is sweet

620
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,108
and your face is lovely."

621
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,568
DOWNLOAD ANALYTICS

622
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,993
Stop refreshing the page.

623
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,120
That doesn't change
the number of downloads.

624
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,205
I just can't believe it.

625
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,749
There haven't even been ten downloads.

626
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,419
We should be happy if our DAU reaches 20.

627
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,338
I wonder what the problem is.

628
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,424
This is really upsetting.

629
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,010
But you don't look upset at all.

630
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,555
It's all about marketing.

631
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,140
Hey.

632
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,310
Well? Would you like help
from a marketing expert?

633
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,771
Do you have any ideas?

634
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,858
I can always come up with one.

635
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,909
So he doesn't have any.

636
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,410
- That's right.
- Exactly.

637
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,959
Guys, cheer up.

638
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,879
I'll treat you all to some chicken.

639
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,798
Cheer up! Let's go have some chicken.

640
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,009
It's my treat. Let's go.

641
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,261
Come on, let's go.

642
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,765
It's okay. We can do this, right?

643
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,850
Let's have some chicken. It's my treat.

644
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:55,229
Let's go. Chicken!

645
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,148
- Why are you crying?
- Come on.

646
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,443
- Order everything.
- Up to this point, I thought

647
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,320
- Come on.
- my prayer had been answered.

648
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,446
Hello!

649
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,783
But as usual, Lord answered my prayer…

650
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,702
- What brings you here at this hour?
- I'm looking for something.

651
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,704
- Hey.
- Hello.

652
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,123
The picture of Do-san and Park Chan-ho.
Is it here?

653
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,543
Yes, but why do you need that?

654
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,503
…in a peculiar way.

655
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,299
Where's the picture?

656
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,802
There it is.

657
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,639
There it is.

658
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,272
What are you doing?

659
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,607
It's viral marketing.

660
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,109
Let's drink.

661
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,695
VIRAL MARKETING: A SALES TECHNIQUE
THAT INVOLVES SOCIAL MEDIA

662
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:47,281
TO SPREAD INFORMATION
ABOUT A PRODUCT QUICKLY

663
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,619
Excuse me. Spicy fried chicken
and a pitcher of beer, please.

664
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,121
Coming up.

665
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,416
The beer tastes bitter today.

666
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,086
Why? It tastes sweet to me.

667
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,131
While we were eating fried chicken…

668
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,592
We have one more download now.

669
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,427
That's incredible.

670
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,431
It's okay. Let's drink.

671
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,650
Are you crying?

672
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,069
The beer tastes spicy today.

673
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:30,073
Unbelievably, our app was downloaded…

674
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:41,001
2 NEW MESSAGES FROM NAM CHEON-HO

675
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,544
DO YOU REMEMBER THIS PICTURE?

676
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,963
THE KID IS NOW ALL GROWN UP
AND LAUNCHED A START-UP.

677
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,381
"NoonGil"?

678
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,801
NOONGIL

679
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,429
VIEW

680
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,599
…halfway around the world in LA

681
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:59,311
by the baseball legend, Park Chan-ho.

682
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:12,491
Oh, my. Isn't the wind so refreshing?

683
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,166
Excuse me. Can you close the window?

684
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,130
Dal-mi, I'm sorry,
but can you close the window?

685
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,133
Why? Isn't it so nice?

686
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,427
- Well…
- Fine.

687
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,722
I'll open it just this much.

688
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,476
Just this much. Are you happy now?

689
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,939
It smells like summer.

690
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,857
I'm sorry.

691
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,587
Oh, my.

692
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:11,883
Did she get drunk and rub her nose
on the bus window again?

693
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,677
You know about that?

694
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,680
Of course. When she sobers up,

695
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:23,603
she'll throw a tantrum
saying that someone drew on her face.

696
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:24,980
Really?

697
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,036
Here.

698
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,165
What's this?

699
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,710
Now, what is that called again? NoonGil?

700
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,420
You did a great job.

701
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,839
I heard that it was your idea.

702
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,133
Well, yes.

703
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,511
I tried using the app
and wrote some review.

704
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,473
That's called feedback, right?

705
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,310
I should have told you beforehand.

706
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,438
Thank you.

707
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:08,982
I think it'll be

708
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,277
a great help to me in the future.

709
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,494
Fifteen years ago,

710
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,624
when Ji-pyeong and I first started
writing those letters,

711
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,753
we decided to go by your name
after seeing a picture of you

712
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,296
in the newspaper.

713
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,717
The newspaper? Do you mean the article
about the Mathematical Olympiad?

714
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,055
In the picture,

715
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:43,141
your eyes looked so kind
and you looked so smart.

716
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,727
That's why we chose your name.

717
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,528
I turned out to be disappointing,
didn't I?

718
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,656
No, you turned out to be amazing.
Really amazing.

719
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,074
You turned out great.

720
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,619
Who is it?

721
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:07,207
Who drew on my face again?

722
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,047
Here it comes. You should go.

723
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:18,385
- Should I go check on her?
- It's started. Go home.

724
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,638
- But…
- It's just like I told you.

725
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,519
Do-san!

726
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,067
Do-san, wake up.

727
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,027
- What?
- You're on TV.

728
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,822
I'm on TV?

729
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,448
Come on.

730
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,620
A very long time ago,

731
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,499
- I met a little boy named Nam Do-san.
- Turn on the TV right now.

732
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,376
- What's going on?
- I got a message

733
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,837
- Are you watching it?
- that the boy is now grown up

734
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,422
and launched a start-up.

735
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:59,551
- Chan-ho? Yes, we're very close.
- I wanted to help

736
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,596
- He's talking about it right now.
- the young entrepreneur…

737
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,724
Apparently, my nephew sent a message
to Park Chan-ho.

738
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:10,270
And he was kind enough to do
the interview and everything.

739
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,606
I hope he doesn't think
we were expecting it.

740
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,942
Using image recognition technology,

741
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,904
- I'm getting another call.
- the app tells the user

742
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,947
what it sees.

743
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,616
- Hello, Mr. Cha.
- For example, if I ask,

744
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,869
- "Yeong-sil, what's in front of me?"
- Yes, Samsan Tech is

745
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,830
- Three men are holding cameras.
- Do-san's company.

746
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,458
- Did you see that?
- No, it's not going public yet.

747
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,586
- I tried using the app, too.
- But it might happen soon.

748
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:38,381
What? You don't have to take out loans
to buy their stocks!

749
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,801
I hope the young man never gives up hope

750
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,262
and continues to run his start-up
successfully.

751
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,348
That's why I'm doing this interview.

752
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,391
- What?
- I tried using the app, too.

753
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,518
I'm sure this app can give new hope

754
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,979
- to the visually impaired.
- Park Chan-ho? How come?

755
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,316
He's talking about NoonGil? How?

756
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:00,695
Go, Samsan Tech! Go, Nam Do-san!

757
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,281
How come Park Chan-ho…

758
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,325
- Yes!
- Yes!

759
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,452
We're Samsan Tech! We made NoonGil!

760
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,663
Thank you!

761
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,002
Our DAU reached 10,000!

762
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:17,921
Great work, Ms. Seo.

763
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,009
Yes!

764
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,849
The global market was a great call.
5,000 downloads came from India.

765
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,143
Our DAU might reach 30,000 soon
at this rate.

766
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,438
If our DAU reaches 30,000,

767
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,650
it costs one billion won a year.

768
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,361
Come! I'll treat you
to ten hours of karaoke.

769
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,279
- Okay.
- Let's go.

770
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:45,657
Let's go, guys!

771
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,451
Thank you!

772
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:50,912
Thank you!

773
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,475
- Hello?
- Is this Mr. Nam Do-san?

774
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,438
- Yes, speaking.
- I'm calling from Yangjin Police Station.

775
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:17,856
What?

776
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,150
Police station?

777
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,903
I'm not really laughing

778
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,740
I'm not really walking

779
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,743
In memories of you

780
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,870
I shed tears and wait for you…

781
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:34,164
Why that song on a happy day like this?

782
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,166
Is she being ironic?

783
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,379
We were so happy

784
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,966
Since you left, my heart…

785
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,384
Well…

786
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,221
Should we sing a duet?

787
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:54,225
How about "Nagging"?
"Don't stay out late…"

788
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,146
Let's sing a duet.

789
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:02,609
Darkness finds me again

790
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:06,321
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

791
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,240
Why isn't Do-san picking up?

792
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,329
You're being accused of property damage
and threatening

793
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,456
by Won Du-jeong,
chairman of Morning Group.

794
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,085
- Okay.
- The damage is small.

795
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,545
Settle with the plaintiff,
and you'll be excused.

796
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:23,880
Can you do that?

797
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,429
What if we can't reach an agreement?

798
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,932
The case will be sent to the prosecution.

799
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,809
Worst case scenario is you go on trial.

800
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:37,811
That'll be a headache.

801
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,451
Going down. First floor.

802
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,331
Doors closing.

803
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,336
LIST OF DOMESTIC CSR TEAMS

804
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,880
What do I do?

805
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,842
I really don't want to ask
Morning Group for help.

806
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,140
Should we just give up on NoonGil?

807
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:41,332
What happened?
We've been trying to reach you all day.

808
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,333
Where were you?

809
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,295
I had to go somewhere.

810
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,756
What's that?

811
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,510
It's a notebook of feedback on NoonGil.

812
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:54,971
She wants you to have it.

813
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,640
Really? Me?

814
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,690
This is so detailed.

815
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,819
Her handwriting reminds me of my grandma.

816
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,783
So she hasn't lost her vision completely
but has low vision?

817
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,913
Oh, she's losing her vision
little by little.

818
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,167
This makes me feel so proud.

819
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,046
Who is this lady? I'd love to meet her.

820
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:34,802
Dal-mi.

821
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,643
This may shock you.

822
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,716
I feel so bad for Grandma…

823
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,890
Grandma…

824
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,251
Thanks, Do-san.

825
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,378
For what?

826
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,172
For everything.

827
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,634
For developing NoonGil

828
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:58,886
and

829
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,681
telling me the truth

830
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,184
before it's too late.

831
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,275
Why can't I stop crying?

832
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:18,781
Dal-mi.

833
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:22,619
Your grandma said

834
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:28,207
she wanted to see your pretty smile

835
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,252
for a long time.

836
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:39,093
So put on a smile.

837
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:47,852
Does it show that I cried?

838
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:50,229
Yes, a little.

839
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,732
Actually, a lot.

840
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:54,484
- Really?
- Yes.

841
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:56,694
That's not good.

842
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,405
I don't want it to show.

843
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:03,201
What should I do? I'm a mess.

844
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,953
- Do I look okay now?
- Yes.

845
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,205
Here, too.

846
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,123
- Here?
- Yes.

847
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:33,356
Hey, you're home. Did you have dinner?

848
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,318
I did.
Give that to me. I'll clip your nails.

849
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,028
Forget it. I can do it.

850
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,698
Give it here. I'll do it.

851
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,540
What is this? You're a mess.

852
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:57,797
Grandma.

853
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,926
I'll work hard on NoonGil.

854
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,637
What?

855
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,599
I'll work hard

856
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,893
so that…

857
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,066
things aren't too uncomfortable for you.

858
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,695
I promise.

859
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,415
Dal-mi.

860
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,127
Just for today…

861
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:41,215
Just for today, let me cry.

862
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,969
Starting tomorrow, I'll always smile.

863
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:48,931
So…

864
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,108
Your nose is running.

865
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,363
Oh, my. My sweetie.

866
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:38,940
WE SUPPORT THE DREAMS OF OUR YOUTH

867
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,288
I wonder

868
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:57,500
if Chairman Won has arrived.

869
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,795
He's probably in the waiting room.

870
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:04,632
"Chairman Won"? Why are you
referring to him so politely today?

871
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,261
I need to scrape up

872
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,764
what little respect I have for him.

873
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,269
- Do you think I can meet him?
- I doubt it.

874
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:20,481
After making such a scene…
He probably filed a restraining order.

875
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:22,984
Can you come with me, then?

876
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,737
I'm sure he'd let you in.

877
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,739
Me? Why should I?

878
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:31,742
Because…

879
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:35,913
I'm going to your father

880
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,584
to beg for his forgiveness.

881
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:42,545
"Beg"?

882
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,755
What is this all about?

883
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:46,757
Don't you have any pride?

884
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,302
I'm on the edge of a precipice now.

885
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,597
I couldn't care less about my pride.

886
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:58,019
Take me to him.

887
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,273
Watch me make a complete fool of myself.

888
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:11,574
Follow me.

889
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:24,795
It's been a while.
I'd like to see my father.

890
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:26,839
Please go in.

891
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,468
I can do this.

892
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,657
Do-san.

893
01:05:58,996 --> 01:05:59,956
Dal-mi.

894
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:03,292
This is great.
Do you want to beg next to him?

895
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:10,091
What are you doing?

896
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,095
It seems like she doesn't know.

897
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,890
I filed charges against him
for property damage and threats.

898
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:21,519
If he fails to settle with me,
he'll be convicted. What can he do?

899
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:22,561
He has to beg.

900
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,192
Ms. Seo, what brings you here?

901
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:36,784
I'd like to ask Morning Group

902
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,955
to provide CSR funding
for our service, NoonGil.

903
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:42,373
My gosh.

904
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:47,128
You're more shameless than I thought.

905
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:48,462
Hold on.

906
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,716
All right. CSR funding?

907
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:53,884
I'll think about it.

908
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:58,139
Father.

909
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,517
If the both of you get down on your knees.

910
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,937
Father.

911
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:09,859
I'd like to teach
these young entrepreneurs

912
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:15,448
that bravado doesn't work in this world,
which you already know.

913
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:18,451
This will teach them the price

914
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,871
of not watching your mouth
when your pockets are empty, right?

915
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,624
You never know what might happen.

916
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:32,506
Exactly. There's no telling
what might happen.

917
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:37,678
That's why preparation matters.

918
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,435
Well, I don't know much about technology.

919
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:46,437
- If you'll excuse me…
- Are you leaving, sir?

920
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:51,192
Be good to them.
I've been eyeing them since the hackathon.

921
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:53,819
The proposal shows you
how talented they are.

922
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,404
Are you meeting with Mr. Won?

923
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:57,823
Record the meeting, just in case.

924
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,116
Come by my office later.

925
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,118
See you.

926
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,539
VOICE RECORDING

927
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:08,751
Let's all sit down.

928
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,925
So you're In-jae's little sister, right?

929
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:20,137
- Yes.
- Since I'm older than In-jae,

930
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:22,765
I'll consider you my little sister
and talk comfortably.

931
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:26,644
I know you guys came here
with great ambitions.

932
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:28,104
But throw them away.

933
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,564
We already hired engineers.

934
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,609
What we need are part-timers
to do simple labor.

935
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:35,986
That's why you're here.

936
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:38,322
You recorded that?

937
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:39,990
There's more. Keep listening.

938
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:45,204
It may look like manual labor,
but it'll be a good experience.

939
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,706
What makes youth so special? Your passion!

940
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,917
We want to buy your passion.

941
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:53,337
You promised to pay 50 million won
for the solution alone.

942
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:56,090
I checked your website,
and it looks pretty bare.

943
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:59,677
You can put our logo on your main page.
"Morning Group's strategic partner."

944
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,887
That's worth a lot more
than 50 million won.

945
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,809
I see many young people outside.

946
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,728
There are even reporters,
thanks to the fascinating topic.

947
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,649
Once they hear this, they'll churn out
many interesting articles.

948
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:19,905
"Chairman Won Du-jeong,
the Supporter of Youths' Dreams,

949
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,825
Turns Out to Be the Exploiter of Youths."

950
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:24,243
Isn't that a killer headline?

951
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:27,913
So? Are you going to hand that over
to the reporters?

952
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:31,917
Reporters have the power
to ruin a company's image.

953
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,754
And once your image is ruined,
it takes time and money to restore it.

954
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,553
Wouldn't this be the perfect use

955
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,930
of Morning Group's CSR budget?

956
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,350
Are you blackmailing me now?

957
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,812
Let's say I'm negotiating with you.
That sounds better.

958
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:54,481
Have you lost your mind?

959
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:00,779
To prevent your company from falling,

960
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:04,909
fund NoonGil with
Morning Group's CSR budget.

961
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,704
That sly bitch…

962
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:10,080
Don't do anything.

963
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:13,417
Also,

964
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,086
settle with Do-san.

965
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,855
Silicon Valley is known
for its "Pay-It-Forward" culture.

966
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:38,359
It means that successful entrepreneurs

967
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,611
help young entrepreneurs unconditionally.

968
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:43,405
As a successful entrepreneur,

969
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:46,784
I'd like to put the "Pay-It-Forward"
spirit into action today.

970
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:50,537
This year's Morning Group
CSR funding goes to

971
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:55,042
NoonGil by Samsan Tech
of the 12th Sand Box residency program.

972
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,431
We plan to support NoonGil,

973
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,725
a companion to the visually impaired,

974
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,144
as much as we can.

975
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,189
That's great!

976
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,277
Nice!

977
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:26,240
Well…

978
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,579
- What's this?
- Takeout pine nut kalguksu from Gapyeong.

979
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:35,749
They said they don't do takeout,
but I insisted.

980
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,294
- I hope it tastes good.
- Why…

981
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:40,921
You travel all the way to Gapyeong
to eat this.

982
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:43,549
It's a token of gratitude
for helping us fund NoonGil

983
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,510
and also a belated birthday present.

984
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:53,726
Here. I wrote down the instructions.

985
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:56,895
Okay.

986
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:00,107
- See you.
- Wait, Ms. Seo.

987
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:02,026
Well… Here.

988
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:04,945
I touched up your business plan.

989
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,989
You should start preparing for Demo Day.

990
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,533
Thank you.

991
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:12,369
I'll get going. Enjoy.

992
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:15,998
Okay, thank you.
I'm sure it'll taste good.

993
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,293
Thanks.

994
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:24,340
So I have to cook it myself?

995
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:38,979
Gosh, the comments are so detailed.

996
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,899
His handwriting is really neat.

997
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:53,702
This handwriting…
It looks really familiar.

998
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,711
His handwriting looks
exactly like Do-san's.

999
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:49,216
Yes, it's the same as Do-san's.

1000
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,385
My birthday.

1001
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:55,597
The same handwriting

1002
01:13:57,182 --> 01:13:58,725
and the same birthday?

1003
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:02,938
How?

1004
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,150
COOK NOODLES IN BOILING WATER
FOR 2 MINUTES

1005
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:43,645
I don't see any pine nuts,

1006
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:46,565
but it tastes like pine nuts.

1007
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,026
This is…

1008
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,737
My gosh.

1009
01:15:41,995 --> 01:15:44,122
SPECIAL THANKS TO BAE HAE-SUN

1010
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:49,438
I'm glad I ran into you.

1011
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:51,064
Give this to Ms. Seo.

1012
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:55,569
- Why do you have this?
- I found it while cleaning the car.

1013
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,655
Did Dal-mi get in your car?

1014
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,033
Yes.

1015
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,994
- Why?
- Well…

1016
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,580
She said I shouldn't tell you.

1017
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:13,670
See you.

1018
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:16,465
Oh, your arms. Be careful. Bye.

1019
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,005
I'm glad I ran into you.
Give this to Ms. Seo.

1020
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:01,551
- Why do you have this?
- I found it while cleaning the car.

1021
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,098
Are you sure it's Dal-mi's,
not another girl's?

1022
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:08,350
What?

1023
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:11,144
It can't be another girl's.

1024
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,440
- You've never had a girlfriend?
- Why are you asking such a thing?

1025
01:18:16,149 --> 01:18:19,736
You live close by.
Consider riding a bike instead.

1026
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,863
For the environment and your health, okay?

1027
01:18:25,325 --> 01:18:26,743
Bye.

1028
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,000
What?

1029
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:35,669
Hey…

1030
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,382
Darn it.

1031
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,719
He's so annoying.

1032
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,408
I'm so happy

1033
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:49,785
it scares me a little.

1034
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:53,038
I have only one thing
and that's everything to me.

1035
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,540
- You're taking it away from me?
- Then let's change.

1036
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:59,211
- You little punk.
- I keep disappointing you

1037
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:00,921
and it has been hard for me too.

1038
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:02,172
Don't run.

1039
01:20:02,255 --> 01:20:05,217
You are bigger than the moon.

1040
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,136
I keep thinking about her,
I want her and it feels so unfair.

1041
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,514
Why did you lie?

1042
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:11,807
I didn't want you to cry.

1043
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,185
I didn't want you to cry like you are now.

1044
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:20,273
