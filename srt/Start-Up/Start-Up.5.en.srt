EPISODE 5

2
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,047
Chul-san, what's with him?

3
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,054
Hey, what's going on?

4
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,430
The date went well. Why the knitting?

5
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,015
Is something bothering you?

6
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,772
Hey!

7
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,607
- Chul-san.
- Yes.

8
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,196
- Nothing.
- Gosh.

9
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,782
What is it? Tell us.

10
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:04,999
Nevermind.

11
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,585
Jeez, you're doing it again.

12
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,003
Just tell us.

13
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,257
I asked Dal-mi

14
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,009
- why she likes me.
- What did she say?

15
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,345
I bet she has low standards.

16
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,099
Sorry.

17
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,185
First of all, you're…

18
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,104
my first love.

19
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,105
"First love"?

20
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,233
Technically, that would be Han Ji-pyeong.

21
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,654
So I asked her again why she likes me.

22
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,947
Your letters

23
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,825
comforted me for a long time.

24
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,827
That was also Han Ji-pyeong, not you.

25
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,580
Did she say anything about you?

26
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,668
My hands.

27
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,378
You have nice, big hands.

28
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,465
Just my hands, nothing else.

29
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,221
- Do-san.
- Yes?

30
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,557
When humans switched from all fours

31
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,559
to two limbs,
their brains started to grow.

32
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,979
Why? The other two limbs had
nothing to do, so they became hands.

33
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,070
The use of hands
led to the development of the human brain

34
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,032
and toolmaking,
thus establishing cultures and histories.

35
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,035
What's your point?

36
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,705
Jeez, a fellow engineering major
should understand him.

37
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,333
He's trying to say
that it's not "just" your hands.

38
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,710
The hands are everything.
Isn't that what you mean?

39
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,794
That's right.

40
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,671
MAN IS MOST INTELLIGENT
BECAUSE HE HAS HANDS

41
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,470
Yes! He held my hand.

42
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,931
What are you talking about? What about it?

43
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,476
When In-jae said to Do-san…

44
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,896
Who do you choose, me or Seo Dal-mi?

45
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,398
Do you know what he said?

46
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,526
Will you be the CEO of Samsan Tech?

47
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,615
Then he reached out his hand to me,
not In-jae.

48
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,951
Grandma.

49
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,412
That hand…

50
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,539
His hand

51
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,835
was the coolest thing ever.

52
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,553
You're weird. How cool could a hand look?

53
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,472
It looked very cool.

54
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,267
I'm a nobody.

55
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,813
Why hold my hand instead of In-jae's?

56
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,608
At least she likes my hands.

57
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,736
I'm a nobody.

58
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,281
Right?

59
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,204
Grandma.

60
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,707
I keep getting more ambitious.

61
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,712
I started this because I wanted to
win against In-jae because of dad.

62
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,220
Now, I'm getting really ambitious.

63
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,477
I know that she's too good for me,

64
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,941
but I keep wanting more.

65
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,032
I keep getting more desperate.

66
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,346
A SPRINT-LIKE EVENT
WHERE PARTICIPANTS TEAM UP

67
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,058
TO CREATE A SOFTWARE BUSINESS MODELS

68
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,893
SAND BOX 12TH HACKATHON

69
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,854
The next two days will be hell.

70
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,358
But not for me. It's none of my business.

71
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,694
Gosh.

72
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,073
After participating as a mentor
for three days last year,

73
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,783
I was bedridden for four days.

74
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,827
It was exhausting, stressful,
and not at all rewarding.

75
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,330
It's awful, isn't it?

76
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,832
Mr. Han?

77
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,501
Mr. Han?

78
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,087
Oh, where did he go?

79
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,588
ROOM 801

80
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,140
Here you go.

81
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,976
Find table 36.

82
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,020
Whenever you get a new team member,

83
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,522
send me their QR code.

84
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,023
Sure, got it.

85
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,691
Help yourself to the snacks.

86
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,653
You may eat as much as you like…

87
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,865
Hey, here.

88
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,409
Put some in your pocket, too.

89
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,161
They have awesome snacks here.

90
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,290
Hey, talk about motivation.
It'd be amazing to eat this every day.

91
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,209
Now, I'm dead serious about Sand Box.

92
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,002
I want to live here forever!

93
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,088
Hey, put them in here.

94
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,340
Do-san.

95
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:05,925
Hey.

96
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,219
Bend down.

97
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,518
Don't share these gummy snacks, okay?

98
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,645
They'll be gone in no time.

99
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,356
Okay.

100
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,193
Ms. Seo, we need another team member.

101
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,779
- Yes, we do.
- What are we looking for?

102
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,366
For our founding members,
I believe a good personality

103
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,869
is more important than fancy credentials.

104
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,663
I want someone who is motivated.

105
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:39,000
A natural-born problem solver
who is focused and persistent.

106
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:43,254
Someone who is resilient and
springs back easily. You get the idea.

107
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,843
Do-san. Where did Do-san go?

108
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,980
- How much did you tell her?
- Sorry?

109
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,149
Tell me. How much did Dal-mi find out?

110
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,360
Which part are you worried about?

111
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,446
The fact that I'm not a hotshot?

112
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,157
Or that the letters
from her first love were fake?

113
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,160
She knows about the letters?

114
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,706
No, not yet.

115
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,753
Was she very disappointed
that you're not a hotshot?

116
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,505
No, it actually made her happy.

117
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,757
It made her happy? She wasn't angry?

118
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,841
No.

119
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,178
What about me?
She doesn't think I'm weird?

120
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,430
I participated in tricking her
and even led it.

121
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,475
- She must be dying to know why I did it.
- Mr. Han.

122
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:42,522
She hasn't said a word about you.

123
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,233
- Really?
- Yes.

124
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,736
You don't have to lend me
your car or watch.

125
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,821
- You don't need to worry--
- How can I not?

126
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,617
You and Dal-mi are on the same team now.
Hold this for a second.

127
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,203
On top of that,
even her sister is at Sand Box now.

128
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,248
She'll be devastated if her sister gets in
and she doesn't.

129
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,502
- What are you doing?
- My question exactly.

130
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,462
What am I doing right now?

131
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,549
I can't believe I have to wear this
when I should be raising funds.

132
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,968
And a hackathon mentor?

133
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,220
Will there be many reporters?

134
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,514
I don't want them to take pictures of me.

135
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,184
You've done enough. I'll take care of it.

136
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,187
You're scaring me.
That's the scariest thing I've heard.

137
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,565
What have you been doing all this time?

138
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,568
If I were Yong-san or Chul-san,

139
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,363
I'd ask you to compensate me
for the past two years of my life.

140
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,577
What? Are you offended?
Does that piss you off?

141
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,955
Yes, a little.

142
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,583
What's that?

143
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,459
No, that's…

144
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,670
You don't get to be angry
because it's a fact.

145
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,548
I'll give you a chance to get angry
if you get into Sand Box.

146
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,841
My blood sugar's dropping.

147
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,932
This is mine.

148
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,521
Wait, let me see.

149
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,367
What's with him?

150
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,924
Hey, Do-san!

151
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,345
I looked everywhere for you.

152
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,685
Hello, Mr. Han.

153
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,612
I actually wanted to ask you something.

154
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,993
Well, I'm…

155
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,372
Right now…

156
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,832
What's up, Dong-cheon?

157
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,501
- What's going on?
- Pardon?

158
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,252
You need me? Excuse me for a second.

159
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,338
- Hey.
- Something's going on?

160
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,757
What is it? What's the matter?

161
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,218
- What? You're a mentor?
- Gosh, hey.

162
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,761
I see. We should hurry.

163
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,472
Come on. Let's go. Tell me what happened.

164
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,016
I see. You should've told me earlier.

165
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,146
What were you going to ask him?

166
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,067
Just some stuff.

167
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,071
Let's go.

168
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,747
I see.

169
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,333
I'm sorry. You should've called.

170
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,876
Why tell me now…

171
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,882
Gosh, this is nuts.

172
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,467
What is going on?

173
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,262
Is it something serious?
Did I make another mistake?

174
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,430
This won't do.

175
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,599
Hold this for a second.

176
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,519
Hey, take off your jacket.

177
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,398
- Dong-cheon.
- Yes?

178
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,566
You should be a mentor.

179
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,569
What? Why should I… No, hold on!

180
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,948
- Why should I be a mentor?
- I'm counting on you.

181
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:25,369
What? What do you mean? Sir.

182
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,764
Hey.

183
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,600
Look who it is.

184
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,976
Kim Yong-san, Lee Chul-san.

185
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,937
- Hyeon, Jeong!
- Hyeon, Jeong!

186
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,231
Wow, how long has it been?

187
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,902
I didn't expect to run into you here.

188
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,570
Same here. Good to see you guys.

189
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,741
My gosh, Hyeon.
You look even more stylish now.

190
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,284
Come here, buddy.

191
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,956
Jeong, you're here, too.

192
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,463
Do you guys have a team now?

193
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,092
Yes. Luckily, we were able to team up
with the best team.

194
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,263
- The best team?
- The best team?

195
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,017
INJAE COMPANY

196
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,077
Are those two in colorful clothes
also developers?

197
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,333
Oh, them. Yes, they're twins.

198
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,585
They're top-notch AI developers.

199
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,170
- Top-notch?
- Yes.

200
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,258
Why are they here? They're not interested
in starting a business.

201
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,842
People call them hunters.

202
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,469
Hunters? As in "hunter-gatherer"?

203
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,430
Yes. They've been participating
in all sorts of contests

204
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,307
and hackathons for about two years now.

205
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,435
They're only after the cash prize.
They're not launching a start-up.

206
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,728
It's like a dine and dash.

207
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,313
Those jerks demotivate people

208
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,233
who desperately need money
to launch their start-up.

209
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,235
They've probably won
hundreds of millions of won.

210
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,240
Sounds like they're quite skilled.
And they're pretty stylish for developers.

211
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,411
Hold on a second.
"Pretty stylish for developers"?

212
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:34,707
Ms. Seo, I don't like the sound of that.
Ms. Seo?

213
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,918
Then what about us? What are you implying?

214
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,003
Jeez.

215
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,386
Fine, I admit
that they beat us on that front.

216
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,680
But they don't care about
launching a start-up.

217
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,473
And we're the only CODA winners here.

218
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,976
Yes! They're only locally famous,
but we're global.

219
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,104
They've been global since college.
They went to MIT.

220
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,315
Whose side are you on?
Stop stirring things up.

221
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,860
That's impressive.

222
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,572
Don't be intimidated.
Their concept is totally different.

223
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,242
Yes. Academic credentials come second.
We'll showcase our high integrity.

224
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,328
Right, Ms. Seo? What?

225
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,292
- We need one more person.
- Anyone else?

226
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,002
- Let's talk outside.
- Sure.

227
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,837
Excuse me, coming through.

228
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,134
We need someone with such credentials.

229
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,389
Someone with impressive credentials.

230
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,689
SAMSAN TECH

231
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,234
Oh, my.

232
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,070
This is so cool.

233
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:49,323
All our past experiences show up
as soon as you scan the QR code.

234
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,284
I see.

235
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,412
SEO DAL-MI
HIGHEST EDUCATION LEVEL: HIGH SCHOOL

236
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,957
- Do-san, Yong-san.
- What?

237
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,211
Did you know
Seo Dal-mi didn't go to college?

238
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,546
She didn't?

239
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,800
Let's go ask Won In-jae to take us back.

240
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,677
The teams aren't finalized yet.

241
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,096
No. Seo Dal-mi is our CEO.

242
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,477
Do you really think we should let
a high school graduate be our CEO?

243
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,604
People will think
we're a joke because of her.

244
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,815
You sure you don't think that?

245
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,695
Me?

246
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:34,076
I don't waste my time with people
who think they can look down on others.

247
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,954
But other people do.

248
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,168
I don't look down on her.
Come on. You know how I am.

249
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,547
All right, then.

250
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,175
Don't worry about what people say.
We just need to be confident.

251
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,804
I was scared for a second.

252
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,514
He's become charismatic.

253
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,654
You're gorgeous.

254
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:14,658
I hope you join our team.
You'll brighten up the entire office.

255
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,619
I guess you prioritize looks
over experience.

256
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,746
But you know what?

257
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,080
I also prioritize looks.

258
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,294
Sa-ha, you're exactly the kind of person
we're looking for.

259
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,921
We want someone
who's multifaceted enough to tackle

260
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,757
accounting, legal matters, and design.

261
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,801
So you want me to do the work
of three people?

262
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,054
No, not even if you beg me.

263
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,391
Who are you?

264
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,310
I'm Seo Dal-mi, the CEO of Samsan Tech.

265
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,104
I'm here because of your experience,
not your looks.

266
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,940
I won't be one of those CEOs
who never work.

267
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,318
And I won't expect you to wear many hats.

268
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,570
Just take care of the design for us.

269
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,239
- Have you been following me?
- Yes.

270
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,076
Don't be such a loser.

271
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:01,080
People will look down on you.
A CEO must not kneel down so easily.

272
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,796
No, people don't care about the fact
that I'm on my knees.

273
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,881
Rather,
this will make them look up to you.

274
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,759
Isn't that better for you anyway?

275
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,554
Decide while there's still some time left.

276
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,516
If you do it at the last minute,
you'll look desperate.

277
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,190
Why me?

278
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,318
Tell me your reason.
I'll make my decision after I hear it.

279
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,506
It's…

280
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,259
…a green light.

281
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,413
Hello.

282
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,961
Yes, have a seat over here.

283
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,173
I'll take that…

284
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,724
All right. Meet the developers
of Samsan Tech. Nam Do-san,

285
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,310
Lee Chul-san, and Kim Yong-san.

286
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,520
This is designer Jung Sa-ha.

287
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,940
I see, you're a designer.
We've met before, haven't we?

288
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,943
Right, we have.

289
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,615
- Really? Where did you guys meet?
- Oh, we were buying a book.

290
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,158
That book… What was it called?

291
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,035
Joining Sand Box Q and A.

292
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,453
Yes, there was only one left…

293
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,539
She kindly yielded it for 10,000 won and
we bought the last copy.

294
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,874
What? 10,000 won?

295
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,877
It was a sensible transaction
that satisfied both of our needs.

296
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,087
They say

297
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,008
even brushing shoulders means
you were meant to cross paths.

298
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,054
What a coincidence!
Who knew we'd all be founding members?

299
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,349
Let's set some boundaries first.

300
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:29,519
Lame expressions such as "meant to be"
and "coincidence" are banned as of now.

301
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,564
It's not like I wanted to join this team.

302
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,942
I chose you guys
because I was pressed for time.

303
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,109
Samsan Tech…

304
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,028
What a horrible name.

305
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,697
This isn't my final destination.

306
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,909
I'm just making a quick stop, that's all.

307
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,245
Don't forget that.

308
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:47,996
I won't.

309
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,416
All right. Shall we get started, then?

310
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,686
Okay, everyone.

311
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,897
Now that you've finalized your teams,

312
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:18,902
we'll begin the hackathon.
You will be given 48 hours.

313
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,863
Work with your teammates

314
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,574
to come up with a new business model.

315
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,411
Feel free to use

316
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:31,081
Sand Box's data set, GPU, and API.

317
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,710
You are free to use as much
of our resources as you need.

318
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,462
GPU: GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT
API: APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE

319
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,548
That's amazing. We can use everything?

320
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,175
"We'll open up our oil field.
Take all you need."

321
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,679
"Take it and make asphalt, nylon,
or whatever you want with it."

322
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:49,141
My gosh, how generous.
It sure is nice to play in a big pond.

323
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,353
Tell us the winner selection criteria.

324
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,732
We'll be looking at two things.

325
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:02,154
First, the ability to come up
with a feasible, practical business plan

326
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,198
within the limited amount of time
using the given resources.

327
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:10,037
Second,
the ability to pitch the idea to us

328
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,747
in just three minutes.

329
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,042
- Three minutes?
- Three minutes…

330
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,376
All right.

331
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,714
You may use all of Sand Box's data
however you need.

332
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:24,134
I hope you can all come up
with revolutionary ideas.

333
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,013
Good luck to all of you.

334
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,905
So what are you guys thinking?

335
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,656
Probably something service-related.

336
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,868
No, we're thinking of launching a service
based on machine learning.

337
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,829
Are you guys a tech-based team?

338
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:57,375
Yes, obviously.
Can't you tell from our name? Samsan Tech.

339
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,504
This is like playing the lottery.

340
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,800
Right? Aren't you happy that you chose us?

341
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:09,471
No. What I'm saying is, this isn't for me
because I never win the lottery.

342
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,306
Oh, I see.

343
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,226
Ms. Seo, I'm not trying
to belittle you or anything,

344
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,354
- but do you know what machine learning is?
- Hey.

345
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,693
Yes, I do.
Do-san explained it to me the other day.

346
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,948
It's a very romantic technology.

347
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,075
"Romantic"?

348
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,037
How did you explain it to her

349
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,082
to give her an impression
that machine learning is romantic?

350
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,919
- I'm curious.
- About what?

351
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,257
You. I want to know everything about you.

352
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,260
Your family, friends,

353
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,138
and the things you like.

354
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,516
I like…

355
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,812
designing artificial neural networks.

356
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,564
ANN: ALGORITHMS THAT MIMIC
HOW THE BRAIN PROCESSES DATA

357
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,608
- Have you heard of it?
- Yes, I have.

358
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,944
But I don't really know what it is.

359
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,821
Then…

360
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,198
What about machine learning?

361
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,077
Well, that too. I've heard of the term

362
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,454
but don't know what it is.

363
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,126
If that's the case… Here.

364
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,007
This is a computer.
Let's say his name is Tarzan.

365
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,427
He grew up on a deserted island,
so he's never seen a woman in his life.

366
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,679
But one day,

367
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,808
Jane arrives on the island.

368
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,813
He gives her a rock,
and she doesn't like that.

369
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,025
But when he gives her a flower,
it makes her happy.

370
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:45,984
I see.

371
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,945
He's never dated,
so he doesn't know what women like.

372
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,866
That's right. So Tarzan keeps on trying.

373
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,660
He catches a snake for her,
but she doesn't like it.

374
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,622
One day, he gives her a cute rabbit,
and that makes her happy.

375
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:03,877
She seems displeased when he yells,
but she likes it when he smiles.

376
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,923
While building such experiences,

377
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,300
he learns how to win Jane's heart.

378
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,680
I see. Hence the term, machine learning.

379
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,642
- You teach the machine to learn.
- Exactly.

380
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,229
You give the computer data
on various experiences.

381
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,190
It'll learn the data
through ANNs and predict results.

382
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,650
That's what I do.

383
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:32,948
Boring, right?

384
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,659
No, it was very interesting.

385
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,496
And cool.

386
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,794
- Tarzan?
- Jane?

387
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,297
Meta… Don't you know what a metaphor is?
A figure of speech.

388
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,591
No, I don't.
I always bombed my Korean exams.

389
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,760
I'm cringing so hard right now. Jeez!

390
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,929
How long will this chitchat last?

391
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,847
We've wasted 20 minutes already.

392
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,433
All right.

393
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:04,020
What kind of data set
can our Tarzan learn?

394
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,897
There's all kinds of data here.

395
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,527
Traffic accidents, fine dust levels…

396
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,822
- Even penmanship.
- Penmanship?

397
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,617
- It's a data set on handwriting.
- Jeonghan Bank?

398
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,744
Why would a bank have data on handwriting?

399
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,456
Of course, they would.
All the deposit, withdrawal, loan,

400
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,834
and power of attorney forms
are filled out by hand.

401
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,544
Same goes for handwriting forgery.

402
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:32,048
Sa-ha, you suddenly seem
totally unapproachable.

403
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:33,883
What?

404
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,802
You're too perfect.

405
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,232
SAMSAN TECH

406
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,695
Oh, hold on. I've got an idea.

407
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,407
- What's your idea?
- If we teach Tarzan

408
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,911
to distinguish forged handwriting
from authentic ones,

409
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,080
maybe he'll be able to detect forgery.

410
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,422
I can't guarantee it,
but I think it's doable.

411
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,799
But can that be a viable business model?

412
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,844
Of course, it can.

413
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,729
Hey, Dong-cheon.

414
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,397
Park Dong-cheon.

415
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,900
Jeez, who's calling my name
so desperately?

416
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,860
Park Dong-cheon! Hey!

417
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,696
Yes, Mr. Han. There you are.

418
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,283
- You pretended you didn't hear me.
- No, not at all.

419
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,871
About Samsan Tech…
Have they decided what to do?

420
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,039
Yes, I think so.

421
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,957
- Already?
- Yes.

422
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,834
You should've helped them out.

423
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,920
There was no need.
Their idea is pretty good.

424
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,963
Yeah, right. What's their idea?

425
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,008
Detecting handwriting forgery
using machine learning.

426
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,511
Hey, that's not a viable…

427
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,554
- Actually, that's not a bad idea.
- Right?

428
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,181
Who came up with the idea?

429
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,808
Seo Dal-mi, the CEO.

430
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,478
Seo Dal-mi?

431
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,652
- Handwriting…
- Yes, the data on handwriting

432
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,445
- can definitely be turned into…
- But…

433
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,623
There's a lot of interesting data sets.

434
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,167
What about distribution?
That's our specialty.

435
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,461
What about
Jeonghan Bank's handwriting data set?

436
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,130
Handwriting?

437
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,841
But what kind of business model?

438
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,926
That is up to the CEO to decide.

439
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,804
Handwriting data set? That's random.

440
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,434
Samsan Tech is planning to create
a service using that data set.

441
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,272
- What about it?
- I saw

442
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:56,109
Nam Do-san at Samsan Tech
flat out rejected you earlier.

443
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,237
- Hey, watch your mouth.
- We'll help you.

444
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,782
Let's go up against them.

445
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,951
Why should we?

446
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,414
Because it's fun.
Taking down the jerk who rejected you.

447
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,435
SAMSAN TECH

448
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,773
Shall we get started?

449
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:58,671
SAMSAN TECH

450
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,239
Let's be creative.

451
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,408
Why don't we design a new font?
The things that cost money…

452
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,701
Eight percent, right?

453
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,829
Right, the court.

454
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,915
- We did it.
- My gosh.

455
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,939
It's not collecting the data at all.

456
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,068
Shall we tweak the hyperparameter?

457
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,738
Okay, let's start over.

458
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,654
Why is the test set accuracy so low?

459
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,698
What is the problem?

460
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,034
Shall we change the activation function?

461
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,333
- Guys, I think--
- We're all busy now,

462
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,542
so save it for later.

463
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,921
Dal-mi, what is it?

464
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,132
Jane may prefer flowers,

465
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,468
but I prefer rocks.

466
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,846
What's she saying?

467
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,057
Flowers are useless on a deserted island.

468
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,227
With rocks, you can knock
fruits off trees and scare off wolves.

469
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,436
Right.

470
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,106
That's why I'd prefer rocks to flowers.

471
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,485
Hey, Do-san. Make sure you get her
a big rock, not flowers.

472
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,286
Everyone's taste is different.

473
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,551
Let's change the network structure.

474
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,972
- Now?
- Have you lost your mind?

475
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:39,142
We used this structure
when we were working with video data.

476
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,477
Handwriting data
has a totally different pattern,

477
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,146
so the same network won't work.

478
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,190
Let's completely redo it
and come up with a slimmer network.

479
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,443
Yes, that's exactly what I wanted to say.

480
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,487
Hey, that is a lot of work.

481
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,032
And once it's done, we can't undo it.

482
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,994
Still, we should try something new rather
than being stuck with the wrong answer.

483
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,455
If it doesn't work, we have to pack up.

484
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,539
Right.

485
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,543
Let's try it.

486
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,010
The kimchi doesn't taste
as ripe as it did last time.

487
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,012
I told you that you can let it ripen.

488
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,889
You put it in the fridge right away.

489
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,809
- Why are you blaming me?
- I'll take it out.

490
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,861
Goodness, the world is going to the dogs.

491
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,488
What is a full-fledged adult
doing with that toy?

492
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,656
Oh, dear.

493
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,704
What? Why…

494
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,123
What do we do? He must've heard you.

495
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,382
I didn't say anything.

496
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,510
Do you happen to know
where Mr. Nam Do-san lives?

497
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,600
- Who are you?
- I'm Alex.

498
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,395
I came all the way from San Francisco
to meet Mr. Nam.

499
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,568
Awesome pronunciation.

500
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,613
San Francisco?
Isn't that where Silicon Valley is?

501
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,160
I am

502
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:48,039
Do-san's dad… I mean, I'm his father.

503
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,790
- And this is…
- I'm his mother.

504
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,086
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

505
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,590
I had to come to Korea for work,
so I came here to meet Mr. Nam.

506
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,094
I'm really sorry,
but Do-san isn't home at the moment.

507
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,806
Where is he?

508
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,979
Shall I bring you something to eat?

509
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,276
SAND BOX 12TH HACKATHON
SAND BOX AUDITORIUM LIVE BROADCAST

510
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,323
I'm eating now. Don't worry.

511
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,919
Mother.

512
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,690
What are you doing here?
Weren't you transferring to the US?

513
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,441
I quit.

514
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,488
- Why?
- Like someone once told me,

515
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,657
I could only start the company
thanks to Dad.

516
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,160
I won't get any credit
even if I do well, so I quit.

517
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,288
I want to start over.

518
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,249
I see.

519
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,459
So you probably don't need
three years now.

520
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,753
What?

521
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,840
I'll be honest. At the moment,
I'm not as successful as In-jae is.

522
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,843
I admit it.
But In-jae is three years older than me.

523
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,386
So give me three years.

524
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,638
I'll outdo her by then.

525
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,141
Let's bet 10,000 won. What do you think?

526
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,643
So step up your game.

527
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,355
You have to get into Sand Box
for us to compete.

528
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,275
The developers on your team
seem totally lost.

529
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,865
You always make the wrong choices.

530
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:50,036
Choosing Nam Do-san
and also staying with Dad.

531
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,205
I wish you would shut up.

532
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,335
Let's wait and see.
Time will tell who made the bad choice.

533
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,965
You're right. Time will tell.

534
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,808
Right, we're also using
Jeonghan Bank's handwriting data set.

535
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,895
I thought you should know
because that's only fair.

536
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,324
We have the result.

537
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,955
- You have the result?
- I was just about to text you.

538
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,833
What's the result? Tell me.
What's the accuracy like?

539
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,253
It's over 99.8 percent.

540
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,672
Thank goodness.

541
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,848
Dal-mi, are you crying?

542
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,228
Thank you.

543
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,814
Thank you so much.

544
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,967
Looking for something?

545
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,806
I'm trying to find

546
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,184
this little kid among the participants.

547
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,937
This kid is here?

548
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,315
She's participating in this hackathon.

549
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,651
She is?

550
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,111
- Seriously?
- Yes.

551
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:48,654
Did you invite her?

552
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,324
Gosh, no. I found out about it by chance.

553
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,785
She probably has no idea

554
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:59,707
she was the inspiration behind Sand Box.

555
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,251
Who is it?

556
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,885
I'll tell you if she gets into Sand Box.

557
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,348
The hackathon pitching presentations
will begin shortly.

558
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,309
- Already? Let's go.
- All participants

559
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,894
- Yes, let's go.
- and judges,

560
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,937
please come to the main auditorium.

561
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,984
Ms. Yoon, go ahead. I'll meet you there.

562
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,027
Okay.

563
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,044
How long has it been?

564
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,088
Well over ten years, right?

565
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,217
Right.

566
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,595
In-jae is here, too.

567
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,056
Yes.

568
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,142
Dal-mi is also here.

569
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,060
Right.

570
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,855
What a twist of fate.

571
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,068
You must resent me a lot.

572
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,445
Of course.

573
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,240
I don't even want to see you.

574
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,619
What mother
would be fond of a daughter-in-law

575
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,996
who abandoned her son?

576
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,006
I'm sorry.

577
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,470
How was Dal-mi

578
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,348
while growing up?

579
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,976
It must've been hard for her.

580
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,190
Yes, indeed.

581
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,577
Dal-mi got into a good university,
so I sold my corn dog shop

582
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,788
to pay her tuition fees.

583
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,873
As soon as I did that,

584
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,587
she dropped out of school
and picked up all sorts of part-time jobs

585
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,007
to buy me a truck
so I could sell my corn dogs.

586
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:27,896
Once,

587
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,277
she broke her leg

588
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,196
while working at a grocery store.

589
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,992
That really upset me,

590
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,162
so…

591
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,415
I said this to her.

592
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,463
You know,

593
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,091
you should've left with your mom.

594
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,927
Then you wouldn't be
going through this right now.

595
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,972
It would've been
only sunshine and rainbows.

596
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,225
Grandma, Dad told me

597
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,188
that deserts would cover the entire world
if it was sunny every day.

598
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,815
We need rain and snow

599
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:15,527
for plants and delicious fruits
like this tangerine to grow.

600
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,042
She's a wonderful young lady now.

601
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,004
I'm incredibly proud
that she's my grandkid.

602
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,014
Don't worry about her.

603
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,102
I didn't make this for you,

604
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,396
but you can have it.

605
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:51,939
You…

606
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,442
used to like
the spicy bellflower root salad I make.

607
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,916
Thank you, Mother.

608
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,310
Oh, boy.

609
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,278
Good Boy, you're here too?

610
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,365
- Let's sit over there.
- Gosh.

611
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,160
Oh, dear.

612
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:52,416
You should buy new shoes. What is this?

613
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,462
- What? They look as good as new.
- Jeez.

614
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,630
Are you blind? You call this new?

615
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,053
Why didn't you contact me?

616
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,557
I could've helped you
with Dal-mi's tuition fees.

617
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:10,976
No, actually…

618
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:15,230
You shouldn't have given me
that 70 million won.

619
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:19,651
Goodness, you're at it again.

620
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,196
Why would I keep your money?

621
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,573
Stop talking nonsense. I'm leaving.

622
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,706
Do you have regrets?

623
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,587
- "Regrets"?
- I mean…

624
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,715
Dal-mi could've
gone to college instead of me.

625
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,092
You could've kept your shop, too.

626
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,971
"I shouldn't have helped him."

627
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,974
You must've regretted it.

628
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,188
I never regretted it.

629
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,858
But I wish things could've been different.

630
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,616
I always wished I had met you sooner.

631
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,327
Then,

632
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,580
we could've played cards on the holidays,

633
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,876
and I could've made gimbap
for your school trips.

634
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,547
If anyone had bullied you,

635
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,007
I would've met their parents,

636
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,262
yelled at them to teach their kids better,
and fought for you.

637
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,016
I know I can't replace your parents,

638
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:38,981
but I could've at least been
a nosy old lady who lives next door.

639
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:41,984
That makes me a bit sad.

640
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,789
Darn it. Why would that make you sad?

641
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,413
- Try these gummies. They're good.
- Dong-cheon.

642
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,497
Yes?

643
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,792
- Take off that T-shirt.
- I'm not wearing anything inside.

644
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,295
- Just take it off.
- No, this is very inappropriate.

645
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:46,757
No, gosh. My goodness.

646
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,678
Oh my goodness.

647
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,138
- What's he doing?
- Gosh.

648
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,351
And come to the center of the stage.

649
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,812
Then the branches will spread out
with her in the middle…

650
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,690
Nice. That's a great idea.

651
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,739
Then will this image…

652
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,618
be displayed as well?

653
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,536
- That's right. With the labels.
- What?

654
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,915
- They'll be right here.
- Underneath.

655
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,209
- Yes.
- Can we lower them?

656
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,418
- Like this?
- Yes.

657
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,797
Then we'll display this image at the end.

658
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,800
- Yes, that will work.
- I like it. Let's do it.

659
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:35,681
What is it?

660
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,558
We went around and saw that

661
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,394
many CEOs aren't actually presenting.

662
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:42,938
And?

663
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,732
You should pitch our idea
instead of Dal-mi.

664
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,527
Why?

665
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,446
You saw. She doesn't even know
what a parameter means.

666
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,199
Our future depends on this,
so we can't count on her.

667
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:57,494
She didn't even go to college.
How's she going to explain AI?

668
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:01,415
Hey, people used to say
the same thing about us. Did you forget?

669
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,877
Of course not.
I remember like it was yesterday.

670
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,380
And you're saying this?

671
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,550
Looking down on someone
when you know what it feels like?

672
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:15,470
We're saying it because we know! We're
losers! So if our CEO is a loser too,

673
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,973
all these stuck-up pricks
will think we're a big joke.

674
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:18,890
Stop it.

675
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:19,808
Hey,

676
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,270
we're finished if we don't get in.

677
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,106
Will you move back into that moldy room?
I refuse!

678
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,859
Fine, then I'll present.

679
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,403
If you do, you'll really be screwed.

680
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:39,202
- Then what? Is Seo Dal-mi our savior?
- Well, I can't guarantee that either.

681
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,996
- Then why--
- However,

682
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,750
I can guarantee that you guys will fail.

683
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:52,340
Have you, self-proclaimed AI experts,
successfully pitched your idea

684
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,844
and secured funding even once
in the past two years?

685
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:01,141
Are you sure
you'll magically succeed today?

686
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,146
If you're that desperate, you should

687
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,107
at least try a different answer.
I mean, that's common sense.

688
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,944
But what if she's also the wrong answer?
Then we're screwed.

689
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,740
Then I'll invest personally.

690
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,077
What?

691
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,288
That gives you a plan B
even if you fail this.

692
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,415
Happy now?

693
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,128
That's better, I guess.

694
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,507
But why would you do that?

695
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,093
It's time. Let's go back inside.

696
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:44,976
Come on, guys.

697
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,080
Hello, I'm Yoon Seon-hak.

698
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:09,251
Finally,
Sand Box's intense 50-hour hackathon

699
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:12,587
is complete.

700
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,594
All right. Now, it's time for you

701
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:24,182
to pitch your creative business ideas
to your potential investors.

702
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,894
Let's meet the first team.

703
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,773
Hello. We've come up with a service
that analyzes kids' interests

704
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,525
and finds the best academy for them.

705
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,694
We are Savvy Mom.

706
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,028
JUDGES

707
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,947
SAVVY MOM

708
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,408
My Angel Eyes connects
the visually impaired

709
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:44,411
with volunteers and provides them
with real-time support.

710
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,037
Our designer, whose sibling

711
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,665
is visually impaired,
came up with the idea.

712
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,918
You're never sure how much money to give
as condolences, right?

713
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,712
Our service, How Much,

714
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,171
analyzes your cell phone usage

715
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,466
and suggests an ideal amount
based on your relationship to that person.

716
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,135
A new numbering system

717
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,679
for vehicle license plates
will soon be phased in.

718
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:06,808
To prepare for this,
we developed a recognition system for…

719
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,773
In order to make sure…

720
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,903
- What the…
- What is happening?

721
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,363
- Oh, no!
- That's bad.

722
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,990
- You guys are…
- They're screwed.

723
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,743
- Oh, no.
- I feel bad for them.

724
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,287
- They worked hard, but that's not enough.
- This is bad.

725
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,262
Working hard isn't enough.
You have to do a good job.

726
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,246
Thank you.

727
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,499
I'll revise this a little. Is that okay?

728
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,252
- Yes.
- Let's see.

729
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,422
Keep the intro short but impactful.

730
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:23,009
When you want to emphasize something,
speak slowly.

731
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,053
Keep this short.

732
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,270
Next up is team no. 17, Samsan Tech.

733
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,314
- You'll need time to…
- CEO Seo Dal-mi.

734
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,853
She's super nervous.

735
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,813
I can't see this. I'm covering my eyes.

736
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,401
JUDGES

737
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,887
Nice to meet you all.

738
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,972
I'm Seo Dal-mi, CEO of Samsan Tech,

739
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,558
a company that strives
to innovate the world through AI.

740
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,774
Let me ask you a question first.

741
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:04,444
Would identical twins
have the exact same handwriting?

742
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:09,657
Well, I'm thinking
it's probably different.

743
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,827
Am I wrong?
Do they have the same handwriting?

744
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,038
The correct answer is…

745
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,248
No, they're different.

746
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:21,419
A research institute in the US discovered

747
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:25,465
that even identical twins
can't have the same handwriting.

748
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:29,010
Handwriting is often referred to
as the brain's fingerprint

749
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,929
because every handwriting is different.

750
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:35,183
Therefore, many organizations
such as banks, the Prosecution Service,

751
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,269
the National Forensic Service,

752
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:42,232
and the National Tax Service
use it for identity verification purposes.

753
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:46,027
Hey, she's actually doing better
than I expected.

754
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,114
I know! She's better than anyone
who has presented so far.

755
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:53,576
However, things like your signatures
can be forged quite easily.

756
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,246
The rate of such forgery is eight percent,

757
00:56:56,329 --> 00:57:00,250
but there certainly aren't enough
forgery detection specialists.

758
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,963
There are only 20 specialists
registered with the court.

759
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:07,757
I see!

760
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,678
They'll win at this rate.

761
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:16,266
What if we use AI to fill that shortage?

762
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,894
If it learns countless types
of authentic handwriting

763
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,605
and also forged ones
through machine learning,

764
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,983
we may be able to identify some patterns.

765
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,653
We, at Samsan Tech,
managed to find the answers

766
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,531
to these questions
during this three-day hackathon.

767
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,991
Let's look at the screen.

768
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,201
I'm sure it's great.

769
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,620
You bragged about it
in your business plan.

770
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,290
But what's the use?
You have nothing to entice investors.

771
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,752
BECAUSE, GRADUALLY

772
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,673
This is so cool.

773
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,427
My gosh.

774
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,679
What is your business model?

775
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:58,266
And how will you generate consistent
profit? You don't have a clear picture.

776
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,811
It analyzed the characteristics
of each signature

777
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,355
and handwriting
in Jeonghan Bank's 10,000 test sets

778
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,065
and determined its authenticity.

779
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:10,069
The accuracy reached 99.8 percent.

780
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:15,158
Yes! Applause! Give her a big hand!

781
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,622
If I were Yong-san or Chul-san,

782
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,875
I'd ask you to compensate me
for the past two years of my life.

783
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,755
That's right, 99.8 percent.

784
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:33,426
For the past three days,
I watched our team reach this number

785
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,012
and couldn't catch a wink of sleep.

786
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,515
Handwriting is only the start.

787
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,601
The potential applications
for this technology are endless.

788
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:45,563
Security, medical diagnosis,
smart factories, and self-driving cars.

789
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:49,317
Samsan Tech will enable
all of these things,

790
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,653
and I am so elated to be
a part of their journey.

791
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,820
Me, too!

792
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:59,869
We hope that this exciting journey of ours
begins at Sand Box.

793
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:00,787
Thank you.

794
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,049
She's our CEO!

795
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,842
- You're awesome!
- You rock!

796
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,678
- Dude, we did it.
- We did it!

797
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,143
Well, that wasn't bad.

798
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:25,687
Hey!

799
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,304
Dal-mi.

800
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,265
How was it? Did I make any mistakes?

801
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,851
- Could you tell that I was nervous?
- No, you were great.

802
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,894
No one could've done as well as you did.

803
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,688
- Really?
- Yes.

804
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,398
Gosh, thank god.

805
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,026
I was so nervous thinking
that I might ruin everything.

806
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:15,445
You did great.

807
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:17,780
Let's go.

808
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,924
Hello. I'm Won In-jae,

809
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,468
CEO of Injae Company.

810
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,433
We also used
Jeonghan Bank's handwriting data

811
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:47,518
but came up
with a different kind of service.

812
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,313
Ours is also based on AI technology,

813
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:53,524
but I'd say our approach
is a little more creative.

814
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,277
Jeez, that's rude.

815
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:59,030
What? Is she trying to say
that ours isn't creative enough?

816
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,701
Did you know that they were working
on a font technology?

817
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:04,994
Yes.

818
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,955
Those free fonts
you can download easily on the web.

819
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,416
It's no problem to use them
for personal use,

820
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,711
but if you design a flyer with those fonts

821
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,172
or upload a video on YouTube using them…

822
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,680
She's nervous.

823
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:29,894
Sorry about that.

824
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,647
It's copyright infringement.

825
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,233
It sounds petty, but it's only rightful.

826
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,360
To design one new font,

827
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:41,114
dozens of designers must work on it
for months.

828
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,742
One new design
requires 11,172 different letters.

829
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,954
Designing all of them one by one
can cost anywhere from 100 million

830
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:51,582
to one billion won. It's a huge project.

831
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,877
- That's really expensive.
- Hey.

832
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:59,924
If I told you that we could create
a new unique handwriting font

833
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:05,179
with only 256 letters, what would you say?

834
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,267
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

835
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:15,106
But we, at Injae Company,
put together a learning data set using OCR

836
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:18,317
and has managed to pull off
what no one thought was possible.

837
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,238
- Wow, that is amazing--
- Hey, don't.

838
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:28,119
This is a collection of new fonts
we created in the past three days

839
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:30,621
using 100 handwriting samples
from the bank's set.

840
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,708
If we were to create these fonts
in the old way,

841
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,252
it'd take at least three years.

842
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,338
And of course, it'd cost a lot of money.

843
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,843
However, Injae Company
created these 100 fonts

844
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:47,305
in less than 40 hours.

845
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,558
- Wow.
- My gosh.

846
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:56,773
Now, you can create your own unique font

847
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,442
using 256 handwritten letters

848
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,735
- and--
- Hold on.

849
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,613
I have an interesting question.

850
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:07,450
Hey, isn't that Chairman Won Du-jeong?

851
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:11,412
You're right.
What's Won In-jae's father doing here?

852
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,538
I don't like this.

853
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,832
Sure, go ahead.

854
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:18,211
The team that presented just before this.
Where are they sitting?

855
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:19,712
Oh, there you are.

856
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:23,925
You said Samsan Tech created an algorithm
that uses AI technology

857
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,468
to detect handwriting forgery.

858
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,012
Correct.

859
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:32,308
And your technology allows us to create
a new font using existing handwriting.

860
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,310
Right.

861
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:36,771
Then what will happen
if we put the two together?

862
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:38,856
Am I the only one who's curious?

863
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,360
What will happen if we put
a font created by Injae Company

864
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:43,986
through Samsan Tech's algorithm?

865
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,864
Will it say it was forged?

866
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,844
Yes, of course.

867
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:11,430
Then let's see
if it can really detect it or not.

868
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,139
This is a fight between
a spear and a shield, isn't it?

869
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:11,866
JUDGES

870
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:30,801
Please detect it.

871
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:32,803
Please, please…

872
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:11,717
Injae Company's technology
disabled Samsan Tech's algorithm.

873
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,228
JUDGES

874
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,721
All right. It looks like
we've narrowed down some candidates

875
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,806
for our 12th residency program.

876
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,392
But the last team is the problem.

877
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:06,147
They all got the same score,
so I'm not sure which one to pick.

878
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:09,525
I haven't scored them yet.

879
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,029
- Alex.
- Alex?

880
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,032
Aren't you Korean? What's with that name?

881
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:18,409
He's from 2STO in the US.

882
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,911
It's Sand Box's biggest strategic partner.

883
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,706
Oh, 2STO!

884
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:25,875
I met someone high up in the company.

885
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,543
What was his title?

886
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:30,463
Well, 2STO isn't
a hierarchical organization.

887
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,425
Right, that's what he said.

888
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,181
- Have you decided, Alex?
- Yes.

889
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:55,154
I'm sorry, guys.

890
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,740
I ruined everything.

891
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,577
What are you talking about?

892
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,038
We did our very best. We gave our all.

893
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:08,250
That's right! It's okay.
We have someone to fall back on, you know.

894
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,585
Mr. Han.

895
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:11,670
We'll actually let him invest?

896
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,715
Well, why not?

897
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,843
What we should be worried about
is him backing out.

898
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,022
I guess this is it, then.

899
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,532
Aren't you guys leaving?

900
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,159
The results aren't out yet.

901
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,411
Don't tell me
that you're expecting to get in.

902
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,373
Well, not really.

903
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:51,460
But just in case. What if they call
our names but we aren't there?

904
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,129
We don't want that to happen.

905
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,423
We really don't see eye to eye.

906
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:00,094
I hate people who don't know their place.

907
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:03,347
Why did you join our team
if you hate us that much?

908
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:04,390
To upset us?

909
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:08,144
I wonder, too. I must've been out
of my mind. That punk talked me into it.

910
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:13,023
Right, how did Ms. Seo persuade you?

911
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:16,735
She kept going on about
how the team absolutely needs me.

912
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,571
So I asked her why, and she said this.

913
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:23,826
Why me? Tell me your reason.
I'll make my decision after I hear it.

914
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:25,411
Okay.

915
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,205
I don't have a college degree.

916
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,374
I'm underqualified.

917
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,626
Luck made me a CEO.

918
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,004
What? Do you want to persuade me or not?

919
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:38,507
There's an amazingly talented developer
on my team.

920
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:42,511
He turned down an offer
from someone with stellar credentials

921
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,972
- and chose me.
- Is he crazy?

922
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,891
I bet he's regretting it now.

923
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:48,934
No. Not yet.

924
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:52,521
You don't regret your choice
the moment you make it.

925
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:53,981
It happens after.

926
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:59,111
You see, I've never regretted
any of my choices.

927
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:01,697
I did my best so I wouldn't.

928
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:07,161
So I'm confident that
I can make him never regret his choice.

929
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,917
This is nothing. I can get down
on my knees a thousand times more.

930
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:16,295
I can and will do anything.

931
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:19,965
She seemed so desperate,

932
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:23,552
and I wanted to meet
this "amazingly talented developer."

933
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,556
But he's nothing special.

934
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,563
Maybe Dal-mi is regretting her choice now.

935
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:02,549
Where is Dal-mi?

936
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,927
I saw her going that way earlier.

937
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:15,938
Nam Do-san.

938
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,751
Hey, did you find Dal-mi?

939
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:41,463
What?

940
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,746
Dal-mi got into a good university,
so I sold my corn dog shop

941
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:17,416
to pay her tuition fees.

942
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:19,501
As soon as I did that,

943
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:23,130
she dropped out of school
and picked up all sorts of part-time jobs

944
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:26,008
to buy me a truck
so I could sell my corn dogs.

945
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,677
Dal-mi could've
gone to college instead of me.

946
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,596
You could've kept your shop, too.

947
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:38,979
Oh, you're here.

948
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:42,316
I didn't see you.
I just wanted to sit down.

949
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:46,153
My, what a coincidence.

950
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,784
I should go.

951
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,204
Mr. Han, wait.

952
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:58,665
I'm sorry. I'm busy at the moment.

953
01:12:58,749 --> 01:12:59,750
Thank you.

954
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,545
You did so much to help us.

955
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:07,424
I'm sorry the result wasn't good.

956
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,929
You don't need to thank me.
And don't be sorry. I'll be going now.

957
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,725
I have many questions for you.

958
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:20,437
I was waiting
so I could ask you those questions.

959
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,443
I understand why Do-san lied to me.

960
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:28,904
We met again after 15 years,

961
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:32,866
so he wanted to impress me.
I felt the same way.

962
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:37,830
I'm grateful he also felt that way,
and I get it.

963
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:39,331
Oh, I see.

964
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:41,542
But with you, I don't get it.

965
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,755
I keep racking my brain
but don't understand why you lied.

966
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,301
Why did you do that?

967
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:56,723
Why did you go to great lengths to
help us even if it meant you had to lie?

968
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:02,354
Well, that's…

969
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,992
Ms. Seo, I'm--

970
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:17,244
Dal-mi! Dal-mi.

971
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:20,747
- Dal-mi.
- Hey, Do-san.

972
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:23,917
We…

973
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,212
got in.

974
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:29,590
What?

975
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,679
- For real?
- Yes, for real.

976
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:43,145
Look. That screen over there.

977
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:44,897
"Samsan Tech." See that?

978
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:46,982
You still don't believe it?

979
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:50,527
12TH SAND BOX RESIDENCY RECIPIENTS
INJAE COMPANY, SAMSAN TECH

980
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:42,055
THE 15TH MATHEMATICAL OLYMPIAD
GOLD MEDAL NAM DO-SAN

981
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,349
He won a gold medal
in the Mathematical Olympiad?

982
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,936
Yes, he set a record
for being the youngest winner.

983
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:48,937
I see.

984
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:54,651
I looked up this company.

985
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,653
It's the seventh most valuable company
in the world.

986
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:57,696
What?

987
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:00,741
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
for Do-san.

988
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:05,329
Where did this punk go?

989
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:07,789
Behave yourself. Don't make any blunders.

990
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:14,254
Well, let's only showcase
Do-san's strengths to him.

991
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:16,423
- Only his strengths.
- Okay, nothing else.

992
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,179
GOLD MEDAL NAM DO-SAN

993
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:28,602
Do-san is a fool.

994
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:30,520
He's never been greedy in his life.

995
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,022
He was born that way.

996
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,984
Hey, do you know

997
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:39,780
why we don't have his gold medal here?

998
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:46,662
- No, never.
- That's very impressive.

999
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:48,205
Why the heck are you crying?

1000
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:51,750
You lost to a kid. Aren't you embarrassed?

1001
01:17:58,757 --> 01:17:59,883
You can have this.

1002
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:01,885
I don't need it.

1003
01:18:01,968 --> 01:18:04,012
I'd understand if it was anything else,

1004
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:07,182
but that fool gave away his gold medal.

1005
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:11,061
He was so smart

1006
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:14,439
that he skipped high school
and went straight to college.

1007
01:18:15,148 --> 01:18:16,316
But even there…

1008
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,403
Hey, you're in college.

1009
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:21,279
That 13-year-old boy outdid you.

1010
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:24,658
My goodness.

1011
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:44,302
He intentionally answered all the
questions wrong for the older students.

1012
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:48,390
Eventually, he ended up dropping out
and went back to middle school.

1013
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:02,779
He prefers to lose

1014
01:19:03,947 --> 01:19:05,615
because he feels better that way.

1015
01:19:06,783 --> 01:19:10,704
That's why his nickname is Living Buddha.

1016
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:12,873
"Living Buddha"?

1017
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:24,634
He has no interest in materialistic things
or becoming famous.

1018
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,971
Oh, there's one thing he's greedy for.

1019
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,223
Food.

1020
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,726
- Food?
- He's a glutton.

1021
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,273
You know,

1022
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:43,945
Do-san is as smart as
Steve Jobs or Bill Gates,

1023
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:48,158
but he lacks ambition.
That's why he's in this mess now.

1024
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,169
The moment he becomes ambitious,

1025
01:19:59,836 --> 01:20:01,546
it'll be game over.

1026
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:13,141
- Have you decided, Alex?
- Yes.

1027
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:21,233
Samsan Tech?

1028
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:58,937
We've been assigned our office.

1029
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:03,400
I want Mr. Han to be Samsan Tech's mentor.

1030
01:21:03,483 --> 01:21:04,985
Ms. Seo, you frustrate me.

1031
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:07,904
- I will be your reliable Sherpa.
- It hurts.

1032
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:12,659
I'll do everything I can like your father
covered the ground with sand for you.

1033
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:15,871
You two must've teamed up
to steal my shares.

1034
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:19,457
And the biggest problem here is that
the CEO can't resolve the situation.

1035
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,626
Ms. Seo, you're the problem.

1036
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,837
Regarding why you helped us…

1037
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,548
I'm thinking of telling Dal-mi
the truth today.

1038
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:30,468
