EPISODE 7

2
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,998
Jeez, this is nuts.

3
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,460
She's such a handful.

4
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,504
Why? What's going on?

5
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,589
I'm talking about Seo Dal-mi
at Samsan Tech.

6
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,884
She has so many questions.
She kept texting me all night.

7
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,345
Jeez, look. She texted me over 400 times.

8
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,223
What? Over 400 times? That is crazy.

9
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:41,142
How can any mentor possibly answer
all those questions?

10
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,894
What can I do? I should answer them.

11
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,064
I should've never volunteered
to be a mentor. I really regret it.

12
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,316
It's such an ordeal.

13
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,528
It is an ordeal. Right?

14
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:56,533
Yes, it sure is.
I brought this upon myself.

15
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,620
Gosh.

16
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,455
Is this it? Yes.

17
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,873
SEND
TO: SEO DAL-MI

18
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,835
YOUR EMAIL HAS BEEN SENT

19
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,044
Finally, I'm done!

20
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,505
Gosh, my wrist hurts.

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,510
Ms. Seo.

22
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,181
What's with him?
His actions don't match his words.

23
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,684
Ms. Seo, what brings you here?

24
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,644
Could you check our shareholders' list?

25
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,313
You could've just emailed me. Why come…

26
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,151
all the way here?

27
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,695
I also wanted to talk.

28
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,576
SHAREHOLDERS' LIST

29
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,703
You'll receive the start-up fund tomorrow.

30
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,621
Thank you.

31
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,669
- Let's go.
- You go ahead.

32
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,379
I need to talk with Ji-pyeong.

33
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,382
All right, then.

34
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,933
What is it about?

35
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:05,852
Well…

36
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,564
I'm thinking of telling Dal-mi
the truth today.

37
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,857
The truth?

38
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,776
About the letters?

39
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,446
Yes.

40
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,488
Why, all of a sudden?

41
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,326
I want to remove a bug
that's bound to occur someday.

42
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,832
- Don't tell her.
- I want to.

43
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,085
Everything will be ruined, the company
and your relationship with her.

44
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,546
No, it'll be all right.

45
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,631
Why so confident?

46
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,383
That's what I want to ask you.

47
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,095
What can 15-year-old letters do?
What makes you so sure it'll be the end?

48
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,182
I think they can do

49
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,435
a lot more than you can now.

50
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,857
We'll see about that.

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,286
"We'll see about that"?

52
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,181
"We'll see about that"?

53
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,393
How dare he.

54
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,117
Turn left at the next light.

55
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,171
"We'll see about that"?
Why should I listen to you?

56
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,716
I refuse!

57
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,315
You invited him over
when you've only recently met?

58
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,275
We go back a long way.

59
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,653
Fifteen years. I'd say
that's long enough to invite him over.

60
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,453
My gosh, we don't have anything to eat.

61
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,543
Dal-mi, go to the grocery store

62
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,587
and pick up some beltfish and seaweed.

63
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,297
It's okay. I don't need to eat.

64
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,632
I have to eat dinner. Go on, hurry.

65
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,342
- Now?
- Yes, go.

66
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,929
Make yourself at home.

67
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,307
Don't say anything weird.

68
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,420
Dal-mi's told me a lot about you.

69
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,466
I did think we'd meet sooner or later,

70
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,719
but who knew this is how we'd meet?

71
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,014
Is your eyesight very bad?

72
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,849
It's okay at the moment.

73
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,770
I can see well.

74
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,730
If I take good care of myself,

75
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,943
I can slow down the progression
of my condition.

76
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,446
- I'm guessing Dal-mi doesn't know?
- Right, she doesn't.

77
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,743
So pretend you don't know
anything, either.

78
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,957
How can I do that?

79
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,584
- If she finds out later--
- She'll probably cry

80
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,171
and blame you for not telling her.

81
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,590
She'll cry and be resentful.

82
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,260
Then,

83
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,099
she'll pity me,
just like you're doing now.

84
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,602
- Ms. Choi, I'm just--
- I don't like being looked at like that.

85
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,274
It makes me feel

86
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,986
as though something
really bad has happened.

87
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,572
As if

88
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,451
the whole world will turn pitch black
right this second,

89
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,455
and my life will be completely destroyed.

90
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:39,917
But you know,

91
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,256
that's not going to help my eyes
get better.

92
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,892
I don't want that pitiful gaze
from anyone else.

93
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,188
No more

94
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,982
of that gaze.

95
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,572
Thanks to you,

96
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,784
Dal-mi has been smiling a lot lately.

97
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,830
Since the day she met you,

98
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,958
she's been going on about you every day.

99
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:27,048
Her eyes sparkle like
diamonds when she talks about you.

100
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,009
I'm sure you know

101
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,470
how pretty

102
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,807
her eyes are when she smiles.

103
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,686
Yes.

104
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,232
Of course, I know.

105
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,235
I owe it all to you, Do-san.

106
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,654
Thanks to you,

107
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,031
I can see those pretty eyes

108
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,409
every single day.

109
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,332
If I can see them

110
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,334
for just a little longer

111
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,211
then even if I do go blind,

112
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,505
I'll have no regrets.

113
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,633
Can you please help me?

114
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,512
Is it too inconsiderate of me
to ask such a favor?

115
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,266
No.

116
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,018
Not at all.

117
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,439
I'm counting on you.

118
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,777
Don't tell anyone, okay?

119
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,654
Okay.

120
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,408
Don't tell Dal-mi. Or Ji-pyeong.

121
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,579
You mean, Mr. Han Ji-pyeong?

122
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,039
Yes.

123
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,420
That Good Boy

124
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,257
will go on about his debt again
and make a big fuss over it.

125
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,884
Gosh, I'm so tired of it.

126
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,763
The deep despair
I can't even try to understand.

127
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,725
While watching her quietly embrace

128
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,853
and accept even that into her life,
it became clear.

129
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,897
I'm sorry. I know it sounds ridiculous.

130
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,442
But I'm deeply indebted to the person
who asked this favor.

131
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,235
It's just for an hour.

132
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,446
Please pretend
to be the person in the letters.

133
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,659
The person who led me to a first love
I didn't even know existed…

134
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,745
How in debt are you

135
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,205
that it can't be paid with your wealth?

136
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,416
I wish it could be paid with money.

137
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,838
And the person who offered him a kindness
that could never be repaid…

138
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,591
It was her.

139
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,720
All these miracles

140
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,932
began with her.

141
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,615
- Ms. Choi.
- Yes?

142
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,581
Ms. Choi, I…

143
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,043
I have something for you.

144
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,052
I made these cleaning sponges.

145
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,721
My gosh.

146
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,642
Hey, you're very crafty.

147
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,685
My, these are nice.

148
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,064
Have you heard of the RGB color model?

149
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,651
It's a color system
based on three primary colors.

150
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,362
I made these sponges
inspired by those colors.

151
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,580
Gosh, what was
that awkward reaction about?

152
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,043
She met him again after almost 15 years.
Isn't she excited to see him?

153
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,301
- Oh? Mr. Han.
- Mr. Nam Do-san…

154
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,554
I mean, where is Do-san?

155
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,432
Do-san? He's at my place now.

156
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,724
At your place?

157
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,768
What's wrong?

158
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,187
What brings you here?

159
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,414
Grandma, say hello to our mentor.

160
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:32,126
He's like a brother to Do-san.
His name is Han Ji-pyeong.

161
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,213
Oh, hello.

162
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,340
Hello.

163
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,927
This is the CEO of Cheong-myeong Corn Dog

164
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,680
and my grandma, Ms. Choi Won-deok.

165
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,766
It's nice to meet you.

166
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:05,701
THE RATE AT WHICH A START-UP SPENDS MONEY

167
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,247
Oh, likewise.

168
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,629
But what brings you by at this hour?

169
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,797
I'm here because…

170
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,885
I have something urgent to speak
with Do-san about.

171
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,638
Hey, let's go. We need to talk.

172
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,933
What is it about?

173
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,977
Ji-pyeong.

174
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,939
About that, I'll take your advice.

175
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,316
You'll take my advice?

176
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,484
That's right.

177
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,528
So don't worry.

178
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,445
Just leave.

179
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,951
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

180
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,870
Well, all right. I'll be off then.

181
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,039
Take care.

182
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,918
Did you have dinner?

183
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,629
Dal-mi, he has plans.

184
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,549
- Really?
- Yes. Right, Ji-pyeong?

185
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,053
- No, I don't.
- You do!

186
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,054
Nope.

187
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,767
Well, I'll stay for dinner then.

188
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,144
Oh, boy.

189
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,525
Can you leave?

190
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,610
I'll leave after dinner.

191
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:29,451
Grandma. These two are making our ceiling
look so low, don't you think?

192
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,412
Yes, totally.

193
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,455
Oh, this is great.

194
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:38,502
You guys are tall. Can one of you
change the light bulb in our bathroom?

195
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,670
- Of course.
- Of course.

196
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,924
I'll do it. I'm taller than him.

197
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,426
Only by a centimeter or two.

198
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,177
- What? Hey.
- It's about the same.

199
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,470
What are you saying?

200
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,431
It's not just by a centimeter or two.

201
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,100
- Fine, let's make it four.
- Okay.

202
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,687
But that's still shorter than this.
All right?

203
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,358
Where is it? Where is the bathroom?

204
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,820
- Oh, the bathroom is that way.
- Over there?

205
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,454
Hey! Let me do it, okay?
I majored in computer engineering.

206
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:17,124
Get out.
I own shares in a lighting company.

207
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,336
I got A+ in Circuit Theory
as well as in Power Engineering.

208
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,172
I know everything about the types
and history of lighting,

209
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,425
and I'm also well versed
in their profit margins and distribution.

210
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,593
Okay, I heard you.

211
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,345
But that's just…

212
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,805
- Move, will you?
- They're so tight.

213
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,349
- Fine.
- They look like brothers.

214
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,768
- Seriously…
- Let's take a break. Just for a moment.

215
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,361
I'll let you pretend you know everything
about computers, but not this. Jeez.

216
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,555
Dal-mi, I fixed the showerhead.
Anything else?

217
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,349
I moved the plants. Anything else?

218
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,977
If you need anything moved or fixed,
just tell me.

219
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,269
No, there's nothing else.

220
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,356
Just tell me. I'm still in my 20s,
which means I'm stronger.

221
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,984
You have cervical kyphosis.
What if your disc collapses?

222
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,735
I'm worried.

223
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,362
Tell me. What else?

224
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,863
Nothing else. Come and eat.

225
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,073
- Okay!
- Okay!

226
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,453
Let's eat.

227
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,082
- Oh, beltfish!
- It looks amazing.

228
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,961
Beltfish is so expensive now. I'll make
sure everyone gets an equal portion.

229
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,879
Here, Grandma.

230
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,756
Here, Mr. Han.

231
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,358
It doesn't seem that "equal."

232
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,653
Gosh, Grandma.
Look at you getting jealous.

233
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,825
Here.

234
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,998
I've heard a lot about you.

235
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,084
Dal-mi said you've been taking
great care of her.

236
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,253
You're her savior.

237
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,467
- That's--
- Strictly speaking,

238
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,719
he is Do-san's savior.

239
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,929
He's helping me
because I work with Do-san.

240
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,057
That's not true.

241
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,481
- Pardon?
- I don't help anyone and everyone.

242
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,858
I'm not that kind,

243
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,360
nor do I have that much time.

244
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,448
Then why are you looking after me?

245
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,420
- For my ROI.
- Sorry? Your ROI?

246
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,714
I'm an investor.

247
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,675
I'm not helping you for free,
so you must repay me tenfold.

248
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,720
Of course, we should.

249
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,907
Thank you for the food.

250
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,584
- Get home safely.
- Will do.

251
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,921
You guys are going separately?

252
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,760
Want a ride?

253
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,554
Shall I drop you off?

254
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,598
Sure, that'd be great.

255
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,352
Hold on, Ms. Seo.
Did you check your email?

256
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,979
My email? No, not yet.

257
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,730
Those questions you sent me.

258
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,441
I emailed you my answers,
so check when you get a moment.

259
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,320
What? I texted you over 400 questions.
You answered all of them?

260
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,532
Right, 461 questions in total.
I answered them all.

261
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,869
Seriously?

262
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,621
You're amazing.

263
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,207
Thank you so much. I really mean it.

264
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,963
Then to thank you…

265
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,216
- I will…
- You have something on…

266
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,469
I'll do whatever it takes
to become an outstanding CEO.

267
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,389
You can't achieve that
with determination alone.

268
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,685
Right, I can't. But without determination,
I won't go anywhere.

269
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,237
All right.

270
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,948
Let's go, Do-san.

271
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,117
- All right.
- Okay.

272
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,911
- The car's here--
- Give me a second.

273
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,496
Hey, I forgot to answer your question
about the shares.

274
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,458
You're our CEO
who holds 71 percent of the shares.

275
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,418
I am part of your shares,

276
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,462
and I got your back.

277
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,675
And we'll always be a team,
no matter what happens.

278
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,094
So trust me and don't worry, okay?

279
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,763
Okay.

280
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,559
- Go home.
- All right. It's chilly. Go back inside.

281
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,564
The other side.

282
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,620
So what's going on?

283
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,706
Didn't you say
you'd tell her about the letters?

284
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,834
- You told me not to.
- Don't give me such an excuse.

285
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,879
You couldn't even bring it up.

286
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,216
- Drop me off at the next light.
- I'll take you home.

287
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,510
You're making me uncomfortable.
I'll take the bus.

288
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,014
You have a knack for confusing others.
You said you're ambitious.

289
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,101
Then use your resources,
whether that's me or Seo Dal-mi.

290
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,104
I'm not using her.

291
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,606
I've started to really…

292
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,861
Get out.

293
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,740
You said you'll take the bus. Go.

294
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,504
- What? Get out.
- I'm really confused.

295
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,674
Mr. Han,

296
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,886
are you jealous?

297
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,348
What? "Jealous"?

298
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,228
Hey, look. I guess you don't know
what "jealous" means.

299
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,022
That's why you're asking.

300
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,568
- So you're not jealous?
- No, I'm not.

301
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,652
All right, then.

302
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,747
- Dal-mi.
- Yes?

303
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,375
Which Do-san do you like better?

304
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,127
What do you mean?

305
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,673
The one who used to write you letters
15 years ago

306
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,763
or the one you met again as an adult?

307
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,146
What? What kind of question is that?

308
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,107
Why separate the two? It's the same guy.

309
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,152
I know that.
But if we were to separate the two,

310
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,197
which Do-san would you pick?

311
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,574
Between the two of them?

312
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,952
I'm not sure if I can think that way.
Why do you ask?

313
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,997
What? Well, I was just curious

314
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,918
what it would've been like if you'd
never been pen pals in the first place.

315
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:02,297
Gosh. Knowing how picky you are, I wonder
if he would've met your standards.

316
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,841
What? I'm not picky.

317
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,384
You are picky.

318
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,763
No spelling mistakes whatsoever.
You like men who are empathetic

319
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,641
and not rude.
And they can't expect to see you randomly.

320
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,852
There are so many rules. It's more
complicated than the Constitution.

321
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,979
Those things are basic etiquette.

322
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,233
Anyway, who's your pick?

323
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,695
Your pen pal, Do-san?
Or the Do-san you know now?

324
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,200
Well…

325
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,912
If I have to pick one…

326
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,716
Gosh, as if I have time to get jealous.

327
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,346
How could he think
that I might be jealous of him?

328
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,390
Yeong-sil, what is "jealousy"?

329
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,351
"Jealousy" is the title of a TV series.

330
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,062
The final episode aired on July 21, 1992.

331
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,648
Hey! Are you messing with me, too?

332
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,567
What is the definition of the word?

333
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,028
"Jealousy" refers to the feeling you get
when you think

334
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,865
that a person you like
loves someone else more than you--

335
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,200
See? The premise doesn't apply to my case.

336
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,994
It doesn't apply to you?

337
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,329
I WISH YOU SUCCESS

338
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,835
No, it's not like
I have feelings for someone.

339
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:26,214
So how could I get jealous?
I don't have feelings for anyone.

340
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,217
Then I suppose it's not jealousy.

341
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,847
Right, it's not.

342
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,688
No way.

343
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,005
I WISH YOU SUCCESS

344
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,685
SAMSAN TECH

345
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,603
HERE ARE MY ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS

346
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:08,817
FROM: HAN JI-PYEONG
TO: SEO DAL-MI

347
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,384
RECYCLING

348
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,076
When we receive 100 million won,
how should we spend it?

349
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,579
The rate at which a start-up spends money
is called "burn rate."

350
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,081
You need to know your burn rate

351
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,709
- to find out how many months you can last.
- Burn rate is the rate at which a start-up

352
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,836
- Look at your monthly expenses.
- spends money.

353
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,463
As you know, we received

354
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,507
- a hundred million won.
- 30 percent is your reserve fund.

355
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,260
Thirty percent of that
should be our reserve fund.

356
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,888
Then we have 70 million left.

357
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,558
Let's allocate ten million won
for our expenses

358
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,728
for transportation, communication,
and equipment.

359
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,191
Then let's say we'll pay ourselves
two million won a month.

360
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,360
- For real?
- For real?

361
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,528
That's peanuts.

362
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,738
- It's too little?
- You think it's a lot?

363
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,699
Yes, we were never able to pay ourselves
for the past two years.

364
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,953
My credit card bills
have never been under two million won.

365
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,956
- Mr. Nam.
- Are you boasting?

366
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,542
I sure am.
It means I made that much money.

367
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,799
Hold on, guys.
That's not the problem here.

368
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:42,679
That's ten million won for the five of us,
so we'll be able to last six months.

369
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,806
- Six months?
- That's it?

370
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,642
We need to yield good results
in the next six months.

371
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,895
Because Mr. Han said

372
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,981
there will be a demo day in three months,

373
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,608
and all the influential investors
will be there.

374
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,987
I know what it is.
You present your interim results,

375
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,531
and the investors decide
whether they'll invest more.

376
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,533
Oh, like that.

377
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,994
FUNDING STATUS

378
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,287
Gosh.

379
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,955
JUST ONE DAY
FUNDING: 4 BILLION

380
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,166
If you get a billion won,
your company's value…

381
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,836
If you gave ten percent of the shares,
the value would reach ten billion won.

382
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,212
Ten billion?

383
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,258
- Ten billion?
- They got four billion, so…

384
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,845
If they also gave 10 percent,
the value should be 40 billion won.

385
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,556
They've completed their series A.

386
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,226
That's our future.

387
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,523
Well, you guys…

388
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,611
I mean, that could be your future.

389
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,541
What will happen
if we fail to secure further funding?

390
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,335
You have two options.

391
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,171
Earn money by selling your service

392
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,257
or leave.

393
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:06,554
All right, we need to have a meeting.

394
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,932
- Okay. Hey, come on.
- Let's go.

395
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,308
Hurry.

396
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,270
- Please take good care of this.
- My gosh.

397
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,605
Don't you worry.

398
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,775
I'll get it tested and get back to you
with detailed feedback.

399
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,985
We should pay you for this,
but as you know--

400
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,572
Don't worry. I'm happy to help you out.

401
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,450
I can also help you
with design or marketing.

402
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,785
But you know the drill.

403
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,287
Yes! One percent of the shares.
I'm well aware.

404
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,041
By the way, you have users
to test the product, right?

405
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,502
Well…

406
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,005
Oh, yes. There they are.

407
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,049
- Hey, Do-san!
- Gosh.

408
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,220
What are you doing here?

409
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,226
- Who is he?
- What?

410
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,939
My cousin, Nam Cheon-ho.

411
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,860
Oh, Mr. One Percent?

412
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,737
- Yes, that's me.
- Hello.

413
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,083
What is this?

414
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,336
This is a prototype made by Wepulse,
a team from the tenth residency.

415
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,922
It's called ET, an emotion transistor.

416
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,009
It's a device that expresses
your emotions. I'll show you.

417
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,012
It works like a pulse oximeter.

418
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:33,308
Blue means you're excited.
When you're lying, you'll see red.

419
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,476
If you're indifferent,
the light will turn off.

420
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,021
This will do that?

421
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,194
What… What are you doing?

422
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,906
- Amazing.
- Amazing.

423
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:49,949
It really works.

424
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,165
It's very accurate.

425
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,798
But why do we have to test this?

426
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,884
Oh, since it's a prototype,

427
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,011
they need ideas to perfect the product.

428
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,056
I need you all to test it
and give me thorough feedback.

429
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,058
It's good for start-ups
to help each other.

430
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,311
Hey, are they giving you
one percent of their shares?

431
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,772
Yes. That way,
I can become Bonnie Brown of Korea.

432
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,108
Bonnie Brown? Who's that?

433
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,860
An in-house masseuse at Google.

434
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,987
Her stock options made her a millionaire.

435
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,531
She's my role model.

436
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,410
Discover high-potential start-ups.
Help them out using my skill sets

437
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,914
and get one percent of the stock.
One of them will become huge, like Google.

438
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,791
Then I'll become a millionaire!

439
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,628
Just the thought gets me excited.

440
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,847
What are you thinking about?
Yours is blue, too.

441
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:01,104
Well, I was just thinking
it'd be nice to be one of them.

442
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,356
"One of them"?

443
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,317
What? You mean,
Samsan Tech becoming like Google?

444
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,236
Are you kidding me?

445
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,502
Cheon-ho, this is helpful
when you're making a decision.

446
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,878
- Right?
- Yes.

447
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,107
All right. Get ready for a big surprise.

448
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,026
My solution is brilliant.

449
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,028
It's called "Protect Maesaengi"!

450
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,112
The natural treasure?

451
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,865
That's the leopard cat.
I'm talking about maesaengi!

452
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,409
The seaweed I send to your family
all the time.

453
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,452
Sorry.

454
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,746
My father has a maesaengi farm.

455
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,958
But the ducks eat the leaves like crazy.

456
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,169
That's why my father sits there all day.

457
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,839
Whenever he sees ducks, he rings his bell
to scare them off, but it's useless.

458
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,300
And it's not like he can sit there 24-7.

459
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:16,679
So what if we can detect those ducks
using our image recognition technology?

460
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,556
The moment they show up,

461
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,475
the horn goes… Boom!

462
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,020
Then the yield will go
from 3,000 to 5,000 tons.

463
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,148
Does it not get you excited?

464
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,734
No, not really.

465
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,529
I guess not.

466
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:37,283
When you press the start button,
your selfie shows up.

467
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,745
Then your fortune for career, love,
and health will be displayed

468
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,538
based on scientific data.

469
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,917
Physiognomy and image recognition.

470
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,419
My gosh, I'm so excited about this.

471
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,132
But you don't believe in physiognomy.

472
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,383
I do as of today.

473
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,178
Just like you now believe
the blood type personality theory.

474
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,102
The pet economy is booming these days.

475
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,521
But I'm not talking about
predictable pet-commerce.

476
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,856
What if dogs could shop online themselves?

477
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,192
Dogs will shop online? How?

478
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,529
We teach the image recognition software
to read dogs' facial expressions.

479
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,031
It learns to detect
when they're curious about an item

480
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:21,160
so when the dog makes that expression,
it sends the item to the shopping cart.

481
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,956
That's not a bad idea.

482
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,625
A solid revenue model
and a specific target audience.

483
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,507
By the way, Yong-san.
You look kind of cute with those glasses.

484
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,846
What? "Cute"?

485
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,430
He looks awful.

486
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,015
Like kimchi that has turned sour.

487
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,810
And maesaengi's revenue model is better.

488
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,397
The yearly yield is over 3,000 tons.

489
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:13,254
I wanted to come up with a solution
that utilizes the algorithm we have.

490
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,299
Look.

491
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,218
The recognition rate is so high.

492
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:23,055
Of course. From the speed
to the recognition rate,

493
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,516
no one can beat us in this country.

494
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,186
We won the CODA competition
with this technology.

495
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:33,065
I had this idea a few days ago.

496
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,319
Among the solutions
that use our image recognition…

497
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,918
He still hasn't read it.

498
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,503
- What?
- I'm talking about Mr. Han.

499
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,547
I emailed him the ideas from our meeting.

500
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,883
But it says he still hasn't read it.

501
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,635
And he's not even texting me back.

502
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,972
Oh! That's Mr. Han.

503
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,390
Mr. Han!

504
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,809
Mr. Han!

505
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,604
Mr. Han!

506
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,739
QUESTION BOMBER

507
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,042
He ignored my call on purpose, right?

508
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,128
He must be very busy.
He's been ignoring my calls too.

509
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,922
Really?

510
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,385
What shall we eat?

511
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,514
I'm craving rice because
we ate instant noodles all night.

512
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,142
There's a new restaurant
across the street.

513
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,978
- Do you want to check it out?
- Sure.

514
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,024
I'll have a bowl of rice with kimchi stew

515
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,404
Hey, you're so early!

516
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,031
You guys are working so hard.
Did you stay up all night?

517
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,199
Keep it up.

518
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,091
I thought the twins would leave
after the hackathon.

519
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,676
I'm surprised they're still here.

520
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,971
Right? Looks like they're here to stay.

521
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,183
- That's right. We're here to stay.
- Why?

522
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,102
What the…

523
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,397
Because we can make more profit
by staying.

524
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,149
Hey!

525
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,651
You sneaked up behind us!

526
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,445
- Jeez.
- Where did he come from?

527
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,572
But what do you mean by profit?

528
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,200
Our CEO is competent. She already
managed to land a lucrative gig.

529
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,536
A gig? Care to elaborate?

530
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,914
What the hell?

531
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,001
What kind of gig?

532
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,837
- Jeonghan Bank?
- Yes.

533
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,673
They landed a downsizing project using AI.

534
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,300
They'll get paid 300 million won.

535
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:08,054
What? What about us? We also used
their data set in the Hackathon.

536
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,388
Ms. Won is very competent.

537
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,558
Competent, my ass.
We all know how she got that project.

538
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,519
- How?
- Her dad pulled some strings, obviously.

539
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,647
Jeonghan Bank CEO and Won Du-jeong
went to middle school together.

540
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,236
Bill Gates said, "Life is unfair.

541
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,655
Get used to it."

542
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,200
Damn it.

543
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,506
- This is the oil you used today, right?
- Yes.

544
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,466
- Would you like to get one?
- Yes.

545
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,721
This credit card has been suspended.

546
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,266
Ma'am, it says that your credit card
has been suspended.

547
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,775
He's doing this again?

548
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,237
We'll talk to them and leave right away.

549
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,114
Hey, In-jae.

550
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,748
I see you here often these days.
What brings you by?

551
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,251
What do you think?
I want to put together a task force

552
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,045
to bring AI technology into distribution.
What do you think?

553
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,881
I want you to be in charge.
Write up a proposal.

554
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,800
I want to help you get started--

555
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:31,846
No, don't do anything.
You can watch quietly, but that's it.

556
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,015
You brat! Dad just wants to help.

557
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,480
I mean, Ms. Won. I guess
you don't really know the situation.

558
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,941
People are after this project
like a pack of dogs.

559
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,401
Let those dogs do it, then.

560
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,283
Remember the German Shepherd we had?
His name was Taebaek.

561
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,078
You starved him for days because
you wanted to see him eat his poop.

562
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,747
You gave him just enough food to survive,

563
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,833
saying he'd bite us
if we fed him too well.

564
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,920
Yet he still wagged his tail
whenever he saw you, like an idiot.

565
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,424
There are many Taebaeks here.

566
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,010
So find yourself another team.

567
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,178
I won't do it.

568
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,331
- Ms. Yoon.
- Oh, thank you.

569
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:46,045
I heard Injae Company landed an AI project
Jeonghan Bank is launching.

570
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,964
Yes, I heard.

571
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,717
Won In-jae is impressive, isn't she?

572
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,928
She's already landed
a 300-million-won project.

573
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,347
She doesn't even need a mentor.

574
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,892
I know. She makes my job very easy.

575
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,687
She knows what to do
and how to accomplish it.

576
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,273
But I have to say,

577
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,777
I don't think she knows

578
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,321
why she's doing this.

579
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,741
For money, of course.
What other reason could there be?

580
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,327
Right, it all comes down to money.

581
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,121
It's a good reason and also an honest one.

582
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,709
But I thought

583
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,254
this kid would be different.

584
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,259
I thought she'd find a different reason.
Not money.

585
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,805
Different reason? Like what?

586
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,641
That I don't know yet.

587
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,659
I WANT TO GET MY REVENGE

588
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,785
"Revenge"?

589
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,996
What? That's scary.

590
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,312
Congratulations.

591
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,981
I heard you landed a project
with Jeonghan Bank.

592
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:30,983
Thank you.

593
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,987
Both your congratulations and my thank you
sound awfully insincere.

594
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,742
I can't congratulate you sincerely
because your achievement isn't real.

595
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,329
Does it look fake to you?

596
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,830
Yes, it does.

597
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,917
But you do seem very lucky
and well-connected.

598
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,836
What everyone else finds difficult

599
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,921
seems so easy for you.

600
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:54,798
You think I pulled strings?

601
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:56,967
Why?

602
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:00,471
I heard the CEO of the bank
and your father went to school together.

603
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:07,645
My father's company
is also launching an AI project.

604
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,398
It would've been a lot easier for me
to take that on. Why bother with Jeonghan?

605
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,278
THE 12TH HACKATHON

606
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,073
I met someone from the company that day.

607
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,617
You took a nap after the Hackathon,

608
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,827
but I met the man

609
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,537
who was there as a judge.

610
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,831
Then I contacted him

611
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,708
and submitted a proposal.

612
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,879
And my father was not involved at all.

613
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:40,052
You had your chance, too.
You're incompetent for not seizing it.

614
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,555
Try to learn from my accomplishments.

615
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,849
Luck? Connections?
Stop listing excuses already.

616
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,562
I'm tired of it.

617
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,369
But I thought this kid would be different.

618
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,706
I thought she'd find a different reason.
Not money.

619
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,045
Let me give you a word of advice.

620
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:20,801
If you want to be considered a real CEO,
don't stand there looking spaced out.

621
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,428
You should run to your office now.

622
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,890
I'm giving you information
on Morning Group's new AI project.

623
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,726
Why should I take on a project
you rejected?

624
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,688
For money.

625
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,523
Don't you need money?

626
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,234
What will you do?

627
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,487
Will you let this opportunity slip away?

628
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,126
Morning Group?

629
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,462
Why? That's random.

630
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,922
But we already have plans
for our business.

631
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,632
We'll delay it a little.

632
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,844
To earn money
so that we can finance the business.

633
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,053
How much can we make?

634
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,306
Fifty million won
for just proposing a solution.

635
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,641
And 300 million won for building it.

636
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:13,645
And if we manage it for them,
we can expect at least a billion won.

637
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,404
Then we can easily hold out
for three years, not just six months.

638
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,032
And no more running around
trying to secure funding.

639
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,535
What do you think?
I think we should do it.

640
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,254
All right, let's do it.

641
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,790
I'm sorry.

642
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,168
- For what?
- The business you want to start.

643
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,629
It's a great idea,

644
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,923
but you know. It'll cost a lot.

645
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,677
- To make that much money--
- I know.

646
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,723
I'm just worried about you. That's all.

647
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,102
- Me? Why?
- Chairman Won Du-jeong.

648
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,896
Isn't your mom married to him?

649
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:40,941
Yes.

650
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,277
You don't want to get involved.

651
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,028
Right, I don't.

652
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,156
I hate him more than cockroaches.

653
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:49,700
So why?

654
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,244
My grandma once told me

655
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:55,581
that gaining an enemy
is like losing 100 million won,

656
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,000
and gaining an ally is like
earning that much money.

657
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,254
We're already dirt broke,
so we can't lose money and fall into debt.

658
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,799
I'll suck it up and try to gain an ally.

659
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,969
I'm very patient.

660
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,181
Me, too.

661
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,310
You know, my nickname is

662
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,562
LB.

663
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,773
Get it? Living Buddha.

664
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,816
Oh, I see.

665
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,068
- LB for short, you know.
- Yes.

666
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,903
When I get angry…

667
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,449
Gosh.

668
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,203
- I knit.
- What?

669
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,581
- For real.
- Seriously?

670
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:41,126
Yes. While I'm knitting,
I try to picture it in my head.

671
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,754
- Okay.
- Smashing things

672
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,256
and yelling at people. Stuff like that.

673
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,341
I see.

674
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,343
That helps me calm down.

675
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,719
- Really?
- Yes.

676
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:51,637
I do that, too.

677
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,474
I always picture myself smashing stuff
and arguing with people.

678
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,059
It's like a blockbuster movie!

679
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,310
- For real?
- Yes, for real!

680
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,353
- You do it, too?
- Yes!

681
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:00,812
You knit?

682
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,648
No, minus the knitting.

683
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,317
Who knits when they're angry?

684
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,822
I do. I told you just now.

685
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,241
I bet no one else does it.

686
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:17,204
- I sit like this and knit the knit stitch.
- Yes, show me.

687
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,040
Seriously.

688
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,669
Once, I kept on knitting
until it reached about 2m.

689
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,088
Thinking about the things you'd do
when you're angry

690
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,757
really helps you calm down.
Seriously, believe me.

691
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,011
You haven't changed at all.

692
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:39,142
You were like this 15 years ago
and even now.

693
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,979
No one understands me better than you do.

694
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,357
You think so?

695
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:06,962
Dal-mi.

696
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,008
I've changed a lot.

697
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,972
I don't really remember
what happened 15 years ago.

698
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,850
No, actually…
I don't even want to remember that time.

699
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,519
I wish

700
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,941
you hadn't known me back then.

701
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:33,613
Why?

702
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,074
Because I was a total loser back then.

703
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,079
You always thought highly of me,
but I wasn't like that.

704
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,056
Let's go make some money.

705
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,078
Sir.

706
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,249
Oh, hello.

707
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,084
Just a second.

708
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,337
This is you, right?

709
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,965
Yes, this is me.

710
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,759
- With your pale face and all.
- Yes.

711
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,720
Around 10 at night on May 24th,

712
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,097
you dumped this plant illegally, right?

713
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,390
Right.

714
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:46,478
What? No, I tossed it
in the recycling bin.

715
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,813
Right, you can't do that!

716
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,482
Then how…

717
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:53,443
Plants are a little tricky.

718
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,946
The plant itself can be treated
as regular garbage.

719
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,781
Dump the soil in the garden outside.

720
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,199
And that's a ceramic planter,

721
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,451
so get the bag for incombustible waste.

722
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:02,953
Do you understand?

723
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:04,996
Say that again?

724
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,458
I said,

725
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,544
the plant itself can be treated

726
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,379
- as regular garbage.
- Regular garbage?

727
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,548
The soil can be dumped anywhere outside.

728
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,132
- No one will say anything.
- I see.

729
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,385
And that's ceramic,
so it's not regular garbage.

730
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:22,222
It must be discarded in the special bag
for incombustible waste, okay?

731
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,684
It took me two days to track you down.
That alone makes me so angry,

732
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,727
but it's my job,
so I won't get mad at you.

733
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,104
Okay. Non… What?

734
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,147
The special bag for incombustible waste.

735
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,983
Just find it and put that in there.

736
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,818
Oh, you have a nice car.

737
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,028
- Special bag?
- Yes, that's right!

738
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:40,365
- For incombustible waste?
- The bag for incombustible waste!

739
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,284
Wait, can you…

740
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,870
explain it once more? Where's he going?

741
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,458
Hey, Dong-cheon.

742
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,045
Do you happen to know
where I can get the special bag for…

743
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:57,549
incombustible waste?
Do you know where I can buy one?

744
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,260
No, no. Incombustible, not "incompatible."

745
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,429
No! It's not a dating site!

746
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,514
Incombustible. As in, it doesn't burn.

747
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,141
Yes, non…

748
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,767
Forget it. I'll figure it out.

749
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,272
I WISH YOU SUCCESS

750
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,373
- Mr. Han.
- God, you scared me.

751
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,586
- What's up?
- You seem very busy these days.

752
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:35,837
So I was waiting for you.

753
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:39,591
You didn't answer my calls
and haven't read my email either.

754
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,844
Oh, I've been busy examining investments.

755
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,096
- See you.
- Can you spare me a minute?

756
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,975
We submitted a proposal to Morning Group.

757
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,520
For an organizational downsizing project
using AI technology.

758
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,189
I wanted to let you know.

759
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,816
And here.

760
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,737
What is this?

761
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,031
The bag for incombustible waste.

762
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:07,285
I went to your office hoping to see you

763
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,579
and happened to overhear
your phone conversation.

764
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,290
Park Dong-cheon…

765
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,292
You're throwing something away?

766
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,256
Yes.

767
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,468
FOR INCOMBUSTIBLE WASTE

768
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,764
Why are you

769
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:30,725
so nosy?

770
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,269
Sorry? "Nosy"?

771
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,358
I was just trying to help--

772
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,653
You are nosy if you enjoy forcing
unwanted help or advice upon others.

773
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,739
I never asked you to get me this.

774
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,075
Why do something like this and make me…

775
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,376
I don't want help like this.

776
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:01,840
I'm sorry.

777
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,426
I'll try to be more mindful.

778
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:17,480
Hold on. This isn't right.

779
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,650
You're the one who started it!

780
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:24,112
You did all those things to
save my face without asking me.

781
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,448
You let Do-san use your car
and even your place.

782
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,991
You revised my pitch for me

783
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,784
and answered all my questions.

784
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,703
- That's--
- How nosy.

785
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,747
It's too much.

786
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,166
Why tell me not to do it
when you keep doing it?

787
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,917
I want to be nosy, so don't stop me.

788
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,878
You're mad at me now?

789
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,547
If you really don't like it,
ask for help in advance.

790
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,799
Say, "I'm struggling with this.
I need this."

791
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,218
You said it's okay
if you ask for it first.

792
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,431
So if I ask you… What will you do then?

793
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,978
I will help you to the best of my ability.
And I'll be the first one to help you.

794
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,689
Why?

795
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,650
That's…

796
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,197
Because I like how nosy you are.

797
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:12,827
So…

798
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,165
even if I get all nosy,
just put up with it.

799
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,542
You'll grow to love it.

800
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,343
Your one minute's up.

801
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,346
Sorry, go ahead.

802
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,270
Gosh, this is nuts.

803
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,453
INBOX
FROM: SEO DAL-MI

804
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,412
THIS IS THE FINAL VERSION

805
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,831
SORRY, THIS IS THE REAL FINAL VERSION

806
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,381
She sent you so many emails.
What's the proposal for?

807
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,592
It's Samsan Tech's project proposal
for Morning Group.

808
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,010
AI SOLUTION PROPOSAL

809
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,178
Why so many versions?

810
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,307
I have to say, she has a lot of energy.

811
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,354
"Computerized invoicing system,

812
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,731
and inventory management
using image recognition."

813
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,650
It's pretty good.

814
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,110
I know.

815
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,696
I'm worried because it's good.

816
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,951
2STO is doing so well. I was wondering

817
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:38,246
why they were interested in Sand Box.
There was obviously a reason.

818
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,832
A reason? Care to elaborate?

819
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:44,544
The youngsters that come here
are very smart and competent.

820
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,045
You can take them and use them.

821
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,714
"Use them"?

822
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:51,885
I don't think they were selected
so other companies can "use them."

823
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:56,014
You try to pick a fight with me
every time I say something.

824
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,104
Dong-cheon.

825
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,648
The chairman of Morning Group
is putting a TF together.

826
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,650
Find out how much he's done so far.

827
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,614
Look at that woman.

828
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,454
This is bigger than a buffet menu.

829
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,247
Crispy chicken! It looks delicious.

830
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,626
Oh, this chair is so comfy.

831
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:30,048
My gosh, this is so pretty. It's so cute.

832
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,844
Is this brewed coffee?

833
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,681
Kids, I can't believe
you've kept this gem all to yourself.

834
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,976
Bring your mom next time.
She'll love this place.

835
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,189
FINALE ADDICT

836
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,966
WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOUR DREAMS

837
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,135
The person you're trying to reach
is unavailable--

838
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,892
Still not picking up?

839
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,646
No, she's holding out longer
than I expected.

840
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,232
What if she says she wants a divorce?

841
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:32,402
Then I'll let it be.
She signed the prenup,

842
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,821
so she won't get anything
if we get a divorce.

843
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,532
That woman loves money,
so she won't go there.

844
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,911
What's with them these days?
Both In-jae and this woman.

845
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:45,498
They used to wag their tails for my money.
Why suddenly act like wild dogs?

846
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,583
Goodness.

847
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,670
Dad, the tech manager told me
something interesting yesterday.

848
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,548
- What?
- It's about the downsizing project.

849
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,759
He said Samsan Tech submitted a proposal.

850
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,387
You know, that girl. Dal…

851
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,764
Yes, I know. Seo Dal-mi,
In-jae's little sister.

852
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,350
That's right. The tech manager said

853
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,812
their proposal is pretty good.

854
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,440
Whatever, they're still clueless rookies.

855
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,945
When's the meeting?

856
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,534
Nice car.
Why didn't you give us a ride sooner?

857
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:25,163
I hate having other people
ride in my car with me.

858
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,956
It's just this once, okay?

859
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,667
We could've taken the bus.
Why suddenly offer a ride?

860
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,628
You're our CEO.

861
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:35,715
You need to look like a hotshot,
or people will look down on you.

862
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,762
- Get that out of my face.
- Okay.

863
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,229
You too, Mr. Nam. Stand straight and tall.

864
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,273
Be confident and make eye contact.

865
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:56,861
Thank you.

866
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,530
We'll land the project
and become a real hotshot.

867
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:31,729
Gaining an enemy is like losing
100 million won. We need an ally.

868
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,524
- Let's go.
- Okay.

869
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,736
BUSINESS PLAN

870
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:51,207
Hello, sir.
I'm Seo Dal-mi, CEO of Samsan Tech.

871
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,667
I'm CTO Nam Do-san.

872
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,128
We've met before. Good to see you again.

873
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,588
Yes, great to see you again.

874
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,134
Well, I don't know much about technology.

875
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,011
- If you'll excuse me…
- Are you leaving, sir?

876
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,850
Be good to them.
I've been eyeing them since the Hackathon.

877
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,103
The proposal shows how talented you are.

878
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:14,564
- And you both seem so nice.
- Thank you.

879
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,149
Stop by my office after.

880
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,151
Have a good meeting.

881
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,405
Let's all sit down.

882
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,578
So you're In-jae's little sister?

883
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:33,207
- Yes.
- I see. All right.

884
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,586
Since I'm older than In-jae,

885
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,339
I'll consider you my little sister
and talk comfortably.

886
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,478
Dong-cheon, did you look
into Morning Group's project?

887
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:58,608
Yes. They're saying
Morning Group's AI task force

888
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,027
has already been set up,
including the engineers.

889
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,111
Let me see.

890
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,863
They already have a tech team.

891
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,490
Why did they contact Samsan Tech?

892
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,785
Probably for a part-time gig.
Something they can outsource.

893
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,120
What? A part-time gig?

894
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,664
Pardon? 100,000?

895
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:17,376
You want us to collect
100,000 image files?

896
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:22,131
You can buy such data or hire
a part-timer to do the job for you.

897
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:25,468
We're developers.
You can't expect us to collect 100,000--

898
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:28,304
Right, we're here
to propose an AI solution to you,

899
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,056
not to collect data.

900
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,683
Jeez, you guys are frustrating me here.

901
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,520
What is AI's basic function?

902
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,564
Collecting data for machine learning.

903
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,817
That is what I'm asking you to do.

904
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,944
Our development team
will create a solution.

905
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,328
Then why did you ask us
to submit a proposal

906
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,164
instead of hiring part-timers
to collect data?

907
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:57,750
For all 100,000 images?

908
01:03:58,626 --> 01:03:59,836
That will cost too much.

909
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:04,632
The minimum wage has gone up,
so even hiring students can be so costly.

910
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:07,718
Also, students wouldn't know
what kinds of images we'd need.

911
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,346
It's a job for AI experts.

912
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,349
That's crazy.

913
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,810
So they're trying to exploit
high-caliber talent?

914
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,312
- Who'd accept that?
- Many people do.

915
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,732
Start-ups need good references.

916
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:24,902
Many would do whatever it takes
to be able to include

917
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,029
Morning Group's logo
in their company profile.

918
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,240
That's true.

919
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,576
Then the next one will be a bit easier.

920
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,035
I get it, but…

921
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,581
Gosh, seriously. It's so awful.

922
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:41,502
Will Seo Dal-mi agree
to such an awful, exploitative offer?

923
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,681
It'll be a lot of work,
but it's a good opportunity for you.

924
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:56,934
It may look like manual labor,
but it'll be a good experience.

925
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,061
What makes youth so special?

926
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,898
Your passion! We want to buy your passion.

927
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,108
Then…

928
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,695
I guess you don't need our solution.

929
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:10,865
Your solution? Why not?
If it's a good idea, we should use it.

930
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:13,534
You promised to pay 50 million won
for the solution alone.

931
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:16,370
I checked your website,
and it looks pretty bare.

932
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:19,999
You can put our logo on your main page.
"Morning Group's strategic partner."

933
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,126
That's worth a lot more
than 50 million won.

934
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:30,009
Do you know why I chose Samsan Tech
out of all the candidates?

935
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,183
If you chose to follow your mother,
you'd be my daughter now.

936
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,231
You went through a lot because you didn't.

937
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:53,282
It would've been nice if you'd chosen
me like your sister.

938
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:02,541
I always felt bad for you.

939
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,294
Now that I can help you,
I feel a little better…

940
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,805
Shut up.

941
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:26,232
Dal-mi, I can't work on this project.

942
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:27,817
Sorry.

943
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:32,029
That little…

944
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,709
CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE

945
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,004
Do-san! Nam Do-san!

946
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,721
Do-san.

947
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:05,021
Dal-mi.

948
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:08,691
I really tried to suck it up
and just do it,

949
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:11,527
but I can't.

950
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,031
I'm sorry you gained an enemy
because of me,

951
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,283
but this is so wrong.

952
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:22,121
I'll become more influential
than Won Du-jeong.

953
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,165
A hundred million… No.

954
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,461
You lost 100 million won
because of me, so 200 million…

955
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,922
No.

956
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:35,092
I'll bring you ten billion won.

957
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,928
So forget about this project and--

958
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,159
You caught me off guard, Dal-mi.

959
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,622
- Do-san.
- Yes?

960
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:07,917
Let's forget about this project

961
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,252
and work on that thing.

962
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,255
"That thing"?

963
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:16,342
The idea you told us about the other day.

964
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:22,098
I had this idea a few days ago.

965
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,975
Among the solutions
that use our image recognition…

966
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:28,395
How about an app for the visually
impaired? What do you think?

967
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,314
- The visually impaired?
- That's random.

968
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:31,857
- How?
- What?

969
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:35,236
If this is voice-operated
like GPS navigation systems…

970
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:40,825
Pen.

971
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,955
"There is a door 2m ahead."
That's how it'll work.

972
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,376
Why didn't I think of this?

973
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:53,546
I lost my vision for a moment
because of that milk bomb, you know.

974
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:56,132
I felt so lost when that happened.

975
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,218
I tried to imagine what it'd be like.

976
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,871
It makes me feel

977
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:30,040
as though something
really bad has happened.

978
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,626
I'd be devastated.

979
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,755
As if my life will be
completely destroyed.

980
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:39,300
And so scared.

981
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:42,595
But you know,

982
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:45,014
that's

983
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:48,267
not going to help my eyes get better.

984
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:03,991
If their vision can't be restored,

985
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:09,455
how about we try to have our technology
act as their eyes?

986
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:26,513
What do you think?

987
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:30,809
I got goosebumps thinking maybe
this is why I got into image recognition.

988
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,770
Am I the only one? Is it weird?

989
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:55,042
Let's do it. I was very excited
when you told us that idea.

990
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,963
It won't be profitable.

991
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,883
But

992
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:06,011
it'll be fun.

993
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,599
We can only hold out for six months.

994
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:16,105
That also means we're free to do
whatever we want within those six months.

995
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,150
You're reckless.

996
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:23,779
Well, we'll just get lost.

997
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:27,700
"Sail off without a map." Remember?

998
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,722
SPECIAL THANKS TO MOON SE-YUN

999
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,551
- Dal-mi.
- Yes?

1000
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,011
Which Do-san do you like better?

1001
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:55,472
What do you mean?

1002
01:13:56,098 --> 01:14:00,769
The one who used to write you letters
15 years ago

1003
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:04,857
or the one you met again as an adult?

1004
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,358
What kind of question is that?

1005
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:09,069
Why separate the two? It's the same guy.

1006
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,571
I know that.

1007
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:14,074
But if we were to separate the two,

1008
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:17,494
which Do-san would you pick?

1009
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:23,959
Well…

1010
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,588
If I have to pick one…

1011
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:42,436
I'd still pick the one who wrote me
those letters 15 years ago.

1012
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:48,192
FLOWER SHOP

1013
01:14:58,202 --> 01:14:59,786
NUTRIENTS FOR PLANTS

1014
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,664
So the old Do-san?

1015
01:15:03,957 --> 01:15:04,917
Yes.

1016
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,128
Because he's my first love.

1017
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:12,883
I care about him a lot,
and I'm grateful to him.

1018
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:20,390
I WISH YOU SUCCESS

1019
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,809
What about Do-san as you know him now?

1020
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:28,357
The Do-san I know now…

1021
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,321
I'm still getting used to him.

1022
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:37,491
I'll become more influential
than Won Du-jeong.

1023
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:40,035
A hundred million… No.

1024
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:43,497
You lost 100 million won
because of me, so 200 million…

1025
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,332
He's like a different person at times.

1026
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:48,502
- No.
- That makes me a little sad, but…

1027
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:50,045
I'll bring you ten billion won.

1028
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,297
So forget about this project and--

1029
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:56,718
But for some reason,

1030
01:15:58,845 --> 01:16:01,223
those few odd moments here and there
excite me

1031
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,601
and make my heart flutter.

1032
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:11,108
For some people, what's ordinary to us
isn't ordinary at all.

1033
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:13,610
I want our technology to help them.

1034
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:17,406
The more users, the higher the cost.
Who'd invest in this?

1035
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:20,200
It's the same as Do-san's.

1036
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:21,618
My birthday.

1037
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,830
Hand the CCTV footage
over to the legal team.

1038
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:27,624
What if we can't reach an agreement?

1039
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:29,835
You could get hurt.

1040
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:30,877
Do-san.

1041
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:34,631
If the both of you get down on your knees,
then I might drop the charges.

1042
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,341
I'm on the edge of a precipice now.

1043
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:41,430
