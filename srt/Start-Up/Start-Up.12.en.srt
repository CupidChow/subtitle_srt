1
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,570
Is this what you did to my brother?

2
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,322
Did you tell him he wouldn't make it?

3
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,658
- Your brother?
- What are you talking about?

4
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,577
I'm not jumping to conclusions.

5
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,412
This is acqhiring.

6
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,747
"Acqhiring"?

7
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,666
Acq… What?

8
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,877
What is that?

9
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,379
They're not acquiring your company
for its value.

10
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,340
All they want is recruit your engineers.

11
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,719
The moment they sign the deal,

12
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,680
your team will be disbanded.

13
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,225
Disbanded?

14
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,398
SEO DAL-MI

15
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,319
NAM DO-SAN

16
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,358
Well, that's it.

17
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,363
We'll contact the other shareholders
by letter.

18
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,656
Okay.

19
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,034
Welcome to 2STO.

20
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,832
We look forward to being part of it.

THE ACT OF BUYING OUT A COMPANY
PRIMARILY TO RECRUIT ITS TALENT

22
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,728
Grandma, press this to make a video call.

23
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:53,191
San Francisco is 16 hours behind here, so…

24
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,446
Never mind, it's annoying to calculate.
Just ask Yeong-sil.

25
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,407
Yeong-sil, what time is it
in San Francisco now?

26
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,370
The current time in San Francisco, USA
is 6:08 a.m.

27
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,287
Got it?

28
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,582
That's solved, then.
Now, your medications.

29
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,417
These pills are…

30
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,136
Maybe I shouldn't go to the US.

31
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,015
Don't worry about her. You should go.

32
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,810
I'll take good care of her
while you're away.

33
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,979
I'll make sure
her eyesight doesn't get worse.

34
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,731
You're making me even more worried.

35
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,525
Why am I?

36
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,320
Mother, these are your pills, right?

37
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,991
This is for your blood pressure,
and this for your cholesterol levels.

38
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,993
- It's the other way around.
- What?

39
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,415
Well, it's because the text is too small.

40
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,584
- It's so hard to read.
- What are you talking about?

41
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,341
What? Why is the text so small?

42
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,345
Even worse, they all look the same.
I mix them up all the time.

43
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,764
You're right. It's hard
to tell them apart.

44
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,488
What's the weather like in San Francisco
in the winter?

45
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,783
- You'll pack some winter clothes, right?
- Yes.

46
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,703
I think this will do.

47
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,999
Is that girl going to San Francisco
with you?

48
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,834
What's her name again? Seo Dal-mi?

49
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,753
Oh…

50
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,714
Yes.

51
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,426
Is she feeling the same way as you?

52
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,513
I'm not sure. I couldn't ask her.

53
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,808
But I really want to know.

54
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,936
I'm sure she gave you a signal,
but you didn't notice it.

55
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,480
You can be pretty slow.

56
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,400
No, I'm very quick.
All my friends tell me that.

57
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,779
I'm your mom. Who are you trying to fool?

58
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,781
Sorry.

59
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,035
Then

60
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,081
can you tell me
how to notice such a signal?

61
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,464
- I'll explain as quantitatively as I can.
- Okay.

62
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,591
- Your birthday is coming up, right?
- Yes.

63
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,010
If she remembers your birthday,

64
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,638
- your chances are at 30 percent.
- 30 percent.

65
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,765
If she wants to see you that day,
50 percent.

66
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,058
Fifty percent?

67
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:37,188
But I can't. I celebrate my birthday
with Yong-san and Chul-san every year.

68
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,108
If you do that this year,
you're not my son anymore.

69
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,401
Sorry.

70
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,823
If she looks extra pretty that day,

71
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,157
your chances go up to 70 percent.

72
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,450
70 percent.

73
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,994
But she looks pretty every day.

74
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,498
How do I know if she looks extra pretty?

75
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,376
- She looks pretty every day?
- Yes, really.

76
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,254
Every single day.

77
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,756
Every minute, every second.

78
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,262
I didn't know this day would come.

79
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,390
I'll leave the rest to you.

80
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,477
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?
I've got this now.

81
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,481
Do-san, are you up?

82
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:23,901
Is it her?

83
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,028
Yes.

84
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,034
I'm up. It's still too early to go to bed.

85
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,912
On weekdays, I go to bed around 10:30 p.m.
On weekends…

86
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:37,874
Delete it.

87
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,169
- Delete it?
- Yes.

88
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,089
Take off that jacket.

89
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,800
Okay.

90
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,936
No one asked what time you go to bed.

91
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,688
She wants you to call her!

92
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,398
Call her right now.

93
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,025
Okay.

94
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,113
Jeez, you still have a long way to go.

95
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,471
- You were up?
- Yes. What's up?

96
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,972
Check your inbox.

97
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:35,890
My inbox?

98
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:44,774
I was sorting out my grandma's pills,
but it was impossible to tell them apart.

99
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,900
Okay.

100
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,572
So I'm wondering if our NoonGil
could help people identify medications.

101
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,825
Are you saying we should provide
the service to the general public?

102
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,079
Yes. It's the opposite of barrier-free.

103
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,667
Gosh, why didn't I think of that earlier?
That'd expand our user base a lot.

104
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,793
Right?

105
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,712
It gives us a profit model, too.

106
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,839
So? Can you make it work?

107
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,384
I should. I will.

108
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,177
All we need is videos of the pills

109
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,013
and a database
tagged with the names of the pills

110
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,099
as long as there are ontologies for them.

111
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,809
Ontologies?

112
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,852
Ontologies are, for example,

113
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:26,357
descriptions of drugs
in a form that computers can process.

114
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,068
I'm not sure
if 2STO will like this idea, though.

115
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,194
They will.

116
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,614
If they don't, we'll persuade them.

117
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,077
Actually, I've already drafted a proposal
by myself.

118
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,328
Already?

119
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,165
Gosh, you work fast. Really fast.

120
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,502
I'm so thankful to 2STO.

121
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,006
We can finally stop worrying about money
and focus on running our business.

122
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,842
I'm so happy.

123
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:54,760
I know.

124
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,681
I heard that you drive everywhere
in the US.

125
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,058
Should we get cars
as soon as we get there?

126
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,979
It'd be a waste if both of us do.

127
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,940
I'll get a car and drive you around in it.

128
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,819
Wait. Would that be uncomfortable?

129
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,282
No. That'd be great.

130
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,619
What happens to my home buyer
savings account?

131
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,038
Will it be suspended while I'm away?

132
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,290
I've been paying into it
for six years already.

133
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,463
Did you fall asleep?

134
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,468
No. I'm not sleepy yet.

135
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,933
The baseball signed by Park Chan-ho…

136
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,440
- Yes?
- Do you know why I gave it to you?

137
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,697
Dal-mi.

138
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,909
Did you fall asleep?

139
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,802
I used to be so confused

140
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,099
about the word "dream" written on it.

141
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,509
Mother, let me come with you.

142
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,971
Forget it. You'll only get in my way,
so just stay…

143
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,472
Hey.

144
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,934
What's with the get-up?

145
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,936
I thought I should put on a full set.

146
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,732
- See you later.
- See you.

147
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,650
Mom.

148
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,654
"Mom"? Did you just call me "Mom"?

149
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,783
Not "Mother"?

150
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:27,037
Mother, you're wearing it upside down.

151
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,581
What do you mean?

152
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,332
Your mask.

153
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,836
It did feel a bit tight around the nose.

154
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,923
Hey, let me fix that. Give it here.

155
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,301
My goodness. Here.

156
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,804
- It's pretty confusing.
- Stop talking.

157
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,515
- See you.
- See you.

158
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,060
Jeez, why is this so hard?

159
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,668
- Hey, Do-san.
- What a coincidence.

160
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,295
A coincidence?

161
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,006
There's a very good
English conversation class near here,

162
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,760
so I just stopped by for some information.
What a coincidence, really.

163
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,349
There's an English class near here?

164
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,767
Yes, apparently.

165
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,356
I see. I didn't know that.

166
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,358
Are you going to sign up?

167
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,109
Well, I'm thinking about it.

168
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,404
By the way, isn't it your birthday
next Monday?

169
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,489
Thirty percent.

170
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,324
What?

171
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,536
Nothing. Yes, that's right.

172
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,330
- What are you doing that day?
- Nothing much.

173
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,083
You're not doing much on your birthday?
That's not okay.

174
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,627
Should we meet?

175
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,422
Sure.

176
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:06,929
Fifty percent.

177
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,848
Fifty percent.

178
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,685
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

179
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:24,363
ICED VANILLA LATTE 2 FOR 1

180
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,911
- I'll have an iced vanilla latte.
- I'll have that too. It's the best.

181
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,917
Here you go. Two iced vanilla lattes.

182
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,210
Thank you.

183
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,715
Is something wrong?

184
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,300
Why did you get two coffees?

185
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,801
Aren't you here by yourself?

186
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,387
It was two for one.

187
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,224
- I thought I'd give one to someone.
- Can I be that "someone"?

188
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,018
Thanks.

189
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,273
- Don't you usually drink iced Americano?
- Nothing beats a free drink.

190
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,191
- Dal-mi, an iced Americano?
- Yes.

191
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,861
- One iced Americano, please.
- Sure.

192
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,947
Has anyone ever told you
you're a bit slow?

193
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,743
That's exactly what my mom said to me
a few days ago.

194
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,828
- I got goosebumps.
- Gosh, unbelievable.

195
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,414
On this arm, too?

196
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,293
Am I getting sick?

197
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,546
It's like looking
at two cockroaches in love.

198
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,721
Ms. Jung, how about
we only speak English from now on?

199
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,265
- What?
- In Silicon Valley,

200
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,017
we can only use English.

201
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,520
That's a great idea.
We should practice in advance.

202
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,732
By the way, your English pronunciation
is amazing.

203
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,610
I don't see how it'll benefit me.

204
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,904
I'm not interested.

205
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,910
By the way, have you heard anything
from 2STO yet?

206
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,205
No, I don't think so. Why?

207
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,291
Nothing. Never mind.

208
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,466
Wait, you guys go ahead. I'll catch up.

209
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,095
- What?
- Let's go.

210
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,350
I sent you the job advertisement
draft. Have you had a look?

211
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,061
- I will as soon as I'm at the office.
- Good morning.

212
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,984
I was having a good morning
until I saw you.

213
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,152
Congratulations.

214
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,905
I heard 2STO is acquiring your company
for a good price.

215
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,782
Thank you.

216
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,912
Are you not congratulating me?

217
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,373
You know I never say things I don't mean.

218
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,376
From where I stand,
it's nothing to celebrate.

219
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,336
- Are you jealous?
- I'm giving you advice.

220
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,465
Really? To me,
it sounds like you're jealous.

221
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,927
You just want to insist
that I made the wrong choice.

222
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,515
Do you think I'm still bothered
by what happened 15 years ago?

223
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:01,353
Yes. You even stole my fond memory
from 15 years ago.

224
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,898
Fine, I'm sorry.

225
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,067
I give you back
your oh-so-precious memory.

226
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,072
Anyway, when will you stop bothering me
with what happened ages ago?

227
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,408
Looking back only slows you down.

228
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,869
Fix your eyes forward,
and you may still not make it.

229
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,788
Do I still sound like I'm jealous?

230
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,624
Yes.

231
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,587
If you weren't,
you wouldn't raise your voice so much.

232
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,224
All right. You'll find out
whether this is jealousy or advice today.

233
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,434
What do you mean?

234
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,311
Hello, Ms. Seo.

235
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,939
I see you're talking with Ms. Won.

236
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,693
Hello. What's the matter?

237
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,575
The two cockroaches
have been inseparable lately.

238
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,910
Are you back together?

239
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,581
Well, at least about 50 percent.

240
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,540
You seem relaxed.

241
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,752
Aren't you worried about Mr. Han?

242
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,297
I am. I definitely am, but…

243
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:15,177
Then again, once you two go to the US,
things will get sorted out automatically.

244
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,972
Is that why Mr. Han tried to stop us?

245
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,600
He tried to stop us?

246
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,979
He came over and said there was
something wrong with the contract.

247
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,440
Like what?

248
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,944
He said it was an acqhire
and should be put on hold,

249
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,529
but Mr. Kim disregarded him.

250
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,032
He even took away Mr. Han's phone
and yelled at him.

251
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,826
You didn't know?

252
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,009
- What's going to happen?
- This is unbelievable.

253
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,803
- My gosh.
- They had no idea?

254
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,603
What's wrong?

255
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,068
- Do-san.
- Yes?

256
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,910
- Mr. Han, Samsan Tech is screwed.
- What's wrong?

257
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,037
Alex dismissed Ms. Seo and the designer.

258
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,623
He's only taking the three developers
to Silicon Valley.

259
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,176
This is fraud.

260
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,887
You said you'd take the whole team.

261
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,015
But the contract doesn't say that.

262
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,268
You told me to my face
you'd take over the whole team.

263
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,395
Words don't have power.

264
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,575
It is very regrettable.

265
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,827
I tried my best
to persuade the headquarters,

266
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,746
but it was beyond my ability.

267
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,041
But Ms. Seo and Ms. Jung are
at the core of NoonGil.

268
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,920
NoonGil doesn't need any further updates,
so that'll be fine.

269
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,885
I'm very interested
in Samsan Tech's technology.

270
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,137
Could you tell me
your human recognition accuracy rate?

271
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,473
They're both pitching app sizes
and human recognition technology.

272
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,308
Testing them in the same environment

273
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,352
will tell us which one is better.

274
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,108
Come to think of it,

275
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,030
you only asked us technical questions
at Demo Day.

276
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,242
You didn't ask any questions
about our service or vision.

277
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,329
Are you really willing to continue
with NoonGil?

278
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,418
Well, I'm talking to headquarters
about that, too.

279
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,216
Mr. Han was right.

280
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:04,263
Did you really take over our company
to recruit the developers?

281
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,599
Look on the bright side.

282
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,018
All of you have been given
a good deal of money.

283
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,938
You even get to experience
working in Silicon Valley.

284
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,524
When you look at it rationally,
it's all good.

285
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,483
Dal-mi.

286
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,236
I'm canceling this contract.

287
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,655
Forget about the whole thing.

288
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,659
This isn't something
you can decide emotionally.

289
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,995
You've already signed
the contract, haven't you?

290
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,581
We'll return all the money you gave us.
We'll cancel the contract.

291
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,083
Jeez.

292
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,169
That's fine by me,

293
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,632
but according to our contract,
you must pay a penalty.

294
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,218
How much was it?

295
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,762
Double the takeover price.

296
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,931
Double?

297
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,808
Six billion won?

298
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,282
WORKING CONDITIONS

299
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,326
It's bad in there.

300
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,204
What a tragedy right after the takeover.

301
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,706
What about the developers?

302
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,958
They're the only ones
going to Silicon Valley.

303
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,376
The rest are dumped.

304
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,005
Nam Do-san wants to cancel the contract,
but the penalty is double the price.

305
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,299
Ms. Won, you were right.

306
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,509
The takeover was nothing to celebrate.

307
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,347
So? Is this fun?

308
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,225
What? No.

309
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,275
As for developers, let's hire
the freelancers working for us.

310
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,694
We still need to find someone
who'll manage sales.

311
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,863
Someone who knows strategic planning.

312
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,997
I was about to call you, actually.

313
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,167
- You're breaking up Samsan Tech?
- Yes.

314
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,294
- Ditching NoonGil?
- Yes.

315
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,173
Any unnecessary services
and personnel should go.

316
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,342
What did they say?

317
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,471
I'm not trying to pick a fight here,
but they don't seem to understand.

318
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,433
They're insisting on canceling
the contract. They're way too emotional.

319
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,227
The contract has already been signed.

320
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,479
It's too late for them
to change their minds.

321
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,023
Yes, I know that.

322
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,151
This time, I can let it slide.

323
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,403
But if things continue to go wrong,

324
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,741
they'll end up getting hurt a lot.
You understand that, right?

325
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:38,083
So please, please help them
understand the situation.

326
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,710
You're their mentor after all.

327
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,213
See you around.

328
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,405
You said Mr. Han was wrong.

329
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,575
You said he was talking bullshit.
Now, look what happened!

330
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,120
Everything he said was right.

331
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,794
What are you talking about?

332
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,298
Why did you do that?

333
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,843
Because it's Mr. Han.

334
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,182
- Hey!
- He always dumps on us!

335
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,935
"Not going to work. Not good enough."
All he does is put us down.

336
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,188
How much longer
do we have to be his puppets?

337
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,106
What is he, a god?

338
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,357
He's our mentor!

339
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,359
Maybe to you, he's a nice person.

340
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,779
But you have no idea
what kind of person he is.

341
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,031
That jerk…

342
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,369
killed my brother.

343
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,256
Just like with us,

344
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,509
he nitpicked about everything
my brother's company did,

345
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,303
driving all the investors away.

346
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,556
When funding ran out,
his company closed down.

347
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,141
And my brother…

348
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,774
He's doing the same thing now.
He's driving our investors away.

349
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,070
Don't listen to him
unless you want to end up like my brother.

350
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,371
Mr. Han.

351
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,791
Mr. Han.

352
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,211
What is this…

353
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,923
all about?

354
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,426
I was giving my opinion as an investor.

355
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,095
If it sounded like nitpicking,

356
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,179
that's a shame.

357
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,597
"That's a shame"?

358
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,059
- A person died. How could you?
- Kim Yong-san!

359
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,105
If I hadn't pointed out the problems
with your brother's business,

360
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,357
innocent LPs would have taken the hit.

361
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,025
LP: FUND INVESTOR

362
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,027
Telling the hard truth.

363
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:12,988
That's my job.

364
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,740
The hard truth?

365
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,747
Then explain this situation to us.

366
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,376
Put emotions aside
and be as harsh as you want.

367
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,767
The contract has been made.
There's no point in blaming each other.

368
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,772
Blame yourselves for not reviewing
the contract thoroughly.

369
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,400
So just accept it.

370
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,123
Why…

371
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,293
did this happen?

372
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,754
2STO didn't pay you three billion won

373
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:15,342
for the profit potential of NoonGil,
but for the accuracy of the solution.

374
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,179
- Stop.
- That's why you two are being fired--

375
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,722
I said, stop!

376
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,393
And the rest are staying.

377
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,527
Did you have to say that?
Are you trying to hurt us on purpose?

378
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,572
If this hurts you,
you shouldn't have started a business.

379
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,153
Ms. Jung, could there be a way for us

380
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,322
to cancel the contract
without paying a penalty?

381
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,991
We could file a suit,

382
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,286
but it's a long shot.

383
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,796
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,967
We should have listened to Mr. Han.

385
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,972
I'm really sorry.

386
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,875
SAMSAN TECH

387
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:22,320
The deal itself isn't bad at all.

388
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,739
Except for the team being disbanded,

389
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,866
the terms are pretty good.

390
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,084
Give up on NoonGil.

391
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,920
Even if this hadn't happened,

392
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,881
it wouldn't have lasted long.

393
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,511
Use your excellent technology
for something more lucrative.

394
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,769
Why waste caviar in a stew?

395
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,983
Make money first, and then
with that money, you can…

396
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,067
We need your help.

397
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,028
Jeez.

398
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,615
You want my help
after beating me up like this?

399
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,494
Does this make sense to you?

400
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,634
Ms. Choi asked me

401
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,597
to keep it secret from you, but…

402
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,487
Spit it out already.

403
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,826
NoonGil…

404
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,875
I started it for Dal-mi's grandma.

405
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,971
Her eyesight is getting really bad.

406
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,523
She's going to go blind soon.

407
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,290
Please help us.

408
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,271
CHEONG-MYEONG CORN DOG

409
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,112
How much did we sell?

410
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:16,202
That's strange.
It can't be 34 million won, can it?

411
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,204
A minute ago, you said it was 1,900 won.

412
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,498
At least it's more this time.

413
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,880
Carry those oil cans to the crosswalk.
I'll do the calculation.

414
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,382
Okay, Mother.

415
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,857
Now, where did it go?

416
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,319
RECEIPT

417
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,904
RECEIPT

418
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:10,298
Yeong-sil, can you read this for me?

419
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,966
Sure, one second.

420
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,429
The more users, the higher the cost.
Who'd invest in this?

421
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,514
One Chyeong-myeong corn dog, 1,000 won.

422
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,184
One potato corn dog, 1,500 won.

423
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,103
Okay.

424
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,023
Why?

425
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:31,486
- Do you think we can't?
- Such a future is never going to come.

426
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,240
Two cheese corn dogs, 3,000 won.

427
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,493
One potato corn dog, 1,500 won.

428
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,369
All right.

429
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,749
Done.

430
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,461
Good job, Yeong-sil.

431
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,798
Let's see here.

432
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,219
What?

433
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,139
What are you doing here at this hour?

434
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,683
- Are you closed?
- Yes, of course.

435
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,104
What happened to your face?

436
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,814
Did someone hit you?

437
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:11,776
It's not like that. I had a little fight.

438
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,069
You had a fight?

439
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,657
What kind of jerk picks a fight
with Good Boy?

440
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,120
It was my fault.

441
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,081
I doubt it was your fault, Good Boy.

442
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,875
Stop calling me that.

443
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,002
I'm not a good boy.

444
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,838
What do you mean?

445
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,841
I've never met anyone as good as you.

446
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,801
No, I'm not.

447
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,470
I'm not a good boy.

448
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,473
Ms. Choi, you completely misjudged me.

449
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:44,559
Good Boy.

450
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,188
I'm a jerk who hurts other people
with harsh words.

451
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,233
I pretend to be the smartest in the world,

452
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,154
but in reality, I'm just an idiot
who knows nothing.

453
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,758
I'm not a good boy.

454
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,349
Ji-pyeong.

455
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,483
What's wrong?

456
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,152
What happened?

457
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,739
Ms. Choi.

458
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,158
Ms. Choi.

459
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,453
What's wrong?

460
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,247
What happened?

461
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,919
What on earth is going on?

462
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,420
Ms. Choi, I'm sorry.

463
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,549
Ms. Choi, I'm sorry.

464
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,887
I'm so sorry.

465
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,806
Ms. Choi.

466
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,100
It's okay.

467
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:13,105
Ms. Choi, I'm sorry. Ms. Choi.

468
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,190
There, there.

469
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,381
Why are you still here?

470
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,927
I just have a lot on my mind.

471
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,977
The café is closed.

472
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,648
Do you want this? I haven't touched it.

473
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,653
An iced vanilla latte, right?
Let's share it.

474
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,988
What?

475
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,200
Oh, okay.

476
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,123
Do you want to cancel the contract too
even if you have to file a suit?

477
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,709
- Yes.
- Why?

478
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,337
This is a great opportunity for you.

479
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,423
Silicon Valley has been your dream.

480
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,926
But I don't want to go there
unless we all go together.

481
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,513
What about you?

482
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,058
Are you willing to file a suit?

483
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:36,188
No. I used to be a lawyer.

484
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,025
Lawsuits are exhausting.

485
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,903
The fight is long and hard,
and nothing is guaranteed.

486
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,782
I hated it,
so I left it all behind and came here.

487
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,744
I'm not going back.

488
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,413
Aren't you upset?

489
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,541
I'm furious.

490
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,168
So am I.

491
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,212
It'll keep me up at night for a while.

492
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,382
But sleep deprivation
will only last a few months.

493
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,135
A lawsuit may take years.

494
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,744
Oh, my… Mr. Han.

495
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,499
I had something to talk about
with your grandma,

496
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,043
so I stopped by.

497
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,630
What happened to your face?

498
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,591
I fell.

499
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,678
It doesn't look like it.

500
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,641
Well…

501
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,062
I'm sorry about earlier.

502
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,442
I shouldn't have said those things.

503
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:14,286
No. We needed to hear that.

504
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,591
Mr. Han.

505
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,345
Yes?

506
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,597
Aren't you hungry?

507
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,353
How much is it?

508
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,896
- It's 20,000 won
- 20,000 won?

509
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,232
- It was delicious.
- See you.

510
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,442
- Thank you.
- Bye.

511
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,238
We're having noodles again.

512
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,704
It's the only place that's still open.

513
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:01,500
- Should we order some pork cartilage?
- No, it's fine.

514
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,506
Mr. Han.

515
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,800
Yes?

516
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,094
What should we do now?

517
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,930
What do you want to hear?

518
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,475
I want facts.

519
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,811
Not a future filled with hopes and dreams

520
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,063
that will never come.

521
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,193
I want reality.

522
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,696
I want your honest and objective opinion.

523
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,074
Well…

524
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,452
Am I asking too much?

525
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,749
No, not at all. I'm just worried
it'll be too much for you to bear.

526
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,710
And I feel sorry.

527
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,256
Mr. Han.

528
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,676
You keep saying you're sorry.

529
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:57,389
But I never thought anything
you've said was too much.

530
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,808
You've never offended me. Not even once.

531
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,145
- Not once?
- No, not ever.

532
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,441
Maybe twice.

533
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,695
Three times.

534
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,659
Fine, I did get hurt.
But it was less than ten times.

535
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,495
But I accepted it right after.

536
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,414
I knew I was pathetic.

537
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,377
You're pretty resilient, Ms. Seo.

538
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,047
Yes, I am resilient.

539
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,924
So please tell me.

540
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,134
What do we do now?

541
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:40,307
There's no way you can win against 2STO
about this matter.

542
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,395
They're a lot bigger,
and the contract is legitimate.

543
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,572
Then what do we do?

544
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,036
If you can't beat them, join them.

545
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,498
That's what you do.

546
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,953
- Thank you.
- Next, please.

547
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,289
- Hello.
- Hello.

548
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,750
- What's your name?
- It's Nam Do-san.

549
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,210
Nam Do-san?

550
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,378
What grade are you in?

551
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,255
He's supposed to be in middle school,

552
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,675
but he's already in college.
He skipped grades.

553
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,884
You skipped grades?

554
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,637
He won the gold medal
at the Mathematical Olympiad.

555
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,971
The youngest winner ever.

556
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,515
Oh, my. Aren't you a genius?

557
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,850
He's a math genius,
and you're a baseball genius.

558
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,269
Exactly. Fist bump.

559
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,979
You're one smart boy.

560
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,900
What's your dream?

561
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,277
With my friends, I want to…

562
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,948
A Fields Medal and a Nobel Prize.

563
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,994
My dream is to win
a Fields Medal and a Nobel Prize.

564
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,415
Father, what's a Fields Medal, anyway?

565
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,668
There's this thing.

566
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,340
Just a second.

567
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,134
Let's see here.

568
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,513
- Can we take a picture together?
- Sure. Come here.

569
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,181
Hey, kid.

570
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,224
Look at this.

571
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,062
Okay?

572
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,481
Good. All right.

573
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,276
Do-san, look at the camera.
Hold up the ball. There you go.

574
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,444
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

575
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,196
Clench your fist.
Nam Do-san, you can do this!

576
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,906
Nam Do-san, you can do this!

577
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,744
The baseball signed by Park Chan-ho…

578
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,915
Do you know why I gave it to you?

579
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,878
Dal-mi.

580
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,088
Did you fall asleep?

581
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,304
I used to be so confused

582
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,348
about the word "dream" written on it.

583
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,853
So I was lost for a long time.

584
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,356
But

585
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,277
the moment I first saw you,

586
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,575
my dream became clear.

587
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,624
Thank you for that.

588
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:11,620
A GUIDE TO START-UP LAWSUITS

589
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,125
LEARN ABOUT YOUR INVESTORS

590
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,635
Dal-mi, what are you doing here?

591
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,971
Do-san, what happened to your face?

592
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,059
Well… I fell.

593
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:01,688
You, too?

594
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:03,940
Me, too?

595
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:06,860
Nothing.

596
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,821
So you two had a fight.

597
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,993
Anyway, why did you come here?

598
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,706
It's your birthday today. Did you forget?

599
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,291
Oh…

600
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,169
It slipped my mind.

601
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,588
That's fair.

602
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,801
A lot's happened the past few days.

603
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:33,929
Dal-mi.

604
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,934
Don't worry about a thing. I did
some research all night last night.

605
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,604
In a book called
A Guide to Start-up Lawsuits,

606
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,565
I found a case quite similar to ours.

607
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,531
Here. The Rona Tech case is
the most similar to ours.

608
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,199
Right after the takeover--

609
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,368
Wow, the weather is fantastic.

610
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,495
It really is.

611
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,289
Right after the takeover,

612
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:04,668
the corporate attorney joined the board
and dismissed the other members.

613
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:08,380
- It's an American case, but…
- The next stop is Sand Box.

614
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,509
Let's not get off.

615
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,095
What about work?

616
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:19,725
It's your birthday today.
Don't you remember we promised to meet?

617
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,853
That was before the 2STO thing.
The situation's changed.

618
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,187
Everyone must be waiting.

619
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,315
No one's coming to work today.

620
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,070
- Put on a smile.
- What?

621
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,638
STUDIO JAKDU

622
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,446
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

623
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,947
Congratulations.

624
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,867
This is the first time
I've made money from my shares.

625
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:23,330
Thanks, but I'm not really
in the mood to celebrate.

626
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,332
You really are a great man.

627
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,335
Look how chill you are after hitting
a three-billion-won jackpot!

628
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,295
I thought we did,

629
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,422
but after paying all debts, taxes,

630
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,884
and salaries for three years,
there's barely anything left.

631
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:39,930
Then again, you've been running
on debt all this time, right?

632
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:43,141
Anyway, what can I help you with?
Just say the word.

633
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,559
Well…

634
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,980
Can I borrow that?

635
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,566
- That?
- Yes.

636
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,325
What are we doing here?

637
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:03,495
The French restaurant here
is supposed to be really good.

638
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,997
I made a reservation. Let's go.

639
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,763
We've never eaten
at a place like this before.

640
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,098
I know. It's nice.

641
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,934
About the American case I talked about…

642
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:29,145
They used the media as well.
Why don't we use the same strategy?

643
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,523
The reporter who wrote
favorably about NoonGil…

644
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,275
What was his name? Choi…

645
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,192
Do-san.

646
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,779
When did you find out
that you were good at coding?

647
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,574
What?

648
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,452
I think I was about 13.

649
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,330
Oh, Reporter Choi Yang-won.
That's his name.

650
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,124
How did you find out you were good?

651
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:54,379
Well… We were solving a maze.

652
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:57,716
While the other kids were looking for
a way out, I built an algorithm.

653
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,053
How could a 13-year-old kid do that?

654
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,892
Coding is a language
I'm most comfortable with.

655
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,644
So algorithms were easier for me.

656
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,647
Dal-mi, but right now,
let's focus on the takeover.

657
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,525
What are the chances of being born
a genius like you?

658
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,571
One in 100,000?

659
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,197
Dal-mi.

660
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,744
And the chances of such a genius
being recognized

661
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,662
by someone as competent as Alex?

662
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,291
One in ten million?

663
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,589
It's nearly impossible.

664
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,259
Most geniuses fail to beat the odds
and are never discovered.

665
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,055
You were one of them until recently.

666
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,198
It might even be harder
than winning the lottery.

667
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,368
You shouldn't miss it.

668
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:10,747
Chances?

669
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:16,044
The chances of any two people meeting
are equal.

670
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,172
It's always equally incredible.

671
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,926
Also, I'm worthless at everything
except coding.

672
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,346
My language skills are pathetic.
I don't even know metaphors.

673
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,556
I suck at art, music, and sports.

674
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,559
I can't tell a dessert fork
from a salad fork.

675
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,852
I'm no genius.

676
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,105
I'm a moron.

677
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,065
Do you understand?

678
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,109
Do-san.

679
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,653
This place suffocates me.
I'll be waiting outside.

680
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,713
Do-san, don't you get
what I'm trying to tell you?

681
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,589
I do. I get it.

682
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,842
Would you go if it were you?

683
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,302
Give up on NoonGil and the team?

684
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,432
I would. I'd definitely go.

685
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,269
If I were as competent as you, I'd go.

686
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,812
I don't want to.

687
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,898
I like it here. It's all I want.

688
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:22,527
Sand Box, the steaming rooftop apartment…
That's where I want to be.

689
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,029
Hey!

690
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,325
You're making me miserable.

691
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,703
Please just go!

692
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,294
I feel humiliated.

693
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,254
It sucks.

694
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,759
You were chosen by that big shot,
and I wasn't.

695
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,219
He wants you, but not me.

696
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,431
Do I really have to say this myself?

697
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,309
I didn't want to.

698
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,812
That's why I tried to end it nicely
at that fancy place.

699
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,066
Couldn't you just play along?

700
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:04,652
Dal-mi, please.

701
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,489
Do-san.

702
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,912
You're not the Do-san from the letters.

703
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,511
And I'm not your dream.

704
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,523
Are you breaking up with me?

705
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,611
We shouldn't be unreasonable
and hold on to an illusion.

706
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,117
We should accept reality.

707
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,495
We're not kids anymore.

708
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:59,457
We can't dream forever, can we?

709
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,672
I have to go.

710
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,675
It's my birthday today.

711
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:12,887
I know.

712
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,015
Did you come just to tell me this?

713
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,228
Yes.

714
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:30,947
From the beginning?

715
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,577
Was this your plan from the beginning?

716
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:45,837
Yes.

717
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:46,541
SAMSAN TECH

718
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,967
- Hey!
- What?

719
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,594
Hey.

720
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,430
Yong-san, are you okay?

721
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,765
Yes, I'm fine.

722
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,560
You idiot.

723
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,396
Why would you
throw your life away over this?

724
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,065
How am I supposed to live if you're gone?

725
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,986
You can't do this to me.

726
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,239
Not you, too!

727
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,451
What are you talking about?
No one's dying here.

728
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,037
No one's dying.

729
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:30,168
What? Then why…

730
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:34,464
I dropped my coffee.
That's why I was looking down.

731
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,686
Did something happen?

732
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,699
So you two broke up?

733
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,543
I'm sorry. You must hate me right now.

734
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,795
Don't overreact.

735
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,089
It's not your fault.

736
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,261
Yong-san.

737
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,848
When you quit your job

738
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,352
and joined us, you said

739
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,356
you were sick of being a cog in a machine.

740
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:35,817
That's why you quit.

741
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,530
At this rate, we'll go back
to being a cog.

742
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:42,949
I know that.

743
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,618
Is that how much
money and career means to you?

744
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,831
Enough to undo your decision?

745
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,376
Do you think I want to join 2STO

746
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,587
because of money and my career?

747
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,005
Then what's the reason?

748
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:03,219
Do-san. I don't want that jerk
to remember us as a failure.

749
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,139
That jerk? You mean Mr. Han?

750
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:10,685
Don't you remember
what he told us right here?

751
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,855
Among the start-ups
that I didn't invest in,

752
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,232
zero succeeded.

753
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,484
None of them.

754
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:22,113
I don't want to lose the latter record.

755
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,407
The record he was talking about

756
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,409
includes my brother.

757
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,037
That's when I

758
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:33,541
made up my mind.

759
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:35,251
I WANT TO GET MY REVENGE

760
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:38,880
To enter Sand Box where Mr. Han is.

761
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,258
And smash that personal record of his

762
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,218
that he was so proud of.

763
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,600
And this is

764
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,146
the moment.

765
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,065
It's not for money.

766
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,569
It's for my brother.

767
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,364
So please, Do-san.

768
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:10,161
Let's not be remembered as a failure.

769
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,080
Okay?

770
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,613
Is everyone in support
of Ms. Won's resignation?

771
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,949
- Yes.
- Yes, we are.

772
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:51,285
Then all here is in support,
and there are no objections.

773
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:10,972
Come in.

774
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,815
Ms. Won. What brings you here?

775
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,486
I have something to tell you.

776
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:38,833
Gosh.

777
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,962
You're up early.

778
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,297
Did you stay up all night?

779
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:48,467
Grandma.

780
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,931
You said I was a cosmos flower, right?

781
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:56,893
Yes.

782
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,813
Fall is coming.

783
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:06,569
But I'm falling before I get to bloom.

784
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:09,614
Dal-mi.

785
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,493
Will I bloom next year?

786
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,665
- We could give this to the developers.
- Okay.

787
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,002
What are you doing?

788
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:08,923
You haven't heard?
We're hiring more people.

789
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:13,052
Are you taking over this office?

790
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,889
- Yes.
- At least wait until we move out.

791
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,140
We're still here.

792
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,476
Go. Get out.

793
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:21,852
Leave us alone.

794
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,871
I guess this is it, then.

795
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,043
Ms. Jung.

796
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:51,173
Can we keep in touch?

797
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:57,388
I'm not sure. I don't see why we should.

798
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,683
Right.

799
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:04,520
Good luck.

800
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,026
Take care.

801
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,153
You too.

802
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,917
Did you guys take the group photo?

803
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:28,753
No.

804
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,555
When is Ms. Seo coming to get her stuff?

805
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:16,550
Oh, hello.

806
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:24,183
I heard that you're the girl on the swing.

807
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,685
How did you know that?

808
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,437
Ms. Won told me.

809
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:32,066
That she's not the girl from the logo,

810
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,609
but you are.

811
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,195
She did?

812
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:44,120
So you asked your father
to spread sand under the swing?

813
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:49,083
Did my sister tell you that, too?

814
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:52,378
No. I heard it

815
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,589
directly from your father.

816
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:57,925
My father?

817
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:01,804
I loved that story so much
for some reason.

818
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,934
So much that I started this place.

819
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,026
Dal-mi.

820
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:21,115
He wanted to teach his daughter
how to swing

821
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,576
but didn't want her to get hurt.

822
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:28,497
I could somehow relate to that.

823
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,417
But it turns out,

824
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:35,546
it's much harder to convey
the way I feel than I expected.

825
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:41,427
Ms. Seo,
you like fried chicken, don't you?

826
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,763
Yes, a lot.

827
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,599
How did you know that?

828
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:48,809
That day,

829
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,646
he said that before leaving.

830
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,273
Well… Ms. Yoon.

831
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:58,110
Do you know any nice chicken place
around here?

832
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:00,779
After winning the contract,

833
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:05,326
he must have wanted to buy you
some good fried chicken.

834
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,789
Hey.

835
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:16,712
Why are you crying? You're making me sad.

836
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:21,884
I'm not crying. It's just… Chicken.

837
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:25,054
I want to have fried chicken.

838
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,767
That's easy. I'll get some Coke, too.

839
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:34,313
It doesn't cost much anyway.
I can afford that much.

840
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,149
So you can tell me anytime.

841
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:48,202
Thank you

842
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,082
for telling me. I appreciate it.

Ms. Jung, do you still have
trouble falling asleep?

846
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:17,333
I'm sending you a video that I made.
I hope it helps.

847
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,084
Watch it when you can't sleep.

848
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,295
Hello, Ms. Jung.

849
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:26,508
Reciting these numbers
usually helps me fall asleep.

850
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:31,513
I hope it works for you, too.

851
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:39,730

Yes, I am resilient.

862
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:55,806
So please tell me.

863
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:57,224
What do we do now?

864
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:01,061
If you can't beat them, join them.

865
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,773
That's what you do.

866
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:44,646
I apologize for the mess that we made.

867
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,568
Then are we a team now?

868
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:51,612
Yes.

869
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:54,156
Wait.

870
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:58,035
Actually, I'm here to ask you for a favor.

871
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:01,246
You're not the first person
to say that today.

872
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:04,374
Let's head inside.

873
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:25,479
Have a seat.

874
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:34,363
I'm pretty sure you two are here
to ask for the same thing.

875
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:38,659
It's about NoonGil, right?

876
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:41,286
Yes.

877
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:55,050
What programs did you use
at your previous job?

878
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,887
- Do you have any questions?
- Did you usually…

01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,182
Well…

888
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,143
Can I have an iced vanilla latte?

889
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:12,646
I'm afraid we don't have that.

890
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,482
You don't, right?

891
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:18,485
That was stupid. Of course, you don't.

892
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:22,364
I'll just have some juice.

893
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:41,591
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

894
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:43,510
What do you think?

895
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:48,140
I decided on the developers but am not
sure about the strategic planning manager.

896
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,892
Should we try putting up a new job ad?

897
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:52,394
Let's do that.

898

Hello. I'm Seo Dal-mi.

Seriously?

907
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:54,331
Then tell me

908
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:56,583
why you want to work at my company.

909
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:01,004

SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK CHAN-HO

911
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:23,420
I have to go.

912
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:26,923
It's my birthday today.

913
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,303
I know.

914
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:35,432
Did you come just to tell me this?

915
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:39,477
Yes.

916
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:49,779
From the beginning?

917
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,784
Was this your plan from the beginning?

918
01:21:58,163 --> 01:21:59,164
Yes.

919
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:39,287
To Do-san.

920
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,375
Have you ever wandered on purpose?

921
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,671
Today, I wandered aimlessly on purpose.

922
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:04,729
Have you ever let yourself get soaked
even though you had an umbrella?

923
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,441
That's what I did today.

924
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:13,446
It was a sweltering day,

925
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,533
and the rain totally cooled me down.

926
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,835
After walking for 30 minutes like that,

927
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:31,965
the rain stopped,

928
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:37,887
and an unbelievably beautiful scene
unfolded before my eyes.

929
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,518
I saw a huge rainbow.

930
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:50,483
It looked as though
it'd grant me any wish.

931
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:55,363
Then it suddenly hit me.

932
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:04,706
It's actually nice
to wander aimlessly every once in a while.

933
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,253
From time to time,

934
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:14,883
it'd be wonderful
to sail off without a map.

935
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,581
I've changed in the last three years.

936
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:47,832
I can do this.

937
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:50,960
Have you seen Chul-san's Vlog?

938
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:53,254
Sometimes Do-san appears in it.

939
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:57,092
Three years is a long time. It's long
enough for relationships to change.

940
01:24:57,175 --> 01:25:00,053
I should. It's been a while
since we had such a long vacation.

941
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:03,556
Do I need your permission
to meet Dal-mi, Director Han?

942
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,141
I think I have the right.

943
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:07,811
Our solution has been
attacked by a ransomware.

944
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:10,480
It's me. Do-san.

945
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:17,695
