00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,529
EPISODE 9

2
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,048
His handwriting looks
exactly like Do-san's.

3
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,218
Yes, it's the same as Do-san's.

4
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:34,719
My birthday.

5
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,390
The same handwriting

6
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,477
and the same birthday?

7
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,606
How?

8
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,776
Once again,

9
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,656
the wind was turning into a storm.

10
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,410
Just like that day 15 years ago.

11
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,005
Do-san! Nam Do-san!

12
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,214
Yes, I'm coming.

13
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,600
- Look! My son is here!
- My gosh.

14
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,686
- You smarty-pants.
- Come and eat.

15
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,606
Hey, about the Mathematical Olympiad…

16
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,025
- Was it for middle school kids?
- No, high school.

17
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,902
See? I was right.

18
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,070
My gosh, that is so impressive.

19
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,448
- Who do you take after?
- Does he have a tutor?

20
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,742
Come on.
You know that we can't afford one.

21
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,368
He takes after me. Don't you remember?

22
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,121
I used to be so fast on the abacus.

23
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,372
165? No problem.

24
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,083
It runs in the blood.

25
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,794
Like father, like son!
I envy you, Seong-hwan!

26
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,298
Just use your hands and eat off the bone.

27
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,841
Yes, that's it.

28
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,260
- He'll become even smarter.
- My goodness.

29
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:45,475
Back then, I had solved
all the questions except for just one.

30
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,437
I used to solve
that type of question very easily,

31
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,440
but I struggled with it that day.

32
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,360
At that moment,

33
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,489
a gust of wind suddenly
blew in from somewhere.

34
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,990
15TH MATHEMATICAL OLYMPIAD TEST

35
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,410
PROVE THAT P(N) = Q(N)

36
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,745
And that one line

37
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,875
from the solution caught my eye.

38
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,423
I thought that wind

39
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,426
was a blessing.

40
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,934
But that one line.

41
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,187
Because I saw that one line,

42
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,023
- I forgot the fact that I had solved
- Smile!

43
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,901
nine questions on my own.

44
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,779
GOLD MEDAL NAM DO-SAN

45
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,197
Why the heck are you crying?

46
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,492
You lost to a kid. Aren't you embarrassed?

47
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,538
My gosh, I understand why she's upset.

48
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,872
That poor boy is crying.

49
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,708
The medal felt so heavy.

50
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,501
Why yell at him in front of everyone?

51
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,836
So I ended up…

52
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,385
You can have this. I don't need it.

53
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,303
What?

54
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,140
Why give away your medal

55
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,100
of all things?

56
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,937
Our boy never gets greedy.
He's so compassionate.

57
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,605
He's always so giving.

58
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,774
That wasn't why I gave it away.

59
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,194
I didn't deserve the medal.

60
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,744
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

61
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,634
That gust of wind
in the exam room that day

62
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,057
was not a blessing.

63
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,101
GOLD MEDAL NAM DO-SAN

64
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,312
What is the problem? Tell us.

65
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,897
Why would you drop out?

66
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,983
You got into college
six years before your peers, so why?

67
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,033
Tell us. Why did you do that?

68
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,702
Do-san.

69
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,289
Later on,

70
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,459
that wind turned into a scary storm

71
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,797
that destroyed my self-esteem.

72
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,841
It's just for an hour.

73
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,719
Please pretend
to be the person in the letters.

74
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,889
It's so pretty.

75
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,892
The luck that came with the wind.

76
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,271
I seized the luck.

77
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,940
Give this to Ms. Seo.

78
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,151
- Why do you have this?
- I found it while cleaning the car.

79
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,695
And once again…

80
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,661
We'll have two iced Americanos.

81
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,539
What kind though?

82
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,543
I want this one.

83
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,921
- That one? The orange one?
- Yes.

84
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,923
- I'll take this.
- The orange one.

85
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,007
Sure.

86
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,431
Here.

87
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,184
I looked everywhere for this.

88
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,811
Where'd you find it?

89
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,524
- In the office.
- Oh, the office.

90
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,283
Hey, Do-san.

91
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,578
Yes?

92
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,247
There's something I want to ask you.

93
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,959
What is it?

94
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,383
Just like that day 15 years ago,

95
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,345
I was falling apart, slowly but surely.

96
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,811
Don't you think this coffee
goes so well with this cake?

97
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,524
Yes, it really does.

98
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:21,792
CAN BE GOOD OR BAD DEPENDING ON
RISK FACTORS THAT COME WITH AN INVESTMENT

99
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,357
What's with her face?

100
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,108
It keeps changing every second.

101
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,111
She's responding
to the reviews on NoonGil.

102
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,780
THANK YOU

103
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,200
A good review, I guess.

104
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,914
That's a bad one. Now entering
keyboard warrior mode.

105
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,542
Look at that. She'll break the keyboard.
Goodness.

106
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,420
I guess our CEO cares a great deal
about reputation.

107
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,804
Excuse me. Can I ask you a question?

108
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,182
Is this Injae Company's office?

109
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,518
No, their office is just down the hallway.

110
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,602
I'll show you.

111
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,937
Oh, thank you.

112
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,735
He's holding a carton of eggs.

113
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,737
What?

114
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,042
What brings a loser like you
to our amazing office?

115
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,379
You have a visitor.

116
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,214
This is it.

117
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,051
Who is Ms. Won In-jae, the CEO?

118
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,553
Can't you tell?

119
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:59,098
Everyone is working very hard

120
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:03,477
except for this lady over here,
who's doing nothing. Right here.

121
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,234
I'm Won In-jae. How can I…

122
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,113
You! You're the one
who's trying to get all of us fired!

123
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,866
- Please calm down, sir.
- Let go. I said, let go!

124
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,744
You need a lesson!

125
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,665
- Hold on, sir!
- Let go!

126
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,293
- Hold on.
- Who do you think you are?

127
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,129
- Stop him!
- Calm down, sir!

128
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:35,176
How dare you! Who are you to get us fired?

129
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,594
Hey!

130
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,848
Dal-mi, are you all right?

131
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,934
Yes, I'm okay.

132
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,356
Hey, are you okay? Are you hurt?

133
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,192
I'm okay.

134
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,819
- Ms. Won, are you okay?
- Are you hurt?

135
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,307
How dare you get us fired?

136
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,811
Who do you think you are?

137
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,897
- I won't give up! I'll be back!
- God…

138
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,566
- This is nuts.
- I know.

139
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,736
Let go of me!

140
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,447
What was that about?

141
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,450
He works
for Haun Engineering and Construction.

142
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,078
He's about to be laid off
because of Injae Company's

143
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,663
unmanned security system.

144
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,208
Who cares about money
when you have no compassion?

145
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,962
Who cares about compassion?
It won't make you money.

146
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,677
Why are they so serious?

147
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,097
He's very rude.
Is he a hotshot or something?

148
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,890
Yes, I'd say he is.

149
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,892
He even has
an exclusive resort membership.

150
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,770
So what? He forgot why he
started this in the first place.

151
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,480
That's my type.

152
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,399
I like rich, arrogant guys.

153
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,860
I wonder which resort it is.

154
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,155
A resort membership? Who doesn't have one?

155
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,575
I own a vacation home.

156
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,827
- Oh, that place!
- With a private beach.

157
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,580
Really? I'm surprised.

158
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,625
I told you that my family
has a maesaengi farm.

159
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,712
We built a nice hut
to scare off the ducks,

160
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,755
but the beach view from the hut is…

161
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,634
Kota Kinabalu?

162
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,304
Santorini? Forget it.

163
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,890
They are no match for it.

164
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,059
You can see the most beautiful

165
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,854
sunset in the whole wide world.

166
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,483
Oh, right. Now's the perfect time
to go there.

167
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,235
It'd be nice to go for a drive together…

168
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,321
Hey, where are you going?

169
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,072
I'm not making it up!

170
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,949
Guys, you tell her.

171
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,535
- Wait.
- You can even dig clams on the mudflat.

172
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,496
The view is spectacular, for real.

173
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,873
From temperature to humidity,
everything's perfect.

174
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,334
Excuse me. Who are you?

175
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,044
I'm Choi Yang-won.

176
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,130
CHOI YANG-WON

177
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,966
- You're a reporter.
- That's right.

178
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,486
Hey, Dal-mi.

179
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,280
Hold that thought. I'll go first.

180
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,658
I don't want any misunderstanding.

181
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,995
I'd appreciate it if you didn't read
too much into what I did earlier.

182
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,958
- What you did earlier?
- Yes, it was a reflex.

183
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,294
I would've done the same thing
even if it were someone else.

184
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,339
I have exceptionally strong
protective instincts.

185
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,466
I'm selfless to the bone.

186
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,844
My friends say I should run for office,
but I don't care about politics--

187
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,434
So just forget about it, okay?

188
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,812
Okay.

189
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,858
That's it?
Weren't you going to say something?

190
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,027
No, nothing.

191
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,113
You were going to say something.

192
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,288
You have a tail.

193
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,456
A tail?

194
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,547
Damn it.

195
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,890
- What's that?
- You scared me.

196
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,726
The Demo Day is coming up, you know.

197
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,978
I've pulled some data.

198
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,814
DEMO DAY: WHEN START-UPS CAN PRESENT THEIR
PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS MODELS TO INVESTORS

199
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,109
I heard 2STO has its eye on a team
in the 12th residency program.

200
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,445
Rumor has it that you want them
in Silicon Valley.

201
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:05,988
Is it true?

202
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,950
Go on and spread that rumor, please.

203
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,286
Come on. I know you have
a specific team in mind.

204
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,370
Which team is it?

205
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,041
A team with a vision, of course.

206
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,293
A vision?

207
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,420
Which one is it?

208
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,923
A profitable one?

209
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,300
Or one with more users?

210
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,137
Obviously, one that will bring us
a ton of money.

211
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,317
- You came together?
- This doesn't mean anything.

212
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,694
- We ran into each other.
- I wish we hadn't.

213
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,904
- Right.
- Yes.

214
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,201
Ms. Seo, you have a meeting
with Mr. Han, right?

215
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,703
- Yes.
- Wait in the meeting room.

216
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,789
- He'll be here shortly.
- Okay.

217
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,625
- Ms. Won, please come with me.
- Sure.

218
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,803
I heard that you were attacked.

219
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,138
Yes, but I'm okay.

220
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,600
Someone from Haun Engineering
and Construction, right?

221
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,853
Are you working on a project with them?

222
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,815
Yes, Jeonghan Bank
put us in touch with them.

223
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:26,360
They wanted
an unmanned security system using AI.

224
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,487
Yes, I heard.

225
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,700
And I hear that the security guards
are protesting at the moment?

226
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,118
Yes.

227
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,620
We did see that coming,
but we didn't think

228
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,372
they'd cause a scene here

229
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,624
and attack us, a mere solution provider.

230
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,965
Do you think they were merely
causing a "scene"?

231
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:50,968
Pardon?

232
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:58,392
You see, I've never been worried
about you or your projects so far.

233
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,894
However, your choice of word
concerns me a little.

234
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,940
If it wasn't a scene, what was it?

235
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,817
I'd call it…

236
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,111
a risk.

237
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,197
- Because it's dangerous?
- No.

238
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,660
A risk means a possibility of loss.

239
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,328
It's different from danger.

240
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,625
You should be well aware
of the difference by now.

241
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,010
I noticed that
you've been responding to every review

242
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,595
and arguing with hate commenters.

243
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:38,932
Well, some of them
are just too aggressive.

244
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,061
One called NoonGil a hot mess
for draining battery life.

245
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,938
There are many other expressions.

246
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,357
Such as, "room for improvement"
and "disappointed."

247
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,402
Why call it a hot mess?

248
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,197
Way to discourage the developers.

249
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,622
Amateurs react to VoC emotionally,

250
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,416
whereas pros respond to it based on data.

251
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,588
Are you saying I'm an amateur?

252
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,506
Yes.

253
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,926
If I were you, I'd be just as focused
on new users as new customers.

254
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,303
Aren't they the same thing?

255
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,890
Normally, yes. But not for NoonGil.

256
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,143
NoonGil doesn't profit from its users.

257
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,979
NoonGil's customers
are the wealthy who sympathize

258
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,606
with what the business stands for.

259
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,234
At the moment, you only have
one customer, Morning Group.

260
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,406
You need to separate the revenue model
from the business model.

261
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,452
And to draw in new customers,
you have to focus on marketing and PR.

262
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,289
Think about which direction you'll take
for the service's objectives.

263
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,458
Then you can work
on attracting new customers.

264
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,626
For PR…

265
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,088
What? Do I have something on my face?

266
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,216
No.

267
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,470
Utilize the media as much as possible.

268
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,389
Consistently advertise your service

269
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,851
through interviews and newsworthy events
to attract many customers.

270
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,995
I've changed a lot.

271
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,539
I don't really remember
what happened 15 years ago.

272
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,667
No, actually…
I don't even want to remember that time.

273
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,419
I wish

274
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,591
you hadn't known me back then.

275
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,304
- Why?
- Because I was a total loser back then.

276
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,765
You always thought highly of me,
but I wasn't like that.

277
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,978
- You're a genius.
- Indeed.

278
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,860
Just a moment.

279
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,201
I tried increasing the battery efficiency.

280
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,455
If there are any other comments
that make you angry, just tell me.

281
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,081
I'll take care of them.

282
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,418
Okay.

283
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,721
Good morning.

284
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,266
Ms. Won, did you see the news?

285
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,101
The news? About what?

286
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,646
As soon as the news broke out
that Haun was working

287
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,232
with Injae Company,
the company that developed

288
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,235
an AI-based
security manpower reduction solution,

289
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,778
Haun's security guards…

290
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,988
If it wasn't a scene, what was it?

291
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,114
I'd call it…

292
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,450
a risk.

293
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,619
About 100
of the company's security guards…

294
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,663
They're ruining it
when we haven't even started.

295
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,206
…are on strike at the moment.

296
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,582
- Haun will
- He ended up covering it.

297
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,210
- review a secondary plan.
- Do you know that reporter?

298
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,546
Yes. He's Choi Yang-won, a YGN reporter.

299
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,798
I have his business card.

300
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,388
CHOI YANG-WON

301
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,307
He wrote an article about Samsan Tech.

302
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,979
I heard Morning Group
chose Samsan Tech's NoonGil

303
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,356
as its social contribution project
this year.

304
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,652
There is this proverb.

305
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,863
Sir? Do you mind looking at me
while talking instead of the camera?

306
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,990
Oh, sorry.

307
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,290
There is this proverb.

308
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,626
"A fly on a horse's tail
can travel thousands of miles."

309
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,421
What can I do? The young developers
want to ride on my tail.

310
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,548
I should give them the support they need.

311
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,841
That's why I chose them.

312
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,636
Funding NoonGil gave me a lot of joy.

313
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,181
Samsan Tech's being mentioned
on TV again. Amazing!

314
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,684
I'd like to thank Ms. Seo Dal-mi,

315
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,312
the CEO of Samsan Tech,
for this great opportunity.

316
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,689
- Who's Seo Dal-mi?
- Morning Group

317
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,065
- What?
- wishes to partake…

318
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,692
She's the CEO of Samsan Tech.

319
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,611
- Why is she the CEO?
- We're also interested

320
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,072
- What about Do-san?
- in AI and bio projects.

321
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,450
- Hasn't Do-san
- We've put together a task force,

322
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,618
- told you?
- so we can focus on such projects.

323
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,746
- About what?
- As a strategic partner of…

324
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,589
- Hello?
- Hey, where are you?

325
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,923
Me?

326
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,176
I took Dal-mi home.
I'm on my way home now.

327
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,428
- What's up?
- Don't come home now.

328
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,682
The threat level's been raised to red.
Sleep somewhere else.

329
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,434
Why?

330
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,020
Did you not tell your parents
that Dal-mi is the CEO?

331
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,440
Anyway, don't come home tonight. Okay?

332
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,608
I have to go.

333
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,076
Why did Chairman Won do that interview
without telling us?

334
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,244
That's not important now.

335
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,331
Why didn't you tell your dad about Dal-mi?

336
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,791
Who signed the agreement?

337
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,877
I did it with my dad's seal which I stole.

338
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,505
You're nuts. I can't believe you did that.

339
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,591
That's considered forgery.
Do you want to go to jail?

340
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,843
I guess he was more scared
of his dad than jail.

341
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,764
I'll tell him everything
when I get home later.

342
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,474
You're so dead.

343
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,810
That's why I'm drinking now.

344
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,271
I don't think I can deal with that sober.

345
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,233
What will you tell him?

346
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,277
You should rehearse
what you're going to say. We'll help you.

347
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,322
Okay.

348
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,329
I'm sorry I lied to you, Dad.

349
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,915
I'm not good enough to be a CEO,

350
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,043
yet I acted like I was
and fooled you for too long.

351
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,795
"I bet she lured you

352
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,798
into handing over the CEO position
to her." What if he says that?

353
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,716
No, Dad.

354
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,385
I was always

355
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,139
a good-for-nothing,

356
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,892
and bluffing about starting a business.

357
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,895
I was wrong.

358
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,439
I'm sorry I'm such a loser.

359
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,150
You're being ridiculous.

360
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,776
If you're a loser, what are we?

361
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,154
- Shitheads?
- My point exactly.

362
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,698
You won a coding competition,
for God's sake.

363
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,659
But you know, Dad…

364
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,245
Because I was wrong,

365
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,835
I stumbled upon fireworks.

366
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,256
Fireworks? That's so random.

367
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,094
I made a wrong turn

368
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,059
and stumbled upon fireworks,

369
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,651
but it looked so cool.

370
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,800
Why did you do it?

371
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,515
I wonder why, too.

372
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,103
Why did I do it?

373
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,441
Why did you lie?

374
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,781
At first,

375
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,745
I did it because I liked seeing you smile.

376
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,418
Then what about now?

377
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,507
I didn't want you to cry.

378
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,637
I didn't want you to cry…

379
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,933
like you're doing now.

380
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,772
This is crazy.

381
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,238
What do I do?

382
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,848
Hey, Do-san. Get up.

383
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,727
Why did you drink so much?

384
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,645
Do-san, wake up.

385
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,817
What do we do? Where should we take him?

386
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,154
Let's call Ms. Seo.

387
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,823
What?

388
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,502
- Where? Here?
- Yes.

389
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,589
Right here.

390
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,008
What happened to him?

391
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,926
I was with him earlier.

392
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,181
Right, he drank a little after that.

393
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,434
"A little"? He's wasted.

394
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,269
Did something happen?

395
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,771
Ms. Seo.

396
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,483
Can Do-san stay at your place tonight?

397
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,109
What?

398
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,944
If he goes home like this,

399
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,239
his father will beat the crap out of him.

400
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,866
We'll have to plan his funeral.

401
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,452
If we take him,
his father will raid our place.

402
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,372
Can you help him out?

403
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,794
Well, I'm not sure if…

404
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,421
It'll be hard, right?

405
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,467
Yes, it will be. But I'll try.

406
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,053
Hey! Come on, Ms. Seo!

407
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,930
We'll take you guys home, of course.

408
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,141
Hey, call a taxi. I got this, okay?

409
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,060
Hey, Do-san. Time to go home!

410
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,520
- No…
- All right. One, two!

411
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,398
- Can you give me a hand? One, two!
- My gosh.

412
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,318
- There we go. We're good now.
- Goodness.

413
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,529
We're all good now. It's okay.

414
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,572
Don't worry. I got this.

415
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,785
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine!

416
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,413
I can do this alone. I got this.

417
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,043
What's going on?

418
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:33,837
Mr. Han.

419
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,381
Oh, what a useless coincidence.

420
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,508
Did you hail a cab? Hey!

421
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,468
Hey!

422
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,803
I'll actually kill you.

423
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,139
Don't you dare.

424
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,433
- I got goosebumps.
- What's happening?

425
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,394
Sir! Can you please give me a hand?

426
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,020
What's he saying?

427
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,655
What?

428
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,117
The fireworks…
I'm sorry I made a wrong turn.

429
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,202
I'm sorry.

430
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,416
What's with him?

431
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,627
Why don't I take him to my place?
He'll be more comfortable there and…

432
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,464
No, I'll just take him to my place.

433
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,090
Please drop us off there.

434
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:23,970
I'm sorry…

435
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,055
- Gosh.
- Do-san, are you okay?

436
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,891
Hey, what's wrong?

437
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,726
- Hey.
- Do-san.

438
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,894
- Do-san?
- Hey, Do-san.

439
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,437
- I'm about to throw up.
- Do-san.

440
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,940
- Do-san. Ms. Seo? Can you please…
- Yes, hold on.

441
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,817
- Hey, no!
- Come here.

442
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,694
- Do-san, I'm driving.
- Hey, come here.

443
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,071
Yes, you can lean on me.

444
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,993
- Are you all right?
- Did he throw up?

445
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,163
No, not yet.

446
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,248
"Not yet"?

447
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,170
Why did he drink so much?

448
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,297
My question exactly.

449
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,050
This fool doesn't even know
how much he can drink.

450
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,512
- He must be heavy.
- Not at all. He's light as a feather.

451
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,432
He's a weakling. I think he has
text neck and osteoporosis.

452
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,725
Where should I take him?

453
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,604
- This way. Come this way.
- This way?

454
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,565
Gosh, he's so light.
My featherlight brother.

455
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,404
Oh, boy.

456
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,294
Gosh, my arm, legs, shoulders and back.

457
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,965
What? You said he's light as a feather.

458
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,508
Goodness.

459
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,260
A huge rain-soaked feather!

460
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,638
No, forget that.
He's like a rain-soaked elephant.

461
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,474
Elephant… No, elephants are cute.

462
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,435
What else is there?
Something heavy and annoying…

463
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,646
Something annoying as hell.

464
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,774
Gosh, my blood sugar has hit rock bottom.

465
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:05,864
Oh, dear. It looks like Do-san
had an upset stomach.

466
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,781
What?

467
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,706
Jeez, when did this happen?

468
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,083
I guess he puked quietly.

469
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,878
He's so courteous. My gosh.

470
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,421
- "Courteous"?
- Yes.

471
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,089
Did you say "courteous"?

472
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,637
What about this or that
looks "courteous" to you?

473
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,806
Quiet! Dal-mi will hear you.

474
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,932
Come out and wash up.

475
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,669
Well… This is the only T-shirt
that would fit me, right?

476
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,548
I have this, too. Would you prefer this?

477
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,510
No, it's okay.

478
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,472
I'll wash this before I return it to you.

479
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,892
Gosh, don't bother. Just keep it.

480
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,852
Okay.

481
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,189
Well, I'll get going then.

482
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,359
You said your blood sugar
has hit rock bottom. Eat with us.

483
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,737
Have dinner with us
if you haven't eaten yet.

484
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,409
Then I'll just stay for dinner.

485
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,827
Here, this is yours.

486
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,957
- Let's eat.
- It looks delicious.

487
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,293
- Eat up.
- Thank you.

488
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,796
Oh my.

489
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,981
Why am I here?

490
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,276
I was with my buddies
until a few minutes ago.

491
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,987
Your buddies ditched you,

492
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,197
so Ms. Seo and I brought you here.

493
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,994
Hey, come join us. You must be hungry.

494
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,538
Scoot over.

495
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,126
Here you go.

496
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,754
You know, I…

497
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:28,840
That soup is mine.

498
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,468
I ate dried pollack and whelks,
so I don't know why I'm hungry again.

499
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,430
Because you threw up everything.

500
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,390
Right here.

501
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,060
No, on me.

502
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,273
You should get changed, too.

503
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,401
Thanks.

504
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,194
Is your stomach okay?

505
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,030
- Do you have a headache?
- No, I'm fine.

506
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,907
I'm sorry.

507
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,325
It must've been hard for you.

508
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,036
No, it's okay.

509
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,496
Do you want to sleep here tonight?

510
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,504
- Can I?
- You nuthead.

511
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:13,301
Yes, of course.
It'll take a while for you to sober up.

512
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,594
Just sleep here tonight.

513
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,763
Then can I…

514
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,685
sleep here, too?

515
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,812
- Sorry?
- What?

516
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,147
What?

517
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,648
Why?

518
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,862
I'd be worried if I left Do-san alone here

519
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,074
because we're very tight.

520
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,119
Or you can come with me, you know.

521
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,835
Thank you for the food.

522
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,810
Jeez.

523
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,980
Gosh, seriously.

524
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:14,487
You have a king-size bed in your apartment
that overlooks the Han River.

525
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,531
Why would you sleep here?

526
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,993
Look who's talking. Why sleep here
when you have your home sweet home?

527
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,747
Rich jerks are greedier.

528
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,584
What? Did you just call me a jerk?

529
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,628
What did you just say?

530
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,005
Oh, my apologies.

531
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,133
Let me rephrase that. "Rich men."

532
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,719
Rich men are greedier, I suppose.

533
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,805
Why are you calling me greedy?
What did I do?

534
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,057
In some sense,
you have more to offer than I do.

535
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,226
What? What do I have that you don't?

536
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,561
Lots! So many things.

537
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,649
You're 4cm taller than me.

538
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,736
I have text neck.

539
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,574
You're younger than me.

540
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,868
You're in your 20s,
whereas I'm in my mid 30s.

541
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,787
You own a river-view apartment
and that crazy expensive watch.

542
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,415
You have…

543
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,504
Jeez, what am I doing right now?

544
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,092
Fine! Good for you that you have nothing.

545
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,182
That's right. I have nothing.
That one thing is all I've got.

546
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,518
I have only one thing
and that's everything to me.

547
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,979
You're taking it away from me?

548
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,942
Then let's change.

549
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,988
Take my river-view apartment
and that expensive watch

550
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,657
in exchange for that one thing.

551
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,328
No, thank you.

552
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,633
- Jeez.
- Gosh, seriously.

553
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,442
It's hot in here.

554
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,669
It's hot.

555
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,013
Get me some water.

556
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,988
NOONGIL 4.4 STARS

557
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,659
LEE SO-YEONG

558
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:53,456
I visited Gangju with my daughter

559
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,583
who is losing her vision.

560
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:01,839
NoonGil told her that there were
countless beautiful sunflowers

561
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,674
in full bloom along the road.

562
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,512
I just wish she could have seen it
when she still had her vision.

563
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,558
Then it would've been easier
for her to fully understand

564
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,269
what NoonGil meant
by the word, "beautiful."

565
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,314
I was always too busy with life

566
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:22,610
to show her such beauty
when she could see it,

567
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,236
and I really regret it.

568
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:29,241
This ended up being
a pointless venting session, not a review.

569
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,922
You wrote that it's pointless.

570
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:47,134
But to me,
it's more valuable than anything.

571
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,555
You want her to see
and remember more beauty.

572
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,557
I can totally relate to it.

573
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:58,437
I'd also like to gift the person I love

574
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,399
with the most beautiful scenery

575
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,403
so that I won't regret not doing so
in the future.

576
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:36,809
- Where's Do-san?
- What?

577
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,854
He's not here.
His bag and clothes are also gone.

578
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,314
He left already? Without saying bye?

579
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,275
No way.

580
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,734
DO-SAN

581
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,653
Goodness.

582
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,656
Hello?

583
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,199
It's Sunday. What are you up to?

584
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,411
Nothing much. Hey, where are you?

585
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,705
Then let me take you out on a date.
Ms. Choi too.

586
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,707
Now? A date?

587
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,002
- My grandma, too?
- Me?

588
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,769
What is this?

589
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,564
- Did you buy a car?
- I will, later on.

590
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,691
This is a rental. Hop in.

591
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,529
- It's an electric car.
- Goodness.

592
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,616
- Where are you going?
- Somewhere far.

593
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,660
- What? Come again?
- I said, somewhere far.

594
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,622
But where?

595
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,874
Why? Will you follow us again?
This is our date.

596
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,420
"Date"?

597
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,689
Jeez.

598
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,827
Are you sure I can tag along
if this is a date?

599
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,413
Of course, you have to come with us.

600
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,040
Where are you taking us?

601
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,670
A place that's more beautiful
than Santorini.

602
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,798
- There's a place like that in Korea?
- Yes, there is.

603
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,178
- Look! The ocean!
- My gosh! The beach!

604
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,722
Santorini!

605
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,683
- This is amazing!
- Better than Santorini.

606
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,394
- Grandma!
- My gosh!

607
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,770
Grandma!

608
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,233
Wow, it's so beautiful here.

609
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,110
It's really nice here, isn't it?

610
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,945
Oh, my.

611
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,657
Gosh, she's so excited.

612
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,121
Grandma!

613
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,623
- Grandma!
- Don't run. Okay, all right.

614
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,669
Don't be amazed just yet.

615
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,504
It's so beautiful at sundown.

616
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,965
The view from here is just breathtaking.

617
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,718
With that island and everything.
This view right here.

618
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,803
- Hey, Do-san.
- Yes?

619
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:21,140
Can you go borrow a hoe
and a pair of rubber boots from someone?

620
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,099
Pardon?

621
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,935
- Why do you need them?
- You'll see.

622
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,146
- Go on.
- Okay.

623
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,148
- Shall I go?
- No, I got it.

624
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,691
- Hurry.
- Okay.

625
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,069
It's so nice here.

626
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,919
My gosh, this is a big one. Let's see.

627
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,343
This isn't right.

628
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,595
- Ms. Choi!
- Yes?

629
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:05,017
Look over there, please!
The sea looks so beautiful from over here!

630
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,353
Beautiful, my foot!

631
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,858
It's not like the scenery
will give you food to eat!

632
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,860
Gosh, that silly goose.

633
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,239
Oh, my!
This will last us for at least a week.

634
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,995
This is not why I brought her here.

635
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,956
You must've read my comment.

636
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,125
What?

637
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,003
Well, it's…

638
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,424
Thanks.

639
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,851
Isn't the sea so beautiful?

640
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,231
Yes, it really is.

641
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,818
Oh, another one! This is a big one.

642
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,578
Yeong-sil.

643
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,248
What do you see now?

644
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,836
A man and a woman who seem to be a couple
are standing on a beautiful beach.

645
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:55,169
Do-san wanted you to see this, Grandma.

646
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,129
Yes.

647
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,798
I'm grateful.

648
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,641
Grandma, you asked me a little while ago
which one I liked better.

649
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:14,730
The Do-san from 15 years ago
or the Do-san I know now.

650
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:16,815
Right, I did.

651
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,818
Could they be two different people?

652
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,074
What are you talking about?

653
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,288
Well, I just keep getting a weird feeling.

654
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,000
I'm being weird, aren't I?

655
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,211
Yes, you are.

656
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,047
You know that's nonsense.

657
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,549
And you like Do-san.

658
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:55,854
Yes, I do.

659
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,148
I like him so much that…

660
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,111
Grandma.

661
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,447
It scares me a little.

662
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:10,285
I have many questions for him,
but I'm scared to ask.

663
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,354
It's ready! Come on over!

664
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,147
- Okay!
- Let's eat!

665
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,191
- Let's go, Grandma.
- All right.

666
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,658
- The best grilled pork belly ever!
- Really?

667
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:11,930
Hey, do you know if any convenience store
in the area needs a part-timer?

668
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:16,059
I've been walking around
but didn't see a single hiring sign.

669
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,521
Who puts up a sign like that these days?
Everyone uses the job search app.

670
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,565
Job search app?

671
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,402
You don't know what an app is?
A mobile application.

672
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,613
Oh, that.

673
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:00,771
Hey.

674
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,690
It looks like we made a wrong turn.

675
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,737
I'll be right back.

676
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,420
The road ends here.

677
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,297
DO NOT ENTER
END OF ROAD

678
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,507
We should go back.

679
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,094
What are you looking at?

680
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,556
Wow, I've never seen so many stars
in the sky.

681
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,600
Me, too.

682
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,728
It's good that we got lost.

683
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,817
- Dal-mi.
- Yes?

684
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,111
Shall we wander around more?

685
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,279
I guess you don't want to go home.

686
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,699
No, it's not that.

687
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,244
Did you fight with your parents?

688
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,328
No.

689
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,039
How could I fight with them?

690
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,333
It's just… You know.

691
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,085
Just what?

692
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,296
I'm just

693
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,842
not a good son.

694
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,430
I feel bad because
I'm always letting them down.

695
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,352
I think I get it.

696
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,939
You want to be as bright as the moon

697
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:30,694
but feel as though you're just a star
as tiny as a dust particle. Is that it?

698
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,489
Yes.

699
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,075
- Dal-mi.
- Yes?

700
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,661
Strictly speaking,
that wasn't a good analogy.

701
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,622
Those are fixed stars,
whereas the moon is a natural satellite.

702
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,875
The stars may look like
tiny dust particles,

703
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,711
but most of them are much larger
than the moon.

704
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,671
Both mass and energy-wise.

705
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,013
This is why people talk shit
about engineering majors.

706
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,347
Yes, this is why.

707
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,018
I think it's a good analogy.

708
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,776
You're that star over there, the one
that looks like a tiny dust particle.

709
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,779
A fixed star

710
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,740
that is much bigger than the moon.

711
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,497
So don't run away.

712
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:28,752
I'm sure your parents
will realize it eventually, like I did.

713
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,724
Dal-mi.

714
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,726
Yes?

715
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,189
I'm sorry.

716
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,024
For what?

717
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,112
Just…

718
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,824
For making a wrong turn.

719
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,000
Seriously, there are so many stars.

720
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,920
And that's huge.

721
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,898
Those clams will last us
for good ten days…

722
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,817
No. For a month, I'd say.

723
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,946
Hey, don't underestimate yourself.
I'd say a week at the most.

724
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:38,864
Gosh.

725
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,367
- Grandma, what is this?
- What?

726
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,288
Oh, that. I made a poster
to find a part-timer.

727
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,956
No one looks at it these days.

728
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,499
I'll post it on the app for you.

729
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,835
It's okay. You don't need to do that.

730
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,129
Many still don't know
how to use stuff like that.

731
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,172
I'll just hire one of those people.

732
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,133
TEMP AGENCY

733
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:14,941
Hey, did Do-san get home safely?

734
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,235
I'm sure he did.

735
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,446
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

736
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,942
He really hasn't called you, right?
I hope you're not lying to me.

737
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,569
No, he really hasn't.
Why would I lie to you?

738
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,655
Why isn't he picking up?

739
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,211
- You punk!
- Dad.

740
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,713
Hey, what is wrong with you?

741
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,091
I gave you money
so you could start your business.

742
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,802
Do you think I gave you
my hard-earned money

743
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,679
so some random girl could take over?

744
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,556
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- Let go of him, honey.

745
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,892
What are you doing? This is embarrassing.

746
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,727
Did that girl lure you

747
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,854
into handing over the CEO title?

748
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,983
No, Dad. She's a lot more qualified
for the title than I am.

749
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,276
I'm really a nobody, Dad.

750
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,737
I'm a good-for-nothing
bluffing about starting a business.

751
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:43,697
I'm sorry.

752
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,783
You're not a good-for-nothing.

753
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,535
You were the youngest person

754
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,329
to win a gold medal
at the Mathematical Olympiad!

755
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,500
Dad…

756
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,836
I cheated that day.

757
00:54:58,712 --> 00:54:59,754
I'm sorry.

758
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,471
What?

759
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,267
A good-for-nothing
has been acting like a genius.

760
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,601
I'm sorry, Dad.

761
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:18,148
I feel like I always disappoint you
no matter how hard I try

762
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,774
and how well I do.

763
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:23,278
This has been killing me inside, Dad.

764
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:37,959
I'm sorry.

765
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,544
I'm sorry.

766
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,803
THE 15TH MATHEMATICAL OLYMPIAD
GOLD MEDAL NAM DO-SAN

767
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,872
Is Dad okay?

768
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,583
He's not okay, of course.

769
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,212
But he'll be fine.

770
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,714
Don't worry.

771
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,388
Do you feel better now?

772
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,557
Yes.

773
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:17,475
I mean…

774
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,812
Yes, I do feel better now.

775
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,106
I'm sorry I feel this way.

776
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,985
You owe me an apology for something else,

777
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,904
not that.

778
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,325
Hearing about you through someone else…

779
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,245
That's really hurtful.

780
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,250
Not being the first to hear about it
hurts me more

781
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,669
than finding out about what you did.

782
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:50,383
Is Cheon-ho more important to you
than your own parents?

783
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,473
I'm sorry.

784
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,393
Yes, you really should be.

785
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,254
Is she ashamed of something?
Why is she hiding?

786
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,396
Are you being like this

787
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,274
because you have feelings for Dal-mi?

788
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,693
No.

789
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,953
I do. I told you just now.

790
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,750
- I sit like this
- Yes, show me.

791
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,419
- And? Do you do both?
- and knit the knit stitch.

792
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,340
Why did you do that?

793
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:15,802
Why did you go to great lengths to
help us even if it meant you had to lie?

794
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:17,387
Well, that's…

795
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,349
Ms. Seo, I'm--

796
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,433
Dal-mi!

797
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,109
But where?

798
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,403
Why? Will you follow us again?
This is our date.

799
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,471
An ad. Someone put up a hiring poster!

800
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,558
Ask and you shall receive! No, hey!

801
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,686
What's your problem, lady?

802
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,815
Sorry, I'm in a bit of a bind right now.

803
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,903
What a load of crap.
I'm the one in a bind.

804
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,489
Never judge a book by its cover.

805
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:21,034
I'm really struggling financially
right now.

806
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,578
You're young, so you have many options.

807
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:27,332
What's that thing called?
Yes, you can use the job search app.

808
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,128
Thank goodness.

809
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,132

HELPER WANTED

810
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,259
FREE CORN DOGS
CONTACT OWNER CHOI WON-DEOK

811
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,429
Mother? Why is she looking for help?

812
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:45,892
CHEONG-MYEONG CORN DOG

813
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,150
No, I can't work with my mother-in-law.

814
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,861
I'm too old for that.

815
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,615
This is still better
than dealing with that jerk.

816
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,994
Gosh, still…

817
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,080
I'm too ashamed to even face her.

818
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,259
And you like Do-san.

819
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,970
Yes, I do. I like him so much that…

820
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,809
Grandma. It scares me a little.

821
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:32,689
I have many questions for him,
but I'm scared to ask.

822
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:39,779
- Are you worried about something?
- What?

823
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,908
Hey, what brings you by?

824
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,577
- I'm here to return this.
- What?

825
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,584
I told you to just keep it.

826
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,045
You know I don't like to do that.

827
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,715
It's still bright and early.
Why were you sighing nonstop?

828
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:00,925
I'm just a little worried.

829
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,721
Looks like Dal-mi is suspicious.

830
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:07,432
What? Of what?

831
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,601
She's suspicious of both you and Do-san.

832
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,563
Gosh, what do we do?

833
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,819
Right, that letter!

834
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,740
Maybe I should go find it.

835
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,951
- What letter?
- You know,

836
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:30,371
she was looking for Do-san a while back
to meet In-jae.

837
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,540
Don't you remember

838
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:36,127
the cherry tree in front of
my old corn dog shop in Seonju?

839
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,005
She said she left her letter there.

840
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:42,800
I should find that letter
and give it to Do-san.

841
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:45,386
If he shows her the letter,

842
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,971
she'll stop doubting him, right?

843
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:49,265
Seonju is far from here.
That's such a hassle.

844
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,558
Gosh, forget it.

845
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:54,020
Hey, I'll be back in no time
if I take the express bus.

846
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,190
But why must you do all that?

847
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:06,491
This way, I can make sure
both Do-san and Dal-mi won't be hurt.

848
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,035
Then what about me?

849
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,370
What about you?

850
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,623
I don't want you to do that.

851
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:16,876
I don't want to lie to her anymore.

852
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:21,172
- What are you talking about?
- I'm out.

853
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,300
I'll go tell Dal-mi that Do-san is a fake

854
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,010
and apologize for lying to her.

855
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,432
But you told me the other day
that you didn't want to disappoint her--

856
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:32,725
Yes, that's right.

857
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,646
But I hate this even more.

858
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:40,233
- Ji-pyeong.
- I'm sorry, Ms. Choi.

859
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,319
I lied to you that day.

860
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,573
I actually…

861
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:50,952
have feelings for Dal-mi.

862
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,192
There's something I want to ask you.

863
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:26,737
Hearing about you through someone else…
That's really hurtful.

864
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,081
DAL-MI

865
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,512
DAL-MI

866
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:03,941
You can't do this.

867
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,904
- Why can't I?
- Must you ask?

868
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,033
You know that Dal-mi and Do-san
are happy in their relationship.

869
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,743
But I'm not!

870
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,287
I keep thinking about her,

871
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,165
I want her and it feels so unfair.

872
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,667
What the heck am I doing?

873
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,297
Why didn't you tell me back then?

874
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,634
You can't tell her now.

875
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,929
- You can't do that to them.
- Why not?

876
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,349
Why can't it be me?

877
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,518
- Ji-pyeong.
- Yes, you're right.

878
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,523
This is wrong. None of this
should've happened in the first place.

879
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,569
I wish I had never met you.

880
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,365
I was doing just fine.

881
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,367
I didn't lack anything!

882
01:05:57,328 --> 01:06:00,039
You got me with that nickname, Good Boy,

883
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,292
and I got too nosy for my own good.

884
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:08,881
I acted like an idiot,
just like back then.

885
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:12,760
Ji-pyeong!

886
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,278
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

887
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,530
- Let's go.
- Okay.

888
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:45,209
It's raining? The weather forecast
didn't say it'd rain today.

889
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:46,794
Right?

890
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:51,507
Who knew it'd start raining
all of a sudden? Gosh.

891
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:04,478
Shall we run over there together?

892
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,314
I can't let you get soaked in the rain.

893
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,621
Hey, come on. Let's run.

894
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,123
- No, get lost.
- Come on!

895
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,791
- Get lost!
- Come on. Run!

896
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:30,671
Damn it!

897
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:44,935
Is it raining outside?

898
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,189
Yes, it's pouring right now.

899
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,274
Like a torrential downpour.

900
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,860
The weather forecast didn't say it'd rain.

901
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,321
- Where's Do-san?
- Well…

902
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:59,825
I'm sure he'll be here soon.
Freezing and soaked in the rain like us.

903
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,622
Ms. Jung, lend me your umbrella.

904
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,752
Is that really how she wants to be?

905
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,928
Dry yourselves. You'll catch a cold.

906
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:28,729
- Does this mean…
- A green light?

907
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,984
I'm taking this home.

908
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,407
Hello?

909
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:43,452
Hey, Yong-san. It's me.
Are you with Dal-mi right now?

910
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:45,955
She already left with an umbrella.

911
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:48,249
- Where did she go?
- To the subway station

912
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:50,417
so you won't get soaked in the rain.

913
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,507
Okay, thanks. See you.

914
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:11,564
SAND BOX ENTRANCE STATION

915
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:36,755
Ji-pyeong!

916
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,184
I'm sorry.

917
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:50,853
I'm…

918
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,773
I'm really sorry.

919
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,029
I'm sorry I got angry at you.

920
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,782
I'll go to Seonju.

921
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:48,244
I'll find Dal-mi's letter

922
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:50,746
and give it to Do-san.

923
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:28,492
This stop is Sand Box Entrance Station.

924
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:31,620
You may exit on the right.

925
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:55,144
CHEONG-MYEONG CORN DOG

926
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:56,228
Lord.

927
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,482
I guess this is karma.

928
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,822
What should I do?

929
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:29,428
Do-san.

930
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:32,181
I sometimes wonder.

931
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:37,519
That spring, everyone and everything
seemed to be leaving me.

932
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,898
Without your letters,

933
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:45,569
what would that spring have meant to me?

934
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:51,450
I would have grieved

935
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,412
over fallen flowers rather than enjoying

936
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:58,540
the flowers in bloom.

937
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,380
The only thing I remember

938
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:11,011
from that spring would have been
losing the person I love more than anyone…

939
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,139
DO-SAN

940
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,188
Oh, why is this here?

941
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:24,525
DO-SAN

942
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:30,697
…without even getting to say goodbye.

943
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:34,910
Thank you for being there for me

944
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,288
that spring.

945
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:42,418
Thank you for your letters.

946
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:45,838
Back then, I believed that you existed.

947
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,926
Now,
I want to believe that you exist, Do-san.

948
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:53,720
I miss you.

949
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,641
So I think it's time for me

950
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:00,477
to find you,

951
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,816
Nam Do-san.

952
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:35,012
Ms. Seo.

953
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,639
What are you doing here?

954
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:50,027
I took my grandma's phone
instead of mine by mistake today.

955
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,615
SAND BOX ENTRANCE STATION

956
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,620
What? This isn't my phone.

957
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,625
But I noticed a strange message

958
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,002
that popped up on her phone.

959
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:10,130
I came here out of curiosity.

960
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:18,639
How do you know this place?

961
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:26,772
Did you know my grandma

962
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:29,775
before you met me?

963
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:41,328
Who are you, really?

964
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,669
SAND BOX ENTRANCE STATION

965
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,422
Please leave a message after the beep.

966
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:55,509
And who is Do-san?

967
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,685
Mr. Han, please…

968
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,355
Say something!

969
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:23,870
Hey, Dal-mi. It's me, Do-san.

970
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,540
Hey.

971
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:29,751
Your grandma said you took her phone.

972
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:30,919
I kept calling you.

973
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,631
- Do-san.
- Yes?

974
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:39,303
You know, the place where we used
to leave our letters 15 years ago.

975
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:41,597
Remember that spot?

976
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:48,937
What?

977
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,151
Where is it?

978
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:59,114
Dal-mi, that's…

979
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:05,412
Answer my question. Please.

980
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:07,914
Dal-mi, where…

981
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:13,086
Where are you? I'll come over now.

982
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,047
Why can't you answer my question?

983
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:18,467
And why is Mr. Han here, not you?

984
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,273
Dal-mi.

985
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,400
That's…

986
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:39,988
Well… Hello? Dal-mi.

987
01:17:58,757 --> 01:17:59,800
Please…

988
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:22,864
The phone is turned off. You will be
directed to voice mail after the beep.

989
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,533
Extra charges may apply.

990
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,341
The wind

991
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:45,470
has turned into another storm,

992
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:49,182
and it's coming at me once again.

993
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,522
Was it fun?

994
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:42,110
You should say it isn't true.
You should say you are the real Do-san.

995
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,031
Does my dream have to be about
becoming successful? Can't it be a person?

996
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:49,534
Not everything started
because of a favor I asked.

997
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,454
Now that I know everything's fake,
I feel fake, too.

998
01:19:52,537 --> 01:19:55,665
You made Samsan Tech
into what it is today.

999
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:57,167
Come to me like you did before.

1000
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,127
You

1001
01:19:59,836 --> 01:20:01,171
were my dream.

1002
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:02,964
Erase everything you know about me

1003
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,175
up until now.

1004
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:10,263
