EPISODE 6

2
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,870
Dal-mi!

3
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,164
Hey, Do-san.

4
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,959
We…

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,213
got in.

6
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,715
What?

7
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,054
- For real?
- Yes, for real.

8
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,144
Look. That screen over there.

9
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,396
"Samsan Tech." See that?

10
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,273
You still don't believe it?

11
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,942
12TH SAND BOX RESIDENCY RECIPIENTS
INJAE COMPANY, SAMSAN TECH

12
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:35,989
Congratulations.

13
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,449
Thanks.

14
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,786
Congratulations to you, too.

15
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,122
Thanks.

16
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,877
Wait. Mr. Han…

17
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,881
- Where did he go?
- Why are you looking for him?

18
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,008
I have something to ask him.

19
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,176
Dal-mi.

20
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,430
Ask me instead.

21
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,599
I'll answer for him.

22
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,488
What's wrong with me?
It's not like I did anything wrong.

23
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,580
But what am I going to tell her?
I don't have an answer.

24
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,457
Gosh.

25
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,253
I have many questions for you.

26
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,838
Why did you do that?

27
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,593
Why did you go to great lengths to
help us even if it meant you had to lie?

28
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,857
Congratulations. You really did it.

29
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,776
Thanks to you.

30
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,529
Enough lip service. It's embarrassing.

31
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,407
I answered Dal-mi for you.

32
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,411
Regarding why you helped us.

33
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,539
You answered for me?
What did you tell her?

34
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,541
I asked him to.

35
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,379
I was finally meeting you after 15 years

36
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,214
and I wanted to impress you.

37
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,841
So I went to him and asked him for help.

38
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,594
But why would he help you?

39
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,813
We're very close.

40
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,986
We're practically like brothers.
That's why.

41
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:43,866
We're close?

42
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,119
We're like brothers? You and me?

43
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,413
Do you seriously expect her to buy that?
Did she?

44
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,498
Yes, she did.

45
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,042
She did?

46
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,712
I told her that everything
you've done for us,

47
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,424
you did for me, so there isn't anything
strange about it.

48
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,260
It has always been like that

49
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,846
and always will be.

50
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,182
Good job. You did well.

51
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,645
You're a good talker, Do-san.

52
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,148
You don't stutter or look away anymore.

53
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,859
But why do I feel like you're angry at me?

54
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,945
- I have the right to be now.
- You have "the right"?

55
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,156
What? Are you offended?
Does that piss you off?

56
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,575
Yes, a little.

57
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,160
What's that?

58
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,788
You don't get to be angry
because it's a fact.

59
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll give you a chance to get angry
if you get into Sand Box.

60
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,296
Now that you got into Sand Box,

61
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,133
you've earned the right
to be angry at me, is that it?

62
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,554
But I can't.

63
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,141
Because we're like brothers now.

64
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,943
AFTERNOON TEA WITH MOTHER

65
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,223
She's pretty tall.

66
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,058
Sorry, I don't think I've seen her.

67
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,570
Dal-mi, is that you?

68
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,748
I don't speak English.

69
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,752
Mother?

70
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,594
By any chance, are you here to see me?

71
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:13,015
No way. How would I have known
you were staying here?

72
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,144
I was just meeting some friends
and accidentally ran into you.

73
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,479
I see.

74
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,690
Accidentally.

75
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,275
Bye, then.

76
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,902
Oh, right.

77
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,865
Have you ever heard of Sand Box?

78
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,741
Yes, I have.

79
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,204
I got in.

80
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,418
Congratulations.

81
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,591
I'm sorting things out
after bluffing the other day.

82
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,553
That's why I want to work with Do-san
and grow the company.

83
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,639
I'll try to get on Steve Jobs
or Mark Zuckerberg's level

84
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,308
so you won't dare to outdo me.

85
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,019
So you came here to tell me that?

86
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,312
Yes.

87
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,148
No. Like I said, I'm meeting friends.

88
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,983
This is just a pure coincidence.

89
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,152
I hope you don't get the wrong idea.

90
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:07,612
I'll be off, then.

91
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,119
Sorry. I don't know you.

92
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,888
WON IN-JAE

93
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:46,692
A PERSON WHO PLAYS A KEY ROLE
IN DECISION-MAKING IN AN ORGANIZATION

94
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,940
Do-san! Wake up and have breakfast!

95
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,070
Nam Do-san! Come out right now!

96
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,407
The food is getting cold.

97
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,119
Let him sleep. It seems
like he stayed up all night last night.

98
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,835
- I'm leaving for work.
- No breakfast?

99
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,421
I'll eat at Sand Box.
There's so much to eat there.

100
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,591
You're going to work dressed like that?

101
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,094
- What's wrong?
- You seriously don't know?

102
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:56,887
Gosh.

103
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,558
Follow me.

104
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,274
There you go.

105
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,862
This is how you should dress
on your first day at work.

106
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,573
No one dresses like this at Sand Box.

107
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,242
But you're not like everybody else.

108
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,328
You're a CEO.

109
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,626
- Father.
- Yes, Mr. CEO?

110
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,795
Look how tall and handsome our son is.

111
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,340
Thank goodness he takes after my side.

112
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,596
Except for his height,
I'd say he definitely takes after

113
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,097
my side.

114
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,517
You should go, Mr. CEO.

115
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,980
Here. See you later, Mr. CEO.

116
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,858
- See you.
- See you.

117
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,448
Gosh, I'm totally going to stand out.
Everyone is going to stare at me.

118
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,659
Are those trousers too short?

119
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,786
I think the jacket is a bit big, too.

120
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,913
But that's in fashion now.

121
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,186
NAM DO-SAN

122
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,854
SEO DAL-MI

123
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,447
Ms. Seo, Do-san!
Come have your morning coffee.

124
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,116
Everything's free here.

125
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,326
Come on, hurry up. Order something.

126
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,706
Guys, I worked on our algorithm
all night last night

127
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,501
and ran Injae Company's data
through our program again.

128
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,961
Okay. What's the result?

129
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,554
- Unbelievable!
- You did it!

130
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,680
Great job, Do-san!

131
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,018
- Nam Do-san!
- Nam Do-san!

132
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,270
Cheers, guys!

133
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,607
Is this even possible?

134
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,819
We've been assigned our office.

135
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,198
We're right next to Injae Company.

136
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,120
That's great. Let's go.
Let's go and show them this.

137
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,329
Okay.

138
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,379
Coding has never been more rewarding.

139
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,217
"Rewarding"? What is he talking about?

140
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,928
- Do you know what he's talking about?
- No.

141
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,556
Are we really slow?

142
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,314
Take this.

143
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,024
SAMSAN TECH

144
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,613
What's our room number again?

145
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,615
- It's Room 302.
- It's over there.

146
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,617
- There it is!
- Room 302!

147
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,243
Room 302!

148
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,746
This is it!

149
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,292
- Oh, my gosh!
- This is amazing!

150
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,347
NAM DO-SAN, KIM YONG-SAN

151
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,932
It has everything.

152
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,688
- Are you Mr. Nam Do-san?
- Yes.

153
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,482
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

154
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:40,945
You're welcome.
It's so nice to have you here.

155
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,990
- Oh, my. Look at this.
- This is fantastic!

156
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,201
I can't believe this!

157
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,913
Gosh! Guys, look at this.
The desk is going up!

158
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,540
It's automatic!

159
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,750
- Gosh!
- It's going up!

160
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,961
- It's moving!
- That's incredible!

161
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,505
- Can you see me?
- You have to get down!

162
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,298
- Are you there?
- I'm here!

163
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,175
- There you are!
- I'm over here!

164
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,553
Try lowering it!

165
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,599
- It's going down!
- It's going back down!

166
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,394
It's going down now! It's going down!

167
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,937
Guys, is all this really free?

168
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,106
Yes, it is!

169
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,282
My gosh. Unbelievable.

170
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,533
Where's Dal-mi, anyway?

171
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,326
INJAE COMPANY

172
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,747
Their office looks larger than ours.

173
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,208
Is it just me?

174
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,668
Yes, it's just you.

175
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,052
- Hey.
- Why are you peeking into our office?

176
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,345
I wasn't peeking.

177
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,016
I have something to show you.
I came to have a meeting.

178
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:53,934
What is it?

179
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,479
I came here to…

180
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,273
- Just leave!
- Are you okay, Dal-mi?

181
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,983
- You want everything?
- What's wrong?

182
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,985
- This is over!
- Just leave!

183
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,445
- Get lost!
- Fine.

184
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,448
- Hey!
- No, just leave it.

185
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,407
This is it!

186
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,409
Damn it!

187
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,994
You want all the damn shares?

188
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,747
Fine, you can have them!
But I don't want to see you again.

189
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,708
- Hey, listen to me.
- Leave!

190
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,545
This is the end
of our 20 years of friendship.

191
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,755
Get lost!

192
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,266
Shouldn't having this amazing office
boost teamwork?

193
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,851
I wonder what happened to them.

194
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,854
No idea.
So much drama right before our eyes.

195
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,981
How can they break up on their first day?

196
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,400
Could it be their leader's fault?

197
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,152
They probably had poor teamwork.

198
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,872
All right. Where should everyone sit?

199
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,916
Let's decide where the CEO will sit first.

200
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,711
Me? I'll just choose my desk
after you guys choose yours.

201
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,006
Dal-mi. Just a second.

202
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,011
Dal-mi, this desk is the largest.
Sit here.

203
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,930
No. I don't need a big desk.

204
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,432
But the developers do.
They have more equipment.

205
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,604
Beautiful.
Now, this is what I call teamwork.

206
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,606
- Sit here.
- No, I'm fine.

207
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,192
Sit here. Come on.

208
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,654
Do you call not being able to decide
where to sit teamwork?

209
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,199
I'll sit here. Happy?

210
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,287
- But this is--
- She's a designer. She needs a big desk.

211
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,372
Go away.

212
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,585
All right. Let's decide how to address
and speak to each other at work.

213
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,630
How about we speak formally to each other,

214
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,340
using Mr. and Ms.?

215
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,175
- That sounds good.
- Sure.

216
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,176
I don't want to.

217
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,930
Then should we just speak informally
to each other?

218
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,598
- On a first-name basis?
- Good.

219
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,225
- Okay.
- Sure, Dal-mi.

220
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,768
I don't like that.

221
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,146
I don't want you guys
to speak informally to me.

222
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,359
Well… Then we'll speak formally
to each other,

223
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,153
and you can speak informally to us.

224
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,864
That's too complicated.
I want some consistency.

225
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,621
It's okay.

226
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,249
I guess we could use some consistency.

227
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,460
Hello, I'm VC Park Dong-cheon.

228
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,963
This 2.5 billion-won investment
will be made solely by us.

229
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,217
Jiphyeonjeon Tech has combined
their AI voice technology, Yeong-sil,

230
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,427
- with health services…
- Now that you got into Sand Box,

231
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,347
you've earned the right
to be angry at me, is that it?

232
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,598
But I can't.

233
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,143
Because we're like brothers now.

234
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,315
The service will be validated
through collaboration

235
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,025
with Kangun Hospital in the future.

236
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,444
And in the future,
Yeong-sil will help monitor

237
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,822
- the health of--
- Stop saying "in the future"!

238
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,742
Enough of what'll happen in the future.

239
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,995
Maybe they should go to fortune-tellers,
not investors.

240
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,209
I'm sure you know this.

241
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,337
We make decisions based
on the current data, not on predictions.

242
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,964
Yes, but

243
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,551
these services cannot be implemented
until investments are made.

244
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,344
I see. Then answer these questions.

245
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,429
What's their monthly burn rate?

246
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,974
When is the estimated BEP?

247
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,059
Did you check the contract
with the hospital?

248
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,769
How high are the barriers to entry?

249
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,230
Their labor costs increased
dramatically last year.

250
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,690
Have you looked into why?

251
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,027
Mr. Han, isn't it great
that they intend to serve

252
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,113
the public interest?

253
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,239
Indeed.

254
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,658
But that's not enough.

255
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,702
Why should we give them our LPs' money

256
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,871
to do charity work
that creates little value?

257
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,957
Let them use their own money!
Their own money!

258
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,967
JIPHYEONJEON TECH
INVESTMENT EVALUATION REPORT

259
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,638
- Have some coffee.
- Thank you.

260
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,351
Why is Mr. Han so on edge today?

261
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,811
Is something bothering him?

262
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,646
It's nothing serious.

263
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,859
He just starts mentoring
the newcomers at Sand Box today.

264
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:57,070
What? I thought he was only mentoring
at the Hackathon.

265
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,201
He was sure that the team would fail,
but they got in in the end.

266
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,786
Gosh. So that's what happened.

267
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,497
I get how he feels.

268
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,958
A Sand Box mentor is
like an angel investor.

269
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,503
What kind of VC wouldn't go crazy
to be accelerating start-ups?

270
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,673
It's like asking a professor
to teach preschoolers the alphabet.

271
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,551
Actually, Mr. Han inspired me

272
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,386
to become a Sand Box mentor myself.

273
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,265
Ms. Yoon, you never cease to amaze me.

274
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,477
I admire your contributions
to our country's start-up ecosystem.

275
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,397
You're my biggest role model.
I wish to follow in your footsteps.

276
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,942
That's great.
I'll let you follow in my footsteps.

277
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,736
- Pardon?
- I was actually looking

278
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,821
for someone who can manage
the 12th program.

279
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,406
No one has applied yet.

280
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,868
Why don't you go ahead
and make a contribution yourself?

281
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,997
Sure, that sounds exciting. Yes!

282
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,796
SAMSAN TECH

283
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,801
For the next six months,

284
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:04,179
you'll be provided with this office
and other office supplies.

285
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,890
If you need more,
submit a request at any time.

286
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,434
You can also use the servers,
Internet, and electricity

287
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,645
without paying any fees.

288
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,356
When will we be paid our support?

289
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,776
You'll receive 100 million won
in your company account soon.

290
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,861
A hundred million won?

291
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,490
- Unbelievable.
- A hundred million!

292
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,200
Please prepare for due diligence.

293
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,494
- If everything looks good, you'll be paid.
- Okay.

294
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,333
"Due diligence"? What's that?

295
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,965
It must be something like a "due date."

296
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,426
- Okay.
- Okay.

297
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,013
- You're incredible.
- A "due date"?

298
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,809
What's with you? You know what it means.

299
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,980
It's a company appraisal process
conducted before investment.

300
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,901
- Oh, that.
- I mixed them up.

301
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,989
Do you have articles of association,
financial statements,

302
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,198
and a shareholder list?

303
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,117
- What?
- What?

304
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,661
Well…

305
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,205
As if.

306
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,833
They don't even know
what due diligence is.

307
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,421
Wait.

308
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,715
Where are you going? I'm not done yet.

309
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,056
She'll be back soon.
Her purse is still here.

310
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:33,060
She's a designer, an artist.
She's a free spirit.

311
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,607
The due diligence process will be
performed by your mentor.

312
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,026
When will we know who our mentor is?

313
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:46,031
After the mentor-CEO meeting at 3 p.m.

314
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,577
Will there be more than one mentor?

315
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,372
Who are the mentors?

316
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,666
First,

317
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:02,380
Ms. Yoon Seon-hak, the Director
of Sand Box and SH Venture Capital.

318
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,968
Alex, the new head
of the Korea branch of 2STO,

319
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,930
the world's seventh-largest company
in terms of market cap.

320
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,851
Mr. Han Ji-pyeong,
the senior manager of SH Venture Capital.

321
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,480
Last but not least, Mr. Won Du-jeong,
Chairman of Morning Group,

322
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,816
the country's 43rd-largest company.

323
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,166
The other day,
you at least tried to smile.

324
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,378
But you're completely ignoring me today?
Aren't you going to thank me?

325
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,964
For what?

326
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,299
You already forgot?
The test that I suggested.

327
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,468
That's what got you in here.

328
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,722
Oh, are you here to brag about that?

329
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,142
"Brag"?

330
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,687
I did expect this
when you suggested that, though.

331
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,397
If I lost, you'd humiliate me

332
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,067
by saying,
"Serves you right for leaving me."

333
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:09,406
If I won, you'd brag and say,
"See? You got in all thanks to me."

334
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,411
You're acting exactly the way I expected.

335
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:18,248
I made time to come here and mentor you,
and is this how you treat me?

336
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,792
I appreciate that you made time for me,

337
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,378
but I've already decided on our mentor.

338
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,922
What? You've decided?

339
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,967
Yes.

340
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,218
START-UP RELAY LECTURE

341
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,471
There's so much text on the screen.
How about we take that logo away?

342
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,848
No, we can't.

343
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,852
The name Sand Box
comes from that very girl.

344
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,062
That girl on the swing?

345
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:45,233
Was that about 15 years ago?
An entrepreneur told me this story.

346
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,527
He covered the ground with sand

347
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:51,239
so that his daughter wouldn't get hurt
even if she fell off the swing.

348
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,993
After that, his daughter wasn't afraid
of playing on the swing anymore.

349
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,383
Is that where the name Sand Box
comes from?

350
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,510
Have you rewarded him for the idea?

351
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,346
I would have,

352
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,557
but he passed away in an accident.

353
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,648
Dad.

354
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,111
APPLICATION FOR THE 12TH
SAND BOX RESIDENCY PROGRAM

355
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,115
WON IN-JAE

356
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,661
REASON FOR APPLICATION

357
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,382
I REMEMBER SWINGING OVER THE SAND

358
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,343
MY DAD SPREAD FOR ME
SO THAT I WOULDN'T GET HURT

359
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,228
Thank you for the opportunity.

360
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,896
We finally meet.

361
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,942
She is the beginning of Sand Box.

362
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,279
What? Then is she the girl on the swing?

363
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,448
It's you, right, Ms. Won?

364
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:21,454
Did you know my late father?

365
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,416
I met him only once

366
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,419
about 15 years ago.

367
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,889
Just like how your father
covered the ground with sand for you,

368
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,561
I'll do everything I can
for you not to get hurt.

369
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,900
Thank you, Ms. Yoon.

370
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,286
What the hell? Is this room soundproof?

371
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,581
Or are they whispering or something?
I can't hear anything.

372
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,174
Why were you listening in?

373
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,343
To understand the situation beforehand.

374
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,179
Isn't it a CEO's job
to understand and analyze the situation?

375
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,266
CEO of Samsan Tech, please come in.

376
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,309
Yes!

377
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,447
I really enjoyed Samsan Tech's pitch
at the Hackathon.

378
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,369
Do any of you want to be
a mentor for Samsan Tech?

379
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,458
Maybe I should raise my hand, too.

380
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,793
You don't have to.

381
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,089
I've already decided
who I want to be our mentor.

382
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,673
What's going on here?

383
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,386
Why is everyone saying
they've already decided?

384
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,556
Really? Who do you want?

385
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,475
It's, of course…

386
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,771
Mr. Han.

387
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,067
Why?

388
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:19,030
Dal-mi. I mean, Ms. Seo.
That's very kind of you to say, but…

389
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,535
If I were you, I'd choose Alex over me.

390
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,704
But you're the one I choose, Mr. Han.

391
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,001
I mean…

392
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,341
He's from 2STO. You know,
the world's seventh-largest company.

393
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,053
And Alex is the one who recommended
Samsan Tech to Sand Box.

394
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,763
Yes, I know that.

395
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:52,147
I want Mr. Han to be Samsan Tech's mentor.

396
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,701
Ms. Seo, you frustrate me.

397
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,162
Why give up on such a great option…

398
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,873
I'm not saying I'm a bad option, but…

399
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,585
Do you know how interested
Alex is in Samsan Tech?

400
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,504
He flew in from Silicon Valley
to meet the Samsan Tech guys.

401
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,299
But you are way more interested
in Samsan Tech than he is

402
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,301
and went to even more trouble than he did.

403
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:25,138
Me? I'm in no way that interested.
And when did I go to any trouble?

404
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,892
That's strange. It's so obvious to me.

405
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:32,228
Your great interest in Samsan Tech
and the trouble you go to for us.

406
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,856
What are you talking about?
What makes you think so?

407
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,233
I've noticed it many times.

408
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,530
You helped us with the Hackathon pitch.

409
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,117
Mr. Han, what are you doing here?

410
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,661
You let the guys use your apartment
to look successful.

411
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,830
You don't know what that means?

412
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,624
A funding round is… The thing is…

413
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,044
It's a seed stage company
we're immensely interested in.

414
00:29:56,127 --> 00:30:00,215
You saved Do-san from humiliation
at the networking party, too.

415
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,928
Your interest and efforts were

416
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,137
pretty obvious to me.

417
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,475
It almost gave me the wrong idea, too.

418
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,144
What wrong idea?

419
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,396
I mean, you were being unusually generous.

420
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,984
So I wondered if you were interested in me
as a girl or something.

421
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,324
But that was just a misunderstanding.
Do-san cleared it up.

422
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,660
I heard that you two are like brothers.

423
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,246
And you were doing Do-san a favor.

424
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,707
Yes, kind of.

425
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:38,294
That explains all the things you've done
for us so far. And I'm thankful.

426
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,300
I know this is shameless of me,
but I have a favor to ask you.

427
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:49,556
Please continue to look after and guide us
like family in the future, too.

428
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,527
You'll regret choosing me.

429
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,945
Don't worry.

430
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,907
I've never regretted any choice
I've made in my life.

431
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,331
We'll see.

432
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:29,929
So Alex is from that famous 2STO?

433
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,640
- Yes.
- And he came here to meet us?

434
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,683
Yes.

435
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,812
And you chose Mr. Han as our mentor

436
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,065
over Alex? Is that it?

437
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,275
Yes.

438
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,487
Why? Why would you give up
on a global figure like Alex

439
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,907
for a local figure like Mr. Han?

440
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,117
What do you mean, why?

441
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,077
Alex might be a global figure, but Mr. Han

442
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,579
is family.

443
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,998
"Family"?

444
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,207
Yes.

445
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,126
Since when? What is she talking about?

446
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,294
What?

447
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,797
You know that Mr. Han and I are
like brothers, right?

448
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,217
- That's right.
- Yes, I know that,

449
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,721
but it surprises me every time.
I never get used to it.

450
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:17,769
Well… If you need anything
or have any questions,

451
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,062
feel free to let me know.

452
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,773
That's what a mentor is for.

453
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,526
The Himalayas… What's that called again?

454
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,987
The trekking guide…

455
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,657
Sherpa?

456
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,700
That's it. Sherpa.

457
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,453
Do-san, my brother. I will be

458
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,122
your reliable Sherpa.

459
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,460
The journey is going to be hard,

460
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:47,340
but we'll make it together.

461
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,802
My…

462
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:51,803
dear…

463
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:52,971
precious…

464
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,472
brother.

465
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:56,641
Okay?

466
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,524
All right. It's time for due diligence.

467
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,275
Let's start with the basic contract.

468
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,568
Sure.

469
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:13,282
What? A bolt from the blue?
This doesn't feel right.

470
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:15,952
What's going on?

471
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,174
Ten out of ten for the business plan
and articles of association.

472
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,387
Our CEO here amended them all.

473
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,848
Come on. We did it together.

474
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:44,272
But the shareholders' list gets
minus one million points.

475
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,149
- What?
- Why?

476
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,191
Minus?

477
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,110
"Nam Do-san, 19 percent.

478
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,488
Seo Dal-mi, Kim Yong-san, Lee Chul-san,
Jung Sa-ha, and Nam Seong-hwan,

479
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,781
16 percent respectively.

480
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,491
Nam Cheon-ho, one percent."

481
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,369
Mr. Nam, you're the biggest shareholder.

482
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,248
He is the best coder among us
and makes the most contribution.

483
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,792
So he gets three more percent than us.

484
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,670
The rest of us get
16 percent each, which is fair.

485
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,841
Who's Nam Seong-hwan?

486
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,635
What? You don't know?

487
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,056
Bro, it's my father.

488
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:20,641
That's right.

489
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,480
What's happening to me?
It slipped my mind.

490
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,356
- Is everything all right with him?
- Yes.

491
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,609
- How's his health?
- Good. Very good.

492
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,777
That's great.

493
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,696
He's been investing a lot in Samsan Tech
over the years.

494
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,282
- That's why he gets 16 percent.
- Oh, that's why.

495
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,950
- Yes.
- I see.

496
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:43,247
And Nam Cheon-ho is…

497
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,874
My cousin.

498
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,001
My cousin.

499
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,920
Right, he's your cousin.

500
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,005
Why does he get one percent?

501
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,424
I'm sure you told me, but I forgot.

502
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,053
- Well…
- He's been in charge

503
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:00,473
of design and video editing
for Samsan Tech.

504
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,642
- Design and video editing?
- Yes.

505
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,770
SAMSAN TECH
ON STANDBY 24/7

506
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,813
INVESTMENT INQUIRIES WELCOME

507
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,861
I see…

508
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,322
All right. Fair enough.

509
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,700
You guys split equity very beautifully

510
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,410
among yourselves.

511
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,372
Right? Isn't it so beautiful?

512
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,375
I know this for sure.

513
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:32,421
After seeing this shareholders' list,
no one will be stupid enough

514
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,925
to invest in your company. No one. Why?

515
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,013
This beautifully distributed equity
will eventually get in the way of the CEO.

516
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,894
Ms. Seo.

517
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,064
Where do you think
a CEO's power comes from?

518
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,526
It comes from equity.

519
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,279
It's so obvious, but I didn't know.

520
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,657
No, it's not that I didn't know.
I trusted my father too much.

521
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,411
So I just thought his shares were mine.

522
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,999
You learned an important lesson.

523
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,001
As you probably already know,

524
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:13,713
it's important to give power to the CEO
in the early stages of a start-up.

525
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,507
Yes. I learned that the hard way.

526
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,469
I don't think you need any advice from me.

527
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,681
I'm the one who should learn from you.

528
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,101
That's not true. Please help us a lot.

529
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,854
Why shouldn't the equity
be distributed equally?

530
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,230
If we act as one--

531
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,525
Wouldn't it be simpler to just be one
than to act as one?

532
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,819
Let's say one of you disagrees
with the rest--

533
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,738
That's not going to happen.

534
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,615
Our friendship will last forever.

535
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,035
Sorry. It'll last forever?

536
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,078
It's never going to change?

537
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,205
Where do you think

538
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,874
such stupid words are used most often?

539
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,375
At weddings.

540
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,503
Then why do 100,000 couples
get divorced every year?

541
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,381
Didn't they love each other
when they got married?

542
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,468
That's not it.
In the beginning, they felt the same.

543
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,762
They loved each other sincerely
and they believed

544
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,348
that their love would be eternal.

545
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,060
Just like you do now.

546
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,188
When a marriage breaks,

547
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,107
you just split money and custody
between you and your spouse.

548
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,859
But a company is different.

549
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,570
When a company breaks up,
the investors lose their money.

550
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,698
What if I give up my shares

551
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,033
to someone else?

552
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,744
- Then that person will have 35 percent.
- Hey.

553
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,580
Did you say 35 percent?

554
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,540
That's nowhere near enough.

555
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,626
What?

556
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:37,713
Once the funding round begins, investors
will start buying up company shares.

557
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,799
It won't be long before an investor

558
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,261
owns more than 35 percent of the shares.

559
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,098
In the worst-case scenario,
your colleagues may betray you

560
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,101
and side with investors
to try and take control of the company,

561
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,186
or even sell it.

562
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,605
To prevent that from happening,

563
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,775
you need to give the key man
the majority of shares in the beginning.

564
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,777
That's how you protect your company.

565
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,366
How do you decide
who should be the key man?

566
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,285
It's simple.

567
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,955
Who is the person
that Samsan Tech can't do without?

568
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:15,418
Then how much equity
should that person have?

569
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,212
At least 60 percent.
But personally, I'd say

570
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,172
more than 90 percent.

571
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,893
We can finish due diligence here.

572
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,147
The transfer will be made
tomorrow morning.

573
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,815
Thank you.

574
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,277
So the CEO gets 80-percent equity.

575
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,447
The rest will be distributed
among the founding members.

576
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,158
We're all for a strong CEO,

577
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,952
but is everyone on the same page?

578
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,204
- Yes.
- Yes.

579
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,833
Ms. Won promised to compensate us
with stock options.

580
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,253
I doubt that anyone would object to this.

581
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,216
Over my dead body!

582
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,011
Did you plan this together?

583
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,222
I knew something was going on
when you chose Mr. Han over Alex.

584
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:14,560
You two must've teamed up
to steal my shares. Am I wrong?

585
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,146
- Look, Mr. Lee.
- Hey, are you serious right now?

586
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,231
Was it your idea, Do-san?

587
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,816
Did you want our shares?

588
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,778
So you teamed up with your family,
Mr. Han, you jerk?

589
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,739
You little… That's enough.
You're out of line.

590
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,575
Guys, calm down. Is this how little
our friendship is worth?

591
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:34,455
Yes, that's right. It's worth less than
shares, and a lot less than a girl!

592
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,873
You want a piece of me?

593
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,750
- Stop, guys!
- Stay out of this.

594
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,752
What? Did I say something wrong?

595
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,422
Hey, why should I stay out of this?
Do I mean nothing to you?

596
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,427
Let go! Hey, baldness runs
in my family! Let go!

597
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,137
Thanks for the information!

598
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,849
Fine, this is the end for us!
This is the end!

599
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:54,892
Let go!

600
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,602
That hurts!

601
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,229
Hey!

602
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,272
That hurts!

603
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,401
No! I have a bad hip!

604
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,694
Let go!

605
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,533
Mr. Han!

606
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,164
I'm sure they'll make up soon, so--

607
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,209
If they're fighting
over 100 million won now,

608
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,294
they can never pursue a greater cause.

609
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,799
Let alone grow a hundred, thousand times
more in the future.

610
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,885
And the biggest problem here

611
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,555
is that the CEO can't resolve
the situation.

612
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,892
Ms. Seo, you're the problem.

613
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,688
- This is it!
- I quit!

614
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,150
Fine, this is it! Change the name, too!

615
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,111
Change it to Dal-mi Tech!

616
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,071
Go for it!

617
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,281
Chul-san!

618
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,992
Can you go talk to him?

619
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,077
Why? I'm not a pushover.

620
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,746
Hey, are you really quitting?

621
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,331
Does this look like a joke?

622
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,838
Wow, Samsan Tech is shutting down
on their first day.

623
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,256
I know.

624
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,305
Oh, right. Didn't you say
you had something to show me?

625
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,937
Well, I don't remember what it was.

626
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,087
SHAREHOLDERS' LIST

627
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,185
Do-san.

628
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:03,771
Yes?

629
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,986
Can you take me home?

630
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,542
Is there anything you want to say to me?

631
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:29,088
Don't let what the other guys said
bother you. Just think of it as noise.

632
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,215
"Noise"?

633
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,261
When there's too much data,

634
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,347
machine learning takes longer
and is more difficult.

635
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:43,269
But you can achieve better results
by filtering out noise beforehand.

636
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,606
So consider what they said noise
and just filter it out.

637
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,775
Okay.

638
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,737
What about you? Can you filter it out?

639
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,073
No.

640
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,453
Don't worry. I'll persuade them somehow.

641
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,999
How about

642
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,001
you become the CEO instead?

643
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,420
I can be the CMO or CFO.

644
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:12,715
No. That's noise.
It needs to be filtered out immediately.

645
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,551
Hey, I'm not joking.

646
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,387
I'm not either.

647
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,390
I chose you as the CEO of our company.

648
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,226
And I don't want to regret it.

649
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,189
Dal-mi, is that you?

650
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,318
Yes, Grandma! I'm coming in!

651
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,363
Do you want to come in
and say hi to my grandma?

652
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,535
Some other time. I look awful today.

653
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,830
What? You look great.
You're wearing a suit and everything.

654
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,290
Come in and say hi to her.

655
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,917
This doesn't feel natural.

656
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,338
Later. I'll come visit her
some other time.

657
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,382
Okay. Some other time.

658
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,809
Can't you just be the CEO
and take all the shares?

659
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,270
You have no idea.

660
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:12,316
The guys got into a fight because of that
and were pulling each other's hair.

661
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,151
It was horrible.

662
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,653
Plus, I don't want that.

663
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,864
I feel uncomfortable,
and it doesn't make sense.

664
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:22,826
Then let Do-san be the CEO
and take all the shares.

665
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,413
I can't. Do-san doesn't want it.

666
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,707
That's out of the question.

667
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,711
What if you're the CEO
but Do-san takes the most shares?

668
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,129
That doesn't work either.

669
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,342
Mr. Han said
the investors wouldn't like it.

670
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,929
Goodness, then there's nothing you can do.

671
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,474
Where are you going? I'm not done yet.

672
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,102
This is enough.
I don't need more Band-Aids.

673
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,813
That's not what I mean.
I'm not done talking yet.

674
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,399
I have a hundred other problems, too.
Sit down.

675
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,150
I'm sure they're just as unsolvable.

676
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,278
The problem is, you're looking for
answers that don't exist.

677
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,700
Then what am I supposed to do?

678
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,168
Yeong-sil, turn on the lights.

679
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,920
Okay.

680
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,588
What?

681
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:22,052
What happened? You're actually
listening to me today. I feel bad now.

682
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,762
You don't have to feel bad.

683
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,562
You're very forgiving.

684
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,441
I denied your company an investment today.

685
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,110
I said some mean stuff, too.
Aren't you angry?

686
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:41,530
Of course not.
No one understands you better than I do.

687
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,075
Thanks.

688
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,287
And the biggest problem here

689
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,706
is that the CEO can't resolve
the situation.

690
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,085
Ms. Seo, you're the problem.

691
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,799
Will Seo Dal-mi do the same?

692
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,345
Will she understand me like you do?

693
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:09,183
Of course not.
No one understands you better than I do.

694
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:13,770
What was I expecting?

695
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:25,324
I WISH YOU SUCCESS

696
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,603

00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,685
RECOGNIZE PROBLEMS
FIND SOLUTIONS

701
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,690
UNTIL WHEN WILL YOU BE HELPING US?

702
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,039
TO MR. HAN JI-PYEONG

703
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,656
What are you doing here?

704
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,576
What about you?

705
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,162
Well, I just…

706
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,875
What's this, anyway?

707
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,587
Mosquitoes love my blood, you know.

708
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,090
Stop being so fussy.

709
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,595
Well… Should I just leave?

710
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,058
Are you letting me just leave?

711
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,772
SAMSAN TECH

712
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,236
The sign looked different
in the beginning.

713
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,198
Do you remember that?

714
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:13,825
Of course.

715
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,579
How could I ever forget?

716
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:23,627
SAMSAN TECH

717
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,215
DOSAN TECH

718
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,025
You didn't have to come. You're busy.

719
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,735
Of course, I should.

720
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,530
Hey, I'm so proud of you.

721
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,740
What? Address him properly.

722
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,242
He's a CEO now.

723
00:49:56,618 --> 00:50:00,163
I love your office.
It has a nice view and a good vibe.

724
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,499
Really? Guys, join me.
There's a lot of space.

725
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:04,876
What do you say?

726
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,964
We would, but we're not good enough.

727
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,966
We're not. We're not there yet.

728
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,721
What are you waiting for? It's cold.
Hurry up and bow so we can go inside.

729
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:16,722
Okay.

730
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,099
Gosh, it's cold.

731
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,563
Stop trembling.

732
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,149
- I'm not the one trembling, Father.
- You're spilling it.

733
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,451
How many times do we bow?

734
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,036
- Three times.
- Three times? Okay.

735
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,877
Don't you think
the company name is so lame?

736
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,587
Dosan Tech? What's that?

737
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,881
What can he do? That's his name.

738
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,011
I pray for my company's success.

739
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:14,488
It looks like our servers have been
attacked by ransomware.

740
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,573
- What about the backups?
- Them, too.

741
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,825
Even all our partners' data
have been removed.

742
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,536
Damn it. How much are they asking for?

743
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,207
To recover the files,
we have to pay 100 million won.

744
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,752
But if we don't pay up within 24 hours,
it'll be 200 million.

745
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,837
What do we do?

746
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,506
God damn it.

747
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,509
- Hey, you sort it out.
- What?

748
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,845
It happened on your watch.
It's your responsibility.

749
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,972
- Got it? Whatever.
- Wait. No.

750
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,058
Wait!

751
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:49,564
- Chul-san, calm down.
- Let go!

752
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:50,732
Please!

753
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,401
I should just die.

754
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,988
I don't have 100 million won!

755
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:57,989
Hey, wait.

756
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:02,452
Hey, you won't even die
if you jump from here.

757
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,246
You'll just hurt yourself.

758
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,708
I told them I'd quit,
but they said I should still pay.

759
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,127
I'm still paying back my student loan.

760
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,922
- How am I going to get 100 million?
- Hey, wait.

761
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,882
I'll solve it for you, okay?

762
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,968
Hey, I'll solve it for you.

763
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,846
Do you have 100 million?

764
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,558
What do you think? Of course not.

765
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,935
I'll just die!

766
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,896
I'll just die!

767
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,275
Do-san, I'll die!

768
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,113
- I can't even die.
- Do it.

769
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,198
- I'm an idiot.
- Just die.

770
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:43,034
- I can't.
- There's no way you can pay 100 million.

771
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,123
- Was your computer on?
- Yes.

772
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,544
I might be able to find the prime key
in the memory.

773
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,421
- Really?
- Let's see.

774
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,802
Chul-san.

775
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:47,098
Chul-san, wake up. It's morning.

776
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,726
What happened?

777
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,227
Did I fall asleep?

778
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:55,649
Did I, really? I'm not even human.

779
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,444
I'm an animal. I must be crazy.

780
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,489
I found the prime key
and removed the ransomware,

781
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,658
- so you don't have to quit.
- What?

782
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,662
That bastard isn't going to get any money.

783
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,082
Do-san.

784
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:17,295
Thank you. Thank you so much, Do-san.

785
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,005
Thank you.

786
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,009
So don't worry about a thing.

787
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,427
Go to work confidently.

788
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,012
- Okay.
- Keep your shoulders back.

789
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,472
- Okay.
- Okay?

790
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,390
- Okay.
- Okay?

791
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:29,516
Okay.

792
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,184
Chul-san.

793
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,229
Hey.

794
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,942
- Use this money.
- What's this?

795
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,945
It's my severance pay
and the money I got for my scooter.

796
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,156
It's not 100 million,
but I'm sure it'll help.

797
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,327
You're crazy.

798
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,788
You must get your job back.

799
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:55,208
Get down on your knees
in front of your boss or something, idiot.

800
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:58,169
Forget it. I wanted to quit anyway.

801
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,047
- I'm sick of being a cog in a machine.
- I mean…

802
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,841
Mr. Nam, can I work here?

803
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,592
You can, but…

804
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,804
I just removed the ransomware.

805
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,266
We don't need that money anymore.

806
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:17,689
Sorry.

807
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,322
You punk, why didn't you tell me earlier?

808
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,949
I already quit my job!

809
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,952
Hey! What are you going to do now?

810
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,996
- I'm sorry.
- Stop it.

811
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,497
- Don't fight.
- Stay out of this.

812
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,625
- I quit my job for you!
- Calm down, guys.

813
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,961
- I'm sorry.
- It's your fault!

814
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,422
- Why did you remove it?
- Why is it my fault?

815
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,257
- Why did you--
- Why are you blaming me?

816
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,789
Do-san, Yong-san.

817
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:18,875
Look at this.

818
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,128
This formula…

819
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,630
One good thing is

820
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,091
that because we joined the company,

821
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,176
we could change the name from Dosan Tech

822
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,053
to Samsan Tech.

823
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,389
Do-san sure is a genius.

824
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,684
All the big companies lost
hundreds of millions to that hacker,

825
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,728
- but Do-san stopped him.
- I know.

826
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,648
Do-san is the unofficial savior

827
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,525
of the country's economy.

828
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:47,695
I wouldn't mind giving up
my shares to Do-san at all.

829
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,739
If it's Do-san, I'm all for it, too.

830
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,700
But not if it's Seo Dal-mi.

831
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:57,163
Why? She looks like a nice person.
She's competent, too.

832
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,542
Let's face it, we couldn't have entered
Sand Box without her.

833
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:04,170
I know that.
I'm a good judge of character, too.

834
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,923
But don't you know

835
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,634
how she and Do-san met in the first place?

836
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,638
Gosh. Those letters.

837
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:16,099
How long do you think he can lie
about the letters?

838
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,727
Do you think Dal-mi will remain

839
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,565
even after finding out
that Do-san is fake?

840
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,484
She'll leave, for sure.

841
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:32,282
She may have been fixing our bugs so far,

842
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,953
but she'll be a bug herself
sooner or later.

843
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,394

SAMSAN TECH CEO SEO DAL-MI

851
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,801
WHAT MAKES A GREAT CEO?

852
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,270
Mr. Han.

853
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,313
You picked a useless book.

854
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:32,026
You know why? My mentor isn't
answering my questions,

855
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,653
so I'm hoping this book will.

856
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:34,988
I'll answer you.

857
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,950
Let me see. Question number one.

858
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,744
"What makes a great CEO?"

859
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,081
There's no such thing.

860
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,750
That's as absurd as asking
what makes a great politician.

861
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,420
Why? What's so absurd about it?

862
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,880
There are no right answers
to politics or management.

863
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,466
Why look for answers that don't exist?

864
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,720
So,

865
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,807
instead of looking for answers,
make choices.

866
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,892
Whatever you choose, you'll be criticized.

867
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:08,479
You can't make any decisions
if you're afraid of criticism.

868
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,399
And if you can't make decisions,
you can't be a CEO.

869
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,320
What do you want to be?

870
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,489
A good person or a CEO?

871
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,160
Don't be greedy. You can't be both.

872
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,913
Choose one. Just one.

873
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,709
WHAT MAKES A GREAT CEO?

874
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,170
It was 8,500 won.

875
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,713
- It's 8,500 won?
- A small bowl…

876
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,965
- What's with 500 won?
- But they give you a lot.

877
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,508
Really? Where is it?

878
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,515
JUNG SA-HA

879
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,101
We're just…

880
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,605
It was really good.

881
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:54,817
Really?

882
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,738
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

883
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,367
Yes, it's coming along pretty well.

884
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,744
What about your content? How's it going?

885
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,715
That's going to burst.

886
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,355
Hi, Dal-mi.

887
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,066
You have something to tell me?

888
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,028
SAMSAN TECH

889
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,863
I'm leaving the office. Where are you?

890
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,576
Hey, Chul-san.

891
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,873
Don't touch the milk.

892
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,085
"Don't touch the milk"?

893
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,755
Where is it? So what if I touch it?

894
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,507
I sure will touch it.

895
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,092
That petty little…

896
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:04,137
What will you do if I drink it?

897
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,643
Chul-san!

898
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,603
What is this?

899
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,733
- It hurts!
- Chul-san!

900
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,195
- What do I do?
- Do-san!

901
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,573
Do-san, I can't see anything!

902
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,158
Is this blood?

903
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,868
No, it isn't. I'm sorry, just wait!

904
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,828
Just wait.

905
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,123
Do-san, I can't open my eyes.

906
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,459
What if I'm going blind?

907
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,085
I told you not to touch it!

908
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,630
It stings!

909
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,216
Chul-san, look at me.

910
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,469
I said I can't see anything!

911
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:48,097
Move out of the way!

912
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,267
- What happened?
- The milk!

913
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,519
- The milk burst!
- Milk?

914
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,146
- Hurry up!
- Milk?

915
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:57,607
- The milk burst?
- Where are you, Yong-san?

916
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,442
- What are you talking about?
- Yong-san!

917
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,985
I'm here!

918
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,743
- Where is it?
- I can't open my eyes!

919
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,914
- It's this way.
- I can't see anything!

920
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:27,386
The medication doesn't stop vision loss.
It only slows it down.

921
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,263
Vision…

922
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:30,932
Doctor.

923
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,811
Am I going blind?

924
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,896
No, you're not.

925
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,314
Saline solution, please.

926
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,695
Doctor, it's salty.

927
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:48,658
Stay still. Why are you crying?

928
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:52,537
I'm crying because I feel ashamed.

929
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:56,332
I'm a piece of trash.
I'm an ungrateful piece of trash.

930
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,878
Doctor, I must see again. Okay?

931
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,298
If I don't, the last thing I'll have seen

932
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:09,220
will be the look of disappointment
in my friends' faces.

933
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,430
I must see them again.

934
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:15,309
- I get it. Just stay still.
- I'll try.

935
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,355
But it stings so much.

936
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:25,194
I threw a tantrum in front of my friends.

937
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:26,904
I said mean things.

938
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:29,198
Don't worry. We understand you.

939
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,868
Yes. We don't care. Just open your eyes.

940
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,494
Open your eyes now.

941
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:36,038
- Can I?
- Yes. What do you think?

942
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:37,915
Can you see?

943
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,585
Yes!

944
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,670
Doctor, I can see!

945
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,842
- Hey!
- Hey!

946
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:53,556
You're Yong-san. And you're Do-san.

947
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:57,143
I really thought I'd never see you again.

948
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,353
Seriously.

949
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,522
Look at me.

950
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:03,900
His eye boogers…

951
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,527
Doctor, his eye boogers are white.

952
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:08,988
That's not good, is it?

953
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:13,242
Your eye boogers may have
a little milk in them for a while.

954
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,786
Use teardrops for a few days,
and it'll be fine.

955
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,413
Thank you, Doctor.

956
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:20,791
Thank you. I'll be a good person.

957
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,501
Come here, guys.

958
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:27,173
I told you not to touch the milk,
didn't I?

959
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,716
Are you sure you can see me?

960
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,093
I can see you!

961
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,554
I can see you. Thank you, Doctor.

962
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,599
Your skills are out of this world.

963
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:38,976
Thank you.

964
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,228
Thank you.

965
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:49,987
I'm sorry for the mean things
I said to you guys.

966
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,907
What mean things?
I don't remember anything.

967
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,033
Me either.

968
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,745
Oh, it's from Ms. Seo.

969
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,289
She wants to have a meeting.

970
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:04,335
Do-san, no matter what decision I make
from now on,

971
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:06,087
please support me.

972
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:11,759
- Do-san.
- Yes?

973
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:13,678
I trust you.

974
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:15,680
No matter what.

975
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:17,515
And Ms. Seo--

976
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:20,184
Chul-san, if you trust me,

977
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,562
please trust Dal-mi, too.

978
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:28,567
Why did you have to cut in
and make me look petty?

979
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,069
I trust her.

980
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:33,030
I trust her like I trust you,
and I'll give up my shares to her.

981
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,449
Why won't you let me finish my sentence?

982
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,493
- Really?
- Yes.

983
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:38,786
So do a good job.

984
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:42,289
Okay. I'll make sure
we don't become a bug.

985
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:44,792
A bug?

986
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,796
Did you hear
everything we said last night?

987
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,715
- I did.
- Gosh.

988
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,759
You sneaky bastard.

989
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,762
- Come here.
- What?

990
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:58,431
Take that.

991
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,599
Let's go.

992
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,754
I made a new shareholders' list.

993
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,841
Kim Yong-san, Lee Chul-san,
Nam Seong-hwan,

994
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,885
and I get eight percent each.

995
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,387
Nam Cheon-ho gets one percent.

996
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:41,849
The largest shareholder is Nam Do-san
with 67 percent.

997
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,188
- Well…
- I want you all to respect my decision.

998
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:50,816
Also, I'd like everyone to speak formally
to each other at work.

999
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,612
It might be okay to speak informally now,
but when we recruit more people,

1000
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:57,740
we'll need some guidelines
regarding the way we communicate.

1001
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,659
So why don't we give ourselves
a head start by starting it now?

1002
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:04,413
- That sounds good to me.
- Okay.

1003
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,917
Are there any questions or comments?

1004
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:09,668
Hold on.

1005
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,462
Why do I get no shares?

1006
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,298
You do, in the other version.

1007
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,594
Here, everyone including you
gets seven percent each.

1008
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:22,515
Nam Cheon-ho gets one percent,
and Nam Do-san 64 percent.

1009
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,768
Why are there two versions?

1010
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:28,729
Your answer to the next question
will determine which version.

1011
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:34,944
Are you ready to speak formally
to everyone at work?

1012
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:37,488
No, I'm not.

1013
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:50,126
Okay, then. I'm sorry,
but you can't work with us anymore.

1014
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,127
What?

1015
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:55,965
Because I don't speak formally
to my colleagues?

1016
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:57,174
This is tyranny.

1017
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,884
You don't show up for work

1018
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,262
and ignore work-related calls.
That's tyranny.

1019
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,973
I can't work with someone like you.

1020
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:14,108
So? Which do you choose?

1021
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,238
Choose that one.

1022
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:24,660
SHAREHOLDERS' LIST

1023
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,621
SHAREHOLDERS' LIST

1024
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:40,634
- Hey, show your ID card.
- Oh, thanks.

1025
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,013
Here we go.

1026
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,140
Squeeze in.

1027
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,184
"Let's do this!" on the count of three.

1028
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,019
One, two, three.

1029
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,562
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

1030
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:04,617
Hey, I thought Dal-mi was
always easygoing,

1031
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,327
but she was so charismatic earlier.

1032
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:09,705
- I was so scared I couldn't say anything.
- I know.

1033
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:12,208
Aren't we supposed to speak formally
to each other?

1034
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,501
- I'm sorry.
- We'll stop.

1035
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,962
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

1036
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,798
Don't worry. It's okay.

1037
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:31,602
SHAREHOLDERS' LIST

1038
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:33,771
NAM DO-SAN 64%
SEO DAL-MI 7%

1039
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,900
I told you, it'll confuse the investors.

1040
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:40,402
Who is the key man
that they're dealing with?

1041
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:41,695
Ms. Seo or Mr. Nam?

1042
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:44,031
I'll be the one
dealing with the investors.

1043
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:48,244
But Mr. Nam will always accompany me
as our CTO.

1044
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:49,828
What if you two disagree?

1045
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,288
That's not going to happen.

1046
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:57,711
Since Mr. Nam has
the majority of the shares,

1047
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:01,131
he'll still be the largest shareholder
even if we get investors.

1048
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,633
So you're ignoring

1049
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,260
my opinion?

1050
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:07,638
No. I followed your advice.

1051
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,558
Whatever I choose,
I can't satisfy everyone.

1052
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,186
So I made a choice

1053
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:18,274
that I knew would be criticized
by only one person.

1054
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,944
And that person is me?

1055
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:23,904
I'm sorry.

1056
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:27,950
But I had to make a choice
because I'm the CEO.

1057
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,748
You're right. You're the CEO.

1058
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,003
Your support will be paid tomorrow.

1059
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:40,879
Thank you.

1060
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:47,011
- Are you not coming?
- You go ahead.

1061
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:49,013
I have something to discuss
with Ji-pyeong.

1062
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,473
Okay. Excuse me now.

1063
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,609
What do you want to talk about?

1064
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:13,912
What?

1065
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,665
At the meeting earlier,

1066
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,168
you were like a different person.

1067
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,212
Do you know how nervous I was?

1068
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,924
I thought my heart was going to burst.

1069
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,760
My heart is still pounding.

1070
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:31,972
But your heart is on the left side.

1071
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,183
Oh, right.

1072
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,644
Are you sure about this, though?

1073
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:41,482
Being the CEO without being
the majority shareholder?

1074
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:44,777
Why am I not the majority shareholder?
7 plus 64.

1075
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,404
I'm the CEO with 71 percent equity.

1076
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,745
You're my share in the company.
The one who is completely on my side.

1077
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:58,374
So we have to always be a team
no matter what.

1078
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,376
Understood?

1079
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:04,797
Is your grandma home?

1080
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:06,965
My grandma?

1081
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:09,468
I think so. Why?

1082
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:13,013
What do you want to talk about?

1083
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,766
I'm thinking of telling Dal-mi
the truth today.

1084
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:17,101
The truth?

1085
01:13:18,977 --> 01:13:19,895
About the letters?

1086
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:22,481
Yes.

1087
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,690
Why, all of a sudden?

1088
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:27,694
I want to remove a bug
that's bound to occur someday.

1089
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:35,119
Can I come in and say hi to her?

1090
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,662
Are you sure?

1091
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,288
I'd love that.

1092
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,293
Just a second.

1093
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,003
Wait just one minute.

1094
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,964
Actually, make it three.

1095
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,221
Grandma!

1096
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,266
Dal-mi, you're home. Did you eat?

1097
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:58,725
Grandma, Do-san is coming.

1098
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:01,311
Do-san? When?

1099
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:04,148
- Now.
- What? Now?

1100
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,691
Yes.

1101
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:08,735
Gosh, why, all of a sudden?

1102
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,405
Grandma, two minutes left.

1103
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,335
I have a little something for you.

1104
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:28,755
I made these…

1105
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,301
These are scrubbies I made myself.

1106
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:35,971
They're RGB, the primary colors of light.

1107
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,890
Maybe I don't need to mention RGB.

1108
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,187
- Come on in.
- Okay.

1109
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:49,902
- Put on these slippers.
- Okay.

1110
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,198
Grandma, Do-san is here.

1111
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:57,242
He is? Welcome.

1112
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,870
Hello, I'm Nam Do-san.

1113
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,714
You haven't seen each other
in 15 years, right?

1114
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:13,008
Can you recognize her?

1115
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:16,303
Grandma, do you remember him?

1116
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:25,020
The medication doesn't stop vision loss.

1117
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:26,772
- It only slows it down.
- Okay.

1118
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:32,069
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1119
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:52,256
You don't remember her?

1120
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:54,216
What?

1121
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:58,303
Well…

1122
01:16:04,851 --> 01:16:06,103
Of course, I do.

1123
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:13,777
It's been a long time.

1124
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:16,446
Yes.

1125
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,617
It's so nice to see you again, Do-san.

1126
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:53,877
I WANT TO GET MY REVENGE

1127
01:19:53,371 --> 01:19:55,874
SAMSAN TECH

1128
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,767
I don't really remember
what happened 15 years ago.

1129
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,477
I wish

1130
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:18,605
you didn't know me back then.

1131
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,440
Mr. Han,

1132
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:24,402
- are you jealous?
- We'll be able to last six months.

1133
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:28,073
We need to yield good result
in the next six months.

1134
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:29,866
I'm giving you information.

1135
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,952
Will you let this opportunity slip away?

1136
01:20:32,035 --> 01:20:32,994
Let's go.

1137
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:35,205
It would've been nice if you'd chosen
me like your sister.

1138
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:37,415
Shut up.

1139
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:43,672
