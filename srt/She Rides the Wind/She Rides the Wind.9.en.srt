Thank you, Qin Nan.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,040
You are welcome.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,440
Didn't you also save me at the KTV
last time?

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,600
The feeling is mutual.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,080
I found out that you are a good person.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,080
You don't seem like a bad person either.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,440
So how are you going to thank me
for saving your life?

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,200
I'm craving ice cream.

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,200
After going down the mountain,

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,840
I will treat you to ice cream.

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,000
Sure.

Why do we sit on the roof?

29

You must not have viewed
the mountain scenery

from this perspective before.

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,560
My dad always wanted me
to go hiking with him.

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,840
But because I was busy with work

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,920
and never had the chance.

34

I don't know whether

35
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,640
I can still accompany him to hike.

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,640
I am accustomed to handling issues
on my own.

38

My sister used

39

to ask me to accompany her to go hiking.

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,840
I have always been very busy.

41
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,140
After you go down the mountain,

42
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,600
you must take your sister
to go hiking once.

48
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,280
