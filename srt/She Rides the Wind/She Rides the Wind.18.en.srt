[Episode 18]
[Evidence]

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
This is the technical patent manual

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,560
of the Qin Group from the years

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,720
right after its establishment.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,080
I took it from my mom.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,440
She should get it

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,200
from your family's old residence.

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,680
Not only your dad

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,040
but also those founders from back then

25
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,320
have confirmed and signed inside.

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,040
She wants to use this manual

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,280
to take down the Qin Group

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,120
and then take revenge on you.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,360
Yafeng,

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,280
I am very grateful to you

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
for doing this.

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,600
I said,

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,400
no matter what my mom does to harm you,

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,320
I will take it for you.

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,640
And this.

[All recordings]

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,080
I need to rely

38
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,120
on the CloudTop Group behind you

39
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,240
to join me in reporting the Qin Group.

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,800
I join you.

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,000
I accidentally passed by the café
that day.

42
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,760
I saw my mom chatting with Fu Yunlan.

43
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,920
I just felt something wrong,

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,880
so I eavesdropped.

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,240
I found out

46
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,680
they were discussing how to cooperate

47
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,920
and use this manual

48
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,920
to take down the Qin Group.

49
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,080
Fu Yunlan thought
that I caused his sister's death.

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,080
He has not let it go.

51
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
He not only hates me,

52
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,120
but also wants to take revenge on me.

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,640
Anyway, Qin Nan,

54
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,240
you need to protect yourself well.

55
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't know what other tricks

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,960
they will come up with.

57
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Do not be used by them

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,360
and fall into their traps.

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,560
He dares to scheme against me.

60
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,040
I won't go easy either.

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,680
Qin Nan.

62
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,440
I am on a date with Qin Nan.

63
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,840
Irrelevant people should leave early.

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Don't make others dislike you.

65
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,960
I came to tell you something

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,080
very important.

67
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,520
Tong Qian told me

68
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,120
she has the handle
to take down the Qin Group.

69
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,200
I had someone investigate.

70
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,320
It's a manual.

71
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,200
You need to be wary of Tong Qian

72
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
to avoid being plotted against by her.

73
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,680
You said you investigated?

74
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,320
Where is that manual now?

75
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,640
I don't know for now.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,760
Fu Yunlan,

77
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,720
what other tricks do you want to play?

78
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,600
Isn't it that you and Tong Qian
conspire together

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,720
to harm me?

80
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,080
Qin Nan...

81
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
Stop hiding it.

82
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,840
I have already

83
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,480
taken that manual from my mom

84
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,550
and handed it over to Nan.

85
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,440
You don't have to get involved.

86
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,160
I have a recording
of what you talked about

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,240
with my mom at the café that day.

88
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,160
Do you want me to play it for you?

89
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,760
You agreed to cooperate with my mom.

90
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,720
It's none of your business.

91
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,760
Qin Nan,

92
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,160
I'm doing this to stabilize Tong Qian.

93
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,400
Please believe me.

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
Why should she believe you?

95
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
You initially suspected
that she harmed your sister,

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,560
but now you are tangled up with my mom.

97
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,080
Have you not made her suffer enough?

98
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,880
Don't say anymore.

99
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,240
Qin Nan,

100
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,640
maybe you have nothing to do
with my sister's death.

101
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
I was really too excited that day.

102
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,480
That's why I said those harsh words.

103
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,480
Can you forgive me, please?

104
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,240
Fu Yunlan,

105
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,360
you can go now.

106
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,040
I'm going to have dinner
with Tong Yafeng.

107
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,680
By the way,

108
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,280
I forgot to tell you.

109
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,920
Nan is my girlfriend now.

110
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,280
Qin Nan,

111
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,200
is what he said true?

112
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,840
Of course.

113
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,520
Nan,

114
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,000
I hope you won't be unhappy

115
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,080
with what I just said.

116
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,680
No.

117
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,920
Instead, I feel relieved.

118
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,360
That's good.

119
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,040
Let's go.

120
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,760
Yafeng,

121
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't like you,

122
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,320
even if there is no Fu Yunlan.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,560
Okay.

124
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,800
I got it.

125
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,600
Don't like me anymore in the future.

126
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,920
Because liking someone

127
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,800
is really too exhausting.

128
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,800
Mom.

129
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,120
Did you steal the manual?

130
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,160
Yes.

131
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,560
I gave it to Qin Nan.

132
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,040
This originally belongs to her company.

133
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,360
Are you still not my son?

134
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,280
You didn't help me.

135
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,920
You even stole the manual
and gave it to Qin Nan.

136
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,480
Do you know you ruined my plan?

137
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,240
Mom,

138
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,720
let it go.

139
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
Can you stop getting revenge?

140
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,400
Go away.

141
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,120
Get out of here right now.

142
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,480
From today on,

143
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,760
you are no longer my son.

144
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Fu.

145
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
When I went to Tong Qian's house,

146
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,080
I didn't know there was someone here.

147
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,760
We were schemed against by Tong Qian.

148
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,920
You asked me to check the photo before.

149
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,400
I found some information.

150
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,120
Your sister had an ambiguous
relationship

151
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,680
with Luo Sen.

152
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,880
She admired Luo Sen very much.

153
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,600
Qin Nan was accompanying her father
on a business trip abroad.

154
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,760
She may not be aware of this matter.

155
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,160
Luo Sen...

156
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,080
Luo Sen has always been a scumbag.

157
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,920
He often messes around
with various women.

158
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,860
How could she think

159
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,320
that Qin Nan is Luo Sen's wife?

160
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,040
She was deceived by Luo Sen's eloquence.

161
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,360
My sister and I

162
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,800
are both sorry to Qin Nan.

163
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,920
Qin Nan,

164
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm sorry for you.

165
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,680
I misunderstood you.

166
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,280
Mr. Fu, please stop drinking.

167
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,480
Get out of the way.

168
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm going to find her.

169
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,000
Nan,

170
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,520
you stayed up all night again.

171
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,160
Are you okay?

172
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,320
Although the Qin Group has started
the new business now,

173
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,640
and there has been some improvement,

174
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,800
it still faces significant problems.

175
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,640
I am currently thinking

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,560
about how to seek greater opportunities

177
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,360
for expansion

178
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
in a fierce market environment.

179
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,480
I've heard about your matter
with Fu Yunlan.

180
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,440
Didn't expect that, did you?

181
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,560
I've fallen for a man once again.

182
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,880
Men are all unreliable.

183
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,240
You still have me, don't you?

184
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,880
If you need a shoulder to lean on,

185
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,200
I am always here.

186
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,240
I'm fine.

187
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,240
Don't worry.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I am the acting president
of the Qin Group.

189
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,560

190
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,920
