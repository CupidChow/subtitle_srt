Qin Nan,

189
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,800
do you really feel nothing for me

190
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,120
no matter how I treat you?

191
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,920
It's true

192
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,920
that I originally concealed my identity.

193
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,520
It was because I thought

194
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,800
you were the one
who caused my sister's suicide.

195
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,600
I investigated my sister's matter

196
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
and didn't tell you the truth.

197
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,440
Because I'm afraid of dragging you down

198
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,800
and putting you in danger.

199
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,200
Indeed,

200
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,680
I have destroyed your trust in me.

201
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,440
But you can't keep not believing me

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,480
because of what happened before.

203
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,840
Everything you did to me is built
on deception.

204
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,400
Don't speak

205
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,800
so grandly, okay?

206
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,200
Don't think that your kindness to me

207
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,840
can beautify these deceptions.

208
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,240
You can go.

209
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,840
I don't need you anymore.
