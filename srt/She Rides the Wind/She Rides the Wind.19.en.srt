00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,320
I just saw Fu Yunlan downstairs.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,480
He seems to be drunk.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,080
He looks quite pitiful.

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Do you want to go check on him?

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm going downstairs now.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,520
Mr. Fu,

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,420
you have been waiting for Ms. Qin
for two hours.

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,560
Why are you doing this?

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,840
If I don't use this method,

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,080
she may never see me again
in her lifetime.

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,200
What are you doing here?

Qin Nan...

29
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,120
Do you hate me that much?

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,960
You'd rather work overtime in the office
than go home.

31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,320
What are you afraid of?

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,400
Are you afraid that I haven't
moved out yet?

33

Aren't you also away from home
for a night?

What relationship do I have with you?

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,200

If you do not engage in new projects,

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,360
I don't know

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,480

Sorry, I have something else to do.

51

Excuse me.

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,960
If CloudTop Group works
with the Qin Group,

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,360
what else

54
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,280
is more of a waste of time than this?

If CloudTop Group and the Qin Group
reach a cooperation,

for the Qin Group,

58
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,560
it should be beneficial
with no harm, right?

59

That is for sure.

we are discussing cooperation.

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
The foundation of cooperation
is equality,

77
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,240
mutual benefits, and shared interests.

78
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,640
This contract is unequal.

79
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,360

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,240

I sincerely want to cooperate with you.

86
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,000
But you show me this.

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,120
After the Qin Group and CloudTop
reach a cooperation,

88
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,520
you want to take the dominant position

89
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,200
and 60% of the profits.

90
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,960
I think I have written it very clearly

91
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,320
in black and white.

92
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,800
You don't have to ask me anymore, right?

93
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,000
Sure.

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,200
If it's you who want it,

95
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,120

How about it?

99
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,680
As long as we reach a cooperation,

100
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,760
you can state any conditions.

101
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,320
Fine.

102
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,480
Since you agree to the terms
of this contract,

103
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,280
once you has signed,

104
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,560
the follow-up work

105

between your assistant and my secretary.

The only basis for our cooperation

107
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
is just you.

108
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,280
If your group sends someone else
to talk to me,

109
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,800
then there's no need to cooperate.

This is very unfavorable for us.

123
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,000
This is not a cooperation at all.

124
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,240

129
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,960
