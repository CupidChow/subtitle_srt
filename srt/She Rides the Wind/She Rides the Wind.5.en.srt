If I report your actions to the police,

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,880
it could get you imprisoned

190
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,200
There will be plenty of opportunities
to meet in the future.

191
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,160
I advise you

192
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
to have

193
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,000
more trust

194
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,480
and less suspicion

195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,040
in your partner.

196
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,480
Qin Nan,

197
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,480
I will remind you

198
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,680
of those heinous things you have done.

199
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,360
You must hold on
even if others misunderstand you.

200
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,280
Protecting the group is your mission.

201
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,380
You must never give up
until the mission is accomplished.
