17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,280
Qin Nan.

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,440
Yafeng, why are you here?

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,920
Come in and sit down.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,800
Thank you.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,960
Nan,

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,000
I plan to leave this city.

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,480
Aren't you still in school?

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,480
I applied to the school
for a one-year leave of absence.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,640
Is it because your mom's situation

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,880
has affected your studies?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,480
No.

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,040
I want to go out.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,640
I have already known

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,760
about the things

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,480
my mom has done to you,

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,440
the Qin Group, and your father.

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,520
Being a mom is not easy.

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,320
I just don't know how to face you.

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,320
I told you before that I like you.

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,160
I am serious.

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,280
But I think

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,560
I am still not mature enough now.

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,000
I can't protect you.

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,200
So I want to go out

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
and see this world

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,960
to gain some experience.

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,840
I will come back to find you

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,440
after a year.

45
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,400
Okay.

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,840
Then keep in touch with me.

47
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,280
Otherwise I will worry about you.

48
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,840
Nan,

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,680
I can feel

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,520
that Mr. Fu really loves you.

51
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,880
I can understand you

52
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,720
why you are no longer willing
to accept him.

53
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,080
Once the trust
between two people collapses,

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,240
everything will be lost.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,400
But Nan, have you ever thought

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,880
that you will feel regret

57
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,040
when you grow old

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,400
if you miss him like this?

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,520
Talk about it when I get old.

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,040
Who has no regrets in this life?

61
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,440
What you said is not wrong.

62
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,920
But I really hope you can be
a little braver.

63
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
In this world,

64
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,000
there are neither perfect people,

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,040
nor perfect relationships.

66
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,840
Mr. Fu may have deceived you.

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,080
But he truly loves you.

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,680
I think you should think
about it more carefully.

69
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,840
If he can stay by your side
to protect you,

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,840
I can feel more at ease then

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,120
after I leave.

72
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,280
Well,

73
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,040
I'm going.

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,920
Take care.

75
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,400
Nan,

76
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
in this world,

77
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,000
there are no perfect people,

78
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,040
nor are there perfect relationships.

79
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,120
Fu Yunlan,

80
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,800
I'll give you a chance.

81
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,960
Let's talk properly.

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,640
Minmin.

83
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,960
What are you doing here, Minmin?

84
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,560
Help me!

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,560
Do you still ask me to save you,

86
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,520
Ms. Qin?

87
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,040
What do you mean, Minmin?

88
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,680
Why are you doing this?

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
Are you being manipulated by Tong Qian?

90
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,120
Tong Qian is unable
to protect herself now.

91
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,160
How can she force me to do all this?

92
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,960
I did it all.

93
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Because I hate you.

94
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,600
I hate you for taking everything
from me,

95
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
so that the first half of my life

96
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,320
was so miserable.

97
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,880
Minmin, I can't understand you.

98
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,040
You don't need to understand.

99
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,960
Mr. Fu,

100
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,440
Xue Minmin just called
and said that she kidnapped Qin Nan.

101
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,280
She asked you to prepare 5 million.

102
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,320
Otherwise, she will kill Qin Nan.

103
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,480
Bai Ye,

104
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,720
I have already called Fu Yunlan.

105
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,440
He will bring the money over.

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,360
When the time comes,

107
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,960
we will kill them all at once.

108
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,040
When we take our revenge

109
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,640
and get the money,

110
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,720
we no longer

111
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,680
have to live those difficult days
of our childhood.

112
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Just wait for your lover to save you.

113
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,520
Minmin,

114
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,480
let go of me.

115
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:34,920
Bai Ye,

116
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,160
go take a look.

117
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,600
Leave it to me.

118
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,360
Mr. Fu,

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,040
long time no see.

120
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,320
I have already prepared the money.

121
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,800
Where is Qin Nan?

122
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,480
Give me the money.

123
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,600
I'll take you to meet your lover.

124
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,520
Before I see Qin Nan,

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,960
you can't take a single cent away.

126
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,720
Mr. Fu,

127
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,200
even when facing death,
you still talk tough.

128
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,280
Today, the money must stay here

129
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,960
and you are not allowed to leave.

130
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,280
Let go of me, Xue Minmin.

131
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,920
Let go.

132
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,440
Qin Nan,

133
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
your dad and Fu Yunlan

134
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,040
are the two people
you love the most in this world.

135
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,910
Your dad has ended up in my hands.

136
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,840
If Fu Yunlan also ends up in my hands,

137
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,480
how would you feel?
