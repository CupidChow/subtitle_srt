17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,880
Fu Yunlan,

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,280
I'm the acting president
of the Qin Group.

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,400
I'd like to talk to you
about cooperation.

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,280
I'm not interested.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,280
I am no longer the CTO.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,680
I can't work with you.

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,720
Feel free to make any requests.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,440
I will satisfy you.

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,200
You are really persistent.

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,720
This is strong Vodka.

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,280
One drink will make you drunk.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,120
If you can drink three cups,

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,920
I'll give you three minutes

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,600
to talk about our cooperation.

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,720
How long can I talk to you?

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,560
To show my sincerity,

[Contract]

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,240
I also brought the contract.

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,280
I believe you will be very satisfied

37
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,480
with the terms written on it.

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,720
I said I would talk to you
about cooperation,

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,240
but I haven't agreed to your offer.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,760
What do I have to do

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
to get you to agree to work with us?

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,640
It's impossible.

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,280
You are the one asking for help,

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,240
yet you act as if you are in control.

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,040
It's really annoying.

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,760
I'm going to make you obedient

47
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,440
and beg me.

48
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,200
Fu Yunlan,

49
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,960
don't push your luck.

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,280
Is this your attitude?

51
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,320
It's really boring.

52
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,800
Everyone, get out.

53
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,050
- Who is she?
- Let's go.

54
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,560
Fu Yunlan,

55
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,160
I don't know why you tease me like this.

56
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,080
But I hope you can seriously consider

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,200
what I said.

58
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,160
Working with our group,

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,680
for you

60
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,760
and me,

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,280
is a win-win choice.

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,840
I can agree to work with you.

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,080
But

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,000
you have to agree to one condition.

65
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,800
What condition?

66
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,080
Come over.

67
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,120
I am a married woman, you know.

68
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
You are so beautiful.

69

Who wouldn't want to have you?

70
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,600
You can rest assured.

71
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,320
I won't do anything to you.

72
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,400
I just want you to be my partner.

73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,320
Be your partner?

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,440
You have ulterior motives, right?

75
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,400
Who says a partner

76
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,360
must have ulterior motives?

77
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,680
I will think carefully
about your proposal.

78
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,950
Fu Yunlan

79
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,880
is indeed difficult to deal with.

80
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,270
I didn't expect to cost me something

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,920
to take him down.

your game with me has just begun.

86

In order to become the acting president,

87
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,520
I have to agree to Fu Yunlan's
condition.

88
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,960
After getting Fu Yunlan done,

89
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,160
I still need to gain the support
of the directors.

90
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,960
According to my investigation,

91
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,200
Mr. Zhou

92
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,680
is addicted to gambling.

93
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,590
Almost every week, he goes

94
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,040
to his private club to gamble.

95
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,080
Mr. Zhang,

96
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,840
I have a good hand.

97
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,680
Think it over before you're in.

98
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,080
I just don't believe

99
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,520

100
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,880

If you lose,

104
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,920
you owe me the money for the Ferrari.

105
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,440
I will use this money

to go shopping in Paris.

107
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,560
So just deal.

Mr. Zhang,

109
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,640
why not take me with you
to shop in Paris?

110
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,320

he is good in everything.

121
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,880
But he is just very lustful.

122

for such an important meeting.

171
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,840
are your guns.

172

We'll shoot

173
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440

174
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
