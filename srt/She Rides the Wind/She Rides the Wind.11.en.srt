it turns out you were tempting my son.

I found two of his subordinates.

163
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,920
They said

164
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,800
Mr. Zhao has met Fu Yunlan

165
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,480
before something happened.

166
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,080
It seems

169
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,640
I see.

170
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,560
No wonder

171
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,480
Fu Yunlan

172
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,480
is willing to work at the Qin Group.

173
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,900
It turns out he had a plan all along.

174
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,020
This person cannot be kept.

175
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,520
Got it.
