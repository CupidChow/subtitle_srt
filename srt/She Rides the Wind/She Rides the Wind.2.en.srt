That's a new business.

192
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,950
I have negotiated with Fu Yunlan
for so long

193
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,350
but haven't come to any conclusion.

194
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,760
She lives a life of comfort every day

195
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
and is dedicated to getting pregnant.

196
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,520
What can we expect her to do?

197
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,720
Fu Yunlan.

198
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,360
I will

199
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,280
definitely take him down.

200
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,640
Minmin,

201
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,310
help me check the information
on Fu Yunlan.

202
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,360
Fu Yunlan is the CTO
of the Simulator.

203
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,300
He quit his job for some reason

204
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,840
and spent all day in a drunken stupor.

205
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,980
[PARTY PARK]

206
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,420
Fu Yunlan,

207
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,800
the Qin Technology Group

208
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,760
is one of the top enterprises

209
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,680
in the industry.

210
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,040
You actually didn't show me any respect

211
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,680
and made me find you so many times.

212
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,080
I want to see

213
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,920
how much capability you have.

214
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,960
Fu Yunlan,

215
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,360
I'm the acting president
of the Qin Group.

216
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,480
I'd like to talk to you
about cooperation.
