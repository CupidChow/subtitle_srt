[Episode 15]
[Identity]

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Then why don't you

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,080
believe in love anymore?

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,720
You know

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,960
I have been through a marriage,

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,240
and I have experienced betrayal.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,480
So for me,

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,400
love is very luxurious.

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,040
I once lost the most important person

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,080
due to my mistakes.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,800
Qin Nan,

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,960
from now on,

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,400
stay by my side.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,480
There will be no betrayal.

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,160
I will also not let you
be in danger again.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,200
I promise

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,200
no one can hurt you.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,360
Qin Nan!

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
I am putting on makeup.

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,520
It will be ready soon.

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm going to the company.

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,040
I saw you were still sleeping,

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,680
so I didn't wake you up.

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,360
If you get up first,

40
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,640
I will feel particularly insecure.

41
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,440
Didn't I say if I don't need you,
you don't come to me?

42
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,400
Today the situation is special.

43
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,680
I found some information

44
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,240
about Fu Yunlan.

45
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,200
Isn't that Fu Yunya...

46
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,040
His sister who has been missing
for many years.

47
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,960
Over ten years ago,

48
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,560
she was abducted.

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,520
No wonder

50
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,320
he has always targeted us.

51
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
What should we do now?

52
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,560
If we shift the blame onto Qin Nan,

53
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,080
and let Fu Yunlan know

54
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,840
that Qin Nan is the real culprit
who killed his sister,

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
this show will definitely be wonderful.

56
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,360
Hello?

57
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,730
Mr. Fu.

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,760
No,

59
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,340
I should call you

60
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,680
Vice President Fu,

61
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,600
from CloudTop Investment Group.

62
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,000
What's the matter?

63
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,520
It's hard to explain over the phone.

64
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,120
How about we meet and talk?

65
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,760
I'm not interested.

66
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,110
Don't you want to know

67
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,750
about your sister Fu Yunya?

68
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,240
Mr. Fu,

69
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,680
what would you like to drink?

70
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,760
Whiskey

71
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,160
or red wine?

72
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,880
I won't drink anymore.

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,400
You should know what I'm here for.

74
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,040
Tell me about that message.

75
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,360
Mr. Fu,

76
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,360
you are being so harsh on me.

77
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,400
I would be afraid to speak.

78
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,960
Can you say it now?

79
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,440
I know you have some opinions about me.

80
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,800
I ruined the marriage
between Qin Nan and Luo Sen,

81
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,560
so Qin Nan

82
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,440
is targeting me.

83
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,280
These are the facts.

84
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,280
You deserve it.

85
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,860
[Fu Yunya]

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,640
Your sister is Luo Sen's first love.

87
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,400
I heard

88
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,360
that your sister has always had a crush
on Luo Sen.

89
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,720
But Luo Sen married Qin Nan.

90
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,480
But your sister still entangled
with him.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So Qin Nan sent your sister to Mr. Zhao

92
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,560
to defile her.

93
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,120
Tong Qian,

94
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,040
do you think I believe what you say?

95
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,920
Why don't you believe it?

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,120
You said

97
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,800
Qin Nan instructed my sister
to meet Mr. Zhao.

98
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,600
Why did my sister listen to her

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,400
and meet Mr. Zhao?

100
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,920
You have to ask her about that.

101
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,360
This woman has many tricks.

102
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,040
Who knows how she convinced your sister?

103
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,240
Tong Qian,

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,320
as far as I know,

105
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,000
you are also involved
in my sister's matter.

106
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,800
I won't believe

107
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,600
a single word you just said.

108
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't worry.

109
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,480
I will soon find

110
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,240
evidence of you murdering my sister.

111
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,320
Your sister was killed by Qin Nan.

112
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,320
Don't be fooled by her.

113
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
Tong Qian has already known
my true identity.

114
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,680
You have to find evidence
as soon as possible.

115
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,320
I want to confirm

116
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,640
whether Qin Nan is related
to my sister's death?

117
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
It turns out you conspired
with Tong Qian.

118
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,080
I'll go find you to make it clear.

119
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,840
Mr. Fu,

120
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,880
no,

121
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,840
Vice President Fu,

122
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,800
from CloudTop Investment Group.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,200
Why did you ask me out?

124
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,120
Miss me?

125
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,680
Didn't we just see each other
at my house last night?

126
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
It's nothing.

127
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,840
I'm just very curious.

128
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,760
You, a woman, with a child,

129
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,200
flirt with so many men.

130
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,280
Don't you really care

131
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,440
about your son's feelings?

132
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,760
Why?

133
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,560
Are you jealous?

134
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,960
Want me to be obsessed with just you?

135
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,920
Tong Qian,

136
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,480
remember this.

137
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,000
Qin Nan is not someone
who relies on men.

138
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,240
Qin Nan has good fortune.

139
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,720
She does not depend on men.

140
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,560
But men come to her on their own.

141
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,640
Whatever.

142
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,560
Anyway, she is not like you.

143
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,000
Since she is so good,

144
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,920
why did you ask me out?
