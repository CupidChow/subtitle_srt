Don't put all your thoughts

It seems that you really likes
to take risks.

145
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,200
It's not because I like to take risks.

146
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,000
It's because you are worth it.

147
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,160
Don't rush.

148
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,080

Why did you scare him away?

164

I just kindly reminded him.

165
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,080
As an employer,

166
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,800
if you don't explain this clearly
to him,

00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,840
what if he encounters
some kind of accident

168
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,160

169
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,360
Won't he blame you,

170
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,200

171
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,840
Won't we do the new business

172
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
just because Fu Yunlan

173
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,840
accidentally had a car accident?

174
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,040
Of course we do.
