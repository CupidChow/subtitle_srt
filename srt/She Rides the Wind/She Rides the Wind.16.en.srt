Anyway, she is not like you.

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,360
Since she is so good,

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,280
why did you ask me out?

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,160
It's nothing.

what do you go to the 38th floor for?

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,440
I've checked the photo.

It's true.

There are no signs of editing.

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,320
But I still want to know

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,440
how Qin Nan made my sister

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,640
listen to her.

31
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,240
Mr. Fu,

you approached Qin Nan,

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,360
gained her trust,

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,800
and even made her fall in love with you.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,520
Isn't it just to know this?

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,480
Why did you

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,040
ask me out alone?

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,400
Don't be stubborn.

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,480
You just miss me, right?

40

what do you want to do?

42

what brought you here?

51

Sit down.

52
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,440
Mr. Fu,

53
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,440
you work at the Qin Group

54
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,360
and hide your true identity from Ms. Qin

55
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,800
just to investigate
your sister's matter, right?

56
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,300
Yes.

57
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
I knew it.

58
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,880
So everything is fake.

59
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,160
Nan

60
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,080
is just a pawn in your game,

61
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,250
isn't it?

62
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,670
Yes.

63
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,600
I approached Qin Nan and used her

64
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,840
to investigate

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,560
the case of my sister's murder

66
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,440
in order to seek revenge.

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,080
You finally spoke the truth.

68
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,720
Nan,

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,560
don't be too sad.

70
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,360
You look very stylish
in a trench coat today.

71
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,960
So it is the reason

72
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,000
why you colluded with Tong Qian

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,240
to torment me.

74
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,280
What do you mean?

75
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,080
Watch it for yourself.

76
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,000
Let me explain to you.

77
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,000
My relationship with Tong Qian

78
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,080
is not what you think.

79
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,880
I have no relationship with her.

80
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,040
I don't believe at all

81
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,400
in what Tong Qian says or does.

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,240
But your clothes

83
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,320
and your body

84
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,280
make me believe

85
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
in every single thing
you once did to me.

86
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,840
I originally no longer believed in love.

87
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,400
But you showed up.

88
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,040
It's you

89
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,120
who makes me take this game
more seriously.

90
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,520
It is also you

91
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,360
who reignited my hope for love

92
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,360
when I felt disheartened.

93
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,040
I thought you were my salvation.

94
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,160
But I didn't expect you

95
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,640
to be my deepest abyss.

96
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,840
You won.

97
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,360
I fell into your abyss.

98
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,840
But it's okay.

99
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
No matter how deep it is,

100
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,600
I can climb out little by little.

101
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,760
Now pack up your things

102
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,280
and move out of my house.

103
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,280
It's over.

104
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,440
I really can't believe

105
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,640
I am deceived by a man once again.

106
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,120
What is true and what is false

107
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,400
in everything that has happened
during this time?

108
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,600
Who else can I trust now?

109
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,080
Only myself.

110
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,320
Even if I fight alone,

111
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,920
I won't let anyone

112
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,120
do harm to the group,

113

are you alone?

117
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,200
Get lost.

118
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,680
Come on, let's have a drink.

119
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,000
- Here.
- Get lost.

120
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,800
Can't you hear me?

121
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,880
How about I drink with you?

122
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
Who are you?

123
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,960
Go away.

124
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,960
Qin Nan,

125
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,520
you drank so much.

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,080
Long time no see.

128
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,480
Yeah.

129
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,000
Long time no see.

130
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,320
Qin Nan,

131
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,840
how did you become like this?

132
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,080
Why didn't Mr. Fu come?

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,840
Don't bring him up in front of me.

134
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,960
Why not?

135
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,760
Because we broke up.

136
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,400
Completely.

137
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,440
He hates me.

138
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,880
I hate him.

139
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,360
It's best for us

140
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
to never have any contact
in this lifetime.

141
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,080
You broke up?

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,480
Why?

143
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,920
He thought I was the one

144
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,600
who murdered his sister.

145
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,880
He is not a good person.

146
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,400
You are not a good person either.

147
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,560
Yeah, I'm not a good person.

148
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,520
Laugh at me, Tong Yafeng.

149
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,320
Everything you just said

150
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
has no basis.

151
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,280
You drank too much.

152
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,880
Let me take you home.

153
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,720
I won't go home.

154
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,000
I live in a hotel now.

155
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,880
I can't bear to stay at the house

156
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,850
where I once lived with him.

157
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,480
I just want to stay away from it.

158
