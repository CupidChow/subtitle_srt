You can go now.

I don't need you anymore.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,480
Qin Nan,

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,000
it is you

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,480
who push me away personally.

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,680
Qin Nan,

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,880
what happened between you and Fu Yunlan?

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,480
You didn't have a quarrel, did you?

25
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,520
We were originally strangers.

26
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,200
It's normal to have conflicts.

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,440
But

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,520
didn't you say you were going
to cooperate?

You can rest assured.

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,570
I can handle it myself.

Okay.

didn't she?

I guessed it.

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,640
The press conference did not
take place today,

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,280
turning bullish into bearish.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,480
This gave me the opportunity

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
to short the Qin Group.

As long as the Qin's share price
doesn't suddenly surge,

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,160
Ms. Qin,

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,520
we chose you to be the acting president.

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,480
Since you took office,

59
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,310
has the Qin Group been stable
for one day?

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,200
My proposal is

61
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,480
to replace her.

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,120
The Qin Group is in crisis,
and I have a duty.

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,680
But now is not the time to assign blame.

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,960
First, we should unite internally

65
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,360
and think about how to solve it.

66
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,440
If it can't be solved,

67
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,200
then we can assign blame later.

68
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,320
In this situation,

69
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,160
I think

70
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,280
there are definitely people
maliciously shorting our group.

71
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,400
Today I raised a sum of money

72
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,960
to repurchase the stocks

73
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,360

at a low price.

Ms. Qin,

75
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,120
how much have you prepared?

76
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,000
Can you handle the airdrop
from the other side?

77
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,560
It seems there are multiple parties
involved in the airdrop.

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,360
Our current funds are far from enough.

79
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,160
So what should we do now?

80
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,720
Is there any way for us
to raise the share price?

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,360
If our cooperation with CloudTop

82
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,400
was finalized this morning,

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,240
the share price would have soared.

84

But what about now?

85
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,440
It has directly turned
into a bearish signal,

86
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,040
let alone a bullish one.

cannot be implemented?

89
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,520
The share price is close
to the limit-up.

90
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,080
Tong Qian probably has lost
a fortune by now.

91
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
I have already called the police.

92
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,960
She manipulated the market,

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,920
shorted the group maliciously,

94
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,480
and collaborated with Muddy Waters
to commit financial fraud.

95
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,040
Anyway, none of the things she has done
can escape accountability.

98
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,160
No need to thank me.

99
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,240
You suddenly came up with an idea
in the car,

100
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,960
suggesting to take advantage
of the situation

101
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,440
and postpone our release.

102
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,480
Only then can we pull the firewood from
under the pot.

103
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,840
Mr. Fu Yunlan,

104
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,240
may I ask in what capacity

105
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,360
you are cooperating with the Qin Group?

106
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,640
Is it related to the new project

107
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
launched by the Qin Group?

108
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,640
This time,

109
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,920
I represent the CloudTop Group

110
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,520
to cooperate with the Qin Group.

111
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,520
That is because

112
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,560
I have an identity that is unknown
to the outside world.

113
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,400
Do you mean the Vice President
of the CloudTop Group?

114
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,760
Yes.

115
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,760
Meanwhile,

116
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,880
I am also Ms. Qin Nan's

117
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,920

118
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,240
The Qin Group has fallen
into a financial crisis this time.

119
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,920
Does this affect your cooperation?

120
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,400
We have already investigated clearly

121
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,880
that this incident

122
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,320
was caused by Tong Qian,
Qin's former general manager.

123
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,080
She maliciously fabricated
public opinion

124
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,760
and shorted Qin's share price
with non-performing assets.

125
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,600
We have submitted the relevant evidence

126
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,000
to a third-party organization.

127
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,120
The rumor will soon fall apart.

128
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,840
Thank you.

129
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,400
The reporters are all here.

130
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,400
I didn't expect Qin Nan and Fu Yunlan

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,640
to actually be a couple.

132
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,840
Such a perfect match.

133
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,240
Exactly.

134
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,220
Qin Nan,

135
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,800
can you give me another chance?

136
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,520
Fu Yunlan,

137
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,600
a broken mirror cannot be rejoined.

138
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,160
Even if we start over,

139
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,680
there will also be a crack

140
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,960
between us.

141
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,440
And this crack

142
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,840
is just like my trust in you.

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,520
If you deceive me once,

144
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,480
I will keep thinking about it.

145
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,800
This is what hurts me the most.

146
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,600
Do you know?

147
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,760
Then I will fix this crack.

148
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,040
One year.

149
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,160
Ten years.

150
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,120
A lifetime.

151
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,320
As long as you give me the chance.

152
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,320
Qin Nan, please give me a chance, okay?

153
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,120
I'm begging you.

154
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,360
Don't think that you are the only one
who can't forget this relationship.

155
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,600
So do I.

156
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,600
I can't forget either.

157
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,040
I am also in pain.

158
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,400
But at least I am clear-headed.

159
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,800
I clearly know

160
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,800
there is no possibility for us anymore.

161
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,560
Qin Nan,

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,040
is there really no possibility
for us anymore?

163
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,440
That's right.

164
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,440
Qin Nan,

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,320
what can I do to make you believe
in me again?

166
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Fu Yunlan,

167
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,480
thank you.

168
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,640
Thank you for always being here

169
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,880
when I need help.

170
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,760
Thank you for letting me
feel a moment of beauty.

171
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,240
Forgive me for not being able
to say these words to you in person.

172
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,200
I can no longer give you any hope.

173
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,680
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,280
I am tired.

175
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,880
I have experienced betrayal twice.

176
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,800
My heart is already filled with wounds.

177
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,720
I can no longer endure any more pain.

178
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,320
Fine.

179
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,000
I let you go.

180
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,360
Wish you happiness.

181
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,920
Farewell,

182
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Fu Yunlan.
