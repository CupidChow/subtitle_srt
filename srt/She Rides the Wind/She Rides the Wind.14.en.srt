I have a security camera in the office.

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,160
Every move you make
has already been recorded.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,360
When did you install the surveillance?

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,480
Are you afraid

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,240
that more of your ugly deeds
will be exposed?

It's so late.

Hurry home and accompany your wife.

I have installed a camera in my office.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,800
Not only did it capture evidence
of Luo Sen cheating on you,

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,560

You've been with my dad for so long.

45
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,280
You're always unwilling to be a manager.

46
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,440

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,880
Then you rushed us to get married,

50

and go home to prepare for pregnancy.

You seduced me

126

and made me fall in love with you,

didn't you?

129
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,160
Why did you treat me like this?

130
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,960
I rebelled against my mom
for the first time

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,160
in order to be with you.

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,880
I even thought

133
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,800
that if she disagreed,

134
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,600
I would sever our relationship.

135
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,200

I fell in love with you.

139

Can you afford it?

Actually, this is all my fault.

166
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,790
I shouldn't have dragged him

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,840
it was already late.

170
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,680

you are not wrong.

173
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
It's not your fault.

174
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,760
Actually, I understand him.

175
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,640
Because I've also

176
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,440
been obsessive about love

177
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,160
and lost my way

178
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,080
in a relationship.

179
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Then why don't you

180
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,020
believe in love anymore?
