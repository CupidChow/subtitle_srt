1
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,002
WOULD YOU LIKE TO VOTE?

2
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:00,019
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,312
SAFETY OF CHILD ACTORS WAS ENSURED

4
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:02,688
{\an8}No, Kim Mu-chan!

5
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,899
{\an8}This is what the people want!

6
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,692
{\an8}Everyone wants him dead!

7
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:07,777
{\an8}Don't move!

8
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,738
{\an8}If you keep him alive,
there will be more victims like Na-rae!

9
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,282
{\an8}Mu-chan, just let him die!

10
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,598
{\an8}Mu-chan, no!

11
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,770
{\an8}<i>Press the shock button.</i>

12
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:43,771
{\an8}Kim Mu-chan.

13
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:46,732
{\an8}You also

14
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:49,652
{\an8}wanted to kill him.

15
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:52,279
No.

16
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,406
Don't, Mu-chan. No.

17
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,454
I guess

18
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,626
you can't turn a blind eye
and let me go this time?

19
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,549
You'll never be able to stop then.

20
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,930
Now is the only chance to go back.

21
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,868
No!

22
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,986
EIGHT YEARS AGO

23
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,743
{\an8}<i>I'm sneaking this out for you</i>
<i>since you're my colleague,</i>

24
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,995
{\an8}<i>but you shouldn't get involved</i>
<i>with Lee Yun-seong.</i>

25
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,331
<i>Instead of having something bad</i>
<i>happen to you, just quit the case.</i>

26
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,082
<i>Because things won't end well.</i>

27
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,510
Hey, Jin-soo. My man.

28
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,639
This is new. You never work overtime.

29
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,807
Is this required to make commissioner?

30
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:44,767
Oh, come on.

31
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,145
Unless our junior officers help,
I can't even think about it.

32
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:52,858
I heard Mu-chan found evidence
that showed Byun had an accomplice.

33
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,027
Is it true or just a bluff?

34
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,989
I guess Lee's family is pretty powerful.

35
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,575
Don't get involved.
He's definitely an accomplice.

36
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:05,120
I'm not the one involved. You are.

37
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:09,124
When you took the money
without question the other day,

38
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,251
you knew where it was from, right?

39
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,378
Hey!

40
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,047
They don't want much.

41
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,549
They'll take care of it.

42
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,978
FOUND EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS LEE DID IT

43
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,107
MIN JI-YOUNG

44
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,073
- Isn't being sent down to Jeju a bit much?
- He fabricated evidence.

45
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,492
- That's right.
- Such a disgrace to the police.

46
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,327
How can he do that?

47
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,831
I always knew that nutjob would mess up.

48
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,476
I'll be back soon,

49
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,478
so keep an eye on Lee Yun-seong.

50
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,647
He'll cause trouble again.

51
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,524
I appreciate it.

52
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,109
No can do.

53
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,235
I'm coming with you.

54
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,156
I've already sent my stuff there.
We'll go and come back together.

55
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,092
I understand.

56
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,867
Help the superintendent.

57
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,994
Yoon-ji, take the others
and close off the crime scene.

58
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,871
- Yes, sir. Let's go.
- Okay.

59
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,498
Lee Min-soo isn't doing well.

60
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,834
I'll take him to the hospital.
Let the superintendent know.

61
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,294
- Yes, sir.
- Close the door.

62
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,426
I heard they caught Inmate 0512.

63
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,430
Long time no see.

64
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,061
We'll send him back
only after we finish the investigation.

65
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,106
How about we share the ride?

66
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,785
After all, I'm in charge of him,

67
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,411
so I can't just let him go.

68
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,039
I hope you understand.

69
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,707
Let's go!

70
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,004
Let's go.

71
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,703
Let's go.

72
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,049
- Hey, you made it.
- Hey.

73
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,094
- Shall we start?
- Sure.

74
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,095
Where should we begin?

75
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,139
- Can you please move?
- Why is she in the way?

76
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,765
- Move.
- Oh, dear.

77
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,476
- I said move.
- She's blocking the way.

78
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,729
- Ji-hoon!
- She just hit me.

79
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,731
- What's going on?
- Move! Now!

80
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,149
- Ji-hoon!
- This lady's hitting people.

81
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,400
- Move.
- She's hitting people.

82
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,776
Get out of my way!

83
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,659
Ji-hoon!

84
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,929
Are you sure my son is all right?

85
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,184
He seems all right.

86
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,268
That's great.

87
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,731
Go straight to the hospital.
It looks like there are two cars.

88
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,026
I'm sure you wouldn't have put him
in the same one as Kwon.

89
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,445
Which car is my son in?

90
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,699
The one in the front or the back?

91
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,618
Why do you ask?

92
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,287
Because I'm his mom.

93
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,957
<i>That's how all parents are.</i>

94
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,752
You want to protect your kids
and get rid of anything...

95
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,130
that may harm them.

96
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,134
Which car is my son in?

97
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,607
The one in the back.

98
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,487
Your son is in the back with me.

99
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,250
Hate me all you want.

100
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,920
But justice as a police officer
is more important to me.

101
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,174
You'll soon regret this.

102
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,771
Why is he driving so fast?

103
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,599
{\an8}THREE MINUTES AWAY

104
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,142
Jin-soo.

105
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,646
Jin-soo!

106
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,577
Damn it.

107
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,091
Jin-soo.

108
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,471
Professor.

109
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,058
Are you okay? Can you walk?

110
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,285
- What the...
- You bastard.

111
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,541
Jin-soo.

112
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,441
Jin-soo!

113
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,476
Jin-soo.

114
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:46,618
I'm on Route 57
between Gyeonggi-do and Seorae-dong.

115
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,621
A truck hit a police van,
and three people are injured.

116
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,040
One's severely injured. Please hurry.

117
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,629
Professor, don't kill me.

118
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,599
You know what Na-rae said before she died?

119
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,395
She cried and said
she wanted to go to her dad.

120
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,481
I told her to stop crying,
but she kept saying,

121
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:21,861
"I miss my dad. Let me go to my dad."
I still remember her crying her lungs out.

122
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,573
Then,

123
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,535
I happened to see a jump rope.

124
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,787
I took that,

125
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,164
put it around her neck, and...

126
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:46,428
Then, I really wanted to know
what it would feel like to stab her.

127
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,681
So I stabbed her once, twice,

128
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,057
three times,

129
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,934
four times...

130
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,440
You got the 13th one wrong.

131
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,908
Stop. That's enough.

132
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,963
Seok-joo!

133
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,951
Professor.

134
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,704
We have to go.

135
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,764
It's dangerous, Professor.

136
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,348
We have to go.

137
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,350
Professor!

138
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,163
- I need backup. Gaetal--
- There was a car crash.

139
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,498
It was both of our vans.

140
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,999
- A crash?
- Jin-soo's seriously injured,

141
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,626
and the superintendent's hurt too.

142
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,753
No one's there to help. You should go.

143
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,296
There's one more Gaetal.

144
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,508
- I'm chasing him now--
- Lee Min-soo's dead and Kwon fled.

145
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,803
Go to the scene of the crash first.

146
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,648
Have your wound treated first.

147
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:52,984
I can't leave

148
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,571
- Jin-soo alone.
- Sir!

149
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,240
Excuse me, he's also injured.
He needs to be treated.

150
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,743
Sir, are you okay?

151
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,497
Excuse me. Take a deep breath.

152
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:13,838
One second.

153
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,267
Stop them.

154
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,810
- Stop.
- Move.

155
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:29,729
It's too dangerous.

156
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,606
- You can't be here.
- I said move.

157
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,038
Yun-seong...

158
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:47,956
My son...

159
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,004
Get your hands off him.

160
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,509
This can't be Yun-seong.

161
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,344
Ma'am.

162
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,764
Yun-seong.

163
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,227
Yun-seong...

164
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:16,526
Yun-seong.

165
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:18,945
My son.

166
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,239
No.

167
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,200
Yun-seong.

168
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,537
Yun-seong!

169
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,122
Yun-seong, no!

170
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,708
Yun-seong.

171
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,210
Yun-seong!

172
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,880
Yun-seong!

173
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,342
Yun-seong!

174
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,388
Yun-seong!

175
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,938
Last night, the country was shaken
by a hostage situation and tragic deaths.

176
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,815
The nightmare began right here,

177
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,651
where two families lived
across the street from each other.

178
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,446
The son of one family
killed the daughter of the other,

179
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,865
and the girl's father took
his revenge against the son.

180
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,784
The public witnessed
and were complicit in this act.

181
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:10,204
Popularly known as Gaetal,
Kwon created the Killing Vote.

182
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:14,000
The police and prosecutors view
Kwon and his accomplices' actions

183
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:18,546
as personal revenge or vigilantism,
but what do you think?

184
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:22,300
<i>The targets of the Killing Vote</i>
<i>were shameless individuals</i>

185
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:25,803
<i>who used money and power</i>
<i>to hide and downplay their crimes.</i>

186
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,972
<i>Rather than personal revenge,</i>

187
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:32,226
<i>perhaps Gaetal gave a remedy to a society</i>
<i>suffering from a lack of justice.</i>

188
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:37,523
You can't openly support
a criminal on the news.

189
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,983
Give it a few days.

190
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,860
We have a big one left.

191
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,529
Are we really done with Min Ji-young now?

192
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,657
She won't be coming back anymore.

193
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,036
I'll go prepare for the big one now.

194
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,166
Jerk.

195
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,757
We can't let Chae do this anymore.

196
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,634
She's dangerous. Get rid of her.

197
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,053
Dad.

198
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,058
Dad.

199
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:16,395
I heard the truck driver said
he dozed off. Maybe he was drunk.

200
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,897
Someone hired him.

201
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,025
He didn't have a clear destination,
and he has priors.

202
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,154
We're checking his transaction records,
so we'll soon know

203
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,115
- who made him do it.
- Isn't it obvious?

204
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,784
Who fled after accomplishing
his goal of killing Lee?

205
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,035
It can only be Kwon Seok-joo.

206
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,288
This person knew Lee
would be passing through that area.

207
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,418
It's not Kwon Seok-joo.

208
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,504
Then who? Jin-soo has no enemies.

209
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,928
How did Min find that area?
It's as if she knew our route.

210
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,388
Don't be absurd.

211
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,557
You think she'd kill her own...

212
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:59,605
Even though Jin-soo
could've been assigned to Seoul,

213
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,650
he's been so adamant
about following you around the country.

214
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,485
Was it really out of loyalty?

215
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,241
I trust him.

216
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,037
What happened?

217
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,044
DEATH PENALTY: 30 YEARS IN PRISON

218
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,428
I'M SO HAPPY TO GET
A BIG BROTHER. THANK YOU!

219
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:47,528
That's a relief. We'll join you
after collecting the data.

220
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:48,613
Okay, bye.

221
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,074
Hey, Jjoo.

222
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,202
Jin-soo's surgery went well.

223
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,870
He's still unconscious though.

224
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,540
Why did he have to hurt his head?

225
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,877
- Let's go check on him tonight.
- Sure.

226
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,087
I got his browsing history
and IP addresses.

227
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:08,132
He was connecting
to VPN locations all over the world.

228
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,427
That little brat has some skills.

229
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,972
He seemed pretty close with Min.

230
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,809
I'm sure she didn't know this
about him, but what did she say?

231
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,562
He's not the type to let her know.

232
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,650
He's serious and quiet.

233
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,568
He's a good kid.

234
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:39,997
Are you all right?

235
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,332
<i>We're all fine.</i>

236
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,376
I'm glad you're okay too.

237
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,253
I saw the news.

238
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,755
Lee Min-soo is dead.

239
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,424
I guess our job is done now.

240
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:51,550
<i>Yes.</i>

241
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,011
This is how things turned out in the end.

242
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,055
<i>Speaking of which...</i>

243
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,432
I'll stick to the plan. See you soon.

244
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,356
I got the essentials first.

245
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,901
But you'll need a kettle
to cook the instant noodles.

246
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,028
I'll bring one from home.

247
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,031
Thanks.

248
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,369
I'll manage by myself now. You should go.

249
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,668
We can't have people
mistakenly believe your my accomplice.

250
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,715
I've killed people too.

251
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:31,924
What?

252
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:37,596
To be honest, I pressed yes
for all the Killing Votes.

253
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:43,019
That's aiding and abetting murder, right?
I did what you did, so there's no mistake.

254
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:46,689
I'm not kidding.
I can't put you in danger.

255
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,899
I'm not kidding either.

256
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,070
I'm not doing this because I like you.

257
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,950
If you're caught as Gaetal,
no one will try to understand you.

258
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:03,080
Until everyone is ready to hear
why you did what you did,

259
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,124
I'll be by your side.

260
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,209
Let's wait together.

261
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:09,670
So...

262
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,758
you can help me understand first.

263
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,470
Why did you become Gaetal?

264
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,186
In this very apartment,

265
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,937
an armed robber...

266
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,691
stabbed my parents.

267
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,819
No matter how much I said
who the robber was,

268
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:36,030
no one believed me.

269
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,450
Just because I was only six.

270
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,956
When I ended up completely alone,

271
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:47,833
Na-rae

272
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,419
and my father took me in.

273
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,300
That's why I became Gaetal.

274
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,136
Lee Min-soo

275
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,431
killed my sister, Na-rae.

276
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:05,684
He destroyed

277
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,187
my only hope.

278
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,034
Wait.

279
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,702
- Please move aside.
- What are you doing?

280
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:24,954
Hey!

281
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,166
Darn it.

282
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,760
Are guards hired
for their knife skills here?

283
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,016
We'd like your cooperation
in our investigation of Park.

284
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,228
How long has he known Kwon for?

285
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:58,279
Officer Park hated all the inmates.

286
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:01,532
He said we were wasting
our tax money on caring for criminals.

287
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:05,911
He said they were leeches
who'd suck us dry until we died.

288
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,663
DECEMBER 2016
EMPLOYED AT SECURITY DIVISION

289
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,916
So I can't believe he's helping Kwon.

290
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,267
Just a nice big sum. No more, no less.

291
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,704
Let me check your ID.

292
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,504
I heard they caught Inmate 0512.

293
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:04,303
Come to think of it, Park was in charge
of transferring Kwon to this prison too.

294
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:06,388
<i>Above all else,</i>

295
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,934
I am enraged by the fact
that devils who were deemed innocent

296
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,519
still exist in this country.

297
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:14,313
All of you who took the killer's side
and not the victim's

298
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,106
are all guilty! You all are!

299
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:23,239
Park Chul-min must've heard
Kwon addressing the court.

300
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:30,454
I found a bunch of names here
written with numbers.

301
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:32,206
I think these are inmates.

302
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,219
CHOI JIN-SOO

303
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:54,103
Work with Team Two to see
if any properties owned by the inmates

304
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,479
shows someone living there.

305
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,481
Use of electricity,
water, internet, gas...

306
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,066
- Everything.
- Yes, sir.

307
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:17,459
<i>It seems the professor's picnic is over.</i>

308
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:21,088
<i>You need police protection.</i>

309
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,340
<i>That's the best way to save your son.</i>

310
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:28,220
So this is why we were told
to check Jin-soo's phone.

311
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,640
You already knew about this, right?

312
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:35,603
You knew our information
was leaking out too.

313
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:40,524
The timing of Lee Min-soo
turning himself in was so odd.

314
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:43,986
The only people who had
that video were you, me,

315
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:47,156
and Jin-soo.

316
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,325
What do we do now?

317
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,160
Should we report this?

318
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,372
Jin-soo wouldn't screw me over like this.

319
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:58,417
Is that it? There's nothing else?

320
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,592
<i>Are you sure my son is all right?</i>

321
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,011
<i>He seems all right.</i>

322
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,889
<i>That's great. Go straight to the hospital.</i>

323
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,350
<i>Which car is my son in?</i>

324
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,102
<i>The one in the front or the back?</i>

325
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:19,104
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

326
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,190
<i>That's how all parents are.</i>

327
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,360
<i>You want to get rid of anything</i>
<i>that may harm them.</i>

328
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:26,779
<i>The one in the back.</i>

329
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:30,783
<i>Your son is in the back with me.</i>

330
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,996
He must have kept all the call records

331
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,957
so we could arrest Min.

332
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,502
Jin-soo

333
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,463
wanted to help you

334
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,299
and made this huge sacrifice.

335
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,141
- Sir.
- Sir.

336
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:58,477
What's with him?

337
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,730
I need to tell him
I'm totally stuck on this case.

338
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,817
- What is it now?
- Well...

339
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:07,653
The commissioner gave a direct order...

340
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,655
WANTED: KILLING VOTE MURDER SUSPECTS

341
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,031
to put out an APB on Kim Ji-hoon.

342
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:12,241
What?

343
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:17,079
How can you put an APB
on a kid when he hasn't been charged?

344
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:21,542
{\an8}<i>The police suspect the accomplice</i>
<i>of Kwon, the one behind the Killing Vote,</i>

345
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:25,337
{\an8}<i>is Kim Ji-hoon, a senior at Seorae High.</i>

346
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:27,506
<i>Kim is suspected</i>
<i>of murder, aiding and abetting,</i>

347
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:31,427
<i>and violations of the Information</i>
<i>and Communications Act.</i>

348
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,053
{\an8}<i>If you know about his whereabouts</i>
<i>or have seen him,</i>

349
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:35,973
{\an8}<i>please contact the nearest police station.</i>

350
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,651
This is a draft
of tomorrow's morning paper.

351
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:57,494
SAMDO STEEL'S STANCE
ON CONTROVERSIAL KILLING VOTE

352
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,332
OUR COMPANY HAS NO ASSOCIATION WITH LEE

353
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,630
Our son is dead.

354
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,260
Where's my husband?

355
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:19,600
You can't come in. Ms. Min isn't home!

356
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,482
I was taking out the trash and...

357
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,864
I can't hold his funeral yet.

358
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,868
The police won't send my son back home.

359
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:39,995
You should go see him yourself.

360
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,707
We can put you in the same cell.

361
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:45,834
Right.

362
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:49,963
I guess you're not used
to looking at corpses for a long time.

363
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:53,050
Shut up before I tear your mouth off.

364
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,221
You killed my son.

365
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,556
You and Kwon Seok-joo.

366
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:01,350
You did it.

367
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,310
Then, why did you hit
the car in the front...

368
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,814
and not the one in the back?

369
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:12,069
You dare to attack the police?

370
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:16,990
Only cops can fight with other cops.
We hate it when others mess with us.

371
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,243
You made a mistake.

372
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:27,417
Tell my lawyer to file a lawsuit
against the police for damages.

373
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:30,420
No, against the whole country.

374
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,674
I'm going to hunt down

375
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,844
every single person
who had a hand in killing my son.

376
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,640
You pieces of scum.

377
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,685
You won't last long.

378
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,396
Do whatever you want
to help you stay sane.

379
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,858
But it doesn't change the fact
that you killed your son.

380
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,317
You!

381
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:54,945
By the way...

382
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,702
never mess with Jin-soo ever again.

383
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:08,208
I'm much crazier than I look.

384
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,881
I could put you in a coffin
right next to your son's.

385
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,202
I heard you've been refusing to eat.

386
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,829
We have a long way to go.

387
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:32,000
- You're Ji-hoon's grandma.
- Don't call me that.

388
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,920
We don't share a single drop of blood.

389
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,381
I took him in to deceive people.

390
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,591
We were actually strangers.

391
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,552
We've never even had
a proper meal together.

392
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:46,598
And he didn't even know what I was doing.

393
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,144
A sedative detected in Bae's blood, right?

394
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,271
I got that from the hospital.

395
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,565
I also gave Uhm the heart attack.

396
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,110
Although I failed because of Lee,

397
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:02,364
I even poisoned
the inmates' water to kill them all.

398
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,784
I've committed all sorts of crimes.

399
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,829
Go and tell them it was all me.

400
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,625
So you knew Ji-hoon
was put on the wanted list.

401
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,296
Even if you take the blame for everything,

402
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,718
it won't change the fact
that Ji-hoon was involved.

403
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:26,471
But if you cooperate
with our investigation now,

404
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,598
your charges may be reduced.

405
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:35,897
I lost faith in this country's
justice system a long time ago.

406
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,733
Don't try to convince me.

407
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:44,531
I also...

408
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,701
lost my parents at a young age

409
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,496
and wanted to get revenge for a while.

410
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,792
When my sister started
to get bullied at school, it drove me mad.

411
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:59,337
I went around filled with rage,

412
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,299
wanting to set places on fire.

413
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,594
I understand you and Ji-hoon both.

414
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,721
However,

415
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,682
it's time to trust the police now

416
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,560
for Ji-hoon's sake.

417
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,273
Ji-hoon is such a strong kid.

418
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:22,861
He may be shy but he expresses
his thoughts, and he's determined.

419
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,613
He doesn't yield to violence either.

420
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,201
That's why my sister likes him.

421
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,244
She has high standards for men.

422
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,247
Now that I'm raising a teenager,

423
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:38,627
I realized living with them
is a hard task.

424
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,379
Every day is a challenge.

425
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,098
You raised him well.

426
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,141
Ji-hoon said...

427
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,271
you became his real family.

428
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,525
So,

429
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:03,860
please give me and the police...

430
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,823
please give us the chance
to protect Ji-hoon

431
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,367
before it's too late.

432
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:22,337
JARANG CONVENIENCE STORE

433
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,051
WANTED: KILLING VOTE MURDER SUSPECTS

434
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:44,901
What are you doing?

435
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,615
Who's that?

436
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,828
Give me one of those. I need to wake up.

437
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:59,249
Here. Let's eat this and focus.
This is a crucial moment.

438
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,793
Keep your eyes open.
We can't miss a thing.

439
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,004
So what's going on? Tell me.

440
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,257
They're suing all of us
for Lee Min-soo's death.

441
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,508
Darn it.

442
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,345
- What?
- Yeah.

443
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,685
COMPLAINT

444
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:22,147
He was a suspect
who hadn't been tried yet.

445
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,859
And the police helplessly let him
get kidnapped and receive death threats.

446
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,613
So you'll have to take
responsibility for his death.

447
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,203
What's the real reason for doing this?

448
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:40,081
What are you trying to do
after disturbing our team?

449
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,168
Assemblywoman Min

450
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:47,589
wants a genuine apology
and proper compensation from the police.

451
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,675
That is all.

452
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,060
Yoon-ji, our guest is leaving.

453
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,395
Escort her to the exit
so she won't wander off.

454
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,024
Yes, sir.

455
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,902
Follow me. This way.

456
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:12,280
- Should I dip into my savings?
- Now's not the time for that.

457
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:14,032
You've never been sued.

458
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,701
You can lose everything.
Do you own a house?

459
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,703
Online banking's better for a loan.

460
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:22,332
They're using the lawsuit to stall
so they can find a scapegoat.

461
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,125
They're afraid people will find out
they hired the truck driver.

462
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:27,629
Min Ji-young has always acted like this.

463
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,840
Any trace of Kwon Seok-joo?

464
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:34,511
His car was found 2km
from the scene of the accident.

465
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,972
We're checking all the CCTV nearby.

466
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,599
But he took the dashcam memory card.

467
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,142
What about Ji-hoon?

468
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,812
They must be in touch.

469
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,690
- Anything from your sister?
- Well...

470
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:50,860
There's actually something
about her that bothers me.

471
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:57,158
I checked earlier, and there was
something suspicious in Min's movements.

472
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:02,414
{\an8}HOME, SCHOOL, CONVENIENCE STORE, APARTMENT

00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:11,965
KIM JI-HOON

474
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:20,598
<i>The number you have dialed is...</i>

475
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:28,940
<i>Ji-hoon is on the wanted list now.</i>

476
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:30,734
<i>Do you know where he could be?</i>

477
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,157
What's her problem?

478
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:47,709
Ji-hoon!

479
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,257
Mister?

480
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,762
Hyun, were you following me?

481
00:43:58,845 --> 00:43:59,846
How could you?

482
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,474
Hey. How could you lie to me?

483
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:03,683
You've lost your mind.

484
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:07,062
Cops can't come in
and search a house like this.

485
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,188
Quiet, you idiot.

486
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,857
Where's your friend?

487
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,151
Is he gone or coming back?

488
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,819
He's not here?

489
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:19,407
I don't know. Some kids said
they saw him here so I came.

490
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,494
My phone. Give it back.

491
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,623
Give me back my phone. Move, mister!

492
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,751
Darn it. That's not yours.

493
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,087
I'll call the cops on you both

494
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,215
for trespassing, assault, and theft.

495
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:38,385
Suit yourself. Gosh, such a know-it-all.

496
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:39,594
It's turned off.

497
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,721
- Can we track this number?
- We'll have to try.

498
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,558
Give me my phone!

499
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:49,020
Move, mister. Get out of the way.

500
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:54,275
If you're truly his friend,
you should think of protecting him

501
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,902
instead of hiding him.

502
00:44:57,654 --> 00:45:01,825
Turning himself in is the best thing
Ji-hoon can do for his own safety, okay?

503
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,046
Min.

504
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,966
I'll be watching you.
No more funny business.

505
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,594
Go home!

506
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:32,730
<i>Don't come home. The cops are here.</i>

507
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,960
Remember when we came here before?

508
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,379
Of course.

509
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:02,218
It was our first trip
after we became family.

510
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:07,098
She said when she grew up,
we should come back here

511
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:10,518
and go fishing because you like to fish.

512
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,987
I'm glad we scattered
her ashes in the sea.

513
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:24,699
Na-rae can travel around the world now.

514
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:28,495
She'll brag so much when we meet again.

515
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,831
You should leave too.

516
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:43,009
I was consumed by anger
and made you wear that mask too.

517
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:45,094
I felt sorry every day.

518
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:49,974
All I have left to do now
is to turn myself in.

519
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,773
Don't tell anyone where you're going.

520
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,399
Not even me.

521
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:00,193
And just go

522
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,196
as soon as possible.

523
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:10,995
Make a new family and forget about us.

524
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,206
I don't want that.

525
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:16,125
I'll turn myself in too.
I won't leave you again.

526
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:20,380
I'll negotiate with Mu-chan
to remove you from the APB.

527
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:23,174
Min Ji-young might try to harm you,

528
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:26,052
so until you're safe, stay away from here.

529
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:35,979
When I'm released,

530
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:38,064
I'll come find you.

531
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,067
No matter where you are,

532
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,361
I'll come find you.

533
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:52,704
Don't look for me. Just send me an email.

534
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:56,958
You don't have to say
where you are. I'll figure it out.

535
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:00,086
Okay.

536
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:04,757
There are more people here now.

537
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:08,511
Here.

538
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,598
A fake ID and passport.

539
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:16,227
I made a lot of friends
with skills while working in prisons.

540
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:20,440
Don't worry. They assured me
they're like the real ones.

541
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:22,900
The flight ticket is real.

542
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,488
Thank you, Number Three.

543
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,994
It's nice to meet you in person.

544
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:35,872
You're very talented.

545
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,916
You'll be all right wherever you go.

546
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:01,648
Back then,

547
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,609
I was too late

548
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,695
to pick up Na-rae,

549
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:09,614
so I missed her.

550
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,950
Do you resent me for that?

551
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,249
Not even once.

552
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:25,588
Not even once have I resented you, my son.

553
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:46,567
So you didn't tell him?

554
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:52,657
Well, what can we do?

555
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:57,203
Individuals are bound to be crushed
by the wheel of history.

556
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:11,426
PROPERTIES OF INMATES

557
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,428
These two show signs of being lived in?

558
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,596
Yes. They're still serving time,

559
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,351
so the houses are supposed to be empty,
but water and electricity had been used.

560
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:26,107
- Any relationship with Kwon?
- Yoo regarded him like a cult leader.

561
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,693
And Heo only exchanged greetings with him.

562
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,528
I'm suspecting Heo.

563
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:33,531
Ownership was transferred
while he was incarcerated.

564
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,701
I reviewed the ownership records
for the past five years,

565
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:37,952
and the first owner...

566
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,705
was Park Chul-min's father.

567
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,292
{\an8}Park Chul-min?

568
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:46,669
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

569
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:50,923
There were a few owners afterwards,
but it was originally Park's home.

570
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:54,135
Then, it's definitely him. Let's go.

571
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:56,345
Well done, Yoon-ji.

572
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:58,222
Thank you, sir.

573
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,520
We know where Kwon's hiding.

574
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:05,688
Hello, sir.

575
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,274
Sir, the director's asking for me.

576
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,902
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

577
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:17,617
Park's parents invested
in some bad derivatives

578
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,535
and committed suicide
after going bankrupt.

579
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,829
Park joined the victims' group for them.

580
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:25,291
He was so shocked
he even stopped going to church.

581
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,171
He helped Kwon
because he was angry at the world.

582
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:32,632
In any case, keep looking for Ji-hoon.

583
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,967
He's a teenager.
He couldn't have gone far.

584
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,136
Yes, sir.

585
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:41,307
You'll catch Kwon...

586
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:44,101
alive, right?

587
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,945
<i>Seorae High's first wanted criminal?</i>

588
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,489
<i>- Who's Kim Ji-hoon?</i>
<i>- Gaetal's from our school. Unbelievable.</i>

589
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:59,575
- No joke.
- It's a big reward. Should I catch him?

590
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,546
Hello?

591
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:14,507
<i>Min.</i>

592
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,886
Ji-hoon? Is that you?

593
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:20,930
Where are you?

594
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,098
Hello?

595
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:25,268
Hello? Where are you?

596
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,937
<i>In front of your place.</i>

597
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:41,534
You're the only person I can go to now.

598
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,551
Who are you?

599
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,344
Let go of me!

600
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:21,616
Is everything ready?

601
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,203
- How's it going?
- We're ready.

602
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:28,581
You may begin now.

603
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:39,216
You should've turned her phone off.

604
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,561
It's Kim Mu-chan.

605
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:53,272
Answer it.

606
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,115
<i>It's me.</i>

607
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,284
You know the APB is out on Kwon now.

608
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,161
Of course, I do.

609
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,580
If you know how to get in touch, tell me.

610
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,499
I don't.

611
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:15,169
You met Kwon recently
and even let that fugitive appear on TV.

612
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,587
<i>But you really don't know?</i>

613
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,006
<i>Spill it before things get worse.</i>

614
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,759
What's Kwon Seok-joo's next move?

615
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,345
I don't know. Don't ever call me again.

616
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,390
Also, tell Hyun I can't come
to her birthday party.

617
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,058
I suddenly have a business trip--

618
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:39,860
Don't worry.
I'll give it back when you leave.

619
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,362
You'll really let me go?

620
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:45,700
I'm an anchor on network TV.
You'll get in trouble for this.

621
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,994
Do you think I care
about something like that now?

622
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:55,543
You're not going to killing me, are you?

623
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:59,463
I could catch Kwon
thanks to you, so why would I?

624
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:05,886
Your show used the money
I gave you to sentence my son to death,

625
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,097
but I'm not a thug, you know.

626
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,893
Just watch

627
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:15,438
and see how those murderers end up.

628
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:26,115
CHAE DO-HEE'S KILLING VOTE SPECIAL

629
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,139
I've got to go.

630
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:51,807
Go?

631
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,309
Go where?

632
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,478
I'll let you know later.

633
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:59,607
I don't know when,
but I'll definitely let you know.

634
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,110
Wait. My sister isn't that narrow-minded.

635
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:04,195
She likes you.

636
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,571
Let's talk with her.

637
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:09,408
You're a minor, and you only helped.
They said you won't be punished harshly.

638
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:12,912
I read that turning yourself in
can help you later in court.

639
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,166
I'm not going to turn myself in.

640
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:20,419
My father will turn himself in first

641
00:56:20,503 --> 00:56:23,589
and reveal the crimes
Lee Min-soo and Min Ji-young committed.

642
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:27,885
And I promised him
I'd hide until it's over.

643
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:32,598
Ji-hoon. Actually, I...

644
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,979
<i>Hello, my fellow citizens.</i>

645
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,484
<i>The Killing Vote will now begin.</i>

646
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:48,572
<i>First, I'd like to apologize</i>
<i>for using the network's online forum</i>

647
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:50,908
<i>instead of the smartphone app</i>
<i>for the vote.</i>

648
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:52,827
Start it now.

Darn it.

655
00:57:26,235 --> 00:57:28,070
It's from Gaetal's hideout.

656
00:57:28,154 --> 00:57:30,322
And it's definitely recorded.
It's being transmitted from...

<i>I planned the Killing Vote...</i>

658

They're crazy.

00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:38,747
<i>I'm the one who you call Gaetal.</i>

661
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:43,252

673
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,487
You're with my father, right?
Put him on the phone.

674
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:52,821
That'll be difficult.

675
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,995
He's about to do something important.

676
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,249
He's going to kill himself.
We must stop him.

677
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,542
So you do know.

678
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:07,169
<i>Stop bothering him.</i>

679
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:10,881
You shouldn't stop someone
who wants to leave.

680
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:13,217
That's nonsense!

681
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,845
You're not just going to
let him do it, are you?

682
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:18,597
<i>I am.</i>

683
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,849
To change this unfair world,

684
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:23,060
there needs to be bloodshed.

685
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,272
<i>That's why the Professor</i>
<i>is sacrificing himself.</i>

686
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:29,650
So all sinners on this earth
can get their just punishments.

687
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:32,987
<i>But to let mere human emotion</i>
<i>get in the way of this?</i>

688
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,824
- I guess you're still a kid.
- Number Three.

689
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,993
Be proud of your father.

690
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,453
I envy you.

691
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:43,998
Number Three!

{\an8}<i>I want you to cast your votes</i>

You won't need to verify your names,
and you can vote more than once.

694
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,268
I just want you
to understand my determination.

- Hyun is coming.
- Min!

698
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,617
Yes! I betrayed you.

699
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,912
Running away isn't easy.

700
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,751
Just turn yourself in.

701
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:34,923
I can't let my father die
just so I can live. Could you?

702
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:44,892
I'll convince my father
and we'll both turn ourselves in.

703
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:52,483
I'll come with you.

704
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:57,363
If you're with me,
the cops won't find you.

705
01:01:03,202 --> 01:01:04,661
Where's the place?

706
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:08,874
Where is it?

707
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,473
<i>There's something Ji-hoon has to do.</i>

708
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:27,393
<i>He'll turn himself in</i>
<i>as soon as it's done. Sorry.</i>

709
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:30,979
<i>The phone is turned off...</i>

710
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:33,232
{\an8}GPS CONNECTION ERROR

711
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:38,695
Min ran off somewhere else.
What am I going to do with her?

712
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:39,863
I know. What do we do?

713
01:01:39,947 --> 01:01:43,617
What do we do
with this crazy and incredible situation?

714
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,578
Is the server overloaded? But why?

715
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:47,830
What's the program?

716
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:50,040
It looks like a video streaming program.

717
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:53,919
Where is this coming from?
For crying out loud.

718
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:17,109
We have cameras and sensors
set up all around the house.

719
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:18,902
We're checking now for weapons.

720
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:22,072
People had been coming by
with daily necessities for a while.

721
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:25,534
I checked the photos,
and they were Park and Jung for sure.

722
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,619
- What about Kwon Seok-joo?
- He hasn't been confirmed yet.

723
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:30,873
The fact that Jung was here
means there could be a bomb.

724
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,166
- Check that.
- Yes, sir.

725
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:36,086
<i>I used to believe</i>

726
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:38,589
that everyone was equal before the law.

727
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,048
But when my daughter

728
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,927
became the victim of a ruthless crime,

729
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:47,181
<i>I realized laws</i>
<i>and justice in this country</i>

730
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,266
<i>were incredibly weak.</i>

731
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:54,062
<i>So I created the Killing Vote.</i>

732
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:56,940
<i>While hiding behind this mask,</i>

733
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:59,318
<i>I've been trying to convey one message.</i>

734
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:02,946
<i>Fair and rational justice.</i>

735
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:07,034
<i>Execution of the law</i>
<i>that we all can understand.</i>

736
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:11,997
JI-HOON'S GAETAL STREAMING

737
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:21,632
<i>Hello, my fellow citizens.</i>

738
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:25,260
<i>I'm Gaetal Number One.</i>
<i>I programmed and opened the Killing Vote.</i>

739
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:31,308
Ji-hoon started streaming as Gaetal.

740
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,644
- What?
- Sir.

741
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,187
Check this out.

742
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:45,280
<i>Everyone, please vote "No"</i>
<i>for the current Killing Vote.</i>

743
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:48,283
- No, stop voting.
- We're just playing around.

744
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:50,285
Professor Kwon must not be killed.

745
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:55,499
I think Ji-hoon
is heading there. I'll follow him.

746
01:03:58,168 --> 01:03:59,586
Darn it.

747
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,439
GAETAL'S STREAMING

748
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:24,611
Darn it.

749
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,448
Let's get him first. Up the reward.

750
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:29,658
Yes, ma'am.

751
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:33,912
<i>Although I do not have any regrets</i>
<i>or shame about my method,</i>

752
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:39,543
the fact is I also committed
and aided in murder just as they did.

753
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:45,048
Therefore, I'm leaving the decision
of my execution in your hands.

754
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:48,343
Now I get why Kwon
put himself up for vote.

755
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,848
He's going to kill himself after the vote.

756
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:18,081
{\an8}KILL HIM ALREADY
SUDDENLY GAETAL NUMBER ONE?

757
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,127
{\an8}WHAT'S GOING ON?
SHOULD I VOTE OR NOT?

758
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:24,004
KWON'S GAETAL?
JUST KILL HIM

759
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:31,219
Excuse me. Sorry.

760
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:33,388
Sorry.

761
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:35,182
You can't be serious.

762
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:38,727
<i>I'll tell you why he created the vote</i>
<i>and put himself up for it.</i>

763
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:42,731
- Taxi!
- Please hear me out.

764
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,070
<i>Please.</i>

765
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,197
<i>Let's go.</i>

766
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,080
Move!

767
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:11,385
Change of plans.
We're negotiating with Kwon.

768
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,304
- I'll do it myself.
- What? Negotiate?

769
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,849
We found booby traps
inside the wall and at the entrance.

770
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,356
<i>Kwon and Park.</i>

771
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:25,691
<i>You're surrounded.</i>

772
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:29,569
Darn it.

773
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:33,365
<i>When his daughter</i>
<i>was murdered eight years ago,</i>

774
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:36,034
the cops knew
Lee Min-soo was the accomplice.

775
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:40,080
Go that way. Quick, this way!

776
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,582
<i>The police are watching</i>
<i>every move you make.</i>

777
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,126
<i>Turn yourselves in.</i>

778
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:45,210
They're already here.

779
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:49,131
Are you going to let it
end like this? Professor.

780
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:56,763
To make you believe me,

781
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:58,515
I should reveal who I am.

782
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:01,935
- Hey.
- My name is Kim Ji-hoon.

783
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:05,355
Eight years ago,
Professor Kwon was going to adopt me.

784
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:10,068
And Na-rae was my precious sister.

785
01:07:13,155 --> 01:07:14,948
Move!

786
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,744
Come on out!

787
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:20,787
Go that way.

788
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:21,872
Darn it.

789
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:25,667
{\an8}EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF JI-HOON

790
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:34,176
Everyone's gone crazy.

791
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:46,271
<i>Our family's happiness was destroyed</i>

792
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:48,565
<i>by the murderers Lee Min-soo</i>
<i>and Byun Woo-taek.</i>

793
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:50,984
{\an8}<i>The one who used her money</i>
<i>and power to conceal their crimes</i>

794
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:52,778
{\an8}<i>was Assemblywoman Min Ji-young.</i>

795
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:53,862
And...

796
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:59,034
a group of corrupt cops
and prosecutors were bribed by Min.

797
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:03,371
Ji-hoon's using Lee's computer
to stream through our agency's server.

798
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:06,208
I'll catch up with him soon,
so hang in there.

799
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,251
You said they're coming here.
What's the problem?

800
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:11,838
Min's offered a bounty on his head.
If they catch him, he'll be in danger.

801
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:17,302
Secure those two as fast as you can.

802
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:19,221
Just let us catch you already.

803
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:32,526
Darn it.

804
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,498
Excuse me. Where's the bus terminal?

805
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:48,542
- I think it's that way.
- Thank you.

806
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:01,513
My father's going to take his own life.

807
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,475
But why does he have to?

808
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:09,354
Those who destroyed our happiness
never paid for what they did.

809
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:10,480
Why is it always

810
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:15,110
<i>the righteous people</i>
<i>who are strict with themselves?</i>

811
01:09:16,695 --> 01:09:17,988
<i>I'm still not used to</i>

812
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,199
<i>seeing myself with the mask on.</i>

813
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:25,871
<i>This wasn't how I imagined myself</i>
<i>as a 19-year-old.</i>

814
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:28,415
<i>I want you to tell me.</i>

815
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,542
<i>Once happiness is taken away,</i>

816
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:33,920
<i>can it ever be regained?</i>

817
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:39,759
We found him.

818
01:09:47,017 --> 01:09:48,810
Just let us catch you, man.

819
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,688
- Just stay there.
- Jo-dan.

820
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,441
I'll find him.

821
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:56,610
Right.

822
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:18,673
You think you're Gaetal, you bastard?
Die, you bastard.

823
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:33,355
Seok-joo!

824
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:41,738
Hey! What are you doing?

825
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:43,615
Min. Ji-hoon.

826
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:46,534
Hyun!

827
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:50,413
Die, you bastard!

828
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:29,536
The meat's getting cold by the minute.
We can't keep silent forever.

829
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,538
I'll be brave and go first.

830
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:34,874
Is hierarchy not important to you?

831
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:46,011
Tasty.

832
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,014
Let's dig in.

833
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:54,185
- That one wasn't fully cooked yet.
- All right.

834
01:11:54,269 --> 01:11:56,438
We're on the same team now,
so let's come together.

835
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:59,357
Let's have a drink
before the superintendent comes.

836
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:00,442
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

837
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:06,364
- Cheers.
- We don't just drink like that.

838
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:08,158
Right?

839
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,456
- It's her.
- Two assaults on duty.

840
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:17,125
I assaulted suspects
with my world-class kicks.

841
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:18,376
Let's go!

842
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,587
There it goes!

843
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,590
- Lieutenant Joo!
- Jjoo!

844
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:24,716
- Lieutenant Joo!
- Come on, Jjoo!

845
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,384
Yes, sir! I'm the whistleblower!

846
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:29,929
- Whistleblower.
- Whistleblower!

847
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:35,143
- Whistleblower!
- Whistleblower!

848
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,396
- Hyun?
- Whistleblower!

849
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,273
My sister is here!

850
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,691
Min!

851
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:44,277
Hey, my troublemaker.

852
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,405
And my apprentice is here too!

853
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:49,949
She's here because she couldn't reach you.

854
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:52,535
Sir, Ji-hoon has amazing computer skills.

855
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:54,537
He's awesome.
I'll take him to the Cyber Bureau.

856
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:57,874
- No. We'll become reporters.
- No, he's mine.

857
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,584
- Stop it.
- I'll mentor him.

858
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:02,170
Everyone, the superintendent is here!

859
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:08,968
- Superintendent!
- Superintendent!

860
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,475
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

861
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:17,393
Can you believe this?

862
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:19,646
This is the state of the Korean police.

863
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:22,023
No, it's not!

864
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:24,025
It's not like I hit him a lot.

865
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,864
I like this though.

866
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:34,619
Ji-hoon, my apprentice!
I'll mentor you. Come here.

867
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:40,625
Don't you dare.

868
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:44,045
If you drink, you're dead meat.

869
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:51,154
{\an8}<i>Kwon and Park. You're surrounded.</i>

870
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:52,739
{\an8}They're already here.

871
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:54,032
{\an8}<i>Turn yourselves in.</i>

872
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:56,242
{\an8}<i>- Kill them.</i>
- I said kill him!

873
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:58,786
{\an8}<i>- You need to make a decision.</i>
- Let's stop.

874
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,705
{\an8}<i>Min's offered a bounty on his head.</i>

875
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:01,998
