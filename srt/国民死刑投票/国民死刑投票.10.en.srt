00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,935
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,353
SAFETY OF CHILD ACTORS WAS ENSURED

4
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:13,574
{\an8}EPISODE 10

5
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,085
{\an8}I got it.

6
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,467
{\an8}MOVING FILES

7
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,676
{\an8}What?

8
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,428
{\an8}He locked the videos.

9
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:36,263
{\an8}I can't save or copy them.

10
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:39,099
{\an8}Even though you're using his account?

11
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,726
{\an8}Try changing the security settings.

12
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,978
{\an8}There are too many things to copy.

13
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,397
{\an8}I think I'll need more storage space.

14
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:49,151
{\an8}It'll definitely leave a trace
if we upload them to the cloud, right?

15
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:50,986
{\an8}Jjoo, get out of there for now.

16
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,240
{\an8}This is illegal anyway.
Let's do an official search later.

17
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,451
{\an8}<i>- Come on out.</i>
- I need more storage space.

18
00:01:58,369 --> 00:01:59,370
{\an8}Darn it.

19
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:07,753
Wait.

20
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,006
No.

21
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,425
The door's closed!

22
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,552
What?

23
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,639
Have a good day.

24
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,058
Have a good day, sir.

25
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,144
- Have a good day.
- You too. Bye.

26
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,605
Damn it!

27
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,607
The door's closed.

28
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,150
I'm locked in here!

29
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:31,735
<i>What do we do?</i>

30
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,445
<i>I told you not to go in there.</i>

31
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,822
<i>Gosh!</i>

32
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,242
Good job today.

33
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,207
- Have a good day.
- You too.

34
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,503
<i>Did you see any buttons?</i>

35
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:52,256
<i>Or something like the tumbler</i>
<i>you used to get in?</i>

36
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,635
No! I think the door is set
to close automatically after a while.

37
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,928
Damn it.

38
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,472
Could it be linked to Lee's phone?

39
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,236
What do I do?

40
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,030
<i>- Check his computer.</i>
- Darn it!

41
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,449
<i>First, calm down. Okay? Calm down and...</i>

42
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,368
<i>- Wait, I need to calm down.</i>
- What do I do?

43
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:22,620
<i>Let's stay calm.</i>

44
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,253
There's got to be something here.

45
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,422
You've got to be kidding me.

46
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,424
FUN FOLDER

47
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,594
What's this?

48
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,596
FUN FUN FILE

49
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,016
<i>Na-rae, you're so pretty.</i>

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,227
<i>Isn't it fun to play with me?</i>

51
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,441
<i>I'm having so much fun</i>
<i>playing with you too.</i>

52
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,114
If you just do as I say,

53
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,659
then I'll find Fluffy for you later.

54
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:07,665
Will you really find Fluffy
and take me to my dad?

55
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,835
I promise.

56
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,797
Just say, "Dad, I miss you."

57
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,093
Dad.

58
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,136
I miss you.

59
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,186
Dad, I miss you.

60
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:37,653
Dad, I miss you.

61
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,818
I'm sorry. Please don't.

62
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,446
Please.

63
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,991
- Don't say anything.
- What the...

64
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:06,950
Please.

65
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,931
Ji-hoon.

66
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,911
Hey, Min.

67
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,913
Are you done with your academy classes?

68
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,540
How about some <i>tteokbokki?</i>

69
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,083
Where was your academy again?

70
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,920
Sorry. I ditched class,
because I got a cold.

71
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,589
See you tomorrow.

72
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:06,009
Okay, then. Make sure
to take your medicine.

73
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,977
<i>Dad, I miss you.</i>

74
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:23,402
<i>Dad, I miss you.</i>

75
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,784
<i>Yun-seong, that's enough.</i>

76
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,870
<i>I think she's dead.</i>

77
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,331
JOO HYUN

78
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,586
Where did you get this?

79
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,337
<i>Let's switch to a video call.</i>

80
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,508
<i>I found a secret room.</i>

81
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,052
I found evidence
of Lee committing the murder

82
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,389
and targeting Bang with the Killing Vote.
It was all Lee's doing.

83
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,600
<i>I'm not sure how it happened,</i>

84
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,227
<i>but control over the vote</i>
<i>definitely went from Kwon to Lee.</i>

85
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,647
CHOI JIN-SOO

86
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,274
Find a way to bring the evidence here.

87
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,068
<i>With this, we can arrest</i>
<i>Lee Min-soo for sure.</i>

88
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,695
But the thing is...

89
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,739
Well...

90
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,032
The door is locked,

91
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,326
so I'm trapped in here.

92
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,661
But Lee doesn't know I'm here yet.

93
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,581
I need you to come search
the house right now.

94
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,544
Okay. Hang in there.

95
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,088
Just secure the evidence at all cost.

96
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,931
We're going to search Lee's house.

97
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,390
Don't tell the higher-ups
and gather the team.

98
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,683
Yes, sir.

99
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,483
Learn how to drive, you bastard!

100
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,493
NUMBER THREE
I'M OFF WORK

101
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,374
Hey.

102
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,710
Off work? Number Three?

103
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:04,920
What does this mean?

104
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,884
You're acting so weird.

105
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,011
Why are you here
after lying about going home?

106
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,473
I know this place.

107
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,475
That's Kwon Seok-joo's house.

108
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,269
The escaped convict, Kwon Seok-joo.

109
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,398
That's right.

110
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,149
And this is Mr. Lee's house.

111
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,031
I heard he collects
water bottles as a hobby.

112
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,993
I was going to use this rare one
to bribe him for good test scores.

113
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,077
You got me.

114
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,204
Cut me some slack.

115
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,498
I was afraid my absences
would mess up my chances for college.

116
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,668
Liar.

117
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,717
You...

118
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,386
You're Gaetal...

119
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,559
NEARBY

120
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,019
What's Hyun doing here?

121
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,979
Your sister?

122
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:21,163
<i>- Jjoo, there's no time for that!</i>
- The superintendent said he was coming.

123
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,541
So now you trust him?
You said you'd never talk to him again.

124
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,211
I don't like the way he works,
but he wouldn't let me die.

125
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,463
MIN

126
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,467
MIN
ONE MINUTE AWAY

127
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,554
MIN

128
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,722
Min!

129
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,932
What are you doing here?

130
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,267
<i>Hyun.</i>

131
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,352
Ji-hoon?

132
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,896
Are you investigating Lee's computer?

133
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,189
What did you find?

134
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,192
She's investigating Mr. Lee? Why?

135
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,580
Get out now. He's coming in soon.

136
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,375
<i>- Come on.</i>
- Take Min and go.

137
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,419
My team will arrive soon.
I'll find a way to take care of this.

138
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,754
Ji-hoon.

139
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,839
Please take care of Min.

140
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,008
What's wrong? Why can't you get out?

141
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,343
What did she say?

142
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:37,948
MOM

143
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,700
<i>Hurry.</i>

144
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:46,665
<i>Dad, I miss you.</i>

145
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,963
Hurry up and go.

146
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,257
I'll take care of the rest.

147
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,467
It's only a matter of time now.

148
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,107
He's gone.

149
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,694
Hyun, come on out now.

150
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,299
I hope

151
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,927
I'm not throwing my son
into the lion's den.

152
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,305
We don't have any other options.

153
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,392
He started the Killing Vote
to get your son.

154
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,894
Seeing how he even escaped from prison,

155
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,813
Kwon will definitely
make your son the next target.

156
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,776
If he's so eager to take my son down,

157
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,862
he could've just hired someone.

158
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,198
Why is he doing it the hard way?

159
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,204
It was exactly like this eight years ago.

160
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,583
You turned him into a monster
that everyone condemned.

161
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,419
It was amazing.

162
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,255
Your lectures are so interesting.

163
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,340
Keep up the hard work.

164
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:22,010
- I'm taking law lectures because of you.
- Is that so?

165
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,804
Professor.

166
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,272
Do you still not get it?

167
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:38,735
You need police protection.
That's the best way to save your son.

168
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,429
<i>Will you really take me to my dad?</i>

169
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,306
<i>I promise.</i>

170
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,308
<i>Just say,</i>

171
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,977
<i>"Dad, I miss you."</i>

172
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,274
<i>Dad, I miss you.</i>

173
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,650
I'm turning myself in.

174
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,571
<i>Dad, I miss you.</i>

175
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,905
It was me.

176
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,910
I killed Kwon Na-rae.

177
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:33,290
<i>Dad, I miss you.</i>

178
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,272
What's taking so long?

179
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,481
Still no word yet if they're moving out?

180
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,485
I don't hear any sirens. Something's off.

181
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,487
Why isn't anyone
from the family coming in?

182
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,990
Lee just left before he came in too,

183
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,825
as if he wants me to search here.

184
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,493
This is all so strange...

185
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:13,580
What's going on?

186
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,539
FORMATTING IN PROGRESS

187
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,629
No!

188
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,802
Oh my God, no.

189
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,512
What? What's wrong?

190
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,139
The computer's formatting itself.

191
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,891
It must be the security program.

192
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,269
FORMATTING

193
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,691
We need the original files
to use as evidence. You must stop it.

194
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,997
FORMATTING COMPLETE

195
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,669
SHUTTING DOWN

196
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,620
Great.

197
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,665
Okay.

198
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,178
Kim Ji-hoon from Seorae High?

199
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,888
What are you doing here?

200
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,435
Have you recovered from your injuries?

201
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,687
It wasn't a very serious wound.

202
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,523
By the way, what's everyone doing here?

203
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,442
For a search and seizure.

204
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,445
Anyways, you should go
since you're not supposed to be here.

205
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:16,870
Hyun.

206
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,748
Why are you still here?

207
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,624
I was waiting for you.

208
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,293
What happened to Mr. Lee?

209
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,420
Why did you guys even come here?

210
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,505
Our home is in the opposite direction.

211
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,798
Just go home.

212
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,383
We'll talk about this later.

213
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,594
Did he say he's Gaetal?

214
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,889
What? Mr. Lee is Gaetal?

215
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,517
Come on. He's so upright
he doesn't even jaywalk.

216
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,394
He's not Gaetal, but he's a murderer.

217
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,316
You keep going on
about how much you like him,

218
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,901
so I just had to tell you!

219
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,529
How many times have I said
to never judge a book by its cover?

220
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,366
Think of this as a lesson learned.

221
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,035
And don't tell anyone else.

222
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,705
Jjoo, I think we need the equipment.

223
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,999
Hi, Min.

224
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:05,919
Come take a look.

225
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,712
Did you find his laptop?
It wasn't in his room.

226
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,756
Not yet. There's too many computers.

227
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,806
{\an8}<i>Find the laptop.</i>

228
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,435
Hey, Ji-hoon.

229
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,520
Is it the same thing for you too?

230
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,438
Is the person I'm looking at now

231
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:27,774
the real you?

232
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,320
I've been following you too.

233
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,073
Your address is a lie.
Every time I call, you always lie.

234
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,951
Now, be honest with me.

235
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,663
Are you Gaetal?

236
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,145
Okay. Is the superintendent inside?

237
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,483
What is this?

238
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:14,112
This place has new floors
and a fresh coat of paint.

239
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,989
We won't get any more evidence.

240
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,908
We need at least
one hard piece of evidence.

241
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,536
Hyun filmed that video illegally, right?

242
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,581
We'll show the prosecution
and think of a way.

243
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,918
We can't clearly identify the culprit
with the audio file Lee brought.

244
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,587
If he denies it in court, it's over.

245
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,505
But we know one thing for sure.

246
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,465
The crime scene.

247
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,135
It's safe to say Assemblywoman Min

248
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,178
knew about her son's crime too.

249
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,681
We can connect her to this.

250
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,060
Let's run the fingerprints
and do the blood test first.

251
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,688
The timing

252
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,441
of Lee Min-soo
turning himself in was so odd.

253
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,652
It was as if he knew we had his videos.

254
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,243
He turned himself in before he was caught.

255
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,667
Criminals like him usually have
oddly good intuition.

256
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,962
That son of a bitch.

257
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,633
Sang-jae, call the CSI team in.

258
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,926
Yes, sir.

259
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,596
NEW MESSAGE

260
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,808
THEY'RE SEARCHING THE HOUSE
EXCEPT FOR THE TARGET

261
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,109
Lee Min-soo...

262
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,528
turned himself in.

263
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,614
For killing Na-rae.

264
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,498
Does this mean we've failed?

265
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,599
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

266
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:51,436
It'll take time
for this to be admitted as evidence,

267
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,812
so let's wait and see.

268
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,023
Read this.

269
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,316
He's living the good life in there.

270
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,986
He's acting like he's on vacation.

271
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,154
I know.

272
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:12,123
Here's his medication schedule
and ICD guidelines.

273
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,792
Follow the medication schedule closely,

274
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,836
and if he has difficulty breathing,

275
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,713
put an ECG on him immediately.

276
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:23,092
Avoid using metal detectors,
because it can affect the ICD.

277
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,471
He must be kept away from big speakers.

278
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,764
Do you think the police

279
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,891
are his secretaries?

280
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,771
You little...

281
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,022
Hey!

282
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,524
Sir.

283
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,944
I told you to treat our guests well,

284
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,447
not make a scene.

285
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,499
This isn't even a big deal. Just do it.

286
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,625
But sir.

287
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,044
Give him good food and his medication.

288
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,881
Let's make sure
we keep him alive until the trial.

289
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:06,886
He has to live a long life
to serve a long sentence.

290
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,513
He even turned himself in.

291
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,640
The superintendent told us
to be considerate

292
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,725
so the investigation runs smoothly.

293
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,393
So you should go now.

294
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,604
And you two, take him
to the interrogation room.

295
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,356
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

296
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,842
My son has such a soft heart.

297
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,051
And he's kind.

298
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,222
I'm sure he is. Like mother, like son.

299
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:55,476
The one mistake he made as a child
has always bothered him.

300
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,770
And all he did was pretend

301
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,273
to help Byun Woo-taek,
the real perpetrator.

302
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,442
But he was determined
to follow his moral compass.

303
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:04,819
Moral compass?

304
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,447
Oh, because he turned himself in?

305
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:12,326
How admirable is that?
He wants to belatedly pay for his crime...

306
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,997
I mean, pay for his mistake.

307
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,748
Not many people can do that.

308
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,335
Considering the victim,

309
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,546
he deserves a just punishment.

310
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,507
But he's still ill, so I'm really worried.

311
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,595
You remember, right?

312
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:34,348
You took good care of him before.

313
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,061
Both of us made it to where we are now

314
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,605
all thanks to you.

315
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,024
How could we forget? Right?

316
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,151
Right.

317
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:49,363
I'll make sure he has a comfortable stay
during the investigation.

318
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,592
Did you ask for me, sir?

319
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:13,262
Your job is to catch Kwon, not to bother
someone who turned himself in.

320
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,639
Lee Min-soo

321
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:18,559
is the prime suspect not only
in Kwon Na-rae's case but also in another.

322
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:22,480
And Kwon seems to have started
the Killing Vote to bring him to justice.

323
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:26,275
He's not someone
who's unrelated or innocent.

324
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,320
You're exactly right.

325
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,531
And all the more reason
to catch Kwon first.

326
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,952
My son is risking his life
to pay for a mistake,

327
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,662
so we can't let Kwon ruin that.

328
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:42,250
Catching Gaetal and ending the vote
will solve everything at once.

329
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,627
Identify your priorities.

330
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:49,382
I never prioritize criminals.

331
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,385
I just catch
whoever I can get my hands on.

332
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,890
My coffee is cold.

333
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,767
Catch him at all cost. Dead or alive.

334
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,060
Sir, that's...

335
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,437
I said my coffee has gone cold.

336
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,606
She says her coffee's cold!

337
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,816
Oh, right.

338
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,821
He's taken many lives.

339
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,573
Take strong measures.

340
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,209
I knew it wouldn't be here.

341
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:28,546
Nothing.

342
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,799
No laptop whatsoever.
He moved it somewhere else.

343
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,218
Even if we find it,
he probably erased everything.

344
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,886
Guess how he named the file.

345
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,139
"Fun." F-U-N.

346
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,308
There's no way he deleted it.

347
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:43,477
This creep even displays
his water bottles in straight lines.

348
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:47,148
So after pretending
to delete his files, he moved them?

349
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,859
He must have cloud storage.

350
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,528
We need his laptop
to find out where it is.

351
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,866
Okay. I'll see if his main computer
ever linked to a cloud.

352
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,452
- You keep looking for his laptop.
- Got it.

353
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,288
He has a freaking nice car though.

354
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,291
What do you want to eat, sir?

355
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,751
How about kimchi <i>jjigae today?</i>

356
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,711
How about hangover soup? I know a place.

357
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,629
I know a good one. It's new.

358
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:13,424
- Let's just eat anything.
- That place is really good.

359
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,342
Come on.

360
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,803
It's a really good restaurant.

361
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:54,924
Hey.

362
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,134
What are you doing?

363
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,979
I was just...

364
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,190
I'm here to submit my absence notes.

365
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,149
Liar.

366
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:14,735
Were you

367
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,196
trying to take this?

368
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,411
What am I going to do with you and Min?

369
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:26,705
If you keep getting involved,
I'll get in trouble.

370
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,793
I thought he was Gaetal,
but now you say he's a murderer.

371
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,795
I wanted to know who he really is.

372
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,380
I'll help you.

373
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:36,507
No, you won't.

374
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,927
I still feel bad about breaking in here
with you last time.

375
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,100
What happened yesterday?

376
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:49,019
Min wouldn't tell me anything.

377
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,064
Min was following me.

378
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,066
And I was following Mr. Lee.

379
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,485
You followed him? Jeez.

380
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,529
He was always suspicious.

381
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,781
He'd laugh to himself
while looking at his laptop.

382
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,700
And I don't know
if others noticed this too,

383
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,869
but he'd stare at girls in an weird way.

384
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,788
That's why I wanted to check his house.

385
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:10,416
Min is definitely a bad influence.

386
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,293
Be careful with that curiosity.

387
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,463
Don't make
your grandmother and father worry.

388
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,547
What?

389
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,676
Right. I'm sorry I assumed
you didn't have any parents.

390
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,760
Min told me.

391
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,013
I really don't have any parents though.

392
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,557
I told Min I had a father,

393
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,018
because that's what I consider him as.

394
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,061
But I see why she misunderstood.

395
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:33,606
I thought you grew up well on your own,

396
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,649
but you did have a loving family.

397
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,067
I guess.

398
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,986
That's what a family is.

399
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:43,032
They love you no matter what,
for better or worse.

400
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:46,619
That's why I don't change the locks
on the door despite how Min is.

401
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:47,995
Because we're family.

402
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,999
Go on. I need to head to the office.

403
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,127
Okay. Listen, Hyun.

404
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,839
I'm really glad...

405
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,510
I got to know you.

406
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,640
Oh, God. You just gave me goosebumps.

407
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,100
I'm glad too

408
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:13,062
that you're friends
with my little troublemaker.

409
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,105
I like you too.

410
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,691
Next time, let's grab a bite together.

411
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:20,402
And make sure to apply
to Police University.

412
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,826
Min sure has good taste in men.

413
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,750
I told you I couldn't become a cop.

414
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,759
As the investigation
has seemingly gone off-course,

415
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,886
let's assess how things are currently.

416
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,347
This is the Cyber Bureau's job too.

417
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:53,310
It turns out that the mastermind
of the Killing Vote, Kwon Seok-joo,

418
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:56,063
began the plans for it five years ago.

419
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,732
{\an8}The catalyst was when he found out
Lee Min-soo was an accomplice

420
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,318
{\an8}in the murder of his daughter,
Kwon Na-rae.

421
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:02,444
However,

422
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:05,739
Lee confessed to this,
so no need to go over the details.

423
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:08,867
{\an8}The first Gaetal
to help Kwon was Jung Jin-wook.

424
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,788
<i>This former special forces commando</i>
<i>was presumably the one to take initiative.</i>

425
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,624
<i>He took the lead in murdering</i>
<i>the Killing Vote targets.</i>

426
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,546
And Ko Dong-gyu.

427
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,090
{\an8}This is the taxi driver
who kidnapped Bae Gi-chul.

428
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,968
<i>He's been driving taxis for a while,</i>

429
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,471
<i>and it seems he did this</i>
<i>to observe the targets.</i>

430
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:33,350
<i>All the secretly taken footage</i>
<i>streamed during the votes proves this.</i>

431
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:37,187
Now, this is the crazy part.

432
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:40,691
Before Kwon escaped,
remember how the superintendent

433
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:41,984
was the Killing Vote's target?

434
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,320
But the source
of Gaetal's broadcast that day

435
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,780
was found on Lee Min-soo's
personal computer.

436
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:50,159
Jjoo risked her life
to sneak into his room and filmed it,

437
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,078
so we know for sure it's a fact.

438
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,497
This means Kwon Seok-joo

439
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:58,500
joined forces with Lee Min-soo,

440
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,420
who is his archenemy.

441
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,921
But that makes...

442
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,300
no sense whatsoever.

443
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,302
- Did he steal it?
- Man.

444
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:11,930
Now I see why they say athletes are smart.

445
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:16,352
Ko Dong-kyu stole the voting system
and brought it to Lee Min-soo.

446
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,561
That makes sense.

447
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,105
<i>Both of them were spotted</i>

448
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:21,649
<i>at Bae Gi-chul's funeral.</i>

449
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,233
<i>They must have met there.</i>

450
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:30,074
Kwon had to escape,
because the vote was stolen?

451
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,118
There's another reason too.

452
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,579
Why is he so careful with his ICD?

453
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,664
ICD PRECAUTIONS

454
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:41,460
After arresting Lee, we released him
due to his doctor's appointment, right?

455
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:45,172
Yes, the same one Jung Jin-wook is at.
So I looked into it.

456
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:48,217
Lee's doctor is
a heart transplant specialist.

457
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:53,389
Maybe he wanted to end this
before the operation.

458
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:56,934
It seems the doctor
knew Lee's condition well.

459
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:00,646
Weren't both Bae and Uhm drugged
when they died?

460
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,774
Someone with medical expertise
must be aiding him.

461
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:09,154
{\an8}YANG HYE-JIN
SAEHYEON HOSPITAL

462
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,824
Let's watch Yang more closely.

463
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:16,036
And let's not forget
that there's this mysterious X.

464
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,871
According to Jjoo's analysis,

465
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:21,375
this is the person who created
and spread the voting app,

466
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,168
and they instigated people online.

467
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:28,132
And this person is assumed to be
extremely tech-savvy.

468
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,008
{\an8}X: IMPORTANT FIGURE
TECH-SAVVY

469
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:42,438
There was nothing.

470
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,232
I'm sure they controlled
the main computer remotely,

471
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,316
but we didn't find any files.

472
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,236
I'm trying to find traces of a cloud.

473
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,362
Something will turn up.

474
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,826
Let me make this clear.

475
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,996
I know that we don't get along.

476
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,248
And we have different work styles.

477
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,584
But investigating on your own?

478
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:06,962
No. If you don't listen
to your team leader,

479
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,630
get lost.

480
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,549
Let me make something clear too.

481
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,760
First off,

482
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,720
forget that I said I'd go back to HQ.

483
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:18,766
And I'm sorry I broke into
Lee's house without telling you.

484
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,810
However...

485
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,439
"However"?

486
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:28,609
I don't think I'll ever be able
to agree with the way you work.

487
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:32,070
It's not about our work styles.
It's about work ethics.

488
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,825
But the police do need
a hierarchy and discipline.

489
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,619
Until we catch Kwon

490
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,955
and bring Lee to trial,
I'll do as you say.

491
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,373
Then, we'll go separate ways.

492
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:48,170
That still sounds
like you won't listen to me,

493
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,254
but fine.

494
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,381
Do what you do best.

495
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:54,551
Do a background check
on Yang Hye-jin and Kim Ji-hoon.

496
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:58,263
- Ji-hoon?
- Find out not what shows officially

497
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,225
but what they're hiding.

498
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:56,822
Open the door.

499
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,450
I have something
to propose to you, Ms. Chae.

500
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,788
I'm Gaetal.

501
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:11,670
I created the Killing Vote to catch
the killer Lee and his accomplice Min.

502
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,674
How about we make

503
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:16,758
the show together this time?

504
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,387
I'll help you get
the highest ratings ever.

505
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,944
Then first,

506
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,531
prove that you're really Gaetal.

507
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,832
Hello, I'm Chae Do-hee.

508
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:52,878
Our previous broadcast unexpectedly
caused alarm among our viewers.

509
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,547
We sincerely apologize.

510
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:02,304
Over the past week,
we've been torn between two choices.

511
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,097
Delete the voting app

512
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,725
and become good citizens
of a constitutional nation,

513
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,061
or become watchdogs

514
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,438
who want our society
to wake up and evolve.

515
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,566
Our message boards showed
how torn you were.

516
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,737
So today, we've invited
a very special guest.

517
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,658
The most suitable guest
for <i>Chae Do-hee's Killing Vote Special</i>

518
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:26,286
and the figure at the center
of numerous recent incidents.

519
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,206
Meet the creator
of the Killing Vote, Gaetal.

520
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,461
<i>Hello.</i>

521
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,880
<i>I'm Gaetal,</i>
<i>the creator of the Killing Vote.</i>

522
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:41,301
<i>I've taken the opportunity to come here</i>
<i>and tell you something in person.</i>

523
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,179
What's going on?

524
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:45,889
Is it over?

525
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,434
- It's Gaetal!
- Is he really Gaetal?

526
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:03,115
First, I'd like to extend
my deepest apologies to everyone.

527
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:08,161
It was clearly wrong to hack your phones

528
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:11,707
and install the app on them
without your consent.

529
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,209
I failed to inform you from the start,

530
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,004
<i>because I was afraid my methods</i>
<i>would obscure my intentions.</i>

531
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,171
<i>I apologize.</i>

532
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,051
Come on! Hurry!

533
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,638
<i>But I can tell you one thing.</i>
<i>I have never used you</i>

534
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,807
<i>or sold your personal information.</i>

535
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,767
<i>The app performs only one task.</i>

536
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:33,562
<i>They display text messages</i>
<i>and videos that have been prepared</i>

537
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,231
<i>on your smartphones on cue.</i>

538
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,191
<i>Now, if you update the app,</i>

539
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,110
<i>you can see all the content,</i>

540
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,112
<i>and you can delete it if you want.</i>

541
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:46,783
<i>And I'll let you decide</i>
<i>what to do from this point on.</i>

542
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,243
NUMBER ONE
WE NEED YOUR HELP

543
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,667
UPDATE THE WEATHER APP?

544
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,086
CONFIRM

545
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,129
UPDATING

546
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,051
<i>Your choices</i>

547
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:07,596
{\an8}<i>have healed the wounds</i>
<i>of victims neglected by the law.</i>

548
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,931
{\an8}<i>I have always had only one goal.</i>

549
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,642
{\an8}<i>It was to spread rational justice</i>

550
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:14,102
{\an8}<i>in this society.</i>

551
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,480
{\an8}<i>Now, I fairly ask</i>

552
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,607
{\an8}<i>for your choice.</i>

553
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,903
Please update the voting app.

554
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:26,323
And please continue
to pursue justice with me.

555
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,659
One week from now,
there will be another vote.

556
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,704
The target is disguised
as a high school teacher

557
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,998
<i>who has secretly enjoyed</i>
<i>killing multiple people.</i>

558
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,124
<i>The worst scum.</i>

559
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:40,378
<i>Using his privilege as the son</i>
<i>of an assemblyman from a wealthy family,</i>

560
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:42,255
<i>he cunningly skirted the law.</i>

561
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,591
<i>I need your impartial judgment</i>
<i>on this person</i>

562
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:47,260
<i>- whose name cannot be revealed yet.</i>
- Darn it.

563
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:49,721
<i>If you have already deleted the app,</i>

564
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,807
<i>visit our show's website</i>

565
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,141
<i>to find the link...</i>

566
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:00,190
Now, let us begin again.

567
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,109
CHAE DO-HEE'S KILLING VOTE SPECIAL

568
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:05,695
Hello?

569
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,072
Chae Do-hee!

570
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,743
What in the world? It wasn't live?

571
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,912
So this is what the rehearsal was about.

572
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,997
She really has lost her mind.

573
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,666
Find her and bring her to me.

574
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,883
Sir, we talked with the network...

575
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,051
It was recorded?

576
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:29,427
How did you know, sir?

577
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:32,681
She recorded it secretly yesterday.
Even her chief was fooled.

578
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,517
Old habits die hard.

579
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:39,062
Are you going to just sit by
and let her keep doing this?

580
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:39,980
Darn it.

581
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:43,525
Hello, ma'am.

582
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,527
Please calm down.

583
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,404
- Hello, this is Seorae High.
- Hello?

584
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:51,408
That's just a rumor among the kids.

585
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,244
None of that has been confirmed.

586
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,829
- Of course.
- Okay, ma'am. Bye.

587
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,457
<i>Holy cow, guys. I just heard</i>

588
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,834
<i>that Mr. Lee will be on the next vote.</i>

589
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,711
<i>Did he pretend to be sick to hide this?</i>

590
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,129
<i>So the cops were here to watch him.</i>

591
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,173
<i>His mom is an assemblywoman.</i>
<i>No doubt it's him.</i>

592
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,799
<i>I thought he was a nice person.</i>

593
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,910
Gaetal...

594
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,453
I mean, Kwon Seok-joo

595
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:40,624
officially announced you
as the next target.

596
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,335
He didn't say your name
but revealed your personal information.

597
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,962
You could be attacked
at any time from now on,

598
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:48,632
so you'll need an emergency line.

599
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,303
People are funny, aren't they?

600
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:57,098
They never deleted the app
when the police asked them to.

601
00:41:57,182 --> 00:42:00,435
But when they're asked to join
a murder disguised as justice,

602
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,687
they updated the apps immediately.

603
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,067
Professor Kwon is truly amazing.

604
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:08,777
I know, right?

605
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:13,657
Seeing how he took back
the Killing Vote from you in an instant.

606
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,411
By the way, it's very rude

607
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,789
to enter other people's rooms
without permission.

608
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,583
I guess you didn't have
parents to teach you that.

609
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:27,379
But fortunately, I taught Min well.

610
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:30,840
Mr. Lee Min-soo.

611
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,927
You seemed to like girls
in school uniforms.

612
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:37,639
You dare to talk about my sister?

613
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:40,850
You sick bastard.

614
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:45,438
I don't care if you put that
around your neck or swallow it.

615
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,649
Just keep it with you.

616
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,652
You could die any minute now.

617
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,570
You must be so scared.

618
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,740
Right?

619
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:02,580
I'll kill you, you bitch! How dare you?

620
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:04,666
Come back here!

621
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,126
Hey!

622
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,715
KWON SEOK-JOO, KWON NA-RAE

KWON NA-RAE MURDER CASE

631
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:27,874
<i>He finishes school at 10 p.m.</i>

632
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:03,618
You said too many coincidences
mean it's not a coincidence.

633
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:05,829
{\an8}You were right.

634
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,044
Kim Ji-hoon.

635
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:17,257
The voting always started at 10 p.m.

636
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,969
because that's when schools
and academies close.

637
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,763
Because he was a high school student.

638
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:26,558
Kim Ji-hoon is...

639
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,021
<i>the X.</i>

640
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,984
Wait in front of that camera over there
so it can catch you.

641
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:39,946
JUST ARRIVED

642
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,030
NUMBER FOUR

643
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,333
<i>The boy who almost became</i>

644
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:54,752
<i>Kwon Seok-joo's son.</i>

645
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,050
He's the X.

646
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:14,772
I made some food for you.
I hope you'll like it.

647
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,609
Thank you for the food.

648
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:34,751
It's good.

649
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:38,838
Everything tastes really good.

650
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,426
It's nothing special.

651
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:46,596
I can't believe
I've never done this for you.

652
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:50,308
I'm sorry
I haven't paid attention to you.

653
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:53,811
I know it was hard
being assigned to look after me.

654
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,068
I've never been married,

655
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:04,239
so it was hard for me to answer
whenever you called me Grandma.

656
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:08,368
But when I'd return from work
and see your shoes,

657
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,078
I really liked that.

658
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:18,086
I wasn't assigned to look after you.

659
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,547
I was just living with my family.

660
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,299
That's what it was to me.

661
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:33,977
I'm going to turn myself in soon.

662
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,481
The cops seem
to have found out the relationship

663
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:40,316
between Professor Kwon and me.

664
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,902
And I killed a person,

665
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:45,196
so I can't call myself a doctor anymore.

666
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:48,700
So I was wondering, Ji-hoon...

667
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,452
Why don't you go to Germany?

668
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,122
Me?

669
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,207
You're only 19,

670
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,753
and you will be left
all alone again at this rate.

671
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:07,010
Professor Kwon and the rest of us
chose this because of our grudges,

672
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:09,387
but you're different.

673
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:15,393
Go somewhere where nobody knows
what happened here, and live your life.

674
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:17,687
Laugh,

675
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,648
go experience things,

676
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,109
and find your dreams.

677
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:28,615
You deserve that kind of life.

678
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,912
Where are you going?

679
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:16,996
Well...

680
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,001
The superintendent told me

681
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:23,711
he's that boy from back then.

682
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,005
You knew Ji-hoon too?

683
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:29,258
We almost caught Lee Min-soo
thanks to that kid,

684
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:30,760
so I do remember him.

685
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:33,638
He's a smart and sweet kid.

686
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:38,101
I just can't believe he was
a part of this group of killers.

687
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,269
If we had caught Lee then,

688
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:42,480
many things would've changed.

689
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,941
For Kwon Seok-joo, Ji-hoon,

690
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,069
and all of us.

691
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,364
If Kwon doesn't show up tomorrow,

692
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,033
let's arrest those two first.

693
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:55,118
Yes, sir.

694
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:13,302
{\an8}<i>The professor's student is</i>
<i>Kim Ji-hoon, a Seorae High senior.</i>

695
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:15,096
{\an8}THAT WOMAN

696
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,600
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

697
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,489
Where's my medicine? It's time.

698
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,616
Let's maintain our manners when speaking.

699
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,201
It's coming soon.

700
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,329
What if I get an arrhythmia?

701
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:44,876
If a suspect dies in police custody,
you and your bosses will be fired.

702
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,378
- Am I wrong?
- What?

703
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:49,046
That little...

704
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,884
Wait. Why did you bring that, sir?

705
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:55,386
Tell me about it.

706
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,055
They never let me idle around.

707
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:02,310
I thought he was the culprit,
not a VIP guest.

708
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,519
I said the same thing.

709
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,628
Hello, sir.

710
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,421
- How's everything?
- Good.

711
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:32,799
He works out and drinks herbal medicine.

712
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:34,801
He's probably healthier than I am.

713
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:38,387
I need to check the cloud he uses.

714
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:40,097
Sure. I'll open it for you.

715
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,897
- What?
- What's wrong with him?

716
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,691
What's going on?

717
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,027
Call an ambulance!

718
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,531
Lee Min-soo.

719
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,075
Lee Min-soo!

720
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:01,869
You've got to be kidding me.

721
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,120
Min-soo needs help! Now!

722
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:05,373
Min-soo.

723
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,624
Quick.

724
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:24,183
BP, 86 over 67. Oxygen, 85.
Body temperature, 38.3 degrees.

725
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:26,811
- Pulse is unstable.
- Give him five liters of oxygen.

726
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,354
{\an8}- Run a full lab and an EKG.
- Yes, sir.

727
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:29,689
{\an8}This patient has an ICD.

728
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,816
- Uncuff him.
- No, he's a criminal.

729
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,151
Our machine will malfunction. Uncuff him.

730
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:35,755
Nicotine?

731
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:39,467
How is that possible? He's never smoked.
Someone tried to poison him.

732
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,470
He wasn't injected.
It was in the drink he had.

733
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,764
- So we were fortunate.
- And the cops?

734
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,308
They're questioning the officer
who gave him the drink.

735
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:06,619
This way.

736
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,107
Min-soo!

737
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,484
Min-soo.

738
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,487
Find Min-soo. Now!

739
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:44,740
Min-soo.

740
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:30,911
AMBULANCE

741
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,732
- Can you locate Lee?
<i>- We're tracking his smartwatch.</i>

742
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:43,150
<i>He's still moving.</i>

743
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:46,320
- What about Yang?
<i>- She just went in a supermarket.</i>

744
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:16,517
Where did you take Lee Min-soo?

745
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:19,019
Lee Min-soo?

746
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:21,355
I've never heard that name before.

747
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:24,233
What about Kwon Seok-joo then?

748
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,570
Tell me where he is.

749
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:30,739
I told you I know nothing
about Inmate 0512.

750
00:57:33,826 --> 00:57:36,453
Dr. Yang Hye-jin, you're under arrest

751
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:40,291
for aiding Kwon's escape
and the murders of Bae, Uhm, and Oh.

752
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,546
You have the right to an attorney
and the right to remain silent.

753
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:49,800
- What's going on?
- I don't know. Someone's getting arrested.

754
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:51,051
Stay back.

755
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:55,264
What a shame.

756
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:57,558
I was planning to turn myself in.

757
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:00,811
One more murder,

758
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:03,647
and Kwon Seok-joo
will face the death penalty.

759
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,400
Are you going to let that happen?

760
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,737
Detective.

761
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:13,282
He already died eight years ago.

762
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,076
Don't you get it?

763
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,880
How have you been?

764
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,925
Man.

765
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:14,635
So this is

766
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,762
the hideout.

767
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,224
I always wanted to see it,

768
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:22,309
and this is what it looks like.

769
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:25,062
So you must be Number One,

770
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,856
who developed the voting program.

771
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:30,276
You have some great skills.

772
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,444
I wonder who you are.

773
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:46,166
You've been chosen for the Killing Vote.

774
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,751
The result will decide

775
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:51,213
whether or not
we break that machine in your heart.

776
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:55,259
Due to consuming nicotine,
your heart's beating abnormally fast,

777
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,428
and it won't last long
without a defibrillator.

778
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:00,806
If you want to live,

779
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:03,434
it's not too late to repent.

780
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:07,062
Confess to all your crimes
in front of the people

781
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:09,648
and seek forgiveness from the victims.

782
01:00:09,732 --> 01:00:11,692
If you're genuinely regretful,

783
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:13,694
the people

784
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,905
will change their choice.

785
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,954
Stop acting like you're righteous,

786
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,916
and just do what you want.

787
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,794
You want to kill me.

788
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:32,421
Right?

789
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:42,514
Why did you do that to Na-rae?

790
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,351
She was just an innocent little girl.

791
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:54,443
You just wouldn't pay attention
to me because of her.

792
01:00:57,446 --> 01:01:01,158
I loved you so dearly.

793
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:04,328
<i>I lived for you.</i>

794
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:08,916
<i>And I hated the stupid dog</i>
<i>she always walked around with.</i>

795
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:14,588
I respected and loved you so much.

796
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:18,300
You should've just appreciated it.

797
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,678
That was

798
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,306
your reason?

799
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,226
To get my attention?

800
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:30,437
That's it?

801
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:34,441
Just for that? That's why?

802
01:01:34,942 --> 01:01:36,026
You bastard!

803
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:49,915
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

804
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:53,168
<i>As previously announced,</i>
<i>we have the worst scum of the Earth today.</i>

805
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:56,880
<i>After kidnapping and murdering</i>
<i>a 7-year-old girl at age 16,</i>

806
01:01:56,964 --> 01:02:01,635
<i>he's been committing and aiding</i>
<i>numerous assaults and murders.</i>

807
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,512
And we have chosen him for the vote.

808
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,056
<i>Lee Min-soo.</i>

809
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,141
<i>HIs birth name is</i>

810
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,685
<i>Lee Yun-seong.</i>

811
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:13,605
<i>The son of Samdo Steel's chairman</i>
<i>and Assemblywoman Min Ji-young.</i>

812
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:16,733
He's also a teacher at Seorae High School.

813
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:24,032
I'm screwed.

814
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,829
- Sir.
- Did you find him?

815
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,831
- Search over there.
- Yes, sir.

816
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:43,802
The signal stopped here.

817
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:44,887
The voting has started.

818
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,473
You said there was a power surge
during last week's vote, right?

819
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:52,186
- Check for something similar around here.
- Yes, sir.

820
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:54,646
- We have to find it!
- Yes, sir!

821
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:58,066
LEE MIN-SOO

822
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:04,156
DO YOU VOTE "YES" OR "NO"?

823
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:15,334
YES 45%, NO 4%

824
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:23,342
Justice?

825
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:26,803
You're not falling for that crap, are you?

826
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:30,057
Kwon Seok-joo just wants to kill me,

827
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,726
so he's making you his accomplices.

828
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:36,480
Because if you do it all together,
you won't be punished.

829
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:40,651
<i>You're making up fancy excuses,</i>

830
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:44,363
<i>but I know you're doing this</i>
<i>damn thing for fun!</i>

831
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:48,158
<i>It's so fun to kill a person</i>
<i>with just one click, isn't it?</i>

832
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,661
<i>It's exhilarating, isn't it?</i>

833
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:51,787
AGREE

834
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,038
<i>I'm just like you.</i>

835
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,915
<i>I have tons of money,</i>

836
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:58,669

837
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:01,463

<i>Pricks will always be pricks!</i>

842
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:17,104
Just die.

843
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,606
<i>And the rich will get rich!</i>

844
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:24,236

You bastards are all the same...

847
01:04:30,576 --> 01:04:31,994
Shut up!

848
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,461
<i>So...</i>

849
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:43,422
all the more reason to die.

<i>To change this world and break it down,</i>

851
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:49,511
<i>there needs to be bloodshed.</i>

Do you think the Killing Vote is right?

853
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,602
In order to change something
and break it down,

854
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:59,313
I think there needs to be bloodshed.

855
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:01,648
No way.

856
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:05,986
And you are going to be
a very good example of it.

857
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,738
No way. Are you...

858
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:11,199

Hey.

<i>It's 212-3, Seorae-dong.</i>
<i>Anonymous Internet Café.</i>

They're using as much electricity
as Lee's house.

872
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:16,973
That's normal for internet cafés.

873

<i>This much power would shut</i>

Their business would be doomed.

876
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:28,402
You're right. That must be the place then.

01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:30,779
Yeah, just wait there.

- The fifth basement floor.

01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,929
There is no fifth basement floor.

887
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:20,407
{\an8}<i>Number 347, we need your help.</i>

888
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,576
<i>Number 434, we need your help.</i>

889
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:27,747
YES: 87%
EXECUTE

890
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:10,957
Die!

891
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:12,792
Die.

892
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:15,879
Kwon Seok-joo!

893
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:20,050
Die, you bastard!

894
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:21,134
Mu-chan.

895
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,469
Kim Mu-chan!

896
01:10:23,345 --> 01:10:25,430
Mu-chan, wait!

897
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,390
Bring the defibrillator!

898
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,894
Lay him down!

899
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:34,731
No!

900
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:36,524
Mu-chan.

901
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:16,189
Ji-hoon.

902
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,608
You know who I am.

903
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:22,862
It's all over now.

904
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:26,783
Come out. I won't hurt you.

905
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,577
I promise.

906
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:35,125
I'll do my best to protect you,
Ms. Yang, and Kwon.

907
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,169
So let's go.

908
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:43,633
Kim Mu-chan! This is what the people want!

909
01:11:43,717 --> 01:11:45,343
Everyone wants him dead!

910
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,178
Don't move!

911
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:49,973
Kim Mu-chan. No.

912
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:53,518
If you keep him alive,
there will be more victims like Na-rae!

913
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:56,312
Mu-chan, just let him die!

914
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:39,981
Mu-chan!

915
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,941
Just let him die!

916
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,323
<i>Press the shock button.</i>

917
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:49,657
Kim Mu-chan.

918
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:53,578
You also

919
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:56,706
wanted to kill him.

920
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,168
No.

921
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:01,586
Don't, Mu-chan.

922
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:03,546
No.

923
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,054
<i>Just say, "Dad, I miss you."</i>

924
01:13:12,764 --> 01:13:14,015
<i>It was me.</i>

925
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:17,060
<i>I killed Kwon Na-rae.</i>

926
01:13:24,943 --> 01:13:26,402
I guess

927
01:13:27,946 --> 01:13:30,698
you can't turn a blind eye
and let me go this time?

928
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,637
No!

929
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:39,559
{\an8}Now is the only chance to go back.

930
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,060
{\an8}<i>Hate me all you want.</i>

931
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:43,438
{\an8}<i>What's the real reason for doing this?</i>

932
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:45,356
{\an8}<i>What are you trying to do?</i>

933
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,734
{\an8}<i>Please give us the chance</i>
<i>to protect Ji-hoon.</i>

934
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:48,776
{\an8}Number Three!

935
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:51,571
{\an8}<i>Change of plans. We're negotiating.</i>

936
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,114
{\an8}<i>Just turn yourself in.</i>

937
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,325
{\an8}<i>Everyone's gone crazy.</i>

938
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,160
{\an8}<i>Just watch</i>

939
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,287
{\an8}<i>and see how those murderers end up.</i>

940
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,503
