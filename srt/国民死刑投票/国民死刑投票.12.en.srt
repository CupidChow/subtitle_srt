1
00:00:41,438 --> 00:00:43,023
WOULD YOU LIKE TO VOTE?

2
00:00:57,454 --> 00:01:00,040
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,123 --> 00:01:01,416
SAFETY OF CHILD ACTORS WAS ENSURED

4
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:06,505
TEN YEARS AGO

5
00:01:21,937 --> 00:01:23,355
{\an8}Hyun, we have a guest.

6
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:40,831
{\an8}I'm sorry.

7
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:43,708
{\an8}I'm so sorry.

8
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:47,295
{\an8}My job doesn't pay much,
and I'd worked overnight for a few days.

9
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,923
{\an8}I really messed up.

10
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,717
{\an8}You were drunk.

11
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:56,429
{\an8}You ran away to hide
that you were drunk driving.

12
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:58,265
{\an8}They were trapped

13
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,101
{\an8}and asked you to save them.

14
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:04,020
{\an8}Look, kid.

15
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,899
I just dozed off.

16
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,948
I'll come back another time.

17
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:21,371
Liar. I smelled the alcohol.

18
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:22,998
I know what that stench was.

19
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:25,000
- Please stop!
- You were drunk driving!

20
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,710
You killed my mom and dad!

21
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:28,545
Say you killed them!

22
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:30,046
- Let go!
- Say it!

23
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,631
- Say it!
- Hurry and go.

24
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:34,092
Bring my mom and dad back!

25
00:02:36,094 --> 00:02:38,138
Bring them back!

26
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:44,311
Mom...

27
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:49,733
COURT

28
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,070
{\an8}PUNISH THE DRUNK DRIVER

29
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:00,201
{\an8}How do you feel about this?

30
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:02,954
{\an8}Please give us a word.

31
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:04,497
Could you give us a comment?

32
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:09,544
She left the car there and disappeared.
Then, she reappeared two days later.

33
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:13,006
Alcohol can't be detected
after 20 hours, so she wasn't tested.

34
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:15,967
There was a DUI checkpoint
near the scene that day.

35
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:18,803
Look. The plate numbers are the same.

36
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:22,807
I think she hit our car
while trying to avoid the checkpoint.

37
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:26,436
How did you find all of this, kid?

38
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,773
- Good job with the dashcam footage.
- Well, thanks.

39
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:33,276
But what's certain is
I definitely smelled alcohol.

40
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,986
After the accident,

41
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,530
she removed the memory card
from our dashcam.

42
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:39,866
She even checked if we were all dead.

43
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,702
And she reeked of alcohol.

44
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:47,874
I swear. It was drunk driving.

45
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:58,301
You worked so hard.
I hope I can bring you good news.

46
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:02,013
Thank you for listening to me though.

47
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:03,598
I mean it.

48
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:05,600
You're the only one...

49
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:09,020
who's heard me out.

50
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:11,272
Thank you.

51
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:17,737
REDEPLOYMENT
KIM MU-CHAN

52
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:23,118
Sir.

53
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:27,872
I got the car accident victim's statement.
Want to see?

54
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:29,791
Sure. I'll be waiting for it.

55
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:32,210
Why is Violent Crimes on a traffic case?

56
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:35,296
It was a waste of time.
There's no actual evidence.

57
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,136
Hey, this is because of your incompetence.
If you can't even listen, just quit.

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,555
Get your act together.

59
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:46,057
Bring me the statements by today.

60
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:47,225
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:49,227
Here's the beer!

62
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:51,396
- Here.
- Thanks.

63
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:53,857
Let's drink.

64
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:55,859
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

65
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:59,070
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up?

66
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,073
So refreshing.

67
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:04,117
That really hit the spot.

68
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:25,597
Hey, you said
you'd never play hooky again.

69
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,140
Hyun.

70
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,851
Can you be a killer instead of a cop?

71
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:32,562
You always ask me to do weird stuff.

72
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:34,856
Cops can't get revenge on her.

73
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:38,401
I can't stand seeing her
enjoy her life. I want to kill her.

74
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:39,778
Forget it.

75
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:43,698
The best revenge is to have happy lives.

76
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:49,037
I'll become a great cop,
so there won't be any victims like us.

77
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,873
I'll listen to people
and see investigations through.

78
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:56,544
A great cop catches criminals.
Listening isn't enough.

79
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:59,089
Listening to people
is very comforting to them.

80
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:01,007
Fine. Go ahead and be a cop.

81
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:05,929
Just don't do anything risky.
We weren't born at the same time,

82
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:08,765
but we promised to die together.
Don't forget that.

83
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,267
Well, we don't have to do that.

84
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:14,646
I'll pass. You live a long life,
and I'll take care of myself.

85
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,482
You scratch your scar
when you're uncomfortable.

86
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:19,484
We're not going to die together?

87
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,779
That's something humans can't control.

88
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,324
Let's live our own lives.

89
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,621
Hyun!

90
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:03,236
<i>Kill Kwon Seok-joo.</i>

91
00:07:05,822 --> 00:07:08,032
We can take him alive. Give us more time.

92
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:11,578
There are two of them.
What if they detonate a bomb?

93
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:13,705
Kill them before it's too late.

94
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,168
Let me ask you one thing.

95
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,919
Is this order

96
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:23,631
coming from police executives
without the same external pressures

97
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:26,968
that bound Lieutenant Choi
eight years ago?

98
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,098
Are you certain this decision
wasn't made out of self-interest?

99
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:41,149
Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.

100
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:57,081
Change of plans.
We're negotiating with Kwon.

101
00:07:57,165 --> 00:08:00,001
- I'll do it myself.
- What? Negotiate?

102
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:04,297
We found booby traps
inside the wall and at the entrance.

103
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:11,387
<i>Kwon and Park. You're surrounded.</i>

104
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:16,851
- Darn it.
<i>- I'm coming to you now. I'm unarmed.</i>

105
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,770
<i>Let's talk it out.</i>

106
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:22,690
<i>This has gone far enough.</i>
<i>Let's not cause any more casualties.</i>

107
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:23,775
They're already here.

108
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,653
Are you going to let it end like this?

109
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:29,864
<i>When his daughter</i>
<i>was murdered eight years ago,</i>

110
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:31,866
<i>the cops knew Lee Min-soo was...</i>

111
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,201
- Ji-hoon.
- Professor.

112
00:08:34,244 --> 00:08:37,121
<i>The police are watching</i>
<i>every move you make.</i>

113
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:38,164
<i>Turn yourselves in.</i>

114
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,379
Ji-hoon's using Lee's computer
to stream through our agency's server.

115
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:47,131
I'll catch up with him soon,
so hang in there.

116
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:49,217
You said they're coming here.
What's the problem?

117
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,137
Min's offered a bounty on his head.
If they catch him, he'll be in danger.

118
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:58,726
Secure those two as fast as you can.

119
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,146
<i>My father's going to take his own life.</i>

120
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,690
But why does he have to?

121
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:08,486
Those who destroyed our happiness
never paid for what they did.

122
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:09,862
<i>Why is it always</i>

123
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:15,576
<i>the righteous people</i>
<i>who are strict with themselves?</i>

124
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,122
Please call Lieutenant Joo.
I must tell her something.

125
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:26,754
Holy cow, 200 million?

126
00:09:27,338 --> 00:09:29,465
We could buy new motorbikes with that.

127
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:32,093
This sounds awesome.

128
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:33,720
Let's go, guys.

129
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:39,517
<i>I got my GED thanks to the professor.</i>
<i>I'm now studying for the SATs.</i>

130
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,812
<i>He's a good man.</i>
<i>I'll support him until the end.</i>

131
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:45,023
<i>I won't cast a vote.</i>

132
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:52,113
<i>- Should we vote?</i>
<i>- Gaetal's been wronged.</i>

133
00:09:52,196 --> 00:09:55,783
<i>- I feel bad. I won't vote.</i>
<i>- I'm voting. He did kill them.</i>

134
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:57,869
<i>- He wants to die.</i>
<i>- Still, it's not right.</i>

135
00:09:57,952 --> 00:09:59,454
{\an8}<i>- I'm against this.</i>
<i>- I'm not.</i>

136
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:01,331
<i>- I'm not voting.</i>
<i>- Me neither.</i>

137
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,792
DO YOU VOTE "YES" OR "NO"?

138
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:08,171
These sons of...

139
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:09,130
Step on it!

140
00:10:13,676 --> 00:10:14,969
I'll go alone.

141
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:16,763
- Take out the booby traps.
- Yes, sir.

142
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:37,992
I ABSTAIN

143
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:46,584
<i>Ma'am, the entire nation is watching,</i>

144
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:49,420
and Kim Mu-chan
won't listen to me anymore.

145
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:53,466
That criminal planted a bomb.
And you let Kim get in the way?

146
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:59,680
If this gets out,
you think you can handle it?

147
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:00,932
<i>Give me some time.</i>

148
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:02,809
I will deal with this.

149
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:06,813
If no one's on site to take charge,
then go there yourself.

150
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:09,607
Go and shoot him.
At least earn what I paid you for.

151
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,150
Shoot and kill Kwon!

152
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:15,321
I said kill him! Kill him!

153
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:17,865
Kill him!

154
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,085
VOTING WILL CLOSE

155
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:30,169
VOTING HAS CLOSED

156
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:31,129
Please.

157
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,590
MAJORITY ABSTAINS SO VOTE IS CANCELED

158
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:38,219
<i>The vote has ended.</i>

159
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:40,763
Most people abstained, so it's canceled.

160
00:11:40,888 --> 00:11:42,223
VOTE IS CANCELED

161
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:49,772
You need to make a decision.

162
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,442
Stick to the plan.

163
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:13,296
Sang-jae!

164
00:12:14,672 --> 00:12:17,258
Yes, we're fine.

165
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:19,594
An animal must have passed by.

166
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,647
How can I leave you here?

167
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:34,859
That doesn't change what I must do.

168
00:12:34,942 --> 00:12:36,569
This has always been my plan.

169
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,906
Then, let me take over.

170
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:43,201
The Killing Vote's program.

171
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:45,077
Let me have it.

172
00:12:46,621 --> 00:12:48,956
I should keep it to carry out your wishes.

173
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,879
People were moved by what you said, right?

174
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:57,423
I should tell Hyun about this.

175
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:01,511
I still need to go to my father
and stop him from hurting himself.

176
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:04,889
NUMBER THREE

177
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:07,975
Number Three turned off his phone.
We can't track him.

178
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:12,104
I know his general area, so I'm going.

179
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:25,535
<i>- Ji-hoon.</i>
- Grandma.

180
00:13:26,244 --> 00:13:28,746
I thought you were arrested.
Where are you?

181
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:32,708
That's right. I'm in a cell now.
They let me call you.

182
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:36,337
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

183
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,549
You were made to carry
this burden because of us adults.

184
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:45,304
<i>It's okay to stop now.</i>
<i>Min's sister promised to protect you.</i>

185
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:49,433
And the cops found out
where the Professor is.

186
00:13:50,184 --> 00:13:51,185
Do you think

187
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:53,646
he'll be okay then?

188
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:55,523
Yes, he will.

189
00:13:56,482 --> 00:14:00,653
<i>Let's pay for our mistakes</i>
<i>and move on with our lives.</i>

190
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:02,989
I won't ask you to go off alone again.

191
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:04,865
Okay.

192
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:08,077
I'll see you soon...

193
00:14:10,037 --> 00:14:11,038
Grandma.

194
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:29,932
Let's go see Hyun.

195
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:32,268
I'll turn myself in.

196
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:34,270
Okay.

197
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:46,616
<i>Ji-hoon will turn himself in.</i>

198
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:49,910
Please keep your promise and protect him.

199
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:50,995
Of course.

200
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:53,331
I'll do my best.

201
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:56,917
He disconnected when the stream ended,
but I've located him.

202
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:58,961
It's the bus stop by Mirim Station.

203
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:17,313
Stay back. Don't come closer!

204
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:31,452
Darn it.

205
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:49,637
Darn it.

206
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:55,518
Kwon is calling.

207
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:58,187
He wants me to put you
through to him. Should I?

208
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,647
Do it.

209
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,731
<i>Kim Mu-chan.</i>

210
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:03,359
You came much sooner than I expected.

211
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,236
I almost changed my plan.

212
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:06,904
I know what you're thinking.

213
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,784
And that's not the best decision.
It won't make you look regretful.

214
00:16:12,368 --> 00:16:13,953
I don't regret what I did.

215
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:18,165
I'm taking responsibility for my actions
that violated the social norms.

216
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,750
Don't run away like this!

217
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,545
It'll only make things harder
for those left behind.

218
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,297
I left evidence showing
that I threatened Ji-hoon

219
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:26,716
so he was forced to help me.

220
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,262
My college friend and lawyer, Kang,
will defend him and Ms. Yang.

221
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:33,931
But first, call off the APB on him.

222
00:16:34,014 --> 00:16:36,267
If you saw what Ji-hoon did today,

223
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,895
then you'd know how much
leaving him behind would hurt him.

224
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,314
<i>But you're still going to insist?</i>

225
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:44,108
He'll get over it.

226
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:46,485
He's strong.

227
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:49,655
<i>I wish...</i>

228
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:53,743
<i>we had never met.</i>

229
00:16:57,913 --> 00:17:00,583
You should wait to see Min
face the consequences.

230
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,334
Then, it'll really be over.

231
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,716
After calling out for justice,
you can't let this be the end.

232
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:11,594
So...

233
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:17,183
Seok-joo?

234
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:21,562
Are you there?

235
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:37,036
Na-rae.

236
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:54,345
Seok-joo!

237
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,144
No!

238
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:05,856
Seok-joo!

239
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,067
Sang-jae!

240
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,361
Seok-joo! Wake up.

241
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:33,676
CONNECTION FAILED

242
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:49,316
Jjoo.

243
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:53,487
He was definitely here, but...

244
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:56,532
Gosh, I don't feel good about this.

245
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:57,825
Me too.

246
00:18:57,908 --> 00:18:59,118
Let's find them quickly.

247
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:00,244
Okay.

248
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:01,203
Hey.

249
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:03,998
Right.

250
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,002
This is Kim Jo-dan from the Cyber Bureau.

251
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:09,753
Bus stop number 20576.

252
00:19:09,837 --> 00:19:13,173
Please check the CCTV footage.
It's urgent. Yes.

253
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:17,261
- Let's go.
- Okay.

254
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:27,980
What are you doing?

255
00:19:33,485 --> 00:19:35,154
Ms. Chae, this is the police!

256
00:19:35,237 --> 00:19:36,363
- Open it.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:11,023
Sir, what brings you here?

258
00:20:11,774 --> 00:20:12,816
Are you okay?

259
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,362
- Are you hurt?
- Of course, not. Why would I be?

260
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:18,906
We saw you being abducted.

261
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:21,367
You signaled the superintendent
on the phone.

262
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:24,620
I said that because I wanted
to make up with Hyun.

263
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:28,415
He must've misunderstood.
I wasn't abducted.

264
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:29,792
It was even filmed--

265
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,711
I simply received
an unexpected invitation, okay?

266
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:42,221
Anyway, since the director came for me,

267
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:43,973
I'll get going now.

268
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,975
As you wish.

269
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:48,477
It was an interesting conversation.

270
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:52,648
I won't forget what you said today.

271
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,609
Next time you invite me,
give me a heads-up.

272
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:02,408
Wait, Ms. Chae!

273
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:25,264
{\an8}THEY'RE BULLIES FROM SEORAE HIGH
HE'S WORTH 200 MILLION WON?

274
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:27,016
{\an8}Nice.

275
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:30,144
{\an8}Stop it!

276
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:33,772
{\an8}Hello, everyone.

277
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:37,526
{\an8}What you're seeing is a guy
with a handsome bounty on his head...

278
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:43,282
{\an8}Ta-da! Gaetal Kim Ji-hoon
is being brutally executed.

279
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:47,202
If you don't want to watch, get lost.

280
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:49,413
Stop it!

281
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:53,167
{\an8}This con artist told us
to do this and that.

282
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,712
{\an8}This damn Gaetal treated us
as if we were his slaves.

283
00:21:57,504 --> 00:21:59,423
{\an8}A devil who was deemed innocent.

284
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:01,842
Now, I'll give you one minute.

285
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:06,096
If you're in favor of Ji-hoon's execution,
press the like button.

286
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,598
Starting now.

287
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:09,975
One. Two.

288
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:11,477
- Three.
- Three.

289
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,686
Four.

290
00:22:30,162 --> 00:22:31,288
Stop, you crazy bastard!

291
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,794
What are you going to do, bitch?
Butt in again?

292
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:39,797
My sister is a cop.
You'll all go to jail--

293
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:41,965
Get up.

294
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,810
Hit me as much as you want. I won't move.

295
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:55,521
But let Min go.

296
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:59,483
You think you're still Gaetal,
you bastard?

297
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:01,485
No!

298
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,279
Where are you going?

299
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:06,573
What are you doing?

300
00:23:08,784 --> 00:23:09,618
Please stop.

301
00:23:11,078 --> 00:23:12,996
He's completely lost it.

302
00:23:21,505 --> 00:23:24,383
{\an8}GWANAK-GU, SEOUL
GA 2000

303
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:26,802
ONE MINUTE
45 METERS AWAY

304
00:23:28,303 --> 00:23:30,055
Hey, is a gun necessary?

305
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:31,515
Those kids are Min's age.

306
00:23:31,598 --> 00:23:35,018
They're not here just for the reward.
They're no ordinary kids.

307
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:36,270
Darn it.

308
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,455
Hey! What are you doing?

309
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:57,166
Min. Ji-hoon.

310
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,877
- Hyun!
- Hyun.

311
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,254
Min!

312
00:24:04,923 --> 00:24:06,300
Die, you bastard!

313
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:22,983
No!

314
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:32,701
Ji-hoon!

315
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:34,953
Run!

316
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:36,997
Ji-hoon!

317
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:41,793
Min, are you okay?

318
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:46,131
Hold on.

319
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:47,883
Ji-hoon.

320
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:51,178
Hyun, I was going to turn myself in.

321
00:24:51,428 --> 00:24:52,638
I know.

322
00:24:59,186 --> 00:25:02,648
Someone's been assaulted
1 km south of Mirim Station.

323
00:25:02,731 --> 00:25:05,734
The victim's been hit in the head
and he's bleeding a lot.

324
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:08,028
Please come quickly. Now!

325
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:09,780
Sir!

326
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,495
Come back.

327
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:21,208
It's not fair
if you die like this. Come back!

328
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:26,505
Here.

329
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:38,392
Ji-hoon.

330
00:25:38,976 --> 00:25:42,062
The ambulance is coming.
Everything will be okay.

331
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:43,313
Ji-hoon!

332
00:25:45,816 --> 00:25:48,610
Do you think my father is all right?

333
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:51,697
Yes. Don't talk.

334
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:54,992
That's a relief.

335
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:57,035
I'm so relieved.

336
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:19,349
Seok-joo.

337
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:35,949
Ji-hoon.

338
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:41,788
Ji-hoon?

339
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:46,626
Ji-hoon.

340
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,337
Ji-hoon!

341
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,672
You're just messing with us, right?

342
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:53,925
Kim Ji-hoon!

343
00:26:54,885 --> 00:26:56,887
No!

344
00:26:57,637 --> 00:27:00,182
Hyun, please do something!

345
00:27:02,726 --> 00:27:04,061
No!

346
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:16,031
Damn it!

347
00:27:19,368 --> 00:27:22,162
Kim Mu-chan, you bastard!

348
00:27:35,675 --> 00:27:36,718
Sir.

349
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:38,387
A moment, please.

350
00:27:53,276 --> 00:27:56,613
Park escaped in a car,
so we're trying to track him.

351
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,407
And...

352
00:28:01,118 --> 00:28:01,952
Kim Ji-hoon...

353
00:28:04,246 --> 00:28:05,497
is dead.

354
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:12,212
Ji-hoon?

355
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:15,173
Mu-chan.

356
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:18,051
Where's Ji-hoon?

357
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:23,849
- Where's my Ji-hoon?
- It's all your fault.

358
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,559
He worried about you until the end.

359
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:29,938
He put himself out there to save you,
knowing he'd be in danger!

360
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:32,232
You said he's your son.

361
00:28:32,315 --> 00:28:35,777
What did you even gain
from dragging that poor boy into this?

362
00:28:37,654 --> 00:28:39,906
What happened to my son?

363
00:28:41,032 --> 00:28:44,494
Mu-chan, what happened to Ji-hoon?

364
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,793
A bounty was put on him,

365
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:56,381
and it led to an incident.

366
00:28:58,717 --> 00:28:59,718
Is he...

367
00:29:01,136 --> 00:29:02,429
Is he hurt badly?

368
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:04,681
Is Ji-hoon...

369
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:07,058
Is Ji-hoon hurt badly?

370
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:09,019
My son, Ji-hoon...

371
00:29:09,936 --> 00:29:10,937
Mu-chan.

372
00:29:11,938 --> 00:29:14,024
No, right?

373
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:17,944
Mu-chan. I should've died, not him!

374
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,780
Mu-chan, why did he...

375
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,803
Ji-hoon...

376
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:10,163
Can I say goodbye one last time?

377
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:15,126
That's where I let Na-rae go.

378
00:30:41,903 --> 00:30:42,904
Min...

379
00:30:48,702 --> 00:30:49,536
How's Min?

380
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:54,958
She hasn't said
or done anything for hours.

381
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:57,877
I've never seen her like this. I'm scared.

382
00:30:58,753 --> 00:31:02,716
By the way, we caught the perpetrators.
They're bullies at Min's school.

383
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,677
They wanted the reward.
They also supported Gaetal.

384
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:08,221
Keep an eye on Min.

385
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:09,848
And inform the superintendent.

386
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,852
- I'm heading there now.
- Okay. Stay safe.

387
00:31:47,177 --> 00:31:49,512
If I had just accepted Na-rae's death,

388
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:52,474
I wouldn't have lost Ji-hoon too.

389
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:56,686
I've made everyone miserable.

390
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,609
We should've caught Lee back then.

391
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:05,904
I knew my method was wrong,

392
00:32:05,987 --> 00:32:08,323
but I was so desperate to catch him.

393
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,576
You went down the wrong path,

394
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,162
because I fabricated the evidence.

395
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:20,293
I'm sorry.

396
00:32:22,295 --> 00:32:24,130
I pretended like I wasn't,

397
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:27,008
but I was always sorry.

398
00:32:28,718 --> 00:32:30,053
I know.

399
00:32:34,057 --> 00:32:36,726
There were times
when I resented you the most,

400
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:40,689
but I actually hated
our society and country.

401
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:44,651
I just wanted to show people

402
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:48,780
how strict and proper punishment
could be so comforting to the victims.

403
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:24,107
There is something

404
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:26,985
I want you to keep for me.

405
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:29,320
Professor!

406
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:31,740
Professor Kwon!

407
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:34,159
Don't move, Kim Mu-chan.

408
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:40,874
Let's not shed more blood.

409
00:33:40,957 --> 00:33:42,792
If you let me and him go,

410
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,128
no one will get hurt.

411
00:33:46,379 --> 00:33:47,464
He took my gun.

412
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:49,632
I already shot one bullet.

413
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:53,428
Did you hear me?

414
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:56,806
I said let's not shed any more blood.

415
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:59,517
Professor, come over here.

416
00:34:00,935 --> 00:34:04,731
There won't be any hostage exchange.
Drop the gun or you'll die!

417
00:34:08,777 --> 00:34:12,113
Everything's ruined anyway.
Let's all die here then.

418
00:34:12,197 --> 00:34:14,199
You think I'm joking?

419
00:34:14,783 --> 00:34:16,242
Drop the gun, Kim Mu-chan.

420
00:34:16,326 --> 00:34:17,911
I said drop the gun, bastard!

421
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:20,288
Drop it!

422
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:26,377
Move. Get away from him.

423
00:34:35,678 --> 00:34:38,014
Let's not risk any lives here.

424
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:40,099
He's not here to save me.

425
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:44,896
Right?

426
00:34:51,778 --> 00:34:54,155
Why did you break your promise?

427
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,574
You had to sacrifice yourself at the end.

428
00:34:56,658 --> 00:34:59,577
We agreed your blood
would change the world.

429
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:00,495
So why?

430
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:04,207
- Why spare your life?
- I won't make excuses.

431
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,169
I'll help you.

432
00:35:08,837 --> 00:35:10,380
I'll help you become a martyr.

433
00:35:10,964 --> 00:35:12,757
- So come here.
- Don't go.

434
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:14,884
You're right.

435
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:17,053
Stop!

436
00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:19,556
My only successor...

437
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:24,519
is you, Chul-min.

438
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:33,528
Now, use this to make
the world you dream of.

439
00:36:34,213 --> 00:36:35,048
Sir!

440
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:36,925
Hyun, what happened?

441
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:03,409
Spread out!

442
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:09,290
- Check that side too.
- Have you seen this person?

443
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:12,460
Have you seen him?

444
00:37:12,543 --> 00:37:13,461
- No.
- No.

445
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:33,314
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

446
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:34,399
<i>The Killing Vote case,</i>

447
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,485
which had shaken the nation
for the past six months,

448
00:37:37,568 --> 00:37:40,947
has been closed due to the deaths
of the main suspects.

449
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,742
The developer
of the Killing Vote program, Kim Ji-hoon,

450
00:37:44,826 --> 00:37:49,664
was killed by members
of a criminal organization

451
00:37:49,747 --> 00:37:51,582
hired by Kwon, the mastermind,

452
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:56,170
as revealed by his last stream,
CCTV footage, and video clips.

453
00:37:56,921 --> 00:38:01,175
The motive was to stop Kim Ji-hoon
from surrendering and to conceal evidence.

454
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:05,263
In addition to the main suspect,
Jung and Park were also killed.

455
00:38:05,346 --> 00:38:07,223
And Yang is under investigation.

456
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:10,393
We're still investigating
those who aided and abetted

457
00:38:10,476 --> 00:38:11,686
with their votes.

458
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:15,106
We acknowledge that this case
is in the spotlight,

459
00:38:15,189 --> 00:38:18,776
and we'll do our best
to investigate the suspects. Thank you.

460
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,278
You're not taking questions?

461
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:22,864
- Sir!
- Excuse me, sir!

462
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:24,741
Please answer our questions!

463
00:38:25,742 --> 00:38:27,035
What in the world?

464
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:33,958
You're not covering this?

465
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:35,835
The case was wrapped perfectly.

466
00:38:35,918 --> 00:38:39,547
What he said is so far from the truth
that it's not worth covering.

467
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:41,591
I'm killing it.

468
00:38:41,674 --> 00:38:43,926
Says the one who blew this up the most.

469
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:48,389
What deal did you make with Min?
Why lie about the abduction?

470
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:50,308
What was the bribe?

471
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:55,938
Be careful with the internet.

472
00:38:56,022 --> 00:38:57,565
Be it emails or comments.

473
00:38:57,648 --> 00:39:02,195
Think carefully before you post
an article, because I'll dig it all up.

474
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:04,572
Bringing down the corrupt media

475
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:07,366
- will be my mission.
- Lieutenant Joo,

476
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,869
I've never chased money or power.

477
00:39:09,952 --> 00:39:11,579
Believe it or not,

478
00:39:11,662 --> 00:39:14,290
I became a reporter
to help create a better world.

479
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,168
But without money or power,

480
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:20,546
no one will listen
to your calls for justice.

481
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,132
A lesser evil will create that world.

482
00:39:23,966 --> 00:39:26,511
One day, you'll grow up and realize that.

483
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,723
I doubt that will ever happen.

484
00:39:31,265 --> 00:39:33,434
I'll always be an immature cop

485
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:37,855
who listens and stands up for the victims.

486
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:39,357
Change the world

487
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:41,692
all you want.

488
00:39:46,614 --> 00:39:49,117
As if you could
actually make a difference.

489
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:33,661
Jump here.

490
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:35,163
Jump, jump.

491
00:40:37,123 --> 00:40:38,374
Are you okay?

492
00:41:22,543 --> 00:41:24,837
- Why are the cops here?
- I'll find out.

493
00:41:32,511 --> 00:41:33,638
You can't go in.

494
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:35,056
- Move.
- Move.

495
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:42,813
Move!

496
00:41:42,897 --> 00:41:43,940
I said move!

497
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:45,775
What do you think you're doing?

498
00:41:50,446 --> 00:41:52,156
- Keep going.
- Yes, sir.

499
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:56,869
My subordinate forgot
to give you a notice.

500
00:41:57,912 --> 00:41:58,913
Sang-jae.

501
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:00,206
I'm sorry, ma'am.

502
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:03,876
The warrant is
in your living room. Go check it.

503
00:42:06,128 --> 00:42:08,422
- Let's move. It's getting late.
- Yes, sir.

504
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:12,176
Tell me why you're destroying
my house without permission.

505
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,720
You filed a lawsuit against the police.

506
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:17,306
We're trying to gather all we can

507
00:42:18,808 --> 00:42:20,351
to defend ourselves.

508
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:21,852
If that's the reason...

509
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,648
I'll drop the charges.

510
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:28,025
It'll cost more to fix the house.

511
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:31,988
{\an8}The commissioner's visiting a temple.
I doubt you'll reach him.

512
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:36,492
And no lawyer in this country
will come to help.

513
00:42:37,451 --> 00:42:38,536
Your husband

514
00:42:39,203 --> 00:42:40,788
just dumped you.

515
00:42:46,794 --> 00:42:48,379
CHAIRMAN LEE FILES FOR DIVORCE

516
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:52,842
Last time I was here...

517
00:42:55,261 --> 00:42:56,804
I missed something.

518
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,628
There's another column inside.

519
00:43:29,712 --> 00:43:30,963
Break it down now!

520
00:43:54,862 --> 00:43:56,530
Get the reagent and the lights.

521
00:44:50,668 --> 00:44:52,795
Looks like we just got our trump card.

522
00:44:54,046 --> 00:44:57,091
Also, Detective Choi is conscious again.

523
00:44:57,174 --> 00:45:03,764
He'll testify that you bribed him to forge
and destroy evidence and aid in murder.

524
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:08,602
I think that's enough
to arrest you without a warrant.

525
00:45:12,273 --> 00:45:13,274
Fine.

526
00:45:14,442 --> 00:45:15,526
Now,

527
00:45:16,402 --> 00:45:17,653
I've become tired of this.

528
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,324
Save the handcuffs.

529
00:46:03,032 --> 00:46:04,825
That was the passcode for the vote.

530
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:07,203
You sure that was okay?

531
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:09,705
It was the only thing Ji-hoon left us.

532
00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:13,667
It's also why he died.

533
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:17,755
I'm sure he would've wanted me to do it.

534
00:46:21,592 --> 00:46:23,219
At the press conference,

535
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:26,472
Min Ji-young and Lee Min-soo
weren't even mentioned.

536
00:46:26,555 --> 00:46:27,932
And Kwon Seok-joo...

537
00:46:29,808 --> 00:46:32,311
became a murderer
who killed his adopted son.

538
00:46:37,024 --> 00:46:38,234
You saw this coming.

539
00:46:42,655 --> 00:46:47,034
It had to be done so we could arrest
Min Ji-young without a warrant.

540
00:46:47,952 --> 00:46:51,205
Showing our weakness
didn't help with the investigation.

541
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:55,918
I had to compromise with the higher-ups
to bring my team to the RIU.

542
00:46:58,003 --> 00:46:59,129
Once again,

543
00:47:00,172 --> 00:47:02,049
you screwed Kwon Seok-joo over.

544
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:05,970
Like when you fabricated the evidence.

545
00:47:09,431 --> 00:47:11,392
I'm trying to give him what he wanted.

546
00:47:12,268 --> 00:47:14,395
We got the evidence to arrest Min.

547
00:47:14,478 --> 00:47:17,356
With Jin-soo's testimony,
that's conspiracy for sure.

548
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:21,527
You're wrong.

549
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:25,114
Kwon Seok-joo didn't just want
to bring Min Ji-young down.

550
00:47:28,742 --> 00:47:30,744
You still don't get it.

551
00:47:33,706 --> 00:47:37,751
I appreciate your offer to join the RIU,

552
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:39,545
but I'll go back to HQ.

553
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:43,882
Thank you for everything.

554
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:54,184
Didn't you want
to work cases like a real cop?

555
00:48:21,587 --> 00:48:25,466
ONE YEAR LATER

556
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,101
How could you let
your work pile up like this?

557
00:48:37,936 --> 00:48:40,064
How many times
have I told you? Am I wrong?

558
00:48:40,147 --> 00:48:41,899
Should I go on? Because I can.

559
00:48:41,982 --> 00:48:44,652
- Will you please do your job?
- Come on.

560
00:48:44,735 --> 00:48:46,528
You said you wanted to work.

561
00:48:46,612 --> 00:48:51,033
One year ago, you said you weren't sure
if you were a cop or a contractor.

562
00:48:51,116 --> 00:48:54,828
Now, look at you!
You're not an outsider anymore.

563
00:48:54,912 --> 00:48:58,791
You're the ace of our team.
Look at you shine.

564
00:49:00,209 --> 00:49:01,710
People will get the wrong idea.

565
00:49:01,794 --> 00:49:05,589
They'll think I'm the captain now,
because I work here all the time.

566
00:49:05,673 --> 00:49:10,135
Come on, Jjoo.
What can we do? You're just too good.

567
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:15,224
So many people come to me these days
asking me to set them up with you.

568
00:49:15,307 --> 00:49:19,353
There will be information sharing events
in Japan and Singapore,

569
00:49:19,436 --> 00:49:23,107
and the commissioner wants to send you--

570
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,609
Gosh, is there
a loud bird here? I can't work.

571
00:49:26,193 --> 00:49:28,278
Somebody is distracting me.

572
00:49:28,362 --> 00:49:32,366
<i>You're a bird, I'm a bird</i>

573
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:35,202
<i>Distracting, distracting</i>

574
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:39,123
Rear entrances
intentionally made for computers

575
00:49:39,206 --> 00:49:40,457
are called backdoors.

576
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:43,043
Since they're hard to detect,

577
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:46,213
we often don't realize
how common they are.

578
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:50,884
But they can be found in dashcams
and home security cameras,

579
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:53,595
which seem trivial
but are found everywhere.

580
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,808
Gaetal used this method
to transmit his videos to everyone.

581
00:49:57,891 --> 00:49:59,393
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

582
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:01,478
Since you mentioned Gaetal,

583
00:50:01,562 --> 00:50:05,858
both hidden apps and backdoors
sound illegal to me.

584
00:50:05,941 --> 00:50:08,444
So was Gaetal's justice in the right?

585
00:50:10,988 --> 00:50:14,575
That case is closed,
so I have nothing to say about it.

586
00:50:26,962 --> 00:50:29,089
Look who I found. Kim Jo-dan.

587
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:33,635
{\an8}Goodness, my poor eyes.
What a huge transformation.

588
00:50:37,347 --> 00:50:38,807
I grew up without a father,

589
00:50:38,891 --> 00:50:44,271
so Lieutenant Choi is like a dad,
an uncle, and a brother to me.

590
00:50:44,354 --> 00:50:47,775
I heard my innocent
and hard-working Yoon-ji was seeing you,

591
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:49,860
so I haven't been able to sleep.

592
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:54,865
You almost took the big sleep,
so maybe you can cut back on it--

593
00:50:54,948 --> 00:50:55,783
Hey, you brat.

594
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,286
I'm going to give you a test.

595
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:03,916
- Do you think it's enough?
- Thank you.

596
00:51:12,049 --> 00:51:13,300
I love the way you eat.

597
00:51:14,718 --> 00:51:16,178
You added the spicy sauce.

598
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:19,765
- Extra spicy sauce?
- Yes.

599
00:51:19,848 --> 00:51:23,018
I hear you can't handle spice.
Yoon-ji loves it.

600
00:51:23,101 --> 00:51:26,146
If you really love her,
you can adapt to her tastes. Go on.

601
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,482
Sure.

602
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:30,150
Can we order extra cheese?

603
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:32,736
- Break up.
- No, I can do this.

604
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,862
I can eat it.

605
00:51:34,571 --> 00:51:36,365
- Jjoo is here!
- Hello, Lieutenant.

606
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:41,453
I'll eat the spicy food for him.
Please give them your blessing.

607
00:51:42,204 --> 00:51:43,330
- Give it.
- Okay.

608
00:51:46,792 --> 00:51:50,379
This is amazing.
It's so good, I could eat it every day.

609
00:51:50,462 --> 00:51:51,463
That's cheating.

610
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:55,843
If you're like a father to Yoon-ji,
he's like my family.

611
00:51:55,926 --> 00:52:00,430
I played a significant role
in turning him into a decent person.

612
00:52:00,514 --> 00:52:02,224
- Mom.
- I'm not your mom.

613
00:52:02,307 --> 00:52:03,559
No?

614
00:52:03,642 --> 00:52:06,436
And we can order half spicy and half mild.

615
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:08,814
You like him that much?

616
00:52:12,276 --> 00:52:13,402
He passed.

617
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:16,613
I'll hug her for a moment.

618
00:52:18,115 --> 00:52:19,241
Thank you!

619
00:52:22,327 --> 00:52:23,537
What's this?

620
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:31,253
SALE AT JAESANG MART

621
00:52:33,547 --> 00:52:34,548
They're having a sale.

622
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:36,049
- Right.
- They are.

623
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:38,051
Mine's spam too.

624
00:52:38,135 --> 00:52:39,219
Right.

625
00:52:41,471 --> 00:52:44,850
I had no idea dating a human
would be so hard.

626
00:52:45,767 --> 00:52:49,855
But I passed thanks to you.
I love you, my colleague.

627
00:52:49,938 --> 00:52:50,772
Right.

628
00:52:53,442 --> 00:52:54,651
What is it?

629
00:52:54,735 --> 00:52:56,695
- Explain this.
- What on earth?

630
00:52:56,778 --> 00:52:59,615
If I'd met you then,
I wouldn't be your friend now.

631
00:52:59,698 --> 00:53:01,158
I must've been pretty sick.

632
00:53:01,241 --> 00:53:04,119
I asked them several times to remove that.

633
00:53:04,202 --> 00:53:05,537
I'll send it to Yoon-ji.

634
00:53:05,621 --> 00:53:10,083
What's wrong with you? That's violating
my privacy and likeness rights.

635
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:12,753
You never won first place though.

636
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:15,881
{\an8}- Who won first place?
- I don't know. I never saw them.

637
00:53:16,632 --> 00:53:19,718
Mystery X. A hacker loved by hackers.

638
00:53:20,302 --> 00:53:23,388
The skilled ones leave
their signature file when they hack.

639
00:53:23,472 --> 00:53:26,516
I haven't seen them in a while though.

640
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,269
I do remember their file name.

641
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:35,275
It started with L-R-A-E...

642
00:53:35,817 --> 00:53:37,653
Why is this text file so big?

643
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:40,572
- Na-rae?
- What?

644
00:53:41,782 --> 00:53:42,616
What?

645
00:53:45,994 --> 00:53:48,580
Why did they make it unreadable?

646
00:53:48,664 --> 00:53:50,040
I know, right?

647
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:21,905
<i>Happy birthday, Ji-hoon.</i>

648
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,574
{\an8}<i>I tried serving justice again</i>
<i>and Hyun got so mad.</i>

649
00:54:24,658 --> 00:54:26,118
{\an8}<i>I got into college!</i>

650
00:54:26,201 --> 00:54:28,787
<i>I saw someone who looked like you.</i>

651
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:29,955
<i>I turned 20 today.</i>

652
00:54:30,706 --> 00:54:33,166
<i>We promised to have</i>
<i>our first drink together.</i>

653
00:54:34,543 --> 00:54:36,461
{\an8}KIM JI-HOON: HI, MIN

654
00:54:36,545 --> 00:54:38,088
{\an8}KIM JI-HOON

655
00:54:41,591 --> 00:54:42,801
<i>Hi, Min.</i>

656
00:54:42,884 --> 00:54:44,803
Where did he learn to do this?

657
00:54:44,886 --> 00:54:47,514
<i>I bet you said,</i>
"Where did he learn to do this?"

658
00:54:47,597 --> 00:54:48,765
<i>I saw that coming.</i>

659
00:54:49,474 --> 00:54:52,519
<i>Happy 20th birthday, Min.</i>

660
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:59,443
<i>Seeing you kept making me smile,</i>
<i>so I didn't like it, but I was happy.</i>

661
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:03,697
<i>If I'm next to you right now,</i>

662
00:55:04,281 --> 00:55:06,950
<i>could you smile and tell me</i>
<i>you got my message?</i>

663
00:55:10,787 --> 00:55:13,165
<i>I probably won't be able to</i>
<i>keep my promise</i>

664
00:55:13,248 --> 00:55:15,042
<i>- for the first drink.</i>
- Cheers!

665
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:16,793
<i>I've done some bad things in life.</i>

666
00:55:19,004 --> 00:55:21,423
<i>But Min, with you...</i>

667
00:55:22,007 --> 00:55:23,216
<i>I want to be honest.</i>

668
00:55:24,426 --> 00:55:25,552
<i>I'm actually</i>

669
00:55:26,178 --> 00:55:27,429
<i>very scared.</i>

670
00:55:28,764 --> 00:55:33,602
<i>Rather than change the world,</i>
<i>I'd just wanted to say I loved my sister.</i>

671
00:55:34,394 --> 00:55:36,229
<i>I don't know how it came to this.</i>

672
00:55:39,357 --> 00:55:42,194
<i>If there ever was</i>
<i>a bright moment in my 19 years,</i>

673
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:44,654
<i>it was because I was with you.</i>

674
00:55:46,156 --> 00:55:47,157
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

675
00:55:48,158 --> 00:55:49,201
<i>and thank you.</i>

676
00:55:49,951 --> 00:55:53,330
<i>P.S. Don't date a guy</i>
<i>who leaves you on read.</i>

677
00:56:19,773 --> 00:56:25,403
JI-HOON

678
00:56:25,487 --> 00:56:27,489
GAETAL SUSPECT MISSING FOR SIXTH DAY

679
00:56:30,325 --> 00:56:32,452
SEARCH AREA EXPANDED

680
00:56:32,536 --> 00:56:33,453
TETRAPODS OF DEATH

681
00:56:33,537 --> 00:56:34,830
BODY OF MAN IN 30S FOUND

682
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:53,515
It was you.

683
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:21,042
Are you sure you want to quit like this?

684
00:57:21,543 --> 00:57:23,753
I'm too ashamed to continue as a cop.

685
00:57:23,837 --> 00:57:26,214
I should be thankful
I didn't lose my pension

686
00:57:26,298 --> 00:57:28,300
since you let my betrayal slide.

687
00:57:31,178 --> 00:57:33,180
You saved my life. We're even now.

688
00:57:37,726 --> 00:57:39,436
Forget about Min Ji-young.

689
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:42,189
She got away with it
even after I testified.

690
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:46,067
I heard the secretary
who took the fall for her died in jail.

691
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:51,406
Stop wasting your life on that
and go after someone worse.

692
00:57:51,489 --> 00:57:52,616
Someone big.

693
00:57:53,408 --> 00:57:57,787
Why must I fight against my own people
to catch the big ones?

694
00:57:58,705 --> 00:58:01,750
The closer I get to the core,
the more I ask myself,

695
00:58:02,709 --> 00:58:03,710
"Is this right?"

696
00:58:03,793 --> 00:58:05,545
Organizations are like that.

697
00:58:06,546 --> 00:58:08,089
This may sound funny,

698
00:58:08,173 --> 00:58:10,508
but I understand Kwon Seok-joo better now.

699
00:58:11,676 --> 00:58:14,512
Once you realize
your beliefs can fall apart,

700
00:58:14,596 --> 00:58:16,056
you can't live the same life.

701
00:58:17,974 --> 00:58:19,559
But I believe in you.

702
00:58:19,643 --> 00:58:22,354
You can change things.
Gradually, step by step.

703
00:58:40,997 --> 00:58:43,500
You should eat a lot to grow taller.

704
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,126
Can you eat spicy food?

705
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:46,920
Good.

706
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:49,422
Sir, it's okay to eat slowly.

707
00:58:49,506 --> 00:58:51,508
With every bite, what was it?

708
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:52,592
"Let's be healthy."

709
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:54,094
Let's be healthy.

710
00:58:54,177 --> 00:58:56,054
The same goes for you.

711
00:58:56,137 --> 00:58:57,472
What will you do for us?

712
00:58:57,555 --> 00:59:03,228
Well, to send you doctors
immediately when you're ill,

713
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:05,063
I'll make the government pay up.

714
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:06,898
That sounds great!

715
00:59:06,982 --> 00:59:08,733
You should become the president.

716
00:59:08,817 --> 00:59:10,735
Goodness, sir.

717
00:59:10,819 --> 00:59:14,739
I have a fear of heights,
so I can't climb that high!

718
00:59:16,032 --> 00:59:17,367
Thank you.

719
00:59:28,003 --> 00:59:29,004
Thank you.

720
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:31,214
Whenever I volunteer, you're always there.

721
00:59:32,257 --> 00:59:35,510
It's been almost nine years,
but you've changed so much

722
00:59:35,593 --> 00:59:37,095
I didn't recognize you at first.

723
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:40,307
Have we met before?

724
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,017
I was a lawyer before.

725
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,562
I often saw you at court
during your son's trial.

726
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:48,273
I'm sure you didn't know me, but--

727
00:59:48,356 --> 00:59:50,066
Wait.

728
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:52,444
I don't want to talk about him.

729
00:59:52,527 --> 00:59:55,238
I have only one regret
regarding that incident.

730
00:59:55,822 --> 01:00:00,827
As his mother, I should've made him
turn himself in sooner, but I hesitated.

731
01:00:04,956 --> 01:00:06,374
I'm sorry. I wanted to ask

732
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:09,002
why you supported rights
for the culprit's family.

733
01:00:11,087 --> 01:00:15,258
I'm sharing my sadness
with those in the same situation.

734
01:00:15,342 --> 01:00:16,593
That's all.

735
01:00:18,762 --> 01:00:20,513
"Devils who were deemed innocent."

736
01:00:21,848 --> 01:00:25,268
I was Professor Kwon's public defender
nine years ago.

737
01:00:31,066 --> 01:00:32,692
All I wanted to say was

738
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:34,986
that you should be considerate

739
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:40,158
to the victims and their families
while you share their sadness.

740
01:00:41,076 --> 01:00:42,077
That's all.

741
01:00:42,744 --> 01:00:46,539
If you forgot why he had to
wear that mask...

742
01:00:49,334 --> 01:00:50,377
it would be a shame.

743
01:02:16,713 --> 01:02:18,089
{\an8}Interesting.

744
01:02:21,926 --> 01:02:23,136
We need a new hire.

745
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,394
So far, I've only made
a code to start the program.

746
01:02:34,105 --> 01:02:36,357
Most hackers failed to do this.

747
01:02:37,108 --> 01:02:38,276
You're different.

748
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:39,736
I like you.

749
01:02:40,445 --> 01:02:41,946
We can move to the next step.

750
01:02:43,072 --> 01:02:46,659
Can you find a way to connect
with every citizen in this country?

751
01:02:53,124 --> 01:02:55,168
You must be mistaken.

752
01:02:56,669 --> 01:02:59,088
I'm the one who decides
the rules of the game.

753
01:03:00,507 --> 01:03:04,302
If it's boring and pointless,
I won't even start it.

754
01:03:08,014 --> 01:03:12,185
I heard even those who conquer
the world don't get much support.

755
01:03:12,268 --> 01:03:17,899
I think if we help each other a bit,
we could take over the country.

756
01:03:19,776 --> 01:03:20,944
Does that sound boring?

757
01:03:23,112 --> 01:03:25,823
Why don't we test our skills
before we team up?

758
01:03:27,075 --> 01:03:29,035
- Fine, then.
- And who's the target?

759
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:32,789
First, I want my position back.

760
01:03:33,831 --> 01:03:34,832
Go to the next screen.

761
01:03:39,003 --> 01:03:41,839
{\an8}ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JI-SEOK

762
01:03:46,594 --> 01:03:51,015
What do you think is the worst thing
that can happen to a man with a daughter?

763
01:03:55,186 --> 01:03:58,523
Whatever it is, it won't be boring.

764
01:04:09,242 --> 01:04:10,285
LIGHTING PATTERN

765
01:04:13,288 --> 01:04:15,665
{\an8}DOWNLOADING PURCHASED APP
LIGHTING PATTERN

766
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:20,837
{\an8}I love this. I'm going with this one.

767
01:04:24,632 --> 01:04:27,176
Awesome. I like this.

768
01:04:28,386 --> 01:04:29,220
What?

769
01:04:30,888 --> 01:04:32,557
That little...

770
01:04:33,474 --> 01:04:34,559
Min.

771
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:40,064
Who said you can change the lights?
What about my preferences?

772
01:04:40,148 --> 01:04:44,110
What? We have the same tastes.
I never pick bad patterns.

773
01:04:45,278 --> 01:04:47,113
Anyway, you can drive after 100 days.

774
01:04:47,196 --> 01:04:50,241
This car is brand-new,
and you're inexperienced.

775
01:04:50,325 --> 01:04:53,328
You said we could share.
You can't go back on your word.

776
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:55,330
There's somewhere I need to be.

777
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:57,624
- Come on out.
- No.

778
01:04:57,707 --> 01:04:59,042
- Come on.
- I was here first.

779
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:01,210
Get out. It's raining.

780
01:05:03,379 --> 01:05:06,174
But I told my friend I'd come in this car.

781
01:05:06,257 --> 01:05:10,637
Students should ride bigger vehicles.
I see many buses and trains there. Bye.

782
01:05:11,346 --> 01:05:13,222
Hey!

783
01:05:13,306 --> 01:05:14,307
Hyun!

784
01:05:16,351 --> 01:05:17,810
Give me money!

785
01:05:21,606 --> 01:05:22,649
Darn it.

786
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:26,736
3 HA 1 0887

787
01:05:28,696 --> 01:05:29,781
How have you been?

788
01:05:29,864 --> 01:05:34,786
I couldn't die, so I'm alive.
I'm just surviving.

789
01:05:37,121 --> 01:05:40,249
Joking around like this
helps me get through each day

790
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:42,877
and not think too much about Ji-hoon.

791
01:05:43,711 --> 01:05:45,088
Do you really believe

792
01:05:46,214 --> 01:05:48,174
that Kwon Seok-joo is dead?

793
01:05:48,758 --> 01:05:51,761
He hasn't shown signs of life,
but his body wasn't found.

794
01:05:51,844 --> 01:05:54,305
So sometimes, I think

795
01:05:55,807 --> 01:05:57,225
he may still be alive.

796
01:05:57,308 --> 01:06:00,353
As long as there are loopholes in our law,

797
01:06:00,436 --> 01:06:03,564
there will always be someone
to replace Professor Kwon.

798
01:06:04,941 --> 01:06:06,192
In that case,

799
01:06:06,275 --> 01:06:09,862
we can say he's still alive.

800
01:06:13,908 --> 01:06:15,576
I really owe you big time.

801
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:19,622
It's been a while since I've been out,
so I never heard of bail bonds.

802
01:06:19,706 --> 01:06:22,709
You got yourself into trouble
as soon as you got out.

803
01:06:22,792 --> 01:06:25,169
Posting bail won't reduce the sentence.

804
01:06:25,253 --> 01:06:30,258
You have to make the judge believe
that you're deeply regretful.

805
01:06:30,341 --> 01:06:32,009
So don't feel reassured yet.

806
01:06:32,093 --> 01:06:34,846
I'll take care of all the paperwork.

807
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:38,641
You just stay away from the victim
and keep writing letters.

808
01:06:39,225 --> 01:06:41,978
If you listen to me,
I'll get you probation.

809
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:56,159
I'll read the Bible and pray every day.

810
01:06:56,242 --> 01:06:57,994
You're doing well enough.

811
01:07:00,329 --> 01:07:02,665
- You traveled a long way, right?
- Yes.

812
01:07:06,335 --> 01:07:07,754
{\an8}KIM MU-CHAN

813
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:52,590
It's been a while.

814
01:07:53,466 --> 01:07:56,886
Yeah, I needed to get
some forensic analysis done.

815
01:07:59,096 --> 01:08:01,599
Jo-dan told me you were doing well.

816
01:08:01,682 --> 01:08:03,893
I'm the ace of our team now.

817
01:08:04,477 --> 01:08:08,189
In addition to working
cases like a real cop,

818
01:08:08,272 --> 01:08:12,109
I do all kinds of chores,
like lecturing and entertaining guests.

819
01:08:13,861 --> 01:08:15,112
And still a whistleblower.

820
01:08:15,196 --> 01:08:16,572
I heard you cracked the case

821
01:08:16,656 --> 01:08:20,451
that the narcotics team
had been working on for a year.

822
01:08:20,535 --> 01:08:22,161
You even caught all the dealers.

823
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:23,955
Right.

824
01:08:24,664 --> 01:08:26,082
So what's the problem?

825
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:30,294
You really haven't changed at all.

826
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,841
I wanted to ask you something.

827
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:40,763
Kwon said he filed a petition
for Ji-hoon, but I couldn't find anything.

828
01:08:40,847 --> 01:08:42,306
You know anything about it?

829
01:08:43,057 --> 01:08:45,685
I don't know. I've never heard about it.

830
01:08:47,144 --> 01:08:48,437
I see.

831
01:08:48,521 --> 01:08:52,191
Please let me know
if you hear anything about this.

832
01:08:53,442 --> 01:08:54,318
Okay.

833
01:08:56,445 --> 01:08:57,446
I'll get going.

834
01:09:01,075 --> 01:09:02,159
Sir.

835
01:09:05,371 --> 01:09:06,539
Do you think

836
01:09:07,582 --> 01:09:09,208
Kwon Seok-joo is still alive?

837
01:09:13,629 --> 01:09:14,797
No.

838
01:09:15,798 --> 01:09:16,799
I hope not.

839
01:09:19,218 --> 01:09:20,803
He could use some rest now.

840
01:09:27,435 --> 01:09:32,565
NATIONAL OFFICE OF INVESTIGATION

841
01:09:48,205 --> 01:09:50,416
DEAR LIEUTENANT JOO HYUN

842
01:09:50,499 --> 01:09:51,500
<i>In a kindergarten,</i>

843
01:09:52,919 --> 01:09:56,130
<i>students from one class</i>
<i>beat another child.</i>

844
01:09:56,964 --> 01:09:59,175
{\an8}<i>The child cried out loud,</i>

845
01:09:59,258 --> 01:10:03,387
{\an8}<i>but the teacher didn't tell</i>
<i>the principal about it.</i>

846
01:10:03,471 --> 01:10:06,807
<i>The principal says</i>
<i>their kindergarten is always peaceful.</i>

847
01:10:08,142 --> 01:10:12,813
{\an8}<i>I think the principal</i>
<i>is the worst person in this kindergarten.</i>

848
01:10:12,897 --> 01:10:18,277
<i>I was once the principal,</i>
<i>and now, I'm the beaten child.</i>

849
01:10:19,111 --> 01:10:23,532
<i>All Ji-hoon did was report</i>
<i>that I'd been beaten.</i>

850
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:27,662
<i>Not once has he committed a crime.</i>

851
01:10:27,745 --> 01:10:30,790
<i>He's just a poor boy</i>
<i>brainwashed into believing</i>

852
01:10:30,873 --> 01:10:32,583
<i>that I'd become his family.</i>

853
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:35,044
<i>I sincerely plead for leniency.</i>

854
01:10:35,127 --> 01:10:36,170
You can't, sir.

855
01:10:40,424 --> 01:10:42,259
No...

856
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,401
You sold out
your colleagues to avoid jail.

857
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:02,405
And now you're doing crime consulting?

858
01:11:02,488 --> 01:11:05,908
If you want to talk,
do it during the day at the station.

859
01:11:20,506 --> 01:11:24,927
<i>I have committed crimes,</i>
<i>and I'd kill them again if I could.</i>

860
01:11:25,011 --> 01:11:27,304
<i>But I've never thought I was innocent.</i>

861
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:31,392
<i>I don't want my actions</i>
<i>to be seen as irrational either.</i>

862
01:11:34,395 --> 01:11:37,690
<i>Because what I've done was not revenge.</i>

863
01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:39,483
<i>It was punishment.</i>

864
01:11:43,779 --> 01:11:44,822
NEW MAIL

865
01:11:51,537 --> 01:11:53,748
UNIDENTIFIED MAN RESCUED BY FISHING SHIP

866
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:13,851
It's me.

867
01:12:14,977 --> 01:12:17,354
About that event in Japan...

868
01:12:18,022 --> 01:12:22,818
Their Police Information Division
is participating too, right?

869
01:12:26,614 --> 01:12:28,908
THERE'S AN UPDATE ABOUT THE MAN YOU...

870
01:12:28,991 --> 01:12:30,159
I'll go.

871
01:12:31,077 --> 01:12:33,079
I have a reason to go now.

872
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,065
<i>I don't know who it will be,</i>

873
01:13:01,148 --> 01:13:03,692
<i>but there will definitely be</i>
<i>another Gaetal.</i>

874
01:13:06,403 --> 01:13:10,533
<i>To bring down the hell</i>
<i>we're living in by even an inch...</i>

875
01:13:15,996 --> 01:13:19,375
<i>To catch the devils</i>
<i>who were deemed innocent.</i>

876
01:13:54,994 --> 01:14:01,292
<i>Hello, my fellow citizens.</i>
<i>Let the Killing Vote begin.</i>
