CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:07,443
{\an8}PUBLIC DEBATE ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND JUSTICE:
OPEN ACCESS TO SUSPECTS' IDENTITIES

5
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,488
This issue is not only about human rights

6
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,656
but also about safety.

7
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,993
{\an8}The sense of security
that allows you to live in your own home

8
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,954
{\an8}without the constant fear
of criminals who could harm

9
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,165
{\an8}you and your family at any moment.

10
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,626
{\an8}I'm talking about
the basic human right we deserve

11
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,837
to be protected
in the country where you live.

12
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,090
I'm not necessarily against it.

13
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:35,346
Korea is a constitutional nation
that upholds the presumption of innocence.

14
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:38,682
Concluding someone is a criminal
even before an official trial

15
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:43,187
and disclosing their personal information
under the pretext of the greater good?

16
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,689
Here's where that famous saying comes in.

17
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,733
"Whatever."

18
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,822
"Whatever. Let's disclose it anyway.
It's not like it's happening to me."

19
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,533
"They shouldn't have acted suspiciously."

20
00:01:55,616 --> 00:02:00,079
Asking for the proper treatment
and punishment a perpetrator deserves

21
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,664
is not an unreasonable demand.

22
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,708
Professor Kwon,

23
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:09,630
we all have the right to be informed
in order to protect ourselves.

24
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,049
You're familiar
with this right, aren't you?

25
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,926
I am very well aware of what it is.

26
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,511
However,

27
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,596
does knowing it change anything?

28
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:23,769
Even if I obtain information that says
that person there is most likely guilty,

29
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,021
the only things that can protect you are

30
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:29,358
prejudice, discrimination, and ostracism.

31
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,778
Even in a situation
where you might die if you do nothing,

32
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,198
you must never assault anyone first,

33
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,950
and killing them is even more forbidden.

34
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,079
Because in a constitutional nation,
pre-emptive assault

35
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,958
has absolutely no justification.

36
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,510
{\an8}EPISODE 7

37
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,470
{\an8}Even your autograph looks cool.

38
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,723
{\an8}Thank you.

39
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,227
{\an8}My son Yun-seong is such a huge fan.

40
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,231
{\an8}He's too shy to say hi
even though we're neighbors.

41
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:12,902
{\an8}He was really looking forward
to this lecture today.

42
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,995
{\an8}It's not an easy read
for middle school students.

43
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,373
AUTHOR KWON SEOK-JOO

44
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,043
{\an8}Thanks for reading my book.

45
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:35,466
{\an8}I'm also not sure
why Lady Justice is blindfolded.

46
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,677
{\an8}If it's because she's afraid of bias,

47
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,429
{\an8}I think it's cowardly.

48
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:44,266
{\an8}If you pass judgment without looking
at things clearly, it's not being fair.

49
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,559
{\an8}It's being indifferent.

50
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,773
{\an8}His dream is to work
in the legal field one day.

51
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,651
{\an8}My husband also thinks
it'd be nice to have

52
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,861
one of our three boys in the legal field.

53
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,280
And ever since I started
my career in politics,

54
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:01,492
I also think I could really use
a trustworthy legal advisor.

55
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,744
Even though I have a neighbor like you.

56
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:08,457
Relying solely on your experiences
can also lead to bias.

57
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,711
Experiences are gained
through situations and conflicts.

58
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,421
They can't be absolute truths.

59
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,715
I agree.

60
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,510
Would you like to come to my lecture?

61
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,471
For elective classes,
we accept non-credit students.

62
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,641
Is he too busy with school to attend?

63
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:27,393
Well...

64
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:31,814
Actually, he just went
through major surgery,

65
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,482
so he's being homeschooled at the moment.

66
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,485
Still, I'm sure it would be
a great experience for him.

67
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,070
Of course.

68
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,700
Then, make sure to tell me
what you think after attending my lecture.

69
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,911
Even if your opinion is
the total opposite of mine,

70
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,287
- it's okay, so--
- Dad!

71
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,414
Hey, Na-rae.

72
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,748
Excuse me. That's my daughter.

73
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,166
Hey.

74
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,466
- Why did you come alone?
- She left early, as usual.

75
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,636
She said she had
a lot of things to do today too.

76
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,389
I'd hoped the three of us
could have dinner together.

77
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,473
Oh, well.

78
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:10,769
I guess it'll be just be
the two of us on a date then.

79
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,859
AUDIT OR FASHION SHOW?
MIN HAS 3 OUTFITS IN A DAY

80
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,486
Instead of the questions
the administration answered,

81
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,238
{\an8}everyone's focused on this nonsense.

82
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,284
I need you to make a list
of some good image consultants.

83
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,454
Preferably with international
academic backgrounds, especially in DC.

84
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,875
They say negative comments
are better than no comments.

85
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,502
I recommend minimizing
any potential sources of leaks.

86
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,296
You're still
a proportional representative.

87
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,507
- Pull over.
- Yes, ma'am.

88
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,971
Get out of the car.

89
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,348
Me?

90
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,316
So adorable.

91
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,491
What a loser.

92
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,871
I want you to set up
interviews for an aide.

93
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,128
It must be hard for him
to raise a girl by himself.

94
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,716
I'm going to recruit
Professor Kwon for my campaign.

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,051
Run a background check on him.

96
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,095
Yes, ma'am.

Someone fresh out of college

101
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,480
And the drunk driver...

102
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,984
Does the court's decision
always lead to perfect justice?

103
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,570
Hey, you.

104
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,364
Anyway...

105
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,407

109
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,136
I loved today's lecture.

110
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,054
- Seriously.
- It was amazing.

111
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,098
- I loved it.
- Keep up the hard work.

112
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,311

It's staying still.

117

Fluffy.

118
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,851
Hey, Fluffy.

119
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,352
Fluffy.

120
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:04,067
Fluffy? Dad! Fluffy is missing.

121
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,622
Hi, Professor.

122
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:19,583
Hi, Yun-seong.

123
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,294
Did you take our dog, by any chance?

124
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,047
Me?

125
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,840
How could I have done that?

126
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,928
Somebody saw you leaving my house.

127
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,389
If you're done playing with it,
can we have it back?

128
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,891
Na-rae is waiting.

129
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,811
It really wasn't me.

130
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,480
You'll know if you check the CCTV footage.

131
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,151
Wait.

132
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:50,239
Did you know our CCTV system was broken?

133
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:09,967
Hey, my boy.

134
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,468
Were you waiting for me?

135
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,054
Hello, Father.

136
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,517
You're here too, Professor.

137
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,895
What's up?

138
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,563
Our dog is missing.

139
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,984
So I was asking Yun-seong about it.

140
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,403
You interrupted his studies
for something trivial as that?

141
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,198
Goodness. Why do I feel so offended?

142
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,951
I should be offended, right?

143
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,917
Have you seen the dog?

144
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,629
No, of course not.

145
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,390
You should leave now.

146
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:08,692
- Mr. Byun.
- Yes, sir?

147
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,985
Bring me a shovel.

148
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,487
Stay with him.

149
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:13,655
Honey.

150
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,616
- Now!
- Yes, sir.

151
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,993
Honey!

152
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,454
Let's get inside. Come on.

153
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,466
Let's go inside.

154
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,334
Honey!

155
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,418
Are you crazy?

156
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,880
I told you to beat people up instead
or throw money at them if you're too weak!

157
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,383
As if killing all the dogs
we got you wasn't enough,

158
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,884
now you're killing dogs of others?

159
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:16,968
You embarrass me,

160
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,303
like a low-class heathen.

161
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,930
He's sick! How could you hit him?

162
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,807
Can't you try to understand him?

163
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,266
How could you treat us like this?

164
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,396
You said we should try to befriend
that professor so he'd join your campaign.

165
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,565
What if he finds out about this?
What would he think of us?

166
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,860
Ma'am.

167
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,320
What were you doing?

168
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,406
You're supposed to be
Yun-seong's big brother!

169
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,784
Mr. Lee.

170
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,452
I'm sorry, sir.

171
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,539
Woo-taek is Yun-seong's big brother.

172
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,875
This is Woo-taek's fault.

173
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,507
See? Woo-taek says
it's not Yun-seong's fault.

174
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,634
And he'll say that if anyone asks!

175
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,848
This was our deal from the start.

176
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,854
You little bastard.

177
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,443
Don't look. Let's go.

178
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,779
Bastard.

179
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,759
Woo-taek did a good job, right?

180
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,473
I'm sorry, Woo-taek.

181
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,893
Whoever apologizes to Woo-taek

182
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,144
is a good person.

183
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,856
And good people get presents.

184
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,317
Do you want a present?

185
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,913
By the way, Woo-taek...

186
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,918
Do you think anyone saw us?

187
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,136
I can't...

188
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,432
let the tattletale off the hook.

189
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,857
Don't worry.

190
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,901
I know my way back home.

191
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,819
Where are you?

192
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:44,115
Come on. We have to find Fluffy now.

193
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,537
You said you knew who took Fluffy.

194
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,664
Why won't you tell me?

195
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,748
Hurry home.

196
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,667
I'll be waiting at home.

197
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,751
Na-rae.

198
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,464
You're gorgeous.

199
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,400
Hey!

200
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,445
- What are you doing?
- What's his problem?

201
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,158
This is a new one.

202
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,161
Give it a shot. This'll be big soon.

203
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,937
Nobody move. We're from the police.

204
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,230
Don't move, okay?

205
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,357
Come on, I told you not to move.

206
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,197
Just stay put.

207
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,704
Hey, Kim Mu-chan!

208
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,790
Come here!

209
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:50,176
<i>There's been another drug-related crime</i>
<i>that has shocked the country.</i>

210
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,178
<i>This time, it involves</i>
<i>a chaebol family member.</i>

211
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,972
<i>The number you have dialed...</i>

212
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,683
<i>Joo was arrested at a club</i>
<i>for consuming a liquid drug.</i>

213
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,268
KWON SEOK-JOO

214
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,354
<i>Working at a hotel owned</i>
<i>by his father company...</i>

215
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,857
<i>- The number you have dialed...</i>
- <i>He was the go-between</i>

216
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,652
<i>for the drugs to his VIP customers</i>
<i>and friends from the US...</i>

217
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,029
<i>This time, he partook</i>
<i>in the distribution...</i>

218
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,824
You must've lost your mind.

219
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,033
You're crazy.

220
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,369
Why did you take the drugs?
Are you in the Narcotics Unit?

221
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,955
I heard you took 50 painkillers.

222
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,499
Just say you have a death wish
if that's what you want.

223
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,918
Could you remove this for me?

224
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,128
No!

225
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,297
Wait until the IV's done
or you'll become a junkie.

226
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,007
This is what cops do.

227
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,301
To catch crazy guys,
you have to be crazy too.

228
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,636
And to catch junkies,
you've got to get high--

229
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,221
You little...

230
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,307
I know why
you're pushing yourself like this.

231
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,433
You want to wrap this up

232
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,227
to investigate
Professor Kwon's daughter's case.

233
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,771
Just drop it.

234
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,439
Team One is working hard on it already.

235
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,940
We don't need to interfere.

236
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,984
Would you be able to ignore it
if you were me?

237
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,987
You know our relationship.

238
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,906
<i>Moving on to our next story.</i>

239
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,783
<i>It's already been four days</i>

240
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:58,620
<i>since Professor Kwon's</i>
<i>eight-year-old daughter went missing.</i>

241
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,581
{\an8}<i>After the police found her broken phone</i>

242
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,667
{\an8}<i>in a park trash can</i>
<i>near Dawol-dong two days ago,</i>

243
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,171
{\an8}<i>the case has turned</i>
<i>into a missing persons investigation.</i>

244
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,633
{\an8}<i>Her father, Professor Kwon,</i>
<i>claims she was kidnapped</i>

245
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,093
{\an8}<i>and has offered a reward</i>
<i>for any useful information.</i>

246
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:18,473
<i>The child you're seeing right now</i>
<i>on your screen is Kwon Na-rae.</i>

247
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,641
Man...

248
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,644
What if you get involved,
and it really was kidnapping?

249
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,479
My head hurts. Stay out of it.

250
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:26,773
It was a kidnapping.

251
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,235
She would never run away from home.

252
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,741
I really think you should
stay out of this case.

253
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,035
This is the golden hour.

254
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,246
It's already passed.

255
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,583
Will you be okay? You two are close.

256
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,549
<i>...disappeared on her way home.</i>

257
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:57,053
<i>If you know Na-rae's whereabouts</i>
<i>after she got off her school bus,</i>

258
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,266
<i>please do not hesitate to call</i>
<i>the police or our broadcasting station.</i>

259
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,309
<i>Her family is desperately waiting</i>
<i>for her return.</i>

260
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:08,982
They're coming out!

261
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,030
Is that Na-rae?

262
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,448
Is it a homicide or accident?

263
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:18,867
Do you know who the culprit is?

264
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,743
When's the briefing?

265
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,328
Please tell us about the case.

266
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,541
Professor Kwon, please tell us something!

267
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:31,064
Professor Kwon has been arrested
after his daughter's body was found.

268
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,024
Professor Kwon was a popular law professor

269
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,735
- at Seohyeon University...
- There have been numerous reports

270
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,820
- that the family was seen...
- Na-rae's body was found

271
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:41,324
near the place of a witness' report
to the shock of many.

272
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,368
You keep saying it was a kidnapping,

273
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,120
but you never received demands for money,

274
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,205
did you?

275
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,083
But what the witness report
said was clear.

276
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,461
"The man I saw on TV
was going somewhere with the girl."

277
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,755
For an eight-year-old,

278
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:59,050
it takes about ten minutes to walk
from the bus stop to your house.

279
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:03,554
<i>That day, some people saw her</i>
<i>get off the school bus and leave with you.</i>

280
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,722
- Hi.
- <i>But actually,</i>

281
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,432
<i>she was never seen entering your house.</i>

282
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,769
I just got off the bus.
I'm on my way home.

283
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,857
Where are you?

284
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,402
You'd been to the place
where the body was found, right?

285
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,195
Don't even think about lying.

286
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,739
We know you protested
against demolishing that building.

287
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,867
I heard you were a strict father.

288
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,703
Did you beat her often?

289
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,080
What did you beat her with?

290
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,206
Your hands?

291
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,499
A switch?

292
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:32,834
Or a golf club?

293
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:38,131
You know which parts of the neighborhood
have CCTV cameras and which don't.

294
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,466
You took her to a blind spot
and killed her, didn't you?

295
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,218
Tell me the truth!

296
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,514
Kids can be adorable,

297
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:47,932
but they can also be annoying.

298
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,476
Still, how could you kill your own child?

299
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,281
I'll take it from here.

300
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,161
Sir.

301
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,555
Aren't you going to hire a lawyer?

302
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,308
I can handle it myself.

303
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:32,560
There's no need.

304
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,981
You'll need one soon.

305
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,286
TOUCHING
PROFESSOR KWON EVEN HAS A KID

306
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,747
TOUCHING AGAIN, A WICKED SMILE
HABITUAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT

307
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,165
{\an8}ARMS LINKED WITH STUDENTS

308
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,583
{\an8}SEXUAL HARASSMENT THROUGH AUTHORITY

309
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,834
{\an8}STOP TOUCHING ME, PROFESSOR!

310
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,294
{\an8}ME TOO HIM!

311
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:05,218
{\an8}HE'S A DEVIL! HYPOCRITE!
SHAMELESS MURDERER OF HIS OWN DAUGHTER

312
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,522
Mu-chan.

313
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,623
DISCOVERY OF JUSTICE

314
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,419
{\an8}PLEASE GO TO HELL

315
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,171
{\an8}GET LOST, HYPOCRITE

316
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:56,769
{\an8}KILLED YOUR OWN DAUGHTER! DIE!

317
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,230
{\an8}WE DON'T WANT MURDERERS
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!

318
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,416
{\an8}See if there's anything unusual.

319
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,710
And if she took anything.

320
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,881
The murderer might be keeping it.

321
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,475
These were found with her body.

322
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:38,352
See if anything's missing...

323
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:45,818
Professor.

324
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,035
Seok-joo.

325
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,085
Although you've been released for now,

326
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,379
you're still the prime suspect.

327
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:07,173
We must find the person

328
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:09,800
who did this to Na-rae.

329
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,683
A father who lost his daughter...

330
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,439
or a father who killed his daughter.

331
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,653
Which one sounds more interesting?

332
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,285
Whoever it was that made the video,

333
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,456
it got the entire country
hoping that I'm the murderer.

334
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,710
Maybe the last thing I can do for Na-rae

335
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,880
is to admit that I did it.

336
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,259
That way,

337
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:56,347
no one will talk about her anymore,
and perhaps that's all I can do.

338
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:02,019
She died such a painful death.

339
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,732
I won't be able
to hold a proper funeral for her.

340
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,402
Pull yourself together.
Don't be like that!

341
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,113
This is why we have to catch the murderer.

342
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,491
I don't believe you did it. Never.

343
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,704
You're the only person I trust...

344
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,290
and look up to.

345
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,084
Have you forgotten?

346
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,921
I said I'd be your number one fan.

347
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,175
I said that at your first lecture at KNPU.

348
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,471
Let's find who did this to her

349
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,266
and catch that bastard.

350
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:46,647
My number one fan...

351
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,026
is Na-rae.

352
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,322
I told you back then.

353
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:30,566
The plush toy.

354
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,652
The plush toy?

355
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,738
It was always attached to her backpack.

356
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,075
She'd never take it off.

357
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,326
She wouldn't have left it home.

358
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,062
Yes, this one. The bunny plush.

359
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,567
This is the boy
you wanted to adopt, right?

360
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,194
They were supposed to meet that day.

361
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,823
Yes, he thinks all of this happened
because he was late.

362
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,616
He's still in shock.

363
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:24,537
And the two had the same bunnies,

364
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,038
so she'd never take it off.

365
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,841
KWON NA-RAE: 129CM, 23KG

366
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,506
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

367
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,758
Please.

368
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,929
Can I see it right now?

369
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:27,516
You can watch the videos
saved on the phone's cloud.

370
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,227
I back videos up right after each ride.

371
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,397
PHOTO, VIDEO

372
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,083
Na-rae.

373
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:56,337
Hello.

374
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,380
Hello.

375
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:00,841
Wait.

376
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:04,678
The dog.

377
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,847
Your dog.

378
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:08,891
I know where it is.

379
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:10,726
Really?

380
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,729
Do you really know where Fluffy is?

381
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,397
Yeah.

382
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,275
Woo-taek knows.

383
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,444
Come with me.

384
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,244
I was told the boy next door took the dog,

385
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,623
so I thought it was just Yun-seong.

386
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,375
Yun-seong?

387
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,669
You mean Assemblywoman Min's son?

388
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:41,590
Before kidnapping Na-rae,
he must've used the dog as practice.

389
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,842
I should've known.

390
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,471
Now that we've specified the suspect,

391
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,307
all we need to do
is to bring him to justice.

392
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,351
We must catch that bastard.

393
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,529
He said he made them himself,
so there are only two of them.

394
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,323
Whoever has Na-rae's is the murderer,

395
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:09,118
so he told me to use this to catch him.

396
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,620
He left this with me.

397
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:18,961
I'm counting on you.

398
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:21,964
Don't worry.

399
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,350
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

400
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,236
Woo-taek doesn't like it here.

401
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,155
I don't like it.

402
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,448
I feel stuffy.

403
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,574
I feel so stuffy.

404
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:50,868
Yun-seong...

405
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,704
Yun-seong said he'd come to pick me up.

406
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,331
Yun-seong.

407
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,582
Lee Yun-seong!

408
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,500
My little brother.

409
00:31:58,584 --> 00:31:59,835
Yun-seong!

410
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,961
Where are you?

411
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,219
Apparently, his father
is the chairman's driver

412
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,639
and his mother is the housekeeper there.

413
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,725
It seems the chairman paid
for his lawyer and settlement.

414
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,518
They're like family, I hear.

415
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,855
I bet he has money to burn,

416
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,066
but there must be a reason
why he paid the settlements

417
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,903
for his employee's son.

418
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,903
So you're here about Woo-taek?

419
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,491
Lieutenant Kim Mu-chan
from Nambu Police Agency.

420
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,625
You know about Na-rae's case, right?
You were neighbors.

421
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,670
Byun Woo-taek is a suspect in the case.

422
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:30,467
I heard that Professor Kwon
was the culprit.

423
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,302
In cases like these,

424
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,097
it's not uncommon to consider
the victim's relatives as suspects.

425
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:41,895
Your family has been paying
for his settlement and lawyer.

426
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,315
Is there a particular reason why?

427
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,151
Woo-taek's mother

428
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,904
is the maid my family
gave me when I got married.

429
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,450
Since she's served our family
for a while and her son's ill,

430
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,618
so I've helped her
a few times out of pity.

431
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,663
Is there a problem with that?

432
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,708
A maid given when you got married?

433
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,173
Mom.

434
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:22,019
- Go with Yun-seong.
- Yes, ma'am.

435
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,984
I need to go out for a bit,
but I don't need the car.

436
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,029
We have a guest.

437
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,322
Let's go upstairs.

438
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,246
Your son. This is great.
I wanted to ask him something.

439
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,331
Wait...

440
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,042
Yun-seong,
I heard a lot about you from Woo-taek.

441
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,252
Hey.

442
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:50,798
I heard you've been close for a while,
and you did a lot of fun pranks together.

443
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,350
That's odd.

444
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,353
We're not close at all.

445
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,815
Don't believe everything Woo-taek says.

446
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,359
His intelligence is way below average.

447
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,366
That's how you would you put it?

448
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,972
I'm sorry, but I need to be somewhere.

449
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,268
Please go upstairs.

450
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,665
Hey, could you check
Byun Woo-taek's sex crime cases

451
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,918
and see if you could find
the name "Lee Yun-seong"?

452
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:11,712
<i>It's urgent.</i>

453
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,591
Look into that detective.

454
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,009
Ask some of my family's men

455
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,094
to spy on him
without the chairman finding out.

456
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:20,846
Yes, ma'am.

457
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,521
Find out any rumors
about Professor Kwon's late wife

458
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:30,856
and mention them in the video.

459
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,943
Make sure the video doesn't get deleted
until the case is closed.

460
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:38,238
We have to shift all the attention
to Professor Kwon.

461
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:39,865
Yes, ma'am.

462
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,399
What in the world are you doing?

463
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:17,027
Do you want to get fired that badly?

464
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,529
If we get caught, we'll say I broke in.

465
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:21,198
So just play innocent.

466
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:24,201
There's no solid evidence
other than the CCTV footage.

467
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,119
And we can't get a warrant for that.

468
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:29,665
Lee Yun-seong.

469
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,876
He was a bystander, a witness,
and sometimes the first informant.

470
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:37,047
Like you said, he's always been
involved in Byun Woo-taek's cases.

471
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,091
The Women and Juvenile Affairs chief said

472
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,260
one of the victims claimed
Yun-seong always had Woo-taek's back.

473
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,513
Though they took it back right after.

474
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:46,640
Well, he is a middle school student.

475
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:47,808
The first informant?

476
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,229
He's more trouble than I thought.

477
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,565
He underwent major heart surgery,
so he can't go to school.

478
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,693
I think you're suspecting
the wrong person.

479
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,320
He was smiling.

480
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,199
While Na-rae's body was being transported,

481
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,826
Lee Yun-seong looked at that

482
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,453
and smiled.

483
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:13,959
I don't care whether he's just 16,
or his heart can stop at any time.

484
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,086
If you had seen his smile,

485
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,880
you would've known right away too.

486
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,468
He is the culprit.

487
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:31,727
That means a little kid
perfectly cleaned up the crime scene.

488
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:35,856
He can't be on the loose.

489
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:42,654
PERSONAL INFORMATION
LEE YUN-SEONG

490
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,660
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

491
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,055
So this is what
the Violent Crimes Division looks like.

492
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:11,308
It just looks like a regular office.

493
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,436
So you want to give a witness statement?

494
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,271
It's about Woo-taek.

495
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,442
I remembered something odd that happened.

496
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,310
How do you know it was Na-rae's bag?

497
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,188
Had you seen the bag before?

498
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:04,152
I didn't say it was Na-rae's.

499
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,531
Since you came all the way
to my place last time,

500
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,908
I just wanted to tell you
something that may be helpful.

501
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:15,580
I see.

502
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,167
Going out with a child's backpack
late at night is indeed suspicious.

503
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,795
Especially because it was pink.

504
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,344
Pink...

505
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:30,846
What happened to your hand?

506
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,182
Oh, this.

507
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:39,020
I helped our gardener
prune our tree last week.

508
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,276
It's pretty hard to use a knife, isn't it?

509
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,528
You can't get a good grip on it.

510
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,612
Yes.

511
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,413
Thanks for your statement.

512
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,456
Of course.

513
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:18,476
Hey, cover the camera.

514
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,690
You weren't alone! Tell me!

515
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,568
Yun-seong!

516
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,571
It's Yun-seong.

517
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:33,033
Yun-seong.

518
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:40,957
It's pretty hard to use a knife, isn't it?

519
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,751
You can't get a good grip on it.

520
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,085
Yes.

521
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,521
{\an8}SEOUL NORTHERN DISTRICT COURT

522
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,231
{\an8}Are you saying there was an accomplice?

523
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,108
Upon examining new evidence,

524
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,152
the DNA of Byun Woo-taek
and a third party have been found.

525
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,488
We'd like permission
to collect DNA to compare.

526
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,407
And who's the suspect?

527
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,117
Lee Yun-seong, 16 years old.

528
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,578
He's the son of defendant's employers
and lives in the same house.

529
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,372
Based on the defendant's crime records,

530
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,166
it is very likely
that he was an accomplice.

531
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,171
In the next trial,

532
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,882
you may submit the DNA test results
and examine the witness.

533
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:14,968
- Your Honor.
- However,

534
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:18,013
the witness' involvement
with the defendant hasn't been proven,

535
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,889
and the witness is a minor,

536
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:22,642
so be extra careful
not to disclose his identity.

537
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:25,603
The examination of the witness
will be done in private as well.

538
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,565
{\an8}On the victim's plush toy,

539
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:30,984
{\an8}you said blood from someone
other than the victim was found.

540
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,570
I just found the evidence.

541
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,488
The NFS analyzed the blood stain.

542
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:38,116
Is there a reason
why this evidence wasn't found

543
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,577
when the body was discovered,
but it was a few days later?

544
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,748
If the murder and disposal of the body
took place in different areas, then yes.

545
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,541
According to the NFS's investigation,

546
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,044
it's clear that the body
was moved after the murder.

547
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,756
And we couldn't identify any footprints
since it is a redevelopment area.

548
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,383
I see.

549
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,594
I understand. One moment.

550
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,183
- Your Honor.
- Yes, you may go on.

551
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,226
We just received the DNA test results

552
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,771
from an object belonging to the victim
that was found belatedly.

553
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,231
Permission to submit this
as additional evidence?

554
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:13,026
What's odd is that this new evidence
the police found

555
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,944
looks very similar to... No.

556
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,406
It's identical to the toy.

557
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,952
Order in the court. Silence!

558
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,459
This is the plush toy
the victim always carried around.

559
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,378
A delivery worker
who'd often run into the victim

560
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,797
found this in front of her house
and reported it.

561
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,256
We had a DNA test done on it,

562
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,883
but unlike the prosecution's evidence,

563
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:40,261
neither the defendant's fingerprints
nor his DNA was found

564
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,679
on this plush toy.

565
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,268
Results show the only fingerprints
found on it belonged to the victim

566
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,145
and her friends and family.

567
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:52,315
Prosecution, are you sure
the toy in the photo is the victim's?

568
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:53,858
Prosecutor, please explain.

569
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,694
The child's photo has already shown proof.

570
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,823
No. The plush toy in the photo
and the evidence from the prosecution

571
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,157
are slightly different.

572
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,325
Your Honor.

573
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,536
Please compare
the two plush toys' eye colors.

574
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:10,166
I will have a look.

575
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:12,127
EVIDENCE OF PROSECUTION

576
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,260
The attorney is right.

577
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:22,637
The plush toy in the photo

578
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,765
is indeed not identical
to the prosecution's evidence.

579
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:28,601
This means the prosecution's request
for witness examination

580
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:29,936
should also be revoked.

581
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:33,273
Prosecution, is there more evidence
to establish witness examination

582
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:35,150
beyond the suspicion of collusion?

583
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:37,527
No, Your Honor.

584
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,321
Then as it stands,
the involvement of the witness

585
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:44,284
in this case
and how it can be proven seem unclear.

586
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,119
Witness examination will be nullified.

587
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,707
Byun has already confessed to his crime.

588
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,041
He said he did it with--

589
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,334
You hit me!

590
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,920
He said Woo-taek did it!

591
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:58,840
He hit me like this!

592
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,430
What on earth did the police do?

593
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,153
We will announce the verdict.

594
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:25,450
There exists no evidence
substantiating the defendant's charges.

595
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,828
So in accordance with Article 325
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

596
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:30,497
I declare the defendant innocent.

597
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:32,916
Your Honor.

598
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,928
If we reinvestigate both cases separately,
we can solve them both.

599
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,304
Just get us a search warrant.

600
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:48,556
We just need to find the crime scene.

601
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,475
Do you even hear yourself?

602
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:53,394
Prosecutor. Sir, please.

603
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,813
It's over. Just stop it!

604
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,489
I'm sure you know why I hit you.

605
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,244
Never mess with my son again.

606
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:12,580
He should never be tainted
by the likes of you.

607
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,218
It's Byun Woo-taek!

608
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,469
COURT

609
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,598
What kind of messed-up law is this?

610
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,017
What kind of law
lets a criminal walk free?

611
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,435
- You call that the law?
- But still...

612
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:37,438
We must follow it.

613
00:47:38,273 --> 00:47:39,315
Because it's the law.

614
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,609
Please give us a word!

615
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:43,194
A word, please.

616
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:45,405
Follow the law even if it's not just?

617
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:48,575
I can't do that.

618
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:51,119
My justice is...

619
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,663
extremely rational.

620
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:55,832
So what?

621
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,543
Look what happened

622
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,753
after breaking the law
and pressing your luck.

623
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,340
Justice and the criminal.

624
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:09,178
You lost them both.

625
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:30,450
Woo-taek, wait.

626
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,327
Just for a second.

627
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,246
I'd like to...

628
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:37,915
apologize on behalf of the police.

629
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,460
I had no idea you were being harassed.

630
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,462
You were wrongfully imprisoned and beaten.

631
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,381
It must've been hard.

632
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,217
I'm so sorry.

633
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:54,390
Are you apologizing to Woo-taek?

634
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:57,393
Yes.

635
00:48:57,477 --> 00:49:01,648
Whoever apologizes to Woo-taek
is a good person.

636
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:05,360
And Woo-taek
gives presents to good people.

637
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,362
Do you want a present?

638
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,907
What should I give you?

639
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:13,034
What do you want?

640
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:15,453
I...

641
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:19,123
I'm Na-rae's father, so--

642
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,091
<i>Dad, I miss you.</i>

643
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,969
<i>If I say this, will you take me to him?</i>

644
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,555
<i>You promised.</i>

645
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,141
Isn't it nice to talk
to Na-rae on the phone?

646
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:39,602
"Dad, I miss you."

647
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,898
<i>Dad, I miss you.</i>

648
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,944
<i>If I say this, will you take me to him?</i>

649
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,822
<i>You promised.</i>

650
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:57,537
<i>Dad, I miss you.</i>

651
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,540
<i>If I say this, will you take me to him?</i>

652
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,626
<i>You promised.</i>

653
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:58,473
Thank you.

654
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:12,779
Hello.

655
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:22,121
COURT

656
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:23,581
Do you admit to the charges?

657
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,542
How do you feel about this?

658
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:27,710
{\an8}PUNISH THE DRUNK DRIVER

659
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,545
{\an8}Why did you kill your daughter?

660
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:33,549
Are you going to appeal to a higher court?

661
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,559
Please, look here!

662
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:44,894
Do you admit to the charges?

663
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:46,437
Will you file an appeal?

664
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:48,731
- Please give us a word.
- How do you feel now?

665
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:50,358
Do you admit to the crime?

666
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:51,567
Do you admit to the charges?

667
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,377
A word, please!

668
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:15,800
<i>Hey, it's me. They say</i>
<i>both of Byun's parents committed suicide.</i>

669
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:30,481
Yun-seong.

670
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:32,984
Hey, Yun-seong.

671
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:34,902
Let's go.

672
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:38,656
Come on.

673
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:54,899
Let's go.

674
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,002
Okay, let's sum it up quick.

675
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:17,964
Kim Ji-hoon, you went to the hospital
for the reason you mentioned.

676
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:20,049
You got lost and ended up

677
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:21,384
Oh Jung-ho's office?

678
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:23,344
That's how you got involved, right?

679
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:26,347
- Yes.
- Okay. Thanks for your help.

680
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,475
You're just as smart as you look.
You managed to keep it together.

681
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:30,559
That's impressive.

682
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:32,103
You can go now.

683
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:34,522
Right.

684
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,732
Come on. I'll show you out.

685
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:45,825
Just a moment, sir.

686
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:49,662
We need to check something with you.

687
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:52,123
- With me?
- Come on.

688
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,166
Let's go.

689
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,294
Please have a seat. It won't take long.

690
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,188
Thanks, Sang-jae.

691
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:17,273
I'll take it from here.

692
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,275
In the interrogation room by yourself?

693
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,694
This might create issues later.

694
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:38,544
Do you remember me?

695
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:41,714
We met eight years ago.

696
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,301
Of course I do, Detective Kim Mu-chan.

697
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:47,553
How could I forget you?

698
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:51,557
I still think about Woo-taek
from time to time.

699
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:54,852
Good.

700
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,438
Since we both remember each other,
this should go smoothly.

701
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,565
I wasn't sure about it,

702
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,817
but the man I saw
in front of the agency building

703
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:03,486
seems to be Professor Kwon.

704
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:05,196
Right?

705
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,033
I thought he was
in prison though. Am I wrong?

706
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,745
You haven't changed one bit.

707
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,625
People don't change that easily.

708
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,627
I bet you haven't changed either.

709
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,921
Just like eight years ago,

710
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,465
you still fabricate evidence

711
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,175
and beat people up.

712
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,805
By the way,

713
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:34,517
why do I feel like I'm a suspect
or something right now?

714
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,395
Could you make it clear for me?

715
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,691
So I can decide
whether I should hire a lawyer or not.

716
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,156
- Detective.
- Yeah?

717
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,367
Why is my teacher staying back?

718
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,993
Well...

719
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,497
It's about the explosion at your school
and what happened to you.

720
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,707
Also, there are other things
we need to ask him about.

721
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,920
Can I use the restroom?

722
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,130
Sure, it's this way.

723
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,423
Hold on.

724
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:10,052
I can go on my own,
so it's okay for you to go.

725
00:57:10,136 --> 00:57:11,554
I know the way out.

726
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,430
Make sure to go straight home, okay?

727
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:14,557
- Okay.
- All right.

728
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:17,476
Kang Yoon-ji speaking.

729
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,602
Yes.

730
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,229
I did make a request for equipment.

731
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,232
We need to keep suspects
under surveillance.

732
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,068
Yes.

733
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:32,241
You're right. I haven't changed one bit.

734
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,326
I'm exactly the same as I was before.

735
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,289
Which is why...

736
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,334
I'm going to ask you
what I've been wondering

737
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:44,503
for the past eight years.

738
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:49,508
Lee Yun-seong.

739
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,263
You killed Kwon Na-rae, didn't you?

740
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,674
Ji-hoon!

741
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,261
What are you doing here?

742
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,806
Well, I...

743
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:41,018
Where's the restroom?

744
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,729
Restroom?

745
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,898
Yes, I really need to use it.

746
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:54,323
You're lucky that I ran into you.

747
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:59,286
If you'd peed in the yard,
you'd be deemed guilty on the spot.

748
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,289
Thank you.

749
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:04,833
I've been meaning to check on you.
I'm glad we met.

750
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:06,877
How have you been feeling?

751
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:10,214
Min said you still seemed
pretty shaken up from what happened.

752
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,552
Have you talked with your grandmother?

753
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:17,805
I'd recommend getting counseling.

754
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,140
You can go to a police hospital too.

755
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:21,684
I can refer you to one.

756
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,687
I'll ask my grandma.

757
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,690
You can drop me off at that bus stop.

758
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,900
It's okay.
I need to go to your school too.

759
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,653
Don't tell Min about this.

760
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,071
What?

761
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:41,662
By the way,

762
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:47,001
do you happen to know
the passcode to your computer lab?

763
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:55,301
You opened the door, so you can go now.

764
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,812
I knew it.

765
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:08,605
Teachers are all the same.

766
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:10,899
Opening the door
without knowing the reason for it

767
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,276
bothers me.

768
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,861
I'd rather know and pretend I didn't.

769
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,738
Not knowing makes you an accessory.

770
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,990
You'd be released with a warning
since you're a minor.

771
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:21,076
But if you help knowingly,
you'll be an accomplice.

772
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,161
So just go.

773
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,834
You suspect my teacher
may be Gaetal, right?

774
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:35,966
The video of your superintendent
on the night of the explosion...

775
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,052
The kids who hit me and Min filmed that.

776
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,095
I could tell from their voices.

777
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:43,932
But I know they don't have the brains
or skills to work with Gaetal.

778
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,435
While my teacher
is being detained by the police,

779
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,937
you're searching through his computer,

780
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,315
so I think it's pretty obvious.

781
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:58,822
You should become a cop.
Come to the Cyber Bureau. I'll mentor you.

782
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:06,413
Mr. Lee uses the school computer
only for sending out notifications.

783
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:09,416
He usually uses his own laptop
that he carries around.

784
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,212
He must've used it at least once.
All I need are the file transfer records.

785
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:17,549
Even meticulous people can let
their guard down in their own territory.

786
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:21,053
This place is his territory,
but it's also a public space.

787
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:24,848
Since the school's account
is used by many random people,

788
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,684
Mr. Lee might have slipped
and left a trace, right?

789
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:30,979
You're a smart kid.

790
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,237
This isn't going to be easy.

791
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,406
Our hacker guy's not here.

792
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,157
Wait.

793
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,328
What is it?

794
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,670
Hacking the email server
isn't very hard...

795
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:00,509
but we'd get caught
if we used a school computer.

796
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:03,804
In this case,
restoring the deleted files is better.

797
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,556
Oh, my.

798
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,683
You even use data recovery software?

799
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:10,102
Done.

800
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:16,150
This looks like our schoolyard.

801
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,526
Hold on.

802
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:19,153
And that's the car that exploded.

803
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:21,947
<i>Sir!</i>

804
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:25,701
<i>Sir!</i>

805
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:30,164
I got you.

806
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,773
- Is everything set?
- Yes, sir.

807
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:58,650
While you were with him,

808
01:02:58,734 --> 01:03:01,153
Sang-jae started tracking
Lee Min-soo's whereabouts.

809
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,531
But do you think
the Killing Vote will continue?

810
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:05,991
What if Jung Jin-wook lied?

811
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:07,659
Let's wait and see for now.

812
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,329
The Killing Vote is in two days,

813
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,582
so we'll know if he really is Gaetal.

814
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,297
{\an8}PERSONAL INFORMATION
LEE YUN-SEONG

815
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,216
{\an8}JOB APPLICATION FOR TEACHING POSITION

816
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:24,134
{\an8}Proving he owns the video isn't enough.

817
01:03:24,218 --> 01:03:27,012
Are there any records of him sending it
or posting it on the broadcast?

818
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:34,770
<i>We'll need to search his laptop</i>
<i>and personal accounts to find that.</i>

819
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:37,814
At least the fact that he has
the video of you proves

820
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:40,192
that he's closely connected to Gaetal.

821
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:42,694
I'll discuss with Jo-dan
about how we should proceed.

822
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:44,571
All right. Thanks.

823
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:45,656
<i>Of course.</i>

824
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:50,494
Now, it's evident.

825
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:51,703
Lee Min-soo is Number One Fan.

826
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,790
He's Gaetal, the host of the Killing Vote.

827
01:03:58,544 --> 01:04:00,546
I still don't get it.

828
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:02,548
Though he changed his name and face,

829
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:06,051
he was never involved in any crimes
while he was abroad.

830
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:08,679
How could this guy have possibly
cooked all this up?

831
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:11,848
There's no reason for it.

832
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,310
I'm not quite sure about that either.

833
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,564
Gaetal says he pursues justice,

834
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:21,400
but he also always says
if the punishment doesn't fit the crime,

835
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:23,360
it's not fair.

836
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:27,072
Since Lee Min-soo favors
elitism to his very core,

837
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,324
it doesn't sound like something he'd say.

838
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:33,036
What you said last time...

839
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:38,083
Did you mean it?

840
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:50,470
If I were Gaetal,

841
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:54,474
he would've been my first target.

842
01:04:57,603 --> 01:04:58,604
Seok-joo.

843
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:13,619
Jung Jin-wook said
his partner and accomplice

844
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:15,412
called himself Number One Fan

845
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:18,123
and destroyed the person
you loved the most.

846
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:19,207
Lee Min-soo...

847
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,793
is Gaetal.

848
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:29,009
When our dog went missing,
I went to talk to him.

849
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:32,846
Because some kids said
they saw him take the dog.

850
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:34,806
Then he said,

851
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:38,310
"How could I have done that?"

852
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,103
I felt something was off.

853
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:42,564
Did you take our dog, by any chance?

854
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:44,441
Me?

855
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,193
How could I have done that?

856
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:50,280
I still remember him saying that.

857
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:54,117
I studied criminal psychology,
but I missed that.

858
01:05:54,201 --> 01:05:57,329
He wasn't interested in seeing
if I found out his motives.

859
01:05:57,412 --> 01:06:01,375
His only concern
was whether I discovered how he did it.

860
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:07,714
A typical murderer's mind.

861
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,094
There's a lot to regret
about that investigation.

862
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:17,557
By the way, what happened
to the kid you wanted to adopt?

863
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,729
He was a couple years older than Na-rae,

864
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:25,440
so he must be in high school by now.

865
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,235
Have you ever

866
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,821
talked to him since that incident?

867
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:43,834
It hurts my pride
to join forces with a teenager,

868
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:46,670
but thanks for today, my one-day partner.

869
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:47,879
You really nailed it.

870
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:51,508
I'm your partner
and not an accomplice, right?

871
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:52,718
Of course.

872
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:55,095
Seriously, are you interested
in becoming a cop?

873
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,389
You could go
to Korean National Police University

874
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:59,641
or apply directly
to the Cyber Bureau like I did.

875
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:01,309
I'll treat you well.

876
01:07:01,393 --> 01:07:03,311
Me as a cop?

877
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:05,188
I can't be a cop.

878
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:07,482
That's what we all thought
when we first started.

879
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,653
One of my fellow cops
became one to avoid going to prison.

880
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:15,532
I'll drive you home.

881
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:18,535
It's okay. I live nearby.
You can go without me.

882
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,787
Should we call Min out
and have dinner together?

883
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:23,165
It's okay. You can go now.

884
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,500
Listen.

885
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:27,919
Well...

886
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:32,132
If there's anything you can't say
to your grandmother, you can tell me.

887
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,970
I can tell. I'm a cop.

888
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:40,849
I can be your big sister or your aunt.

889
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:45,479
So you can tell me anything
you can't share with your grandmother.

890
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:52,319
I guess it's pretty obvious
that I don't have parents.

891
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:53,862
Yes, it is.

892
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:59,534
I can tell right away, because I lost
my parents at a young age too.

893
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:01,203
So...

894
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:04,331
take the opportunity while you still can.

895
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:05,415
Okay?

896
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,960
Okay. Thank you.

897
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:10,670
Attaboy.

898
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:11,838
I'm off now.

899
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:13,043
Let's play together, son!

900
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:49,741
{\an8}<i>He deserves</i>
<i>a meet-and-greet with his hero.</i>

901
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:52,327
{\an8}It was you, wasn't it? Number One Fan.

902
01:12:52,494 --> 01:12:55,371
{\an8}<i>What in the world are you up to? Tell me!</i>

903
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:57,457
{\an8}I want you to resume your show.

904
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,876
{\an8}<i>So you're saying</i>
<i>there will be another Killing Vote?</i>

905
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:02,045
{\an8}<i>Are you sure Lee Min-soo is Gaetal?</i>

906
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,589
{\an8}I keep getting this feeling
they aren't the same person.

907
01:13:05,173 --> 01:13:07,383
{\an8}<i>The person you're voting for...</i>

908
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:11,054
