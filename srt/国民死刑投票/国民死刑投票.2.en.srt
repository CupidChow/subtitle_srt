WOULD YOU LIKE TO VOTE?

00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,186
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,353
SAFETY OF CHILD ACTORS WAS ENSURED

00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:08,903
KWON SEOK-JOO'S
FINAL TRIAL DATE

5
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,620
The defendant may address the court.

6
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,378
Your Honor.

7
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,005
DEFENDANT

8
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,216
And everyone gathered here.

9
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,511
There was only one reason

10
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,389
why I never defended myself in court.

11
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,227
Byun Woo-taek

12
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,354
deserved to die.

13
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,775
I may feel sorry to his parents
for taking the life of their son,

14
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,694
but I had no intention
of being considerate to the man

15
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,948
who did horrible things to
my eight-year-old daughter and killed her.

16
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,035
Above all else,

17
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:02,206
I am enraged by the fact
that devils who were deemed innocent

18
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,541
still exist in this country.

19
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,169
The shameless man
who never admitted to his crimes,

20
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,798
the cops who released him because
they cared more about their performance,

21
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,676
and the judiciary
who made a preposterous ruling,

22
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,886
bound by worthless law books
and precedents!

23
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,012
Defendant!

24
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,851
All of you who took the killer's side
and not the victim's

25
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,019
are all guilty! You all are!

26
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,789
<i><font color="#80FFFF">We're all at fault.</i></font>

27
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,793
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The devils who were deemed innocent</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">are walking around alive.</i></font>

28
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,295
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I can't stand the thought of it.</i></font>

29
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,215
"Devils who were deemed innocent."

30
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,343
There was a case

31
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,637
where the victim's father
killed his daughter's killer

32
00:02:58,721 --> 00:02:59,722
when he was released.

33
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:00,848
Eight years ago.

34
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,808
You were the officer in charge.

35
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,979
It's what the father said
in his final statement.

36
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,814
"Devils who were deemed innocent."

37
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,111
The father, Kwon Seok-joo,

38
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,821
is the culprit.

39
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,577
"Devils who were deemed innocent."

40
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,705
When I first heard it, I found it strange.

41
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,998
He wasn't quoting anyone.

42
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,834
Kwon Seok-joo said it first.

43
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,210
- So--
- That trial...

44
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,589
Due to the specificity of the case,

45
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,634
the final statement was only heard
by those who were present.

46
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,303
And I remember everyone
who was there at the time.

47
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,683
Two years ago, Assemblywoman Min Ji-young

48
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,645
hired a hacker to do a DDoS attack
on the NEC website.

49
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,481
We had the evidence
and all we had to do was make an arrest.

50
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,442
But my team leader
deleted all the evidence

51
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,029
and said the police should stay away
from politicians.

52
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:00,074
I got so mad
that I released it to the press

53
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,284
and got my team leader sacked.

54
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:03,869
But Min Ji-young got away

55
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,163
and her aide took the blame.

56
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,458
I became the crazy wench
who got promoted for whistleblowing.

57
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,585
I found it
when I looked into Min Ji-young.

58
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,462
Professor Kwon Seok-joo's case.

59
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,172
That's how I know.

60
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,007
Anyway,

61
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,468
I will dig into this video,

62
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,178
so let me join
the Special Investigation Unit.

63
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,517
We'll check the video ourselves,
so leave it here. Good work.

64
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,686
- Mr. Kim.
- Kwon Seok-joo

65
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,396
is still in Cheongnang Prison.

66
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,440
He's never had a visitor
or sent out a single letter.

67
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,485
But The Killing Vote?

68
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,862
- It's impossible.
- But still--

69
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,825
The forensic analysis
on Bae Gi-chul's phone is done.

70
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,284
They found a threatening text.

71
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:45,369
So...

72
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,497
Should I keep talking with her here?

73
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,334
You can go.

74
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,047
I don't accept anyone
who's crazier than I am.

75
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,174
I cause enough trouble.

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,779
Be careful with her.
Once a traitor, always a traitor.

77
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:22,656
Bae Gi-chul's phone?

78
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,659
Remember the cryptocurrency account
that we failed to seize?

79
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:29,246
On the day he died, the entire amount
was donated online using that phone.

80
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,373
To an organization that helps kids
who were sexually assaulted.

81
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,670
He is a bastard hiding behind a mask,

82
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,380
but he acts like Robin Hood?

83
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,762
Share it with the Cyber Bureau and tell
them to track down the account hacker.

84
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,848
The cryptocurrency exchange
won't share the account holder's info.

85
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:27,387
Hyun, where are you going?

86
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,517
I'm right here.
I won't be long. I'll join you.

87
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,979
She's talking in her sleep.

103
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,683
Hello.

104
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,311
Professor, I passed my GED.

105
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,105
Congratulations.

106
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,237
My mom's very happy about it.

107
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,490
I'll get ready to enroll in college
since I'll be released in two months.

108
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:55,035
If it wasn't for your help,
this wouldn't have happened.

109
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,662
Thank you so much.

110
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,330
All I did was root for you.

111
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,250
You are the one who made it happen.

112
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,003
By the way...

113
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,881
I heard he died. Bae Gi-Chul.

114
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,426
I wanted to kill him with my own hands.

115
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,471
But now that he's really dead,
it feels like...

116
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,723
- he died because of me.
- Hey!

117
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,059
Stop talking nonsense.

118
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,311
It's no big deal. He deserved it.

119
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,940
He went nuts after the Professor
caught him trying to mess with me--

120
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,361
On a good day like this...

121
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,114
- let's be positive.
- Yes, Professor.

122
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:38,745
Of course.

123
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,080
Thank you.

124
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,332
I'd like that. Yes.

125
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,376
All right.

126
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:55,846
- Jjoo.
- Yes?

127
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,642
It would've helped us both
if you did this sooner.

128
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,979
- Pardon?
- You went to Kim Mu-chan, right?

129
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,733
Well, that's--

130
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:08,942
It's done.

131
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,570
Gaetal's test video was found
in Bae Gi-chul's hideout,

132
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,781
and they need our additional support
to investigate the video.

133
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,492
They are happy that they found
a crucial lead right away,

134
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:21,496
and I am happy to get rid of the idiot
who hands a lead over to another team.

135
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,875
You really are something.

136
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,335
Respect.

137
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,005
So I'm joining
the Special Investigation Unit?

138
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,758
You're an expert
at getting your boss fired,

139
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,926
so go strut your stuff.

140
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,261
I look forward to it.

141
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,932
Okay, I'll get going!

142
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,769
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER
OF RESPECT FOR MAN'S LIFE AND DIGNITY

143
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,410
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,495
Kwon Seok-joo refuses to see you.

145
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,875
I need to see him
to talk about an ongoing investigation.

146
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,377
Please ask him again.

147
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,837
I can't force him out of his cell.

148
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,756
- He must agree.
- Please ask again.

149
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,299
It's an urgent matter.

150
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,469
You've only asked
how he was doing for years,

151
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,806
so seeing you do this tells me
that it's an urgent issue,

152
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,307
but we're in a bind too.

153
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,976
Professor Kwon knows the law so well.

154
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,396
If he claims that his human rights
as an inmate were violated, it'll hurt us.

155
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,691
Come on. Let's stick to the rules.

156
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,235
If you want to talk to Kwon Seok-joo,

157
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,571
send a formal request
to the Ministry of Justice, okay?

158
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,030
Here.

159
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,330
Wait.

160
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,792
Are you talking to me?

161
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,463
Kwon Seok-joo still
doesn't get any visitors?

162
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,427
No. No one comes and he sees no one.

163
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,722
But he gets along with other inmates
without causing trouble.

164
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,482
My name is Park Chul-min.

165
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,860
It is an honor to meet you.

166
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,619
Can I get your business card?

167
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,749
Maybe I can contact you
regarding Inmate 0512.

168
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,927
- Hello.
- The waiter who saw Bae Gi-chul last

169
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,930
is at the bar, so we'll go question him.

170
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,182
He is one suspicious bastard.

171
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,395
The waiter Oh Young-don.

172
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,397
His online username is One Shot, One Kill.

we looked at some posts uploaded
from the IP of the bar.

175
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,947
On the day Bae Gi-chul was killed...

176
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,157
"Wow. Bae Gi-chul made
a reservation at our bar."

177
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:48,078
"He's one filthy bastard,
so it'll be hard to comfort those girls."

178
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,579
Things like that.

179
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,915
This is how they tracked down
Bae Gi-chul's location.

180
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,377
Another one is something
that Oh Young-don posted elsewhere.

181
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,631
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- I hate him. Seriously.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- He's so disgusting.</i></font>

182
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:03,552
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What a jerk. What's wrong with him?</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He's like that every time.</i></font>

183
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,470
He is a lunatic.

184
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,389
I'll head there too. See you there.

185
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,141
Hey, Jo-dan. Joo Hyun's joining us today.

186
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,520
When she comes, start tracing
the location of the broadcast.

187
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,565
What? Jjoo? How did she end up joining us?

188
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,192
All right. Oh, he hung up.

189
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:35,208
- It must've turned her on.
- "Turned on"?

190
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,210
You want to be arrested
for something else?

191
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,753
Why are you always angry?

192
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,423
Because you always make me angry. Go away.

193
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,470
Jeez.

194
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,472
Why is Joo Hyun...

195
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,529
Hello.

196
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,576
Yo, Jjoo!

197
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,536
Hey, Jo-dan!

198
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,126
Take this.

199
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,212
Here.

200
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,508
You got something exciting going
down there.

201
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,218
- Come on!
- Stop it.

202
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,472
I'm not alone. You always looked tired
and lifeless, but today...

203
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,516
your eyes are sparkling.

204
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,851
Of course!

205
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,936
Stop it!

206
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,396
You got stronger, my friend.

207
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,564
Indeed.

208
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,568
You mess with my shoes, you mess with me.

209
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,320
Are you...

210
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,656
that happy? You look a bit...

211
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,866
No, you look totally

212
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,117
high as a kite.

213
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,369
I never worked OT for two years.

214
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,913
So my brain cells and stamina
are trembling.

215
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,083
People need a bit of adversity.

216
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,959
Let's go and get that lunatic.

217
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,675
It's so strange to see a crazy dog

218
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,802
chasing after a lunatic.

219
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,388
We have to go out now!

220
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,306
We found a zombie PC!

221
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,599
Look at her confidence.

222
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,603
Because of The Killing Vote,

223
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,980
we were all walking on eggshells
around him.

224
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,232
He said it was fine

225
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,734
and he voted "yes" himself.

226
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,779
Wait, that means
he voted to get himself killed.

227
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,343
I didn't find anything in the footage.

228
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,681
What's this?

229
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,851
Don't touch that. It's expensive.

230
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,936
It's fine because it's hard. Never mind.

231
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,982
Bae Gi-chul last talked with his wife
over the phone here.

232
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,025
Did you hear anything he said?

233
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,779
You think that's possible?
I can't even hear my own voice.

234
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,782
Give it.

235
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,373
Do you always keep a close relationship

236
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,210
with the customers here?

237
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,171
Yes, well...

238
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,465
He was a regular at my old workplace too.

239
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,425
- What about it?
- The cab.

240
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,635
Did you use an app for it?

241
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,596
Or...

242
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,561
Or was it a business partner?

243
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,022
What? Oh...

244
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:48,067
When we went out, it was waiting in front.

245
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,654
So you didn't call it?

246
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,450
That means the cab waited
for him on purpose.

247
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,745
The cab probably drove around
until Bae Gi-chul came out

248
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,954
or waited by the curb.

249
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,291
Go look at nearby cameras.

250
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,834
All right.

251
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,049
- It's dangerous.
- Pardon?

252
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,351
I must be getting old now.

253
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,894
I just can't watch.

254
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,748
Wait. Let's talk this out.

255
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:44,833
It's not that.

256
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,794
Hold on. Wait.

257
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,678
Hey.

258
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,722
How could you install a camera
in the women's bathroom?

259
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,936
I'm deaf now because this pig hit me.

260
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,479
What should I do about this?

261
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,523
I can't hear anymore because you--

262
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,233
Wait!

263
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,235
Hey. Username One Shot, One Kill.

264
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,070
Leaking illegal videos
and abetting a murder.

265
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,406
You colluded with someone, didn't you?

266
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,575
Who ordered it? How did you get paid?

267
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,995
I really can't hear anything.

268
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,247
This is a workplace accident.
What should I do?

269
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,671
A beating is not the answer
for bastards like you.

270
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,343
Everyone seems
to be trading crypto these days.

271
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,512
Cash is so outdated.

272
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,348
Sir, how did you find this?

273
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,516
How?

274
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,647
Please don't. My life depends on this.

275
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,320
No! Sir!

276
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,905
You really can't do this, sir.

277
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,410
Who ordered you to put him in that cab?

278
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,037
That's...

279
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,583
I have his business card!

280
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,792
I know the driver.

281
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,879
Here.

282
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:27,852
What is this smell?

283
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,396
Did you burn him?

284
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,566
The smell of his insides burning in pain.

285
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,945
Not many 50,000 won bills are left.

286
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,655
Sihyun Transportation.
Driver's Ko Dong-gyu.

287
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,659
SIHYUN TRANSPORTATION
KO DONG-GYU

288
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,910
I'll track him down now.

289
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,330
Damn it.

290
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,969
My business was thriving, but now...

291
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,930
HISTORY, DATE RANGE

292
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,520
I found it!

293
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,605
You did? Where?

294
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,608
How did you find it?

295
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,947
We found the same malware
that Min's PC had here.

296
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,158
But with this place's system,
all the computers are operated by...

297
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,702
the central server.

298
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:26,995
It's cloud storage.

299
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:30,289
So a client PC ended up infecting
the central server?

300
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:31,416
Yeah.

301
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,167
Wait.

302
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,631
You're right. Min has an account here.

303
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,592
The district is different,
but it's close to her school and academy.

304
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,823
YOUR ACCOUNT IS LOGGED IN ELSEWHERE

305
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:05,783
What?

306
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,161
LEARN MORE

307
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,331
LOGGED IN FROM ANOTHER DEVICE

308
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,708
What's this?

309
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:33,728
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The malware was hidden in the file</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">that's auto-updated.</i></font>

310
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,856
<i><font color="#80FFFF">So all the PCs here became zombies</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">in no time.</i></font>

311
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,610
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The security alerts must have gone through</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">the emails acquired from hacking the PCs.</i></font>

312
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,075
He didn't do anything particular
with these PCs.

313
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,368
Hidden videos weren't detected either.

314
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,623
For now, since we found the IP
that started all this,

315
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:54,999
let's locate the place first.

316
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,710
Let's get this guy this time.

317
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,921
The real one that cut and ran away.

318
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,299
Let's catch him.

319
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,967
I think I won.

320
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,136
I think I did.

321
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,055
What are you talking about? Huh?

322
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,185
Darn it.

323
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,728
You got me this time.

324
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,396
Hello, this is Joo Hyun.

325
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,482
Can you get me some details
of this IP holder?

326
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,068
We're currently investigating it,
so I need it as soon as possible.

327
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:23,820
Thank you.

328
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,865
Here it comes. Car 5403.

329
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,167
- Mr. Ko Dong-gyu?
- Yes, that's me.

330
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,462
I heard that you were asking for me.

331
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,423
We're from the Nambu Police Agency.
You came in quickly.

332
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,175
My shift just ended.

333
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:47,844
My name is Kim Mu-chan.

334
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,513
What is this about?

335
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,391
It's been causing a stir these days.
The Killing Vote.

336
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,144
The victim was Bae Gi-chul.

337
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,479
It was him, right?

338
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,773
I knew it was him when I saw him.

339
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,358
Have you met him before?

340
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,735
Yes, he called for a substitute driver.

341
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,654
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I gave him a ride</i></font>

342
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,240
<i><font color="#80FFFF">and heard that he was killed</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">the next day. I was shocked.</i></font>

343
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,076
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He told me that he wasn't</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">in the position of getting in random cars.</i></font>

344
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,621
<i><font color="#80FFFF">When he got in,</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I could tell why he called me.</i></font>

345
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,124
- Okay.
- He's a VIP. Take good care of him.

346
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,792
All right.

347

348
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,006

349
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:26,883
Give me a call for your clients.

SIHYUN TRANSPORTATION

351
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,386
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

352
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,971
- Have a good night.
- Bye.

353
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,307
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

354
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,100

355
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,436

<i><font color="#80FFFF">What could I do?</i></font>

356
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,148
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I had no choice but to give him</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">a ride just for that night.</i></font>

357

<i><font color="#80FFFF">I just took him to where</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">the car was originally parked.</i></font>

358
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,241
Sir.

359
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,043
THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT

360
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,377
The glove compartment?

361
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:11,928
Why so much?

362
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,358
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I got a text.</i></font>

363
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,151
A text.

364
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,445
Who sent you the text?

365
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,989
- Pardon?
- Bae Gi-chul was asleep,

366
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:34,075
so someone else must've texted you.

367
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,081
You're right. I just...

368
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,750
The same number made the reservation,

369
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,210
so I didn't think much of it. Hold on.

370
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,003
Here it is.

371
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,923
He texted me the cab plate number too.

372
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,968
I'll check if it's from a burner phone.

373
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,555
I'll send you a plate number.
Check it quick.

374
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,015
Yes, right now.

375
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:04,772
<i><font color="#80FFFF">We couldn't find it because it was</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">unregistered and repainted as a taxi.</i></font>

376
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,024
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It was found at a junkyard.</i></font>

377
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,664
- Where is the taxi?
- Where is it?

378
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:22,915
Over there.

379
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,251
- Oh, no!
- Stop!

380
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,878
Where is the taxi?

381
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,463
Do you know?

382
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:34,010
- Stop!
- Stop!

383
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:54,864
What do we do?

384
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,074
It's of no use now. Not even the dash cam.

385
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,670
It really is here.

386
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,422
When I saw the address,
I didn't believe it.

387
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,590
It is the right place.

388
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,012
Every number matches perfectly.

389
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:22,183
So he ran a practice run for
The Killing Vote for Bae at Bae's hideout?

390
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,018
Wow.

391
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,771
The more I find out, the crazier he seems.

392
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,022
By the way,

393
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,940
didn't you tell Mr. Kim too?

394
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,987
We're doomed. He got here so fast.

395
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,448
Did they fly over here?

396
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,866
What's going on here?

397
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,534
Hello, sir.

398
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,370
Are you toying with us?

399
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:43,454
Pardon?

400
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,456
We followed the lead and ended up here.

401
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,585
It looks like Gaetal used

402
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,505
a remote server to air
the test run from here.

403
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,590
- Right?
- Are you sure?

404
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,218
The IP address we tracked down is here,

405
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,887
but we have to see
if there's a hidden computer or server.

406
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,681
He could've aired the actual broadcast
through here too.

407
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,434
Gaetal.

408
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,479
It has a ring to it.

409
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:13,984
"Gae"?

410
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,488
"Tal." Gaetal.

411
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,865
You have to say the full name.
People will misunderstand.

412
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,076
INVESTIGATION IN PROCESS
DO NOT ENTER

413
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,806
Jo-dan, check the log history first.

414
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:44,890
Okay.

415
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,769
I wonder where the LAN cable is.

416
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:50,896
At least look for a camera.

417
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,441
Don't just stand there and do nothing.

418
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:54,692
Please.

419
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,198
It's so stuffy in here.
Let me open the window.

420
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,335
Hey.

421
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,296
Isn't this a LAN cable?

422
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,464
Yes, it is.

423
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,257
How did you find that?

424
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,177
I find everything.

425
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,511
I'm impressed.

426
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,978
LOG

427
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,199
REPORTER CHAE DO-HEE

428
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,533
LOG HISTORY

429
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,827
I have his log history.

430
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,663
He used the server here
a month before Bae Gi-chul was released.

431
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,666
- What about the data?
- I collected all volatile data.

432
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,294
I'll analyze these
once I'm back at the office.

433
00:29:56,837 --> 00:30:00,591
But shouldn't we look for camera footage
from around here in that time period?

434
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,678
That's easier said than done.
Have you ever done it yourself?

435
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,305
You'll hurt both of your knees.

436
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,349
You think it's easy work
at the Cyber Bureau?

437
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,434
Our vision worsens
from staring at tiny numbers.

438
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:12,228
We suffer from neck pain.

439
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,646
We get tech neck

440
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,397
and carpal tunnel syndrome.

441
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,024
- Hey.
- Sorry about that.

442
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,528
Detectives have plantar fasciitis,
but you wouldn't know.

443
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,404
It must be severe.

444
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,534
How can we search
when it's so dark in here?

445
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,035
Let's call it a night and head home.

446
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,329
I haven't been getting much sleep
in the past 10 days.

447
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,733
MURDERER ACQUITTED DUE TO LACK OF EVIDENCE

448
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:07,575
MARCH

449
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:14,456
SECOND VOTE?

450
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:31,890
D-7
THE KILLING VOTE

451
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,200
1. EXECUTION: 30 YEARS

452
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,545
FJ? What about you?

453
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:02,755
INFP.

454
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:03,964
Did you vote?

455
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,841
- I did.
- Really?

456
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,760
- What about you?
- I did it right away.

457
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,387
He'd do it again, right?

458
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,057
On the 15th and 30th of every month.

459
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,309
But we can't keep voting
to get people killed.

460
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,227
Aren't you guys scared?

461
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:18,771
That's murder too.

462
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,189
Didn't you see the online petition

463
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,399
about someone's daughter
who was kidnapped because of Bae?

464
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:24,234
- I did.
- I did.

465
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,403
He's not human, so it's not murder.

466
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,157
- But legally, it's murder.
- So what about you?

467
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:32,785
You're not going to vote?

468
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,411
You're not going to vote?

469
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,373
Come on.

470
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,708
- You scared me.
- Hello.

471
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,794
Break is over. Get back to your desks.

472
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,089
- Come on.
- So dusty today.

473
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,758
Did you vote yes? No?

474
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,426
What did you vote for?

475
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,304
Hye-mi, all elections are secret ballots.

476
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,014
I taught you that.

477
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:57,935
And just as Min said, The Killing Vote

478
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,479
is an instrument of crime
made by a criminal.

479
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,898
The school will make an announcement
about that soon,

480
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,401
so don't talk too much about it, okay?

481
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:08,779
So you don't agree
with The Killing Vote, right?

482
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:12,825
Well...

483
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,744
I do think it's a novel idea.

484
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,871
But what we must pay attention to is,

485
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:21,709
that from the first vote,
more than half of the citizens

486
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,252
participated in it right away.

487
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,962
That's how many people thought

488
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:27,965
the punishment that Bae Gi-chul got
was not enough

489
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,925
and how much they didn't trust
the judiciary system.

490
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:32,136
- Right?
- Right...

491
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:35,973
It seems you're certain
there will be another vote.

492
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,560
You said "first vote."

493
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,360
Well, since the killer
hasn't been caught yet.

494
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:50,529
What about you, Ji-hoon?

495
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,240
Do you think The Killing Vote is right?

496
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,659
In order to change something
and break it down,

497
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,078
I think there needs to be bloodshed.

498
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,124
What?

499
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,500
Was Kim Ji-hoon always like that?

500
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:08,422
I didn't know we had
such a radical anarchist in our class.

501
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,882
I mean, that's good.

502
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,341
Anyway...

503
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,636
Even if the sky falls
and the ground crumbles,

504
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,388
high schoolers must continue to learn.

505
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,267
Open your books and focus.

506
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:23,437
Let me see...

507
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,249
You didn't find anything today either?

508
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,710
They said anyone can make the same mask

509
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:49,713
at home with a 3D printer.

510
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,548
We only have a few days left,

511
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:53,550
so is it okay to not have any leads?

512
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:54,635
The origin of the text?

513
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,721
I searched
all telecommunication companies,

514
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,431
but none of them reported being hacked.

515
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,809
I handed the test video
to the analysis team.

516
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,603
In the end, I didn't find anything useful.

517
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,024
But...

518
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,115
I dug into those around Bae Gi-chul
who held a grudge against him.

519
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,618
I got this post from
an online message board

520
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,578
used by prison guards
at Cheongnang Prison.

521
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:27,417
"Bae Gi-chul was beaten
by inmates who wanted money from him."

522
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:31,213
- What about it?
- What's strange is

523
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,590
Bae Gi-chul was beaten up

524
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,217
and was locked up in solitary confinement.

525
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,512
He was the one who got beaten up, so why?

526
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:40,556
You're right.

527
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:42,850
It doesn't seem right.

528
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,184
Right?

529
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:47,771
I think we should talk
to the inmates here.

530
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:01,618
I'll set it up for you
at Cheongnang Prison.

531
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,246
Do whatever you want then.

532
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,804
It's a simple interview,
so don't be nervous.

533
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:23,724
Okay.

534
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,562
"Devils who were deemed innocent."

535
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,106
Have you heard this before?

536
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,941
Pardon?

537
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:36,194
That dirty bastard. When I think about
what he did with those kids...

538
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,410
He walked out of here alive
because he was damn lucky.

539
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,037
If it weren't for the Professor,

540
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,039
I would've slit his throat.

541
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,541
I didn't have any money in here,

542
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,419
so I used to run some errands,

543
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,712
and they'd give me snacks

544
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,464
and calling cards.

545
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,763
But that bastard

546
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,806
kept taking off my clothes.

547
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,310
My mom would die if she found out.

548
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,646
Inmate 0912 started it.

549
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,982
But of course,
without the Professor's testimony,

550
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,484
it would've been hard to prove it.

551
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,904
Inmate 0912 sure did have a lot of money.

552
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,573
Every inmate who was after him
mooched off him.

553
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,951
Someone outside kept wiring him money.

554
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,120
By the way,

555
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:28,872
who is this man

556
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,124
you call "Professor"?

557
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,835
Bae Gi-chul...

558
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,797
He caused trouble when he was in here,
and he's still doing it now.

559
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,007
Think of how many were after him.

560
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,677
It wouldn't have been strange
if he had been stabbed at night.

561
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,304
So why is she questioning everyone here?

562
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,811
Anyway, I removed you
from the list, Professor Kwon,

563
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,771
so don't worry about being questioned.

564
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,315
Right here.

565
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,692
The highlighted areas...

566
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,402
Revise them and write a new copy.

567
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,988
You must drag this out
and wait until next year

568
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,239
to settle the divorce

569
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,325
to get out of child support
since your kids will be adults.

570
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,788
If your wife's lawyer wants to settle
due to financial support for the kids,

571
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,249
just ignore them. It's not mandatory.

572
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,919
They're taking their mom's side.

573
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:18,630
They'll come to their senses
if I cut them off.

574
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:19,756
Yes?

575
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,935
The police interview is almost over.

576
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,729
Sir, would you like to talk to her too?

577
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,398
She's just a young girl. Why bother?

578
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,483
Nothing serious came up, right?

579
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:39,735
No.

580
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,112
She asked many questions,
but there was nothing serious.

581
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:43,530
What did she say?

582
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,449
"Devils who were deemed innocent"?

583
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,994
She asked everyone
if they've heard of that phrase.

584
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,553
There is one more person involved.

585
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,443
The warden will only allow 30 minutes.

586
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,279
I already explained everything to 0512
on the way here.

587
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,740
Please keep this classified.

588
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,586
I'm Lieutenant Joo Hyun
from the Special Investigation Unit.

589
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,840
Would it be okay if I record this?

590
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:07,989
Well...

591
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:11,535
Based on the Treatment of Inmates Act,

592
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:15,163
inmates have the right
to refuse anyone's visitation,

593
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:18,458
but I heard that this is urgent.
So here I am.

594
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:22,337
You have questions to ask
about the late Bae Gi-chul?

595
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,675
That's why I came here,

596
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,427
but I'd like to ask you something else.

597
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,307
The Killing Vote.

598
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:36,935
Do you know about it?

599
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,439
Yes, I do.

600
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,359
I do read the newspapers in here.

601
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,864
"Devils who were deemed innocent."

602
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:51,950
The phrase that the killer used...

603
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,162
You were the first one to say it,
weren't you?

604
00:40:56,288 --> 00:41:00,500
I think the killer has something
to do with you.

605
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:05,797
The two people who used the same phrase
must be connected.

606
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,592
That's such a naive approach.

607
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,386
When you said that in court,

608
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,929
only a few people were there.

609
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:17,267
I think one of them is either the killer

610
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:19,269
or someone who's involved.

611
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,815
Does anyone come to mind?

612
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:28,028
Someone who hates this society
or wants to be judge and jury?

613
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:31,489
Or someone who might have
that kind of notion?

614
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,284
I don't know anyone like that.

615
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,039
If you can't find the killer,
why don't you find the victim first?

616
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,792
The killer already announced
the next crime,

617
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,503
which means he probably
has the next target in mind.

618
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:49,466
Think from the perspective
of the killer playing hero,

619
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:52,302
and find the target that he'd choose.

620
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,431
You mean you can

621
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,684
guess who that would be?

622
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,522
Inmate 0512. I'm done now.

623
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,150
Wait.

624
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:09,069
You do have someone in mind, right?

625
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,654
Tell me, Mr. Kwon!

626
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,338
It's exactly as you expected.

627
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,801
I knew he'd come
after hearing that phrase.

628
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:36,596
He abandoned everything that he had

629
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,265
and chose to be a murderer.

630
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:42,102
"Devils who were deemed innocent"
is the phrase that he used

631
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,937
to express his feelings at the time.

632
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,231
<i><font color="#80FFFF">If he'd ignored us</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">even after we mentioned that,</i></font>

633
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:50,360
I would've suspected that Kwon Seok-joo
had something to do with Gaetal.

634
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,028
Does that mean

635
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,448
Kwon Seok-joo is excluded
from the list of suspects?

636
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,326
No. He may not be directly involved,

637
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,495
but the killer is someone around him.

638
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:02,998
We must get him to talk.

639
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,125
But...

640
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:09,170
What Kwon Seok-joo said earlier
was fascinating.

641
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,799
Data-collecting is my specialty after all.

642
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:18,638
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

643
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:21,141
The day Gaetal announced
is the day after tomorrow.

644
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:23,935
We haven't found anything yet,
so what are you going to do?

645
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:26,438
Do you really want the two of us
to get fired?

646
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,648
He was in control from the start,

647
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:32,360
and I told you we'd be forced
to follow at his pace for a while.

648
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,653
For a while?

649
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:35,238
So, you're saying

650
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:38,283
that another incident must occur
for us to have more leads?

651
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,909
Cutting and running.

652
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:41,286
It was meticulously planned.

653
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,371
I hope it doesn't happen,

654
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:44,956
but the more incidents there are,

655
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,666
the more leads we will have.

656
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,627
I'm going crazy here.

657
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:54,007
Did you learn anything
at Cheongnang Prison?

658
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,720
I think Kwon Seok-joo is somehow involved.

659
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,013
What?

660
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,016
If that's true,

661
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,643
we can't leave
Assemblywoman Min Ji-young out.

662
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:09,773
And that kid.

663
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:24,037
<i><font color="#80FFFF">No change of plan, right?</i></font>

664
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,332
Don't worry. Wire the money.

665
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,796
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'll wire the remaining half</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">once the job is done as agreed--</i></font>

666
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,846
Min-soo!

667
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:45,850
Min-soo...

668
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,727
Are you all right? Breathe.

669
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:49,104
Breathe.

670
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,438
Let's stand up.

671
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:55,068
Give him the oxygen mask.

672
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,448
Breathe. Keep breathing.

673
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,201
It's all right. You're all good.

674
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:08,790
It's okay.

675
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,377
Look at that. This is intense.

676
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,422
- What's all this?
- It's all data related to Bae Gi-chul.

677
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:18,883
People with similar histories,
criminal records, and trial verdicts

678
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:20,969
are all gathered here.

679
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:23,805
So these are the people
who deserve to die?

680
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,766
You caught on quicker than I expected.

681
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:30,812
But you're really something too.
When did you collect all these?

682
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:32,522
You're even more intense.

683
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,607
I can't just wait doing nothing.

684
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:38,445
All the criminals follow the pattern
that they made.

685
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,738
If one of these become
the subject for the vote.

686
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:43,700
We're going to be able to
overtake Gaetal.

687
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,554
UHM EUN-GYEONG

688
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,223

00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,493
<i><font color="#80FFFF">More than half of the nation voted</i></font>

694
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:29,496
<i><font color="#80FFFF">"yes" to Bae Gi-chul's execution</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">during the first vote.</i></font>

695
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,415
<i><font color="#80FFFF">After Bae Gi-chul's death,</i></font>

696
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:36,336
<i><font color="#80FFFF">we, SBNS, conducted a poll.</i></font>

697
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,631
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The question was simple.</i></font>

698
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,092
<i><font color="#80FFFF">"Did you participate in the vote?"</i></font>

699
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,181
Honey, come on. Let's eat.

700
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,600
Honey, you don't seem so well these days,

701
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,560
so I made this soup with top-grade meat.

702
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:54,187
Be sure to finish it.

703
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,690
Every last drop.

704
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:00,902
I'll take the kids to school.

705
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,300
Oh, my God!

706
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:25,718
Are you okay?

707
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,638
You can't drive like that!
You nearly killed my kids!

708
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:32,475
Are you okay?

709
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:37,814
How dare you ask me for money?

710
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,524
Am I your wallet?

711
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:41,818
Pease don't hit my brother.

712
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,695
We're sorry.

713
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:48,741
What are you doing? How dare you touch me?

714
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:54,247
It's all because you haven't taught
your sister properly!

715
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:13,600
Let's think positively.

716
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:16,436
The Killing Vote might not happen.
And it might be less than 50%.

717
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,563
Dongbu Agency's support team
is also ready.

718
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,190
Do I need to wear this?

719
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,776
You need to protect yourself from
knives as well, not just guns.

720
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,820
They're criminals after all.

721
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,615
I can't even go back home to save
those scumbags.

722
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,661
We'll take the blame
whether we catch them or miss them.

723
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,915
He has his point.

724
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,543
If someone gets hurt, they'll go nuts
saying we're tax eaters.

725
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:45,256
Local officers are on stand-by
at the local base?

726
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:52,388
Once the vote begins at 10:00
and the target is announced,

727
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:55,183
the Cyber Bureau must identify
and locate the target

728
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,434
and notify everyone.

729
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,354
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The team who's closest to the target</i></font>

730
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,230
<i><font color="#80FFFF">must reach the target within ten minutes.</i></font>

731
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,900
Whoever the target is,

732
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,818
they're just an object
of premeditated murder to us.

733
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:10,573
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'll say it again.</i></font>

734
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,826
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The moment the target is identified,</i></font>

735
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:16,412
<i><font color="#80FFFF">everyone in our unit must rescue</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">the victim at all cost.</i></font>

736
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:33,137
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Cyber, can you locate</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">the victim right away?</i></font>

737
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,600
He got us last time because we weren't
aware. Not happening this time.

738
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:40,061
All telecommunication companies
are cooperating.

739
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,271
So we can get the location
as soon as we have the number.

740
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:44,148
We can also track where the text was sent.

741
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:45,233
Yeah.

742
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:49,529
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It's been two weeks</i></font>

743
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:51,030

...voted "yes" for his execution.

753
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:20,309
People who voted for "yes"
on the second vote is 65.3% higher

754
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:21,728
than the first one.

755
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:25,523
Expectation index for the second vote is
getting higher since 3 p.m..

756
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,650
Keep monitoring the public opinion.

757
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:28,818
Check on this...

758
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,070
Yes, this one. Check this again.

759
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,156
Yes, ma'am.

760
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:46,794
Five...

761
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:51,257
Four, three, two, one!

762
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:03,936
We all got the same text.

763
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,772
THE KILLING VOTE

764
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,940
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Hello, my fellow citizens.</i></font>

765
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,151
You waited for too long, right?

766
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:14,530
Let's begin the second Killing Vote.

767
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,574
If you don't want to participate,

768
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:20,578
you can press the X button
on the top right to waive.

769
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:22,455
You've done it before,

770
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:23,831
so you know it well, right?

771
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:25,583
Then...

772
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,252
let me show you whom we'll be voting for.

773
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,296
Let's take a look.

774
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:34,926
UHM EUN-GYEONG
35 YEARS OLD, FEMALE

775
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,887
INSURANCE MURDER:
RELEASED DUE TO LACK OF EVIDENCE

776
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,473
Ms. Uhm Eun-gyeong.

777
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,351
She's quite something.

778
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,438
Her car crashed into sea while she was
on a trip with her husband.

779
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:50,650
Her husband, who was asleep in the
passenger's seat, died.

780
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,694
But Ms. Uhm, who drove the car,

781
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,988
only had an abrasion.

782
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,658
Wow. What a miracle!

783
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,493
The target is Uhm Eun-gyeong,

784
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,203
born in June 21, 1988.

785
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,580
Her resident registration number is
880621-2367531.

786
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:07,124
Her registered address is in Cheongju.

787
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,168
Her most recent mailing address was Seoul.

788
00:52:09,252 --> 00:52:10,294
Here.

789
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:13,172
This is her purchase history
from home shopping.

790
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:17,134
The address is
251 Seorae-dong, Dongjak-gu, Seoul.

791
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,929
I sending her personal details and address
to the entire unit.

792
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:22,723
251 DONGJAK-GU, SEOUL

793
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,183
Let's go!

794
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:25,810
Request for Uhm's location tracking.

795
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,730
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Her husband used to take sleeping pills.</i></font>

796
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:32,441
<i><font color="#80FFFF">So he couldn't wake up when they</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">got into the accident.</i></font>

797
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:33,734
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Oh, no...</i></font>

798
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:34,986
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But!</i></font>

799
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,196
But after his sudden death,

800
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,116
she received a death benefit
that's worth billions of won.

801
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,409
DEATH BENEFIT: 2.76 BILLION WON

802
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:42,952
Just a year after the subscription.

803
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:46,914
Was she really innocent?

804
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:48,833
No way.

805
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,627
Then we wouldn't be
voting for her execution.

806
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,423
She got married three times

807
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:58,259
and all of her husbands passed away.

808
00:52:58,426 --> 00:53:00,386
The first one was drowned.

809
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,097
The second died from
diabetic complications.

810
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:06,684
And the third by a car accident.

811
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:09,770
<i><font color="#80FFFF">After each of her husband's deaths,</i></font>

812
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,522
<i><font color="#80FFFF">she got two billion in insurance.</i></font>

813
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,692
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Could this be a coincidence?</i></font>

814
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:19,071
<i><font color="#80FFFF">In fact, two years ago,</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">when her third husband died,</i></font>

815
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:23,367
<i><font color="#80FFFF">she was sentenced to life</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">for intentional murder for money,</i></font>

816
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:26,621
<i><font color="#80FFFF">but in the second trial,</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">it was deemed an inevitable accident.</i></font>

817
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,749
<i><font color="#80FFFF">She was acquitted because</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">they failed to prove intentionality.</i></font>

818
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,668
That bastard is fussing today.
He's considering us as mud.

819
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,546
I've located her phone.

820
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,590
She's near her current address.

821
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:39,300
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Then Ms. Uhm even requested interest...</i></font>

822
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,888
<i><font color="#80FFFF">So the amount she received was...</i></font>

823
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,139
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Don't be surprised...</i></font>

824
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:47,183
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Ten billion won!</i></font>

825
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,226
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Ten billion won.</i></font>

826
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,192
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But do you know what she did</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">that makes her deserve to die?</i></font>

827
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:57,985

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Now she's after her fourth husband.</i></font>

831
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:09,413

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Is she really a human being?</i></font>

833
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:15,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
the judiciary of the Republic of Korea

834
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:19,382
released this devil
who was deemed innocent

835
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:22,176
to live among us!

836
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:28,808
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Hoping to throw out the garbage</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">that should not be forgiven,</i></font>

<i><font color="#80FFFF">I will leave the judgment</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">of Uhm Eun-gyeong to you.</i></font>

838
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:41,153
Do you vote "yes" to executing
Uhm Eun-gyeong or "no"?

839
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:42,571
Please vote without hesitating.

840
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:45,783
Did you find him?

841
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:47,618
- Everyone, fan out.
- Ju-cheol.

842
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:48,911
- Yoon-ji, the alley.
- Yes, sir.

843
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,295
You two.

844
00:54:58,379 --> 00:54:59,839
- Go up.
- Yes, sir.

845
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,174
- Go find her.
- Yes, sir.

846
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:03,300
- Look carefully.
- Yes, sir.

847
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,078
I found her!

848
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:32,788
Please calm down. We're police.

850
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:42,965
We found her.

851
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,140
No! Don't open it!

852
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,808
Wait. Don't touch the car.

853
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,435
The car's going to explode if it moves.

854
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:19,210
It's okay. It's not linked to the door.

855
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:31,847
Please help me.

856
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:33,682
I'm scared. Get me out of here.

857
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,560
Calm down. And keep it together.

858
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,566
UHM EUN-GYEONG KILLED HUSBANDS
FOR DEATH BENEFIT

859
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:48,072
Look.

860
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,865
- It's a bomb.
- Let's see.

861
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,955
That damn bastard.

862
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,082
Call the Special Forces
and ask for a bomb squad.

863
00:56:58,165 --> 00:56:59,834
Yes, sir. Yoon-ji, the Special Forces.

864
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:00,960
Any military units?

865
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:02,211
Or Corps of Engineers?

866
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:03,879
- Joo Hyun.
- Yes, go ahead.

867
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,589
Uhm Eun-gyeong's phone is busy.

868
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:07,258
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I think he's listening.</i></font>

869
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,717
I'll track it right away.

870
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:11,720
No video is broadcasted from the car.

871
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:14,598
Only the phone is turned on,
so you can move freely.

872
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:16,183
I sent you the photo of the bomb.

873
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,272
It's a homemade bomb.
I'll find out how to defuse it.

874
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,315
Ask her how it was when he installed it.

875
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:34,034
IS THE CULPRIT INSTRUCTING YOU?

876
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:46,630
Any blackmail?

877
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:48,549
Like he'll kill you if you do anything.

878
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:50,926
What kind of bomb is it?

879
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,470
Will it explode? Or suffocate you?

880
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:55,264
I don't know.

881
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:56,599
I don't know.

882
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:58,851
I don't...

883
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,854
Kim. You need to see this.

884
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,565
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I just got some death benefit...</i></font>

885
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:08,611
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It's true.</i></font>

886
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,532
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Yes.</i></font>

887
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:16,952
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I killed them.</i></font>

888
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,288
<i><font color="#80FFFF">So what?</i></font>

889
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:20,998
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I was acquitted.</i></font>

890
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,418
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Don't you know about double jeopardy?</i></font>

891
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:32,218
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'm bleeding too much!</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'm actually dying here!</i></font>

892
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:35,346
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You said you'd let me live</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">if I told you everything.</i></font>

893
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:36,472
She will be executed.

894
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:45,105
It can't go off near these houses.

895
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,899
- Close off the area.
- Okay.

896
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,903
Find an area that we can
get to within ten minutes.

897
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:53,280
A river or an empty lot
that can minimize the damage.

898
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:55,115
Does anyone know one?

899
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,200
Within ten minutes.

900
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,910
Anyone who knows this area well?

901
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:02,039
THE KILLING VOTE
YES: 44%, NO: 7%

902
00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:12,007
Damn it! It's driving me nuts!

903
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:13,801
There're only houses and academies.

904
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,553
Hey, any idea? It's near your house.

905
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:20,474
Do you know a place?

906
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:21,684
I...

907
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:23,519
Did you find it?

908
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:26,397
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Hey, Joo Hyun!</i></font>

909
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:28,274
Seorae High Schoolyard.

910
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:30,025
It's about 10 minutes away.

911
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:32,528
Are you crazy? It's Min's school!

912
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:34,989
Are you sure?

913
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,740
It's my sister's school,
so I know it well.

914
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:38,534
The schoolyard was recently expanded.

915
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:40,911
Shopping and residential areas are
distant from it.

916
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:43,664
Independent study hour is over
and there shouldn't be many left.

917
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,165
I'll check and evacuate them.

918
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,005
We'll move the bomb to Seorae High.

919
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,339
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Everyone to Seorae High.</i></font>

920
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,049
Be sure the school is empty.

921
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:56,385
You heard that? Get moving.
To Seorae High!

922
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,845
We'll head over to Seorae High.

923
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,432
- Joo Hyun.
- Yes?

924
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:03,892
Let Jo-dan take over

925
01:00:03,976 --> 01:00:05,728
and go help out at Seorae High.

926
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:17,990
Let's go.

927
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:21,493
What if it goes off?

928
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:25,289
I can't do it. I can't!

929
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:26,415
Get a grip.

930
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:28,834
You want to live, right?

931
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:33,047
It's not wired to the car.
Turning on the engine is safe.

932
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:34,548
So step on it.

933
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,301
Step on it!

934
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,143
Get it out of the way.

935
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,353
Get it out of the way.

936
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,776
That lunatic. We are off too.

937
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:05,371
29 MINUTES

938
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,923
Hurry and go.

939
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:20,636
Thank you.

940
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:36,151
Mr. Kim.

941
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:38,695
Turn right at the intersection
that's 500m ahead of you.

942
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,450
Did you block the roads near the school?

943
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:45,160
Yes, we started to block them,

944
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:46,370
but the traffic is heavy.

945
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,288
Hurry. We must get there first.

946
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:49,581
- Step on it.
- Yes, sir.

947
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,424
Wow. This woman is evil.

948
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,384
How was she acquitted?

949
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,886
Shouldn't it be 100% "yes"?

950
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,305
So, I'm totally for it.

951
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,437
They're going to lock the gate soon.
Let's go.

952
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,355
I'm having fun here. Why?

953
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:15,065
Yes. Let's stay a little longer.

954
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:17,734
My mom won't let me watch this at home.

955
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,372
<i><font color="#80FFFF">This is an emergency announcement.</i></font>

960
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:39,089
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- This is an emergency.</i></font>
- What's going on?

961
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:43,802
Let's go.

01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:51,602
SPECIAL OPERATIONS UNIT

963
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:20,672

Come on!

968
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:02,673
Mr. Kim will be here soon.

969
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:03,799
- Make way for him.
- Okay.

970
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:06,051
And make sure the school is empty.

971
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,427
- Okay? Move it.
- Yes, sir.

972
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:08,845
- Make way.
- Yes, sir.

973
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:13,684
- Get moving.
- Go, go.

974
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,937
What's going on here?
Are they shooting a movie?

975
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,149
Hurry!

976
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:25,028
Hurry up and come out of there!

977
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:26,280
Hurry up. Go.

978
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:42,170
Wow. Look at this.

979
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:44,840
They are all the way down to there.

980
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:46,383
Hurry up.

981
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:51,430
Please wait here, sir.

982
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:54,266
You can't go in.

983
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:55,517
- I'm a cop.
- I see.

984
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:01,607
This is unbelievable. Is this for real?

Hurry up! Run!

988
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,667

01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:22,169

Joo Min!

994
01:05:43,023 --> 01:05:44,107
Excuse me.

998
01:05:56,495 --> 01:05:57,663
Hyun.

999
01:05:58,372 --> 01:05:59,790
Why didn't you answer your phone?

1000
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:00,916
You didn't either.

1001
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:02,918
Is something going on here?

1002
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:04,920
I've never seen the police
come to our school.

1003
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:06,046
Hurry up. Come.

1004
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:16,223
Step on it. Do it!

1005
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,475
- I can't.
- Get yourself together.

1006
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,227
We need to get there fast
if you want to live.

1007
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:28,694
There's no time to explain. Go home.

1008
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:31,530
Even if you hear any news,
don't come near here, okay?

1009
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:33,031
What is it? You're scaring me.

1010
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:34,116
Come with me, then.

1011
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,993
Don't you know who I am?
Don't worry about me and go.

1012
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:39,287
Please drive her home safely, sir.

1013
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:41,039
Hyun.

1014
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:44,334
Seriously!

1015
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:46,086
Darn it.

1 MINUTE
2 MINUTES

01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:55,971
Are you okay?

1019
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,431
Don't stop and keep going. Go.

1020
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,021
Step on it!

1021
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,369
What was that?

1022
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,413
Hyun...

1023
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:37,971
Step on it! Come on!

1024
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,804
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Kim, are you here?</i></font>

1025
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:20,555
Good. Get out of the car now.

1026
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:22,516
- Hurry.
- Mr. Kim.

1027
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,392
Don't let anyone come near the car.

1028
01:08:25,811 --> 01:08:26,937
Be prepared for an explosion.

1029
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,481
Stay close to the wall!

1030
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:32,859
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

1031
01:08:32,943 --> 01:08:34,152
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Get out of the car!</i></font>

1032
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,363
I will stay in here.

1033
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,284
Damn it.

1034
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:45,914
UHM EUN-GYEONG KILLED HUSBANDS
FOR DEATH BENEFIT

1035
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:48,208
What? What's wrong with the timer?

1036
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:51,127
I really could die in here.

1037
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:55,173
Do something, will you? Do something!

1038
01:08:57,676 --> 01:09:00,053
Hey, you. I know you're listening.

1039
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,137
BLOCKED NUMBER

1040
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:02,931
If she is guilty just as you claimed,

1041
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:04,850
we can put her on trial again.

1042
01:09:06,393 --> 01:09:07,978
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Put her on trial again?</i></font>

1043
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:11,523
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You think that's possible?</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">In the Republic of Korea?</i></font>

1044
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:12,607
It is possible.

1045
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,568
I can make it possible.

1046
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:22,033
You want to seek justice, right?

1047
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,286
Didn't you tell the people to trust you?

1048
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:26,872
But if I die in here along with her,

1049
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:28,164
what would they say then?

1050
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,334
Think about it.

1051
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,712
I will not take one step out of this car

1052
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,423
and I will not go alone.

1053
01:09:46,308 --> 01:09:47,309
So...

1054
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,443
Stop the bomb, you bastard!

1055
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:07,889
<i><font color="#80FFFF">There's a rumor</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">that Kim Mu-chan's deceased.</i></font>

1056
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:10,266
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Do you still think Gaetal is right?</i></font>

1057
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,352
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I told you he's a lunatic</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">from the beginning.</i></font>

1058
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,980
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Maybe we can find where this is.</i></font>

1059
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,357
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You've been there.</i></font>

1060
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,650
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Something's off.</i></font>

1061
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,610
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Then what's making it wrong?</i></font>

1062
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:23,530
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Though our justice is rational.</i></font>

1063
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,323
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Wake up.</i></font>

1064
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:27,033
That bastard is a criminal.
