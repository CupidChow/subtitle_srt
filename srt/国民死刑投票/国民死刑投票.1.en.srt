1
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,227
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:01,353
SAFETY OF CHILD ACTORS WAS ENSURED

3
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:11,447
8 YEARS AGO

4
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,324
Kwon Seok-joo!

5
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,602
Kwon Seok-joo!

6
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:26,999
Stop!

7
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,394
{\an8}What are you doing?
My eyes! Manager's lost his touch.

8
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,148
{\an8}lol just quit it

9
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,316
{\an8}You're out
Boring

10
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,443
{\an8}Hey.

11
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,695
{\an8}What's the point of this?

12
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,114
{\an8}It doesn't bring in more profit.

13
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,241
{\an8}How many stars did you get this month?

14
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,785
{\an8}How many?

15
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,036
{\an8}I got plenty.

16
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,830
{\an8}How will you buy a building at this rate?

17
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,123
{\an8}I'll do my best.

18
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,749
{\an8}Do well, not your best.

19
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,255
{\an8}So awkward
Are you a wooden toy? Get out

20
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,631
{\an8}Hey.

21
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,718
{\an8}You... Shake more. More.

22
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,386
{\an8}<i>We're losing our viewers.</i>

23
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,516
{\an8}Didn't you say she's a famous clubber?

24
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,893
{\an8}<i>Should we pause and beat her up?</i>

25
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,856
{\an8}Finally?
More, more!

26
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,816
{\an8}<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

27
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,819
{\an8}<i>If you don't do it right,</i>
<i>you'll go live with us. Okay?</i>

28
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,621
{\an8}<i>It's my first time,</i>
<i>but I already have so many fans.</i>

29
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,040
{\an8}<i>Where am I?</i>

30
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,292
{\an8}<i>It's my office, not home.</i>

31
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:38,422
{\an8}I may not look like it, but I live
in a skyscraper with a great view.

32
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,719
{\an8}A high-end skyscraper
with a brand-name coffee shop.

33
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,432
{\an8}Oh, my! Sinu79, thanks for the stars.

34
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:07,076
I love your outfit. How much?

35
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,587
{\an8}This outfit? It cost 20,000 won.

36
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,465
{\an8}I bought it at a really famous
underground shopping mall.

37
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,843
{\an8}The underground shopping center
at Kukje Building.

38
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,055
{\an8}I'm kidding.

39
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,276
Come on. We don't have a warrant yet.

40
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,737
We just need to find
where they're filming.

41
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,240
Don't you trust me?

42
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,083
KUKJE BUILDING

43
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,796
Don't worry and let's find them
before they finish it.

44
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,381
The streaming will end soon.

45
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,676
Hello? Sir.

46
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,094
Hey, Kim Mu-chan!

47
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,514
- Hey, step on it.
- Yes, sir.

48
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,019
<i>Hey, just get her out of there. Damn it.</i>

49
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,146
{\an8}<i>Just you wait.</i>

50
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,398
{\an8}<i>I'll strip her down.</i>

51
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,204
{\an8}Do you know what a tease is?

52
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,249
{\an8}Should I take it off or not?
Strip down or not?

53
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,625
{\an8}Should I do it or not? Yes or no?

54
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,169
{\an8}<i>But I won't.</i>

55
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,628
{\an8}Hey, get back inside.

56
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,422
I'll go beat her up.

57
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,676
Just you wait. I'll strip you down.

58
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,887
{\an8}- Hey.
- Don't.

59
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,471
- All right.
- Take it off.

60
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,057
- Take it off. Now.
- I will!

61
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,645
What the hell...

62
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,480
He's here.

63
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,483
Who are you?

64
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,277
You little...

65
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,571
son of a bitch!

66
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,202
Come here!

67
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,965
{\an8}What a surprise. The police are here.

68
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,432
{\an8}All of you watching this...

69
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,352
{\an8}Especially Sinu79 who insulted my family.
You bastard...

70
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,520
{\an8}I'll track your IP address now.
Be prepared.

71
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,693
You bastard!

72
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,378
Get out. Get out of here.

73
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,469
Get out of here. Get out.

74
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,520
Get out. Hurry.

75
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,452
I thought you were not coming.

76
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,003
There you go.

77
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,088
KIM JO-DAN

78
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:55,929
Jo-dan, track the location of my phone
and trace the redirected multiple IPs.

79
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,347
The video records too.

80
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,434
There!

81
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,896
- Did you see their boss?
- What? Well...

82
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,149
There was another room over there.

83
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,552
Come on!

84
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,430
Sir.

85
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,768
Did you get all their IPs?

86
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,478
What?

87
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,563
I gave you the access earlier.

88
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,149
Are you Violent Crimes
or garbage collectors?

89
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,944
What kind of team makes
their team leader do all the work

90
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,154
and takes the credit after coming so late?

91
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,824
You shouldn't do this without a warrant.

92
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,535
Right, they don't seem like
just ordinary slave streamers.

93
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,953
They got things in the rooms.

94
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,996
What? Again?

95
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:46,665
What?

96
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,500
Excuse me.

97
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,168
Hey!

98
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,797
Excuse me.

99
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,133
What do you think you're doing?

100
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,637
You planted evidence earlier, didn't you?

101
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,015
{\an8}I heard that your specialties were
ignoring procedures, making threats,

102
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,976
assaulting, and fabricating cases.

103
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,727
All those rumors were true.

104
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,229
Do whatever you want.

105
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,023
I caught them.

106
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:13,859
And I saved the girls.

107
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,445
That's all that matters.

108
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,241
Hey.

109
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,618
I heard rumors about you too.

110
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,079
Joo Hyun of SMPA Cyber Bureau.

111
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,164
Main specialty.

112
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,749
Whistleblowing.

113
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,712
That crazy bastard.

114
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,924
Oh, right. Give me back my phone.

115
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,760
Give it back!

116
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,014
Hey!

117
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,434
Wait. Open the door.

118
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:48,852
Come on!

119
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,565
He is just unbelievable.

120
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,650
Damn it.

121
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,242
I don't know what I did wrong.

122
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,036
I discovered talented girls

123
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,623
and helped them achieve their dreams.
I should be awarded.

124
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,334
Why am I being treated like this?

125
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,753
"Treated like this?"

126
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,133
I guess you haven't heard
how I really treat people in here.

127
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,426
All right. Fine.

128
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,387
Let's say there was
some business negligence.

129
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,556
I'll pay a fine

130
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,767
and maybe get suspended for six months.

131
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,019
I'll accept that much.

132
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,646
But you...

133
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,399
You turned my office upside down
without a warrant

134
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,944
and caused damage to my business.

135
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,737
I won't let that slide.

136
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,948
I have a lawyer too, you know.

137
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,326
You know Yoon Kang-hee?

138
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,623
I've never seen her.

139
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,336
She was your popular streamer
up until three months ago.

140
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,465
<i>Right? The weather is so nice these days.</i>

141
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,342
<i>It's gotten cooler,</i>

142
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,179
<i>so we can go on an outing</i>
<i>or go for a drive.</i>

143
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,724
<i>When you go for a drive in the fall,</i>
<i>what kind of...</i>

144
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:14,271
I mean, so many girls come and go.

145
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,356
I can't remember all of them.

146
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,859
I can't even recognize them
once their makeup is removed.

147
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:24,656
All right, fine.
She might seem familiar or not.

148
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,283
I see.

149
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,578
She was found dead in some mountain
in Woomyeon-dong four days ago.

150
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,080
The place where she last called her family

151
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,083
was your office.

152
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,501
Oh, right.

153
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,422
We found a bunch of her DNA in your room.

154
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,424
That's ridiculous.

155
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,800
She never came into my room.

156
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,393
If it wasn't that room,

157
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,186
where did you kill her?

158
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,816
Look.

159
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,860
I really...

160
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,863
Fifteen years for prostitution,
kidnapping, murder and corpse abandonment.

161
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:08,033
If you confess now,
I'll take out prostitution.

162
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,618
Damn you.

163
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,952
Stop bullshitting me.

164
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:15,790
Anybody out there?

165
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,046
What the hell?

166
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,505
Over here.

167
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,761
No?

168
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,597
Then I'll add assaulting an officer.

169
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,564
I'll ask again.

170
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:44,027
You better tell me everything in detail
from now on, okay?

171
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,371
Fuck!

172
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,290
You should go see a doctor.

173
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,417
No need. I've done this plenty of times.

174
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:04,005
Exactly. You've done it plenty of times.
Take care of yourself.

175
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,257
You'll wear down your face.

176
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,176
Just wrap this up well.

177
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,887
If he cuts loose and goes off the grid,
we'll get in trouble.

178
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,598
Hey, Kim.

179
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,559
That wacko.

180
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,145
NATIONAL OFFICE OF INVESTIGATION

181
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,065
I sent you out as support, but you didn't
report and ignored my calls?

182
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,318
After blowing the whistle,
you don't respect me as your team leader?

183
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,987
If you feel wronged,
hold a press conference like before!

184
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,073
Were we enemies in our past lives?

185
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,991
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

186
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,911
You're driving me crazy.

187
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,454
Damn it.

188
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,126
Since it's hot...

189
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,046
Why did he have to call
when I didn't have my phone?

190
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,131
I'm shit out of luck.

191
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,217
The ending of a traitor
can't be beautiful, right?

192
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,593
- Hey.
- Speaking of which,

193
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,722
always remember. Only I, Kim Jo-dan,
stayed by your side two years ago.

194
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:54,973
Oh, right.

195
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,727
Why would the Nambu Police Agency
send your phone over?

196
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,525
He deleted everything.

197
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,360
That damn Kim Mu-chan...

198
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,489
What is Kim Mu-chan
at the Nambu Police Agency like?

199
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,951
From my experience,
the rumors about him weren't far off.

200
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,454
Kim Mu-chan, the official SOB
of the Nambu Police Agency.

201
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,747
AKA Wipeout.

202
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,375
Pressuring criminals to admit more crimes.
Making a case bigger to take more credit.

203
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,252
He somehow makes cases into special ones.

204
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,713
That's how he made his way up to Seoul
from the south.

205
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,882
The master of promotions.
Shall I continue?

206
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,676
Just the intro is annoying enough.

207
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,471
This crappy world where only SOBs succeed.

208
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,638
Wait.

209
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,974
We can't really say he's successful.

210
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,058
To be precise,

211
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,020
he's the unofficial clean-up crew
of the National Police Agency.

212
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,939
Based on his arrest rate,
he should be at the top,

213
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,483
but those up there must hate him.

214
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,444
His team always goes in
when something goes wrong.

215
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,613
He's always the scapegoat.

216
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,407
Even at this moment.

217
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,660
{\an8}<i>There is a strong protest against</i>
<i>release of...</i>

218
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,745
{\an8}PROTEST AGAINST BAE'S RELEASE

219
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,080
{\an8}<i>...Bae who was charged with</i>
<i>distributing CSE videos.</i>

220
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,833
<i>Condemnation on</i>
<i>the judicial branch is getting</i>

221
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,627
<i>stronger for the light penalty.</i>

222
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,671
<i>This protest is for Bae Gi-chul's remand.</i>

223
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,508
<i>The public is extremely angry</i>

224
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:15,094
{\an8}<i>about him being released after serving</i>
<i>just for a year and half</i>

225
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,680
{\an8}<i>despite selling over 200,000 videos.</i>

226
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,144
Oh, my gosh.

227
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,564
Thank you for your effort.

228
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,442
Remand Bae Gi-chul!

229
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,695
I've never been this glad to see cops!

230
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,449
Love how cops are escorting me.

231
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,953
Korea's a good country to live in.

232
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,830
It almost feels like a developed country.

233
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,962
I've done nothing wrong,

234
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,589
but I'm getting so many threatening
letters and comments.

235
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,967
Do your work and arrest them.

236
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:55,885
Gi-chul...

237
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,011
Bae.

238
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,973
We didn't come here to do you good.

239
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,808
We'll carry the can if you get stabbed

240
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,185
or beaten to death out there.
We're here to avoid that.

241
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,895
So...

242
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,480
behave yourself out there.

243
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,819
You'll be in a big trouble
if you fall down.

244
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,487
So be careful.

245
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,285
There he is!

246
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,292
Step back!

247
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,752
Step aside, please!

248
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,131
{\an8}Damn it!

249
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,217
Open the way, please!

250
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,553
Please, step aside!

251
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,389
Damn it!

252
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,769
- Get him in there.
- Please, step back!

253
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:47,896
Fucking poor bastards!

254
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,314
What did you just say?

255
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,274
What have I done wrong?

256
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,067
Come here. What?

257
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,485
Look! Korean police is busy

258
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,446
beating up their citizen

259
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,822
to protect the criminal!

260
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,241
I'm speechless! Arrest them too!

261
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,492
Come here, you bastard!

262
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,705
Oh, no! Stop!

263
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,082
Get on you fucking feet!

264
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,127
Fuck!

265
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:16,841
Please stop!

266
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:17,926
Hey!

267
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,305
What the hell!

268
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:23,890
Step back!

269
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,142
God damn it!

270
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,770
Hey! Where are you going?

271
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,772
Say that one more time!

272
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:31,940
Let's get going!

273
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,488
That son of a bitch!

274
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,956
He's so noisy even on the day of release.

275
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,291
We should've fucked him up back then.

276
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,543
He's a lucky bastard.

277
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,505
He's alive thanks to Professor.

278
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,215
He's out there because of him.

279
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,728
I really appreciate what you've done
for me Professor Kwon.

280
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,480
Hello, Professor!

281
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,649
- Hello, sir.
- He's here.

282
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,915
Fuck!

283
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,083
Do your job!

284
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,960
You couldn't even protect me.

285
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:37,547
All that taxpayer money
to turn my face into this?

286
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,798
You pigs...

287
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,718
- are just tax eaters.
- You little...

288
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,556
Watch your mouth.

289
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,850
One more word, this car's going

290
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,935
straight into the river
and we'll go to hell together.

291
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,673
Feels like you're one of our kind.

292
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,216
Come work for me if you quit.

293
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,400
Hey.

294
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,111
What the hell?

295
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,201
You bastard!

296
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,042
You...

297
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,213
Get in the car! Hurry!

298
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,297
Get in the car.

299
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,007
His lawyer is...

300
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,884
a former Supreme Court Justice.

301
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,387
He said he did lots of self-reflection

302
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,139
and he'll never do such
dirty things again.

303
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:12,517
Old habits die hard.

304
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,111
That fucking lunatic!

305
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,704
It's cold. Close the window.

306
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:34,789
Okay.

307
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,290
Please be patient.

308
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:37,917
You'll never see him again.

309
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,043
What did you just say?

310
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:42,130
Am I paying you all that money
just so I can be patient?

311
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,802
You brought it, right?

312
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,807
External hard drive.

313
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,310
Hard drive!

314
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:01,149
Yes! This!

315
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,532
I told you to get one who speaks Korean

316
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,285
for god's sake.

317
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,620
Is everything set?

318
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:17,415
I've got the server and office ready
more than a month ago.

319
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,958
As long as the product's fine,

320
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,502
- it's a piece of cake.
- Yeah?

321
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:23,963
Let's start today.

322
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,478
ANALYTICAL MATHEMATICS

323
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,609
Hey, Hyun.

324
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,403
All right. I'll be there.

325
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,156
- You're going with your sister again?
- What about the Internet cafe?

326
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,616
Next time. I'll carry for you.

327
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,118
- Bye.
- There she goes again. Get home safe.

328
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,328
Okay.

329
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,182
{\an8}TEN MINUTES

330
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,976
{\an8}She's late.

331
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,520
{\an8}- Hurry up. Come on.
- You can check the item first.

332
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,827
{\an8}THREE MINUTES

333
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,454
She's here.

334
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,171
Are you all right?

335
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,259
I'm sorry. Is that cup okay?

336
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,803
Wait...

337
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:56,514
Hyun.

338
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,516
Hey, Min.

339
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,686
Sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

340
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,853
I could've gone by myself,

341
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,231
but you insisted on coming,
and you're late?

342
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,401
You'll be a senior in high school soon.

343
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:11,279
I'm the head of the family,
so I wanted to get you home comfortably.

344
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,572
I like that attitude.

345
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:14,657
I'm impressed, sis.

346
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,826
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

347
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:21,497
<i>To be honest, I don't even want to</i>
<i>try to understand.</i>

348
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,668
<i>The number of CSE videos that</i>
<i>Bae Gi-chul's spread are 200,000.</i>

349
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,546
<i>But he was only imprisoned</i>
<i>for a year and half.</i>

350
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:29,839
PROTECT BAE'S RIGHTS? WHY?

351
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,757
<i>It'd been at least 20 years</i>
<i>in other countries....</i>

352
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,759
- Reporter Do-hee.
- ...<i>or even a death penalty.</i>

353
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,429
You're beautiful as always.

354
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:39,307
<i>I'm an advocate of human rights</i>

355
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,600
<i>and I value indicator's rights as well.</i>

356
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:42,768
She's so cool.

357
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,355

359
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,486
<i>He didn't care at all about</i>
<i>victim's rights.</i>

360
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,989
Hey, Min. I'm hungry.
Should we order some <i>tteokbokki</i>?

361
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,950
- Move.
- .<i>..we can't afford a precedent...</i>

362
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,412
- Get out of the way.
- Look at me.

363
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,623
- Oh, come on.
- Let's watch a drama.

364
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,459
There's a drama that I want to watch.

365
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:07,585
Come on!

366
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:11,047
Oh, right. Your computer
broke down, right? I'll fix it.

367
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,923
Finally. I told you a long time ago.

368
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:16,218
I'll turn it into a new one.
Just wait and see.

369
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,928
Whatever.

370
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,680
Give it back.

371
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,349
I really have to watch it.

372
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:22,892
- Give it back.
- I must watch it.

373
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,352
I must.

374
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,062
- Come on!
- Give it back!

375
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,521
No way!

376
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:28,731
You're so strong.

377
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,191
Give it back.

378
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:32,818
- Give it back.
- No way!

379
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:35,780
<i>I want to ask the police</i>
<i>that were on-screen.</i>

380
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,823
Are you a puppet doing whatever
you're told?

381
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,201
You can see the ethical standards

382
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,119

383
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,996

384
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,791
Don't be a puppet.

385
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,210
- Nice!
- I like that!

386
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:51,754
You know.

387
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,673
Rationality, moral sense and mothers

388
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,092

389
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,343
There you go!

390
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,597
It seems...

391
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,975
everyone's a bit stirred up.
Let's calm down a little bit.

392
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,811

00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,577
You didn't need to compete for your
nomination,

397
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,162
but running for presidency is...

398
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:29,250
I'm worried the investigative hearings
will end up just hurting you.

399
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,129
Hey.

00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,842

- Did you fix it?
- Hey.

419
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,958
It's infected with malware,
so it's a zombie computer now.

420
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,210
You should've let
the antivirus program run.

421
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,964
Why do you keep facing it down?

422
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,174
Are you embarrassed?

423
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,514
You saved our family.

424
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:52,184
Even if it's just once,
I wish Mom and Dad had seen it.

425
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,692
So can it be fixed today?

426
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,068
I need to do my homework.

427
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,570
I'm working on it. Just wait.

428
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:06,991
First, let me see who's behind this.

429
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:29,555
This collection is awesome!

430
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,766
Hey. You're sure
they won't cause trouble, right?

431
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,978
Their parents either died or forgot them.

432
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,648
I only put together the kids
that no one has claimed for over a year.

433
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:41,609
Nice.

434
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,988
Three, eight, ten.

435
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,657
Fourteen, twenty-one, twenty-two.

436
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:53,162
But is it okay to start this
right after you got out of jail?

437
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,705
I'm so worried.

438
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:55,831
You wuss.

439
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,917
Do you know what's the problem
with the Korean police?

440
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,377
They lack creativity.

441
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,838
We'll hit them when they least expect it.

442
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:12,222
Our regulars who reek of money
are waiting. We can't wait.

443
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:17,019
I got to say, you are so fucking clever.

444
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,648
Getting married in jail was a great move.

445
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:23,567
That foreign bitch is useless now.

446
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:24,818
Let's get our money back.

447
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,571
Get her on a boat
or ship her off to an island.

448
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:30,991
Your sentence was reduced
because she begged with tears in court.

449
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,703
No trails back to me.
That's the most important thing.

450
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,499
- You know that, right?
- Okay.

451
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,340
Forty-four, forty-five.

452
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:54,890
Please go.

453
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,141
My husband will come soon.

454
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,770
There are pictures and videos of children
that the police never found.

455
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:03,023
The victims still fear that
Bae Gi-chul might sell them again.

456
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:07,653
Get that hard drive out and testify.

457
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,656
Then I'll help you settle down in Korea.

458
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:19,832
You think he'll keep his promise?

459
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,877
If you keep your mouth shut like this,
you're his accomplice.

460
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:30,884
Think it over.

461
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:41,395
Hey.

462
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,604
Damn it!

463
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,233
If I seem drunk,
you should come and help me walk.

464
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,861
Help me walk!

465
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,321
Those damn bastards.
I told them to find someone

466
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:54,283
who's quick-witted
even if she can't speak Korean.

467
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,160
You're useless.

468
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,786
Hey, get up.

469
00:33:58,412 --> 00:33:59,705
Get up!

470
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,792
I will teach you a lesson tonight.

471
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:07,296
After all I've been through,
how could you treat me like this?

472
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,643
You need a good beating. Come here.

473
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,604

474
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,440
What?

475
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,608
Who the hell are you?

476
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,861
You bastard!

477
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:40,078
You bastard. Wait...

478
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,713
Let go of me, you bastard!

479
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:10,609
Why is this text file so big?

480
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:12,820
TEXT FILE

481
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,238

00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,072

- Min's computer became a zombie.

533
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,507
I have way too much work.

534
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:24,052
By the way, what's up with that mask?

535
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:25,721
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

536
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,139
He's no average Joe.

537
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,890
Or Jane.

538
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,101
- What are you up to?
- Holy shit!

539
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,270
"Let's work hard as usual."
I was telling her.

540
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:34,980
- I see.
- Yes, sir.

541
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,606
Keep it up!

542
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,324
It seems fishy, right?

543
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:48,785
Yes, you're right.

544
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,787
I can smell it.

545
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:51,913
Totally.

546
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,123
Right?

547
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:56,668
So I started to track down the IP.
And it's not in our database.

548
00:38:56,752 --> 00:39:00,505
I can smell you being nosy again.

549
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:01,590
It reeks.

550
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,926
Is it your first time
seeing attention seekers like him?

551
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,013
They call themselves a pirate
or say they'll join IS.

552
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,766
The Internet forums are filled
with people like him.

553
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,517
Don't be a fool who falls for them

554
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:14,811
and just do what you're told to do.

555
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,897
But you don't assign me real work.

556
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,232
You stop me
when I try to look for work by myself.

557
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:22,778
All I do is help Violent Crimes by
acting as a nurse or going on blind dates.

558
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,863
Two days ago, I danced all day, you know?

559
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:28,825
I'm starting to wonder if I'm a cop
or a part-time service provider.

560
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:32,704
Hey. Did I order you
to become a whistleblower?

561
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:37,292
You were an outcast even before I joined
this team. Don't blame me.

562
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:38,752
That's wrong.

563
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,129
Then order someone else to look into this.

564
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,757
I really think he'll cause trouble soon.

565
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,760
I'm hearing the sound
of a bird chirping somewhere.

566
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:47,844
Is it otolithiasis?

567
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:54,142
<i>Chirp, chirp</i>

568
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,480
Darn it! That nutjob is driving me crazy.

569
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,899
Get off the server
while I'm telling you nicely.

570
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,985
<i>Chief wants you to give the IP and videos</i>

571
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,612

572
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,447

573
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,411
You're driving me nuts.

574
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,956
You've got some nerve, huh?

575
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,291
You did this to me last night.

576
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:19,876
In front of my house.

577
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,670
I'm not a thug who'd chase you

578
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,463
to your house to beat you up.

579
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:26,591
I saw you in the same outfit as
what you wore yesterday.

580
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,385
Hey.

581
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:29,761
Bring me your higher-up.

582
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,805
I want your commissioner here!

583
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,309
Do you have evidence?

584
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:37,769
CCTV?

585
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,396
Evidence?

586
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:42,691
My eyes are the evidence!

587
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,943
Fuck off, bastards!

588
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,903
Hey! Let go of me!

589
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:48,280
I'm speechless.

590
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,492
Hey, step aside! Come over here! Hey!

591
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,077
- Come here.
- Get lost!

592
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:55,495
Hey! Come here!

593
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,955
Get out of here.

00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,538
Bye.

608
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:05,894
What's this?

609
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:20,200
Hey, Kim.

610
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,786
<i>Bae Gi-chul. Can you locate him?</i>

611
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:25,163
Bae Gi-chul? Okay.

612
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:28,375
My noodles... Damn it.
Locate him for what?

613
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,502

616
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,389
She wants to give

618
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,394
Okay.

The Killing Vote

630

It's strange that all of us received

- It's no ordinary text.
- It could be an opinion poll.

00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,752
Calm down. Just because we vote
doesn't mean he'll actually be killed.

What if they really execute you?

654
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,436
Hey, did I rape the kids or kill them?

655
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:57,357
I just created an opportunity

656

Why are these dimwits only blaming me?

657

Damn it.

658
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,655
I almost died last night
because of some crazy bastard.

659
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,615
What are the cops even doing?

660
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:11,287

00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:15,833

It's all set up to welcome the guests.

695
00:50:17,265 --> 00:50:19,308
It's a relief that he's dead.

696
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:22,145
Watch your mouth. This is a homicide.

697
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,063
Sure.

698
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:26,023
Since we're the police,

699
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:29,277
we must catch the killer
even if the victim deserved to die.

700
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:31,654
Get his call records.

701
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:34,073
Sang-jae, check for cameras.
Yoon-ji, track down the bills.

702
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:36,909
It'll be tough because they aren't checks.

703
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:37,994
Yes, sir.

704
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,290
We got what we need.

705
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,709
Just hand the computer over
to the Cyber Bureau.

706
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,294
The crime scene is too clean.

707
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,045
Fingerprints and footprints...

708
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:51,132
Only Bae Gi-chul's
and the first responders' were found.

709
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:54,510
This is a redevelopment zone,
so many construction vehicles drove by.

710
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:56,387
It'll be hard to specify the car.

711
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:59,098
I'll do a thorough medical exam,
but don't get your hopes up.

712
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:02,852
There was that Killing Vote text.
Did you find anything on his business?

713
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,605
Seeing that he set this place up,

714
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,774
there must be something more.

715
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:09,734
Maybe there's more on the computer.

716
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,989
Bae Gi-chul, who was released
amidst controversy,

717
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,866
was found murdered this morning.

718
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,242
It is just as it was stated

719
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:21,412
in the bizarre "The Killing Vote" text
that was sent nationwide.

720
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:22,663
It hasn't been found yet

721
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:25,583
whether the sender of the text
and the killer are the same person.

722
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,423
How was he murdered?

723
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:33,508
What's the cause of death?

724
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:35,843
Is this related to The Killing Vote text?

725
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:37,345
Is the suspect identified?

726
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:38,429
Superintendent Kim.

727
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:40,139
Do you see it as a revenge murder?

728
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:41,599
Step aside.

729
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:44,060
- What's exactly...
- A word please!

730
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,394
Get out of the way!

731
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,521
Please tell us.

732
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:50,900
THE KILLING VOTE

733
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,026
<i>Hello, my fellow citizens.</i>

734
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:56,781
<i>First of all, this video</i>

735
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,367
<i>can be closed by pressing the X button</i>
<i>on the top right.</i>

736
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,912
<i>You aren't forced to watch it.</i>

737
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,080
{\an8}THE KILLING VOTE

738
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:05,915
{\an8}The person who sent out the poll

739
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:08,793
{\an8}and executed Bae Gi-chul...

740
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:10,837
was me!

741
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:16,551
I'm presenting the proof for those
who may have doubts.

742
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,375
The reason why I did this is simple.

743
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,003
<i>Because Bae Gi-Chul</i>

744
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:54,881
<i>deserved to die.</i>

745
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,049
Bae Gi-chul claimed that...

746
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,134
BAE GI-CHUL: EXECUTE

747
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,469
...he earned 400 million won
by distributing 200,000 child porn.

748
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,680
But is that really it?

749
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:06,183
I went through his crypto accounts...

750
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:11,689
and I found his hidden earnings of
two billion won.

751
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:12,982
A whopping...

752
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,151
two billion won.

753
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,906
But this rat who deserved to die spent
time in prison for how long?

754
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,575
Just a year and half.

755
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:26,120
{\an8}Just because this rat claimed that
he wrote a letter of apology

756
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:29,665
{\an8}and because he's a married man,
he served less than two years.

757
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,169
{\an8}Did Bae Gi-chul really deeply repent

758
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:36,172
{\an8}like he claims?

759
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,344
{\an8}<i>There were many videos that</i>
<i>cops couldn't catch</i>

760
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,262
{\an8}<i>and the new videos...</i>

761
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:46,557
It's not just an average text
that only masks the sender.

762
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:48,768
They must've gone
through an overseas server...

763
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,520
<i>...and we had advance payment system.</i>

764
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:55,107
<i>What's funny is that after I was caught,</i>

765
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:57,401
<i>my website became very famous.</i>

766
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:01,864
<i>Even my lawyer got</i>
<i>many purchase inquiries.</i>

767
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,373
<i>Our law isn't perfect.</i>

768
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,000
<i>But it needs to be fair.</i>

769
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,087
<i>The law that is more harsh on victims</i>
<i>than on criminals...</i>

770
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,548
<i>It feeds like a parasite off</i>
<i>of money and power,</i>

771
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:22,677
<i>so the ones who deserve to die</i>
<i>are still alive.</i>

772
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:26,889
<i>It disturbs me so much that</i>
<i>I can't even fall asleep.</i>

773
00:54:26,973 --> 00:54:30,726
So on the 15th and 30th
of every month at 10:00 p.m.,

774
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,896
citizens 18 and older will have the chance

775
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:37,984
{\an8}to take part in The Killing Vote.

776
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:42,363
The vote will takes place for an hour
after I send the message.

777
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,366
The criminal will only be executed

778
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,410
if more than 50% votes for "Yes".

779
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,498
The ones who received a light penalty
for the serious crimes they committed...

780
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:54,834
and who found loopholes in the law

781
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,461
to avoid the penalty are the devils
who were deemed innocent.

782
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:59,046
And the ones who can punish them

783
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:01,257
are you!

784
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:05,011
We shall make a better world
with our hands now.

785
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,348
I'll be your faithful watchdog

786
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:11,183
who monitors them

787
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:13,519
and bites their necks off.

788
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,193
Our justice is

789
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,405
rational.

790
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:30,411
The video that was just sent
confirms that Bae Gi-chul was executed.

791
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:33,247
If more murder threats occur,
what would you do?

792
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,208
Is this a realization of justice that
people seek, or is he playing hero?

793
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:37,293
DIRECTOR

794
00:55:40,296 --> 00:55:41,505
I'll be right there.

795
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,258
Coming through!

796
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,342
CHIEF OF BUREAU

797
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:49,180
Sir, I think we should
form a dedicated team.

798
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,992
{\an8}<i>We can't trust the police</i>
<i>or the prosecutors.</i>

799
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,577
<i>We can't trust anyone.</i>

800
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,914
<i>It's their fault for releasing the man</i>
<i>who should've been executed.</i>

801
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,916
<i>Look at the mess this country is in.</i>

802
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,710
{\an8}What are they trying to do
by broadcasting this?

803
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:20,795
{\an8}Is murder a show?

804
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:23,589
{\an8}The media can come after us
if we hesitate,

805
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:24,924
so we must take action on it.

806
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,968
I think you should form
a special investigation unit...

807
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:29,929
But who will lead it?

808
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:36,102
The entire nation thinks
The Killing Vote is a festival

809
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:39,522
and considers this masked man
some kind of Robin Hood.

810
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:42,900
The team will be criticized whether
they catch the killer or not, so who?

811
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:44,902
Anyone willing to lead it?

812
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,072
It's not just you guys.

813
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:51,075
Those so-called elites. You think
they'll take on this kind of job?

814
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,035
They already got wind of it

815
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,037
and handed in
potential investigation cases

816
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:57,706
to avoid getting assigned
to the special unit.

817
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:01,168
Luckily, we have someone
perfect for something like this.

818
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:02,378
Perfect?

819
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,965
{\an8}He's like the unofficial clean-up crew.

820
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,717
{\an8}<i>Superintendent Kim.</i>
<i>Do you see it as a grudge murder?</i>

821
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:10,261
<i>A word please!</i>

822
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:11,470
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

823
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,610
<i>On the 27th, Bae Gi-Chul, who was serving</i>

824
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:28,737
<i>in Cheongnang Prison, was discharged.</i>

825
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:32,408
<i>He distributed over 200,000 videos of</i>
<i>child porn.</i>

826
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:35,119
<i>But the public is furious</i>
<i>about his light penalty....</i>

827
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,998
Do you still ignore procedures
and beat up people?

828
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:40,207
No, sir.

829
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,459
Can you do a good job?

830
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:45,963
Without a problem?

831
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,007
- What do you mean?
- The Killing Vote.

832
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:50,759
What's the most pressing issue
in your opinion?

833
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:53,888
According to the masked man,

834
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,557
another poll and murder will occur
in two weeks.

835
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,393
We don't know who the target is,
so we can't protect them.

836
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,896
We can't help
but get dragged into the killer's plan.

837
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:04,565
So you think it'll happen again?

838
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:08,235
It definitely will.

839
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,616
Mu-chan, lead
the special investigation unit.

840
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:15,242
I'll be the director.

841
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:16,869
Form about three teams.

842
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:21,165
- And what if we catch the killer?
- What?

843
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:23,834
These bastards acting like
they're Batman...

844
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:26,503
We'll be criticized
whether we catch them or not.

845
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:28,881
I must gain something out of this
to take on the job.

846
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:32,551
Right. It's not like you've
lived like that because you're foolish.

847
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,136
Tell me what you want.

848
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,013
I'll hear you out.

849
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:39,225
I want to join the HQ Investigation Team.

850
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:41,727
There is a case I must investigate

851
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,771
while I travel nationwide.

852
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,649
Hey. You're going to cause trouble again,
aren't you?

853
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,234
Let's call it off, sir.

854
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:49,944
Commissioner.

855
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,279
Okay. I promise.

856
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,073
Just catch the guy.

857
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,659
But what if you fail?

858
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,661
I won't stop until I do.

859
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:01,872
I won't ever fail.

860
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,383
It's the same guy, right? I think it is.

861
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:16,929
Why hasn't anyone found
where the text was sent from?

862
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:20,224
It was sent nationwide. How is it possible
that we still haven't found it?

863
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:23,060
I've looked all night.
This has never happened before.

864
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,353
I know.

865
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:27,314
There was no trace that
the carrier's server was hacked.

866
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:29,942
I want to live in a world
free of crazy bastards.

867
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:31,193
I'm serious.

868
00:59:31,277 --> 00:59:32,903
Hey. Come with me.

869
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,092
Damn it.

870
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:06,979
It never happened.

871
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,233
You never saw that video
and you never brought it to me.

872
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:13,819
You didn't find anything from it, right?

873
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:15,863
What would've changed
if we looked into it sooner?

874
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,240
If we tell the truth,

875
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:20,034
we'll just be criticized
for being ignorant.

876
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,161
We could track down the killer sooner.

877
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,788
They must've spread it as a test
before they did it for real.

878
01:00:24,872 --> 01:00:27,416
- If we track it down--
- We can't tell if it was a test

879
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:29,460
or the gender of the culprit.

880
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,587
Don't get into it.

881
01:00:32,171 --> 01:00:33,464
Just do as I say and bury it!

882
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,133
Didn't you learn anything two years ago?

883
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,470
You must keep your civil servant job
to find a husband.

884
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:44,850
- Hey!
- "Hey"?

885
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,977
- Have you gone mad?!
- Yes, I have!

886
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:51,065
I've tried to respect you as my senior cop

887
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,566
and my team leader.

888
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,651
But now I see that you're a scumbag.

889
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:56,695
What? A scumbag?!

890
01:00:57,488 --> 01:01:01,241
How could a cop bury an investigation
to protect their job?

891
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:03,660
You're afraid of losing your job
and you call yourself a cop?

892
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:07,122
I was hired as a special recruit,
so I haven't been here long,

893
01:01:07,206 --> 01:01:10,709
but I will show you
that I am a better cop than you.

894
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:15,672
Just you watch.

895
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:24,431
You think I'll be the only one to go down?

896
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:34,858
Your breath stinks.

897
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:36,568
Why you little...

898
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:43,325
Has she gone mad? This is bad.

899
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,412
Hey. Damn it.

900
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:48,914
Hey!

901
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,835
{\an8}Superintendent Kim Mu-chan who is in
charge of the special investigation unit

902
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,838
for The Killing Vote case,
will continue the briefing.

903
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,385
We came to conclusion that

904
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:04,012
this is an obvious homicide case.

905
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:07,307
Hence, the special investigation unit will
be set up in the Nambu Police Agency.

906
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,476
And three teams, including myself,

907
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,312
will perform an investigation on
The Killing Vote that was sent out

908
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:13,689
to the whole country.

909
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:37,421
PROFILE
BAN SANG-JAE

910
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:40,924
DISCIPLINARY PUNISHMENT HISTORY
BRIBERY

911
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,303
Bribery.

912
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:51,310
KANG YOON-JI

913
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:52,686
Suspect assault.

914
01:02:54,146 --> 01:02:56,648
Everyone that NPA has given up on is here.

915
01:02:56,732 --> 01:02:58,692
They made a clean-up crew with garbage.

916
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:00,944
Then am I garbage too?

917
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:04,781
We picked out ex-cons
who wore masks when committing crimes

918
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:07,326
for the past ten years,
so narrow them down.

919
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:09,119
Yoon-ji, talk to a mask specialist

920
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:11,205
and find out if
it's custom-made or store-bought.

921
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,372
Yes, sir.

922
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:13,874
- Sang-jae.
- Yes, sir?

923
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:16,251
Find the origin of the video
with the Cyber Bureau.

924
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:17,419
Yes, sir.

925
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:19,838
CHOI JIN-SOO

926
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,299
I will trace the final target
with the team leader.

927
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:23,842
Yes, sir.

928
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:25,135
He's been a lieutenant for years.

929
01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:26,929
He's the worst one.

930
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:30,098
Hello.

931
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,895
{\an8}Jirisan is the best mountain.

932
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,897
The sunrise on Cheonwangbong Peak...

933
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,817
What was your fastest hike
up to Cheonwangbong Peak?

934
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:46,490
You should do lower body workouts often.
All right?

935
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,574
Lunges.

936
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,368
Lunges, squats.

937
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:54,206
The cause of Bae Gi-chul's death

938
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,792
is suffocation due to bills
blocking his airway.

939
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,710
After 10:00 p.m. that night,

940
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:01,421
the victim left a bar in Gangnam,
took a cab and disappeared.

941
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:02,631
<i>Then around 3:00 a.m.,</i>

942
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,424
<i>he was found dead.</i>

943
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,262
Alcohol tastes great today.

944
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:12,099
- See you again, okay?
- Get home safe.

945
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,600
I'll be back next week.

946
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,018
My beauties...

947
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:16,770
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

948
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:21,108
- What time is it?
- Good work today.

949
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,860
The one he talked to last was
his Russian wife that he married

950
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,696
{\an8}right before the Supreme Court ruling.

951
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:28,365
The most suspicious one
is the cab that he last took.

952
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,867
We are collecting all camera footage
on the route

953
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:33,161
from the bar to the place
where he was found.

954
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:34,496
What about the masked man?

955
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:36,832
It looks like he's the killer.

956
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,793
It's hard to identify him
solely based on the video,

957
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:42,504
but the Cyber Bureau
is working to find the origin.

958
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:44,965
We will narrow down the suspect
once the result is out.

959
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,309
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT

960
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:07,738
Excuse me.

961
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:10,949
I have something to tell you.

962
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,078
Hey.

963
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,205
There's something you must know

964
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:18,957
about The Killing Vote.

965
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:21,752
Say it.

966
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:24,171
I...

967
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:26,965
think I know who's...

968
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,010
the culprit for The Killing Vote.

969
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:52,616
How would she know the killer?

970
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,410
And why did she come
instead of her team leader?

971
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:56,745
She's a well-known lunatic.

972
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,873
She revealed their investigation to
a reporter and got her team leader fired.

973
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,167
That's not what a sane person would do.

974
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,461
Backstabbing must be her hobby.

975
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:09,716
TEST VIDEO

976
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:13,720
<i>There are so many of those</i>
<i>who deserve to die.</i>

977
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:17,599
<i>The law is incompetent and there are</i>
<i>rotten people like you everywhere.</i>

978
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:21,645
<i>Just you wait.</i>

979
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,897
<i>I'm coming for you.</i>

980
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:26,775
This is what I found
before The Killing Vote text.

981
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:28,902
I am guessing that he
distributed this as a test run

982
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,321
before he started the Bae Gi-chul case.

983
01:06:32,698 --> 01:06:35,409
- So?
- I saw something else.

984
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,869
The content is harsher

985
01:06:37,953 --> 01:06:39,538
and the tone is different.

986
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:41,748
But there's one thing

987
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:42,999
that did not change.

988
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:50,674
<i>We're all at fault.</i>

989
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:54,219
<i>The devils who were deemed innocent</i>
<i>are walking around alive.</i>

990
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,971
<i>I can't stand the thought of it.</i>

991
01:06:58,682 --> 01:06:59,891
"Devils who were deemed innocent."

992
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:02,936
There was a case

993
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:06,398
where the victim's father killed his
daughter's killer when he was released.

994
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:07,482
Eight years ago.

995
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:09,443
You were the officer in charge.

996
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,363
It's what the father said
in his final statement.

997
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:15,490
"Devils who were deemed innocent."

998
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,620
The father, Kwon Seok-joo,

999
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:22,998
is the culprit.

1000
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:14,299
Stop.

1001
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:17,552
Seok-joo...
