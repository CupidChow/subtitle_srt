{\an8}<i>Everyone.</i>

{\an8}<i>Gaetal isn't one person.</i>

{\an8}<i>Anyone who wants to fight corruption</i>
<i>and promote justice in this world</i>

{\an8}CHAE DO-HEE'S KILLING VOTE SPECIAL

9
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:27,901
Hello.

10
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:31,446
This is <i>The Killing Vote Special</i>

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,823
and I'm your host, Chae Do-hee.

12
00:00:35,742 --> 00:00:39,913
Three months ago, the Killing Vote
sent shock waves across the country.

13
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:42,207
And recently,
the host of the Killing Vote, Gaetal,

14
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,836
reaffirmed he was alive and well
in an extraordinary fashion.

15
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:48,005
Tonight, we're presenting
this surprise special

16
00:00:48,088 --> 00:00:50,507
to show how he has
the nation's full support.

17
00:00:52,926 --> 00:00:55,595
{\an8}<i>...and promote justice in this world</i>

18
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:59,141
{\an8}<i>can become a watchdog.</i>

19
00:00:59,224 --> 00:01:02,477
{\an8}<i>All of us are Gaetal.</i>

20
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:06,106
The moment he suggested
that all of us could be Gaetal,

21
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:09,067
we at SBNS knew we had to do this.

22
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:12,529
A just society is a society

23
00:01:12,612 --> 00:01:16,158
where each and every one of us
is able to voice our opinions.

24
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:21,121
These are the message boards
on our network's website

25
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:23,540
where you can share your stories.

26
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:26,918
Please feel free to share
any instances of injustice or corruption

27
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:30,505
that Gaetal may have missed
for the Killing Vote.

28
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:33,258
The stories with the most likes

29
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:35,218
will be presented by me on this program.

30
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:38,972
Please keep in mind that each user account

31
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:42,768
can share and like
only one story every 24 hours.

32
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:45,228
The identity and credibility of sources

33
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:47,981
will be thoroughly vetted
before broadcasts.

34
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:51,735
Now, let me introduce
tonight's special guest.

35
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,445
Please come on out.

36
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,204
Former justices of the Supreme Court,
former Prosecutor Generals,

37
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:05,457
currently active lawyers,
and former chiefs of police.

38
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,503
Meet our fact checkers,
who will share their honest views

39
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:11,880
on truth, justice,
sentencing, and judgments.

40
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:21,598
And here's our message
to all the Gaetals who are watching this.

41
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:26,228
I hope you see our intentions
to become watchdogs.

42
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:30,524
And until our society achieves
rational justice,

43
00:02:30,607 --> 00:02:32,734
I will stand by your side.

44
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:39,531
THE KILLING VOTE

45
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:42,369
{\an8}EPISODE 9

46
00:03:15,193 --> 00:03:16,736
{\an8}Drop the knife!

47
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,447
{\an8}-Stay away!
-Requesting backup.

48
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,991
{\an8}The suspect being transferred
has taken a hostage!

49
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:22,159
{\an8}Some have been injured.

50
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:25,579
{\an8}Move!

51
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,084
{\an8}Press the button!

52
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:35,213
The suspect is moving with the hostage.

53
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:39,217
Lee Min-soo's first letter

54
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:40,927
is missing.

55
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:45,390
Where is it?

56
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:49,102
What was the letter about?

57
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,242
SUPERINTENDENT KIM MU-CHAN

58
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:08,788
It's Kwon Seok-joo.

59
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:13,752
What?

60
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:23,220
Calm down.

61
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:24,971
Let's talk it out, okay?

62
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:30,435
<i>It's always been him.</i>

63
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,479
The real Gaetal
who started the Killing Vote.

64
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:34,231
It's Kwon Seok-joo.

65
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:18,692
Kwon Seok-joo!

66
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,579
Kwon Seok-joo has escaped!

67
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:41,506
-Sir!
-Sir, what are you doing?

68
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,591
Move!

69
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:45,093
No, please don't.

70
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:01,109
Jung Jin-wook!

71
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:03,361
Plate number 7980. It's a water truck!

72
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:05,363
Kwon Seok-joo has escaped!
Situation room, now!

73
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:12,245
What's the matter, ma'am?

74
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:13,622
Please tell us why...

75
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:15,123
{\an8}-Hey!
-Wait!

76
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:45,236
Can't you find them faster?

77
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:53,244
Hey, he's entering a tunnel.

78
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:55,246
A water truck is entering
Sanggok Tunnel from the south.

79
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:15,767
There must have been an accident. Darn it.

80
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:17,352
What's going on?

81
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:21,898
What are you doing?

82
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,360
Hey! Move the truck!

83
00:07:25,443 --> 00:07:27,404
What on Earth is going on?

84
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:59,185
Darn it.

85
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:05,316
Kwon Seok-joo changed his clothes and ran.

86
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,235
Check both sides
for motorcycles that exited.

87
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:09,696
<i>Motorcycles in the tunnel?</i>

88
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,532
There were two motorcycles in the truck.
Start the search now.

89
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:14,409
-<i>Okay.</i>
-Darn it.

90
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:21,374
Darn it.

91
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:48,359
{\an8}DEAR PROFESSOR KWON

92
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:51,321
{\an8}<i>Professor, how's life in there?</i>

93
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:53,448
{\an8}<i>I was reading a book,</i>

94
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:56,534
{\an8}<i>and I came across a part</i>
<i>about Joseph the tattletale.</i>

95
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:00,455
{\an8}<i>I had a friend who was a tattletale</i>
<i>when I was young too.</i>

96
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:03,082
<i>But I gave this friend a second chance.</i>

97
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:07,128
<i>I carried out justice so they wouldn't be</i>
<i>a devil who was deemed innocent.</i>

98
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:11,174
<i>But now, I guess</i>
<i>they'll forever be a child</i>

99
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:14,093
<i>along with their cherished pet dog.</i>

100
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:04,394
The Body of Christ.

101
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:31,838
{\an8}LET'S TELL THE WORLD ABOUT THIS SIN

102
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:32,922
{\an8}JI-HOON

103
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,518
Goodness.

104
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:48,354
Go get him right now.

105
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:51,399
You lost Kwon Seok-joo,
so I want you to bring him back!

106
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:52,734
I apologize, sir.

107
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:56,237
Well, he literally broke down
the walls of the police agency.

108
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:58,031
How could she have stopped that?

109
00:10:58,114 --> 00:10:59,741
Are you siding with her?

110
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:02,702
If only the guard had come on time,
he wouldn't have escaped.

111
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:06,331
Fighting amongst ourselves
won't help us catch him.

112
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,292
Let's put out an APB on him first.

113
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,543
Excuse me?

114
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:12,253
How are you going to explain

115
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:14,756
he escaped from the police agency
and not from prison?

116
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,132
I told you if people find out

117
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:18,801
we took Kwon out of prison,
we'll all be hung out to dry!

118
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:21,012
That's why we should hurry and catch him!

119
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:23,389
You could lose your job
trying to save face.

120
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:26,225
You punk! How dare you?

121
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:29,729
Let's do things the right way!

122
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:36,194
The moment that brat Kim Mu-chan

123
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:39,614
steps into this room again,
you better tell me right away. Got that?

124
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:45,036
Hello, Warden.

125
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:47,038
Right. I'm terribly sorry.

126
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:51,042
Quiet? Yes, I made sure
everyone keeps this quiet.

127
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:55,505
Of course, we must catch him
as soon as possible.

128
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:58,716
The Commissioner is also uneasy
about this situation.

129
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:10,770
It's okay. We'll just catch him.

130
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,523
You can't even hail a taxi
in Korea without the internet,

131
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:16,109
so how dare he mess with the Cyber Bureau?

132
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:19,904
Jjoo, let's start by going through
Jung Jin-wook's phone again.

133
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:20,989
From now on...

134
00:12:22,824 --> 00:12:24,075
This still hurts.

135
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:25,159
It's war.

136
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,006
Hey. How's Jung Jin-wook?

137
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:43,678
Surgery went well,
but he's still unconscious.

138
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:45,430
All right, stay with him today.

139
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:47,223
And get some shut-eye if you need to.

140
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:48,808
Call me when he wakes up.

141
00:12:48,891 --> 00:12:50,560
<i>-Will do, sir.</i>
-All right.

142
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,319
Jung Jin-wook's not awake yet.

143
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:03,364
How could the two have communicated?
I haven't the faintest idea.

144
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:07,201
Nobody knew Kwon Seok-joo
was out except for our team.

145
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:08,995
You know none of us would ever do that.

146
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:10,705
That's what makes it more puzzling.

147
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:14,751
Lee was suspected to be Gaetal,
so he was going to be released anyway.

148
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,753
So why escape now?

149
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:18,004
Isn't it obvious?

150
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:21,049
He's trying to kill Lee Min-soo himself,
just as he killed Byun.

151
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:24,052
He's still holding grudges
about what happened eight years ago.

152
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:26,721
You saw how he even targeted you
on the Killing Vote.

153
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:30,975
In any case, just wait it out
at home for a few days.

154
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,394
The higher-ups know
it's hard to proceed without you,

155
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:34,687
so they'll call you back soon.

156
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:36,189
Kwon Seok-joo and Lee Min-soo.

157
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:38,024
I'll catch them both.

158
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:40,818
Cover for me for a few days.

159
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:44,781
I can't do it for long,
so come back soon, okay?

160
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:47,366
You know I'm retiring soon.

161
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:16,479
It seems the professor's picnic is over.

162
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:10,449
CCTV
OPERATE, CANCEL

163
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:37,310
{\an8}That bastard...

164
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:39,228
{\an8}When did he join forces with Lee Min-soo?

165
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:40,813
{\an8}Lee Min-soo?

166
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:42,982
{\an8}Are you sure?

167
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:44,734
{\an8}I doubt Number Five did this alone.

168
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:46,402
{\an8}Hacking and stealing a program

169
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:49,280
{\an8}and deleting all the data
left in the server that quickly?

170
00:15:49,363 --> 00:15:50,656
{\an8}Only experts can do that.

171
00:15:51,574 --> 00:15:54,243
{\an8}Does this mean all
of our identities will be revealed?

172
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:57,622
{\an8}I've secured the main server on my side,
so we're pretty safe,

173
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:00,082
{\an8}but there will have to be
many changes to our plan.

174
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:05,254
{\an8}Right. How's Number Four?

175
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:07,089
{\an8}He was shot and is in the hospital now.

176
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:08,841
{\an8}I haven't heard about him since.

177
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:12,678
{\an8}I hope the professor
can at least join us without any trouble.

178
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:17,141
{\an8}I'll start restoring the data first.

179
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:41,165
<i>I'm at the playground. I won't leave</i>
<i>until you come, so you better show up.</i>

180
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,919
-Darn it.
-"Darn it"?

181
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:29,672
What? Were you guys planning to meet here?

182
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:32,842
I was wondering if we had a mole,

183
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:35,261
and it was you.

184
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:41,058
What about yourself?
Talk about perfect timing.

185
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:44,478
How come he escaped
just as you figured out he was Gaetal?

186
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:47,023
You just can't lose an argument, can you?

187
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:51,444
You see, the director's scolding
didn't hurt me at all.

188
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:53,029
However,

189
00:17:53,112 --> 00:17:56,115
my anger has reached its limit for sure.

190
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:02,079
Did you find anything?

191
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:06,167
You knew they'd search this place first,
so you wouldn't be here without a reason.

192
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,877
There is no big reason.

193
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:12,381
I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss
anything for trusting him too much.

194
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:15,217
That's why I came.

195
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:20,514
Well, I'm here
because I still can't believe

196
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,808
that Lee Min-soo isn't Gaetal.

197
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:27,146
If we search his house and seize
his computers and servers now,

198
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm sure we'd find evidence.
Don't you think so?

199
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:31,567
You weren't sure about him either.

200
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,321
You felt like Lee and Gaetal
weren't the same person.

201
00:18:35,404 --> 00:18:36,697
At first, yes.

202
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:40,785
But you saw his reaction
when you were the Killing Vote's target.

203
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:43,746
Only the real Gaetal
would react like that.

204
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:55,257
Apparently, he was her best friend.

205
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:57,968
He's in every one of her drawings.

206
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:01,222
He was her brother, not her friend.

207
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,061
Na-rae was murdered
when Kwon was about to adopt him,

208
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:08,562
and the adoption never happened.

209
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:12,108
Kwon said they lost contact,

210
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:14,193
but we should look for him.

211
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:37,883
Hey.

212
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,929
That threatening text
was so old-fashioned.

213
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:43,681
"I won't leave until you come"? Seriously?

214
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:46,434
{\an8}Then, why did you come?

215
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:50,062
{\an8}And is it that hard to reply
to one text? Why...

216
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:57,653
{\an8}I haven't even eaten yet.

217
00:19:58,487 --> 00:19:59,738
{\an8}If you keep hitting me,

218
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,490
{\an8}you might probably kill me.

219
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,576
{\an8}Jeez.

220
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,377
{\an8}I'm actually really touched.

221
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:16,005
{\an8}Hurry and take it. My arms hurt.

222
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:19,633
{\an8}Thank you, ma'am.

223
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:21,594
{\an8}One's for me.

224
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:30,978
{\an8}JI-HOON

225
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,108
{\an8}All done.

226
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:44,492
Hyun said I should give up too.

227
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,577
And Hye-mi said
boys who leave you on read...

228
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:49,830
I mean...

229
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:54,960
I was trying to reach you,
because I'm the class president.

230
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:01,842
It's been so long
since anyone's looked for me like that.

231
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:03,427
Who else looked for you?

232
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:05,679
My sister.

233
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:10,601
Wherever I went, she'd always call me.

234
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,729
Right. She actually said
the same thing too.

235
00:21:14,897 --> 00:21:17,483
"I won't leave until you come."

236
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:19,652
"You said you'd go with me,
so hurry and come."

237
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:25,366
So that's why I came.

238
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:27,368
You reminded me of my sister.

239
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:30,579
Did your sister go somewhere?

240
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,082
Your house has been empty
the past two days.

241
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,461
-My house?
-Shinyeon Complex, Building 206, Unit 901.

242
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:42,675
Well...

243
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,511
We don't live together.

244
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:46,929
And Grandma is on a trip.

245
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:49,723
I see.

246
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:52,059
But is that place...

247
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,937
really your house?

248
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:58,440
Yeah.

249
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:00,818
But...

250
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:02,278
we're moving soon.

251
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:05,239
So from now on,

252
00:22:05,322 --> 00:22:07,032
stop waiting for me here.

253
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:09,785
Fine.

254
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:23,173
Ji-hoon, your house...

255
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,391
Sorry, but I have to go.

256
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,478
My father's here to pick me up.

257
00:22:41,358 --> 00:22:43,485
I'm really sorry.

258
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,450
What's wrong with him?

259
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,342
How have you been?

260
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:13,932
How do you find out
where someone actually lives?

261
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:16,518
Are you trying to find out
where your teacher lives?

262
00:23:17,144 --> 00:23:18,437
Kim Ji-hoon.

263
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,772
Ji-hoon?

264
00:23:19,855 --> 00:23:21,774
Did he receive his counseling?

265
00:23:21,857 --> 00:23:25,277
The police even came to our school,
because his address was wrong.

266
00:23:25,694 --> 00:23:29,198
They said no one lives at the address
registered in the school records.

267
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:31,033
No one's ever lived there.

268
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:33,535
Why don't you ask him yourself?

269
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,747
<i>We at SBNS...</i>

270
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:39,083
When I was just about to ask,

271
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:42,002
he left with his dad.

272
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:43,462
Dad?

273
00:23:43,545 --> 00:23:45,172
Didn't he say his parents passed away...

274
00:23:45,255 --> 00:23:46,757
Maybe they're divorced.

275
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,760
He's acting suspicious, isn't he?
It's like he's hiding something.

276
00:23:49,843 --> 00:23:51,095
Just focus on your studies.

277
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:53,305
And if you ditch
because I'm too busy to pick you up,

278
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:54,431
you're dead meat.

279
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:57,184
Whatever.

280
00:24:00,562 --> 00:24:04,024
<i>And here's our message</i>
<i>to all the Gaetals who are watching this.</i>

281
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,862
<i>I hope you see our intentions</i>
<i>to become watchdogs.</i>

282
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:12,991
<i>And until our society achieves</i>
<i>rational justice,</i>

283
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:14,702
<i>I will stand by your side.</i>

284
00:24:38,016 --> 00:24:39,226
I'm so sorry.

285
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:41,645
I should've made sure
security was tighter.

286
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:45,441
He had it all planned out,
so how could you stop him by yourself?

287
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:49,194
He was always a little off.

288
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:51,780
I should've watched him more closely.

289
00:24:51,864 --> 00:24:54,158
This is no one's fault.

290
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:56,368
We just chose the wrong person
from the start.

291
00:24:57,494 --> 00:25:00,205
He must've leaked information,
so let's close this place down.

292
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:01,957
What about Number Three?

293
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,043
We can't be sure Number Three
won't act like Number Five either.

294
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:08,797
We know each other very well,
but you said he's a bit different.

295
00:25:09,673 --> 00:25:11,592
He would never turn against us.

296
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:14,261
We go back a long way.

297
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:17,806
And at this moment, his position
could be more valuable than anything else.

298
00:25:20,392 --> 00:25:21,685
We must trust him.

299
00:25:22,644 --> 00:25:24,271
Let's go home first.

300
00:25:24,354 --> 00:25:27,399
We need to move fast before the police
goes public with their pursuit.

301
00:25:36,742 --> 00:25:37,951
It must have been so tough.

302
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:40,204
I'm so sorry.

303
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:41,830
This time...

304
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:45,459
let's catch him at all cost.

305
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:55,052
We will.

306
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,689
POLICE BRUTALITY, EVIDENCE FORGERY
THE FOURTH KILLING VOTE: KIM MU-CHAN

307
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:08,774
This is insane!

308
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:12,861
It's even better than I expected.

309
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:15,531
The speed, the system...

310
00:26:15,614 --> 00:26:17,282
I love everything about this program.

311
00:26:19,284 --> 00:26:22,120
That Number One guy made this,
but you really don't know who he is?

312
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:24,540
I told you I've never met him in person.

313
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:28,794
I used to think that maybe
they all knew each other except me,

314
00:26:29,878 --> 00:26:31,672
but now, I don't even care.

315
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:35,133
Darn it.

316
00:26:38,053 --> 00:26:39,137
Where's the hideout?

317
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:43,934
You have to keep your promise
if you want to see what I know.

318
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:46,854
Money and revenge.

319
00:26:53,735 --> 00:26:57,489
Just lie low, okay?
And don't use the internet.

320
00:26:57,573 --> 00:27:00,576
The second you leave a trace,
they'll come find you.

321
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,161
Don't let your guard down, okay?

322
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,628
MOM:
KWON SEOK-JOO ESCAPED

323
00:27:15,257 --> 00:27:18,218
My dear professor must be so angry.

324
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:27,352
Min, did you watch Chae Do-hee's show?

325
00:27:28,228 --> 00:27:30,689
I've been staying up all night
reading all the comments.

326
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:32,900
Do you think
Gaetal's really watching this show?

327
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:35,235
It would be awesome
if this is the next vote.

328
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:37,696
A DRUNK DRIVER KILLED MY PARENTS

329
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:38,822
SAVE

330
00:27:42,034 --> 00:27:43,744
Looks like you're a little late, sir.

331
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:45,579
Ji-hoon?

332
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:48,248
Right?

333
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:49,625
How are you this morning?

334
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:53,629
You're scaring the students.

335
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:55,797
This is incredibly rude.

336
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:58,216
Mr. Lee Yun-seong.

337
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,054
"Without being detained"
doesn't mean you're innocent.

338
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:03,430
It's still our duty

339
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:08,226
to keep an eye on you as a murder suspect.

340
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:11,021
We must protect the students too.

341
00:28:11,939 --> 00:28:14,483
You're saying you're here
to protect my students from me?

342
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,236
Mr. Lee, can we talk later?

343
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,445
All right.

344
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:18,922
It was convenient to play hooky
while I wasn't around, right?

345
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:23,176
I'm sorry. I needed some time off.

346
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,387
Attendance is important
for college admissions,

347
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,514
so I'll record it as sick leave for you.

348
00:29:27,597 --> 00:29:30,225
Submit the sick leave request
with proof by tomorrow.

349
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:31,393
Yes, sir.

350
00:29:37,024 --> 00:29:38,608
By the way, did you move?

351
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:42,779
The police came by school
and said you didn't live there.

352
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:44,948
Min didn't know where you lived either,

353
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,367
so the police officer came for nothing.

354
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:50,078
Min...

355
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:52,456
met with a police officer?

356
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:54,374
The police officer said

357
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:57,711
Min's sister made a request
for you to receive counseling.

358
00:29:57,794 --> 00:30:01,506
Are you and Min's sister close?

359
00:30:03,717 --> 00:30:05,135
Ji-hoon.

360
00:30:05,218 --> 00:30:06,219
Yes?

361
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:13,560
Thank you.

362
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:26,573
{\an8}I watched the first episode.

FAMILY COMMITS SUICIDE
DUE TO REAL ESTATE SCAM

364
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:30,452
The show's ratings were ranked first.

365
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:33,413
It's a smooth start.
Now, it's time to kick it into high gear.

366
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:37,876
I've emailed you the stories
and instructions for the next episode,

367
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,045
so use them when you prepare the show.

368
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:44,841
The case of a family's suicide
after a real estate scam.

369
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:46,885
Don't make this awkward.

370
00:30:46,968 --> 00:30:49,679
You gave me the cue sheet,
so let me handle the rest.

You can't fabricate the content

374

Ms. Chae. Two years ago,

376
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:09,116
you made your way up the ranks
after exclusively covering news on me.

377
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:13,161
I've always wondered why
you never had any big stories since.

378
00:31:13,745 --> 00:31:15,372
But now, I can see why.

379
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:17,999
You're not too bright.

380
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:22,420
Should I pretend I didn't hear that

381
00:31:22,504 --> 00:31:23,672
or was it your mistake?

382
00:31:28,093 --> 00:31:33,431
I'm saying while you may see
one step ahead, I see the bigger picture.

383
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:38,812

Hello?

390
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:13,680
KIM MU-CHAN

391
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:22,314
Well, look who's calling.

392
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:23,940
What's up?

393
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:26,026
Do you need me?

394
00:32:29,624 --> 00:32:32,919
We need to put out an APB on him
and search every corner.

395
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:34,545
We don't have time for this.

396
00:32:35,963 --> 00:32:38,549
Right. A public search can't be official.

397
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,134
If people find out

398
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:43,054
the cops got help from a prisoner,
it would be embarrassing.

399
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,473
It turns out Kwon Seok-joo

400
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:48,392
got a lot of special treatment.

401
00:32:49,644 --> 00:32:51,813
Since when are prisoners in this country

402
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:55,066
allowed to have this in their cells?

403
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:56,901
It looks very dangerous.

404
00:32:58,611 --> 00:32:59,612
Look here.

405
00:33:01,906 --> 00:33:05,743
Those jailhouse lawyers like Inmate 0512

406
00:33:05,827 --> 00:33:09,705
trade their legal smarts
to live the good life behind bars.

407
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:11,874
You know nothing.

408
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:13,626
If he received such good treatment,

409
00:33:14,418 --> 00:33:17,505
then it must mean Inmate 0512
had a client with high status.

410
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:19,590
A guard?

411
00:33:19,674 --> 00:33:20,967
No.

412
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,301
The warden.

413
00:33:29,517 --> 00:33:31,602
You sure do talk like a jerk.

414
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,858
Come on.

415
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:40,444
Police investigations
always begin with suspicions.

416
00:33:40,528 --> 00:33:41,737
Guards, the warden...

417
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:43,739
Everyone in this prison is a suspect.

418
00:33:43,823 --> 00:33:46,701
-Suspect?
-Yes, a suspect.

419
00:33:46,784 --> 00:33:48,452
We're going to start the investigation

420
00:33:48,536 --> 00:33:52,248
assuming that everyone in this prison
is Kwon's potential communication link.

421
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:53,666
First off,

422
00:33:55,293 --> 00:33:57,420
we need to meet his doctor.

423
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:59,422
He was getting regular check-ups.

424
00:34:02,258 --> 00:34:03,968
She happens to be off today.

425
00:34:05,428 --> 00:34:06,721
The suspect, I mean.

426
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:11,517
That no good...

427
00:34:17,815 --> 00:34:19,358
She isn't stationed in the prison.

428
00:34:19,442 --> 00:34:21,569
She comes twice a week as a volunteer.

429
00:34:22,153 --> 00:34:23,362
Yang Hye-jin.

430
00:34:24,238 --> 00:34:25,448
Yang Hye-jin?

431
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:27,617
PERSONAL INFORMATION
YANG HYE-JIN

432
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,452
Dr. Yang from Saehyeon Hospital?

433
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:31,662
Do you know her?

434
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:44,675
That's Tae-yang.

435
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:46,636
Of course, I remember him.

436
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,138
He was such a smart kid.

437
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:53,226
We're looking for Professor Kwon Seok-joo.
He wanted to adopt Kim Tae-yang.

438
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:55,645
Do you remember Professor Kwon?

439
00:34:55,728 --> 00:34:56,771
Of course.

440
00:34:56,854 --> 00:35:00,316
He visited here often with his daughter.
He made a lot of donations too.

441
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:05,404
And when he said he wanted
to adopt Tae-yang despite his illness,

442
00:35:05,488 --> 00:35:07,782
I was so grateful.

443
00:35:07,865 --> 00:35:09,492
I never knew he was ill.

444
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:13,913
Tae-yang witnessed his parents' deaths.

445
00:35:13,996 --> 00:35:15,331
When he first came here,

446
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:20,461
he had been decimated by shock and anger.

447
00:35:20,544 --> 00:35:22,838
He couldn't speak.

448
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,971
<i>Could I meet him?</i>

449
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:33,057
<i>Luckily, he was adopted by a great family.</i>

450
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,812
<i>And I don't want to remind him</i>
<i>of what happened then.</i>

451
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:46,737
JOO HYUN

452
00:35:48,823 --> 00:35:50,408
<i>I searched Kwon Seok-joo's room,</i>

453
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:52,285
but there were no traces of him.

454
00:35:52,743 --> 00:35:54,078
Nothing about the accomplices either.

455
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:57,498
<i>How did he communicate with them</i>
<i>and direct the Killing Vote?</i>

456
00:35:57,581 --> 00:36:00,001
I'm sure he is
even with the accomplices now.

457
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:01,544
It's obvious where escaped convicts hide.

458
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:05,047
They go to their families, friends,
lovers, or their prison friends.

459
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:08,259
Have you looked into
any of his acquaintances?

460
00:36:08,342 --> 00:36:09,343
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

461
00:36:09,427 --> 00:36:11,929
remember Kwon was suffering
from a collapsed lung?

462
00:36:12,763 --> 00:36:14,724
The doctor
who's been treating him for years

463
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:19,520
turned out to be the grandmother
of the boy that Captain Oh took hostage.

464
00:36:19,603 --> 00:36:21,355
<i>Dr. Yang Hye-jin from Saehyeon Hospital.</i>

465
00:36:21,856 --> 00:36:25,192
A doctor and a patient. The guard said
it was nothing more than that.

466
00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:28,154
But it's too suspicious
to consider as a coincidence.

467
00:36:28,237 --> 00:36:30,656
<i>Out of all hospitals,</i>
<i>it's Saehyeon Hospital?</i>

468
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:33,326
Too many coincidences
mean it's not a coincidence.

469
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:35,286
Does it apply to investigations too?

470
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:39,582
The grandmother is Kwon's doctor,
and the grandson is Lee's student.

471
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:45,004
Like you said,
it's too much of a coincidence.

472
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,341
-I'll go meet her.
<i>-Okay.</i>

473
00:36:48,424 --> 00:36:50,301
Jo-dan is trying
to figure out her address.

474
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,762
What?

475
00:36:52,845 --> 00:36:53,971
I've got to go.

476
00:36:54,555 --> 00:36:55,598
What's she doing here?

477
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:59,101
An inmate serving time escaped
while helping police in an investigation.

478
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:01,187
The inmate's name is Kwon Seok-joo.

479
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,232
A heinous criminal who exacted revenge
eight years ago on the suspect acquitted

480
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:07,401
<i>for the abduction</i>
<i>and murder of his daughter.</i>

481
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:08,986
<i>According to our sources,</i>

482
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,031
<i>Kwon had been staying here</i>
<i>at Nambu Police Agency</i>

483
00:37:12,114 --> 00:37:14,325
{\an8}<i>as a major witness and advisor</i>
<i>for a recent case.</i>

484
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:18,621
{\an8}<i>For allowing a criminal to reside</i>
<i>at the police agency in return for help</i>

485
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:23,459
{\an8}<i>and for helping him escape, the police</i>
<i>are expected to face severe criticism.</i>

486
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,628
Hey, it's unfair to put it like that.

487
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,129
She's making this harder for us.

488
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:29,924
I know. But how did they find out?

489
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,301
The commissioner told us
to keep our mouths shut.

490
00:37:32,385 --> 00:37:35,596
Exactly. Is one of us leaking information?

491
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:38,224
Whether we leak information or not,

492
00:37:38,307 --> 00:37:40,768
they'll always find a way
to get what they want.

493
00:37:41,268 --> 00:37:43,896
What's out is already out,
so let's focus on finding Kwon.

494
00:37:44,355 --> 00:37:47,233
Have you found any family members
he might have gone to?

495
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:51,987
-Hey, Cyber Bureau.
-Yes?

496
00:37:52,863 --> 00:37:54,990
Right. Yes.

497
00:37:57,243 --> 00:38:00,204
All his family members
either live abroad or have passed away.

498
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:03,666
So I'm looking into the inmates
he shared sentence periods with.

499
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:06,377
And I'm waiting for a response
from the KCS.

500
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,421
And as for his friends,

501
00:38:08,504 --> 00:38:09,672
it's like a desert.

502
00:38:10,047 --> 00:38:12,216
He has zero friends, like me.

503
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:13,467
GAETAL NUMBER ONE
ARE YOU READY?

504
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:15,052
I suddenly feel upset.

505
00:38:15,136 --> 00:38:16,470
Good work. See you later.

506
00:38:19,306 --> 00:38:20,724
Wait. Hold on!

507
00:38:20,808 --> 00:38:22,560
Wait!

508
00:38:22,643 --> 00:38:24,353
Hey, get out of the car!

509
00:38:24,937 --> 00:38:25,938
That little...

510
00:38:26,522 --> 00:38:27,606
Darn it!

511
00:38:40,202 --> 00:38:42,288
I'm Kim Mu-chan from Nambu Police Agency.

512
00:38:44,582 --> 00:38:45,958
The warden must've called you.

513
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:47,751
Yes, he did.

514
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:50,629
But I don't feel comfortable
with such unexpected visits at this hour.

515
00:38:50,713 --> 00:38:52,339
Let's meet somewhere else on another day.

516
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,095
I want to say hi to Ji-hoon.

517
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:01,307
Do you know Ji-hoon?

518
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:04,685
Well, I'm the one who saved Ji-hoon
at the incident in Saehyeon Hospital.

519
00:39:05,352 --> 00:39:06,854
I wanted to check on him,

520
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:09,398
but I've been too busy
with this case I'm working on.

521
00:39:11,275 --> 00:39:12,776
Could we have a moment to talk?

522
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:14,612
This is very urgent.

523
00:39:34,131 --> 00:39:35,549
Have a seat.

524
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:37,218
Thank you.

525
00:39:39,386 --> 00:39:42,014
As you've probably heard,
we're after an escaped inmate.

526
00:39:42,097 --> 00:39:43,349
Inmate 0512.

527
00:39:44,892 --> 00:39:46,477
He's had a collapsed lung for a while.

528
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,146
Do you think there's a chance
he'll stop by at a hospital?

529
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,441
He managed his own condition well.

530
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:54,443
Unless his condition worsens,

531
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:56,445
I doubt he'll go to the hospital.

532
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:00,783
All his family members live abroad.

533
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:03,327
Has he ever said anything
about who he wanted to meet

534
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,496
or where he wanted to go
when he was released?

535
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,832
He barely talked about himself.

536
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:10,334
Rather, he asked me questions.

537
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:13,087
He'd ask about my grandson, for example.

538
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:18,050
He also asked how high school students
study and what they do for fun these days.

539
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:21,053
Why was he interested in Ji-hoon?

540
00:40:21,136 --> 00:40:22,263
Well...

541
00:40:23,472 --> 00:40:25,891
Was it Na-rae?

542
00:40:25,975 --> 00:40:27,017
His daughter's name.

543
00:40:28,102 --> 00:40:32,731
I assumed the reason was
if she were still alive, she'd be his age.

544
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:40,072
Having a private conversation
with an inmate isn't as easy as you think.

545
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:43,576
I see.

546
00:40:44,618 --> 00:40:46,161
Thank you for your cooperation.

547
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,456
If Inmate 0512 ever contacts you
or shows up, please let me know.

548
00:40:50,207 --> 00:40:51,875
You must not meet him alone.

549
00:40:52,626 --> 00:40:53,627
Okay.

550
00:40:58,382 --> 00:41:00,384
Is Ji-hoon's room upstairs?

551
00:41:02,177 --> 00:41:03,220
Ji-hoon.

552
00:41:03,304 --> 00:41:05,389
What do you think you're doing?

553
00:41:05,472 --> 00:41:07,057
I told you Ji-hoon isn't home!

554
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:08,350
Please come back down here!

555
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:11,395
What is the meaning of this?

556
00:41:16,984 --> 00:41:19,445
It would've been nice to see him.
What a shame.

557
00:41:19,528 --> 00:41:24,366
He finishes school at 10 p.m.

558
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,035
I'll tell him you said hi.

559
00:41:26,535 --> 00:41:28,412
Okay. Thank you.

560
00:42:01,278 --> 00:42:02,988
I was so nervous.

561
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,783
Do you think we're all right?

562
00:42:05,866 --> 00:42:08,994
Yes, you did well,
just as we talked about.

563
00:42:09,703 --> 00:42:12,206
Thank goodness
you prepared me for this situation.

564
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:18,003
By the way, that detective
seemed to know a lot about you.

565
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:20,297
Is he Number Three, by any chance?

566
00:42:42,736 --> 00:42:46,156

574
00:43:12,474 --> 00:43:13,475
Oh, no.

575
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:15,018
What's taking so long to catch him?

576
00:43:15,602 --> 00:43:17,271
They need to catch him quick.

577
00:43:24,528 --> 00:43:27,114
-What's the government doing?
-I'm so scared.

578
00:43:27,197 --> 00:43:28,198
Me too.

579
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:30,033
Where could he be?

580
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:32,786
-I'm scared.
-I can't even go out anymore.

Hey, Kim Mu-chan!

584
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:07,237
Hey, Director.

585
00:44:07,321 --> 00:44:08,530
Yes, Commissioner.

586
00:44:11,784 --> 00:44:12,785
Sang-jae.

587
00:44:12,868 --> 00:44:14,536
I hear you have a new captain now.

588
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,621
{\an8}Captain Kwon Seok-joo.

589
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:19,708
{\an8}That's not cool.

590
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:22,044
{\an8}How dare you glare
at your superior officer like that?

591
00:44:22,711 --> 00:44:26,131
{\an8}I knew this would happen
when I saw them form a team of jalopies.

592
00:44:26,215 --> 00:44:29,885
{\an8}How could you take investigation lessons
from a criminal? How embarrassing.

593
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:31,220
{\an8}What the...

594
00:44:31,303 --> 00:44:33,555
{\an8}Even jalopies can run you down.

595
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:36,892
{\an8}"What the"?
Is that how you talk to your colleagues?

596
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:38,644
{\an8}What a scumbag.

597
00:44:38,727 --> 00:44:40,020
{\an8}I'm sorry, sir.

598
00:44:40,103 --> 00:44:41,104
{\an8}Let's go.

599
00:44:45,526 --> 00:44:47,778
{\an8}-How's Jung doing?
-He's still unconscious.

600
00:44:47,861 --> 00:44:51,156
The doctor suggests it might be
psychological rather than physical.

601
00:44:52,783 --> 00:44:53,784
Sir.

602
00:44:54,493 --> 00:44:55,702
You really didn't take long.

603
00:44:56,453 --> 00:44:58,664
We decided to put out an APB on Kwon.

604
00:44:59,331 --> 00:45:00,332
Any luck with the plates?

605
00:45:00,415 --> 00:45:03,544
We checked shops and found
a few motorcycles with changed plates.

606
00:45:03,627 --> 00:45:05,379
But we've yet to identify the drivers.

607
00:45:05,462 --> 00:45:07,714
Now, we have to comb through
all the CCTV footage.

608
00:45:08,382 --> 00:45:09,967
And that's right up this team's alley.

609
00:45:11,677 --> 00:45:13,303
I like this clear distribution of tasks.

610
00:45:13,387 --> 00:45:15,806
As for Lee Min-soo,
should we halt the investigation?

611
00:45:15,889 --> 00:45:17,975
He's still the prime suspect
in Jovovich's murder.

612
00:45:18,058 --> 00:45:19,726
We'll continue to monitor him closely.

613
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:24,189
CYBER BUREAU

614
00:45:24,731 --> 00:45:25,858
Where's the Cyber Bureau team?

615
00:45:40,414 --> 00:45:41,748
Stop that. You look suspicious.

616
00:45:41,832 --> 00:45:43,375
What? Fine.

617
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:45,711
Are you sure we can do this?

618
00:45:45,794 --> 00:45:47,921
Come on. You saw Chae Do-hee's show too.

619
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:50,424
There's a mole in our team.
I'm sure of it.

620
00:45:50,507 --> 00:45:52,759
No one can know about this
until the superintendent returns.

621
00:45:52,843 --> 00:45:54,344
Are the time and location correct?

622
00:45:54,887 --> 00:45:56,513
GAETAL NUMBER ONE
AT 5:00 P.M., APRIL 20 INJEONG PARK

623
00:45:56,597 --> 00:45:57,639
Okay.

624
00:46:00,434 --> 00:46:03,395
This is brilliant. I didn't think
of online communities of high schoolers.

625
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:08,525
Gaetal Number One must be the jerk
who posted stuff to instigate people.

626
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:10,193
The system administrator.

627
00:46:10,694 --> 00:46:12,696
Dragging kids into this is
crossing the line.

628
00:46:12,779 --> 00:46:14,698
I think we're the ones crossing the line.

629
00:46:14,781 --> 00:46:16,074
Who'd think we were teenagers?

630
00:46:16,158 --> 00:46:17,492
Then, keep your head down.

631
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:18,577
That's what I mean.

632
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:24,207
-Jjoo, he's here.
-He is?

633
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,334
{\an8}GAETAL NUMBER ONE
WHERE ARE YOU?

634
00:46:26,668 --> 00:46:28,629
IN A BLUE SCHOOL UNIFORM ON A BENCH

635
00:46:37,596 --> 00:46:38,597
What?

636
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:40,682
She's...

637
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:42,684
You... Hey.

638
00:46:44,478 --> 00:46:45,979
Wait! Stop!

639
00:46:47,481 --> 00:46:49,691
Hey, aren't you Min's friend?

640
00:46:49,775 --> 00:46:52,194
What are you doing? I don't know anything.

641
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,403
Just a second.

642
00:46:53,487 --> 00:46:55,781
GAETAL NUMBER ONE

643
00:46:55,864 --> 00:46:57,616
It's her.

644
00:46:58,158 --> 00:47:00,410
Are you really Gaetal Number One?

645
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:02,412
I'm just...

646
00:47:02,913 --> 00:47:03,914
a fan.

647
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:07,668
-What?
-Number One asked me to come here.

648
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:16,176
SEE YOU WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE

649
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,803
Darn it.

650
00:47:18,387 --> 00:47:19,388
Wait.

651
00:47:19,888 --> 00:47:21,431
BENCH, BLUE UNIFORM, DISGUISE

652
00:47:21,515 --> 00:47:22,849
Jjoo.

653
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:25,727
This bastard has been watching us.

654
00:47:59,761 --> 00:48:02,222
The message has been delivered.

655
00:48:03,015 --> 00:48:04,808
Do you think they'll get the message?

656
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:07,019
I'm sure Joo Hyun will.

657
00:48:07,602 --> 00:48:10,063
There's probably no way
we can get the program back, right?

658
00:48:10,605 --> 00:48:11,648
Voting day is drawing near,

659
00:48:11,732 --> 00:48:13,734
and we don't know
who will be the next target.

660
00:48:14,276 --> 00:48:15,902
Lee's abusing it for his own good,

661
00:48:15,986 --> 00:48:18,071
so it's better to get rid of it quickly.

662
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,912
SEE YOU WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE

663
00:48:35,047 --> 00:48:36,965
Just give up already.

664
00:48:37,049 --> 00:48:39,259
He made a complete fool out of us.

665
00:48:39,342 --> 00:48:42,929
It just bothers me how much effort
he put into making fools out of us.

666
00:48:43,013 --> 00:48:44,848
Why did he bother to send this message?

667
00:48:45,432 --> 00:48:48,518
I guess he wants to go
on a date with you on a nice day.

668
00:48:48,602 --> 00:48:50,520
Go ahead then, Gaetal. Go ahead!

669
00:48:52,147 --> 00:48:53,732
It's the weather that's nice, not the day.

670
00:48:55,067 --> 00:48:56,485
Today's weather was nice too.

671
00:48:57,778 --> 00:48:59,154
Nice weather...

672
00:49:00,697 --> 00:49:02,199
What's the weather like this week?

673
00:49:04,993 --> 00:49:07,204
Even these gloves
are making a fool out of me.

00:49:07,287 --> 00:49:08,580

00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,669
Hey, see if there's a weather app
on Jung Jin-wook's phone.

677
00:49:16,088 --> 00:49:17,214
Okay.

678
00:49:25,472 --> 00:49:26,890
I don't see anything special.

679
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,023
APPS

680
00:49:39,402 --> 00:49:40,403

682
00:49:45,325 --> 00:49:46,409
I found it!

00:49:46,493 --> 00:49:48,286
You startled me.

684
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,082
-What is it?
-What?

685
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:54,084
I found it!

686
00:49:56,837 --> 00:49:58,547
The secret behind Gaetal's message.

Hello, everyone.

689
00:50:08,432 --> 00:50:10,767
This is <i>The Killing Vote Special.</i>
I'm your host, Chae Do-hee.

690
00:50:10,851 --> 00:50:14,521
After announcing we'd accept stories,
we were flooded with submissions.

691
00:50:14,604 --> 00:50:18,859
Among the numerous heartbreaking
and infuriating stories of the past week,

692
00:50:18,942 --> 00:50:22,904
we'll reveal the story
that received the most likes.

693
00:50:25,532 --> 00:50:27,659
<i>Land? Is this from a reliable source?</i>

00:50:30,537 --> 00:50:33,206
<i>You know my cousin works</i>
<i>for the Ministry of Land, right?</i>

696
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:37,044
{\an8}<i>This is strictly confidential.</i>
<i>Just invest 300 million won.</i>

697
00:50:37,127 --> 00:50:39,755
{\an8}<i>Well, it hasn't even been decided yet.</i>

698
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:41,256
<i>Forget it, then.</i>

699
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:44,259
<i>Once this land is developed,</i>
<i>you'll hit the jackpot.</i>

700
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:46,094
<i>Don't you want to turn your life around?</i>

701
00:50:46,762 --> 00:50:50,515
"Turn your life around."
These words changed his mind.

702
00:50:51,183 --> 00:50:53,101
Only after taking out
hundreds of millions in loans

703
00:50:53,185 --> 00:50:57,939
and being sued by numerous victims
of the real estate scam did he realize...

704
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,193
that he was registered
as the chairman of a real estate agency.

705
00:51:01,276 --> 00:51:03,737
Some higher-up in the back
was looking for you.

706
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,113
Legally, in a situation like this...

707
00:51:05,197 --> 00:51:06,740
Okay. Thanks.

708
00:51:06,823 --> 00:51:08,575
We're with the special investigation unit.

709
00:51:09,326 --> 00:51:10,327
I'm Lieutenant Joo Hyun.

710
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,621
-What's going on?
-Go and see what's going on!

711
00:51:14,831 --> 00:51:16,708
What are you doing?

712
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:19,211
We, the police, will now show you

713
00:51:19,294 --> 00:51:22,464
the truth behind Gaetal
and the Killing Vote.

714
00:51:22,547 --> 00:51:24,508
If you're watching this show,

715
00:51:24,591 --> 00:51:26,968
please take a look
at the apps on your smartphones.

716
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,060
Normally, you cannot download
the same app twice on your smartphone.

717
00:51:35,143 --> 00:51:38,772
{\an8}But look. There are two weather apps.

718
00:51:38,855 --> 00:51:40,315
{\an8}WEATHER APP
WEATHER APP

719
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:41,441
She's right.

720
00:51:42,317 --> 00:51:43,610
Goodness, she's right.

721
00:51:44,736 --> 00:51:46,613
One of them is the hidden app

722
00:51:46,696 --> 00:51:49,282
that Gaetal installed
by illegally hacking your phones.

723
00:52:00,836 --> 00:52:05,132
Default apps like weather and map apps
are typically set for auto-updates.

724
00:52:05,215 --> 00:52:08,135
Gaetal used that to intrude
into your most private spaces.

725
00:52:10,303 --> 00:52:12,389
-Delete it.
<i>-Gaetal hacked everyone's smartphones,</i>

726
00:52:12,472 --> 00:52:14,349
<i>installed an invisible malicious program,</i>

727
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:17,477
<i>and used all of us</i>
<i>to justify his serial murders.</i>

728
00:52:17,978 --> 00:52:19,062
That is Gaetal.

729
00:52:19,896 --> 00:52:21,106
No more,

730
00:52:21,898 --> 00:52:23,066
<i>no less.</i>

731
00:52:26,194 --> 00:52:27,237
I'm going to kill him!

732
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,489
Damn it, I'm going to kill him!

733
00:52:29,573 --> 00:52:31,324
I'm going to kill them all!

734
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:33,326
Please calm down.

735
00:52:38,081 --> 00:52:39,457
Yun-seong!

736
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:41,126
Calm down.

737
00:52:42,627 --> 00:52:44,045
Keep it together and breathe.

738
00:52:44,546 --> 00:52:45,630
Breathe.

739
00:52:47,883 --> 00:52:48,884
Yun-seong.

740
00:52:49,718 --> 00:52:51,636
You don't need to be mad.

741
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,804
This isn't over yet.

742
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:58,351
Honey.

743
00:53:02,022 --> 00:53:05,025
When humans commit crimes together,

744
00:53:05,108 --> 00:53:06,651
they never forget
that feeling of exhilaration.

745
00:53:09,529 --> 00:53:10,864
Just trust me and watch.

746
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,575
To the public,

747
00:53:14,242 --> 00:53:15,702
justice is merely a fantasy.

748
00:53:31,885 --> 00:53:34,221
I told you my arresting skills
have improved.

749
00:53:34,304 --> 00:53:36,681
You ruined my show. I'm going to sue you.

750
00:53:36,765 --> 00:53:38,308
You're the one who started this.

751
00:53:38,391 --> 00:53:40,393
Forcing this stupid show
to air may have been fine,

752
00:53:40,477 --> 00:53:43,688
but revealing confidential case details
to screw us crossed the line.

753
00:53:44,272 --> 00:53:45,273
Wake up!

754
00:53:45,357 --> 00:53:49,861
Your show has nothing to do with justice.
It's just a contract killing show.

755
00:53:49,945 --> 00:53:51,488
Is there no teamwork on your team?

756
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:53,698
If you want deceive,
at least get your stories straight.

757
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:55,533
What are you talking about?

758
00:53:56,368 --> 00:53:58,787
I didn't find this out myself.
You told me.

759
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:03,667
This is why people
call you pigs, not police.

760
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,293
Think about it.

761
00:54:05,377 --> 00:54:07,545
Who would be good at this?

762
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,024
Hyun.

763
00:54:34,322 --> 00:54:36,449
What are you doing? We have to hurry back.

764
00:54:42,956 --> 00:54:46,543
Were you really the one
who tipped them off about Kwon's escape?

765
00:54:49,337 --> 00:54:50,880
Yes.

766
00:54:50,964 --> 00:54:53,425
That was the fastest way
for me to get back to work.

767
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:58,388
Do you have any idea
how much criticism fell on us after that?

768
00:54:58,471 --> 00:55:00,056
That criticism

769
00:55:00,724 --> 00:55:04,227
will be gone once we catch Kwon
and end the Killing Vote. If you bear it--

770
00:55:04,311 --> 00:55:06,771
Then, how is that
any different from Chae Do-hee

771
00:55:06,855 --> 00:55:09,107
and that crazy show
pretending to be for justice?

772
00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:11,776
You've been planting evidence
to catch criminals

773
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,279
and leaking information
to screw over your own team.

774
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,782
To me, that's not what
a good cop would ever do.

775
00:55:17,866 --> 00:55:21,036
A righteous but incompetent cop
or a bad competent one?

776
00:55:21,953 --> 00:55:23,246
Who do we need more?

777
00:55:25,373 --> 00:55:27,167
Being a cop is not just about honor.

778
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,626
Fine!

779
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,879
Let's say you're right.

780
00:55:30,962 --> 00:55:32,130
But still,

781
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,717
I don't want to be your pawn.

782
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:39,596
I'm going back to my original team.

783
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,352
Kwon Seok-joo may be Gaetal,

784
00:55:46,728 --> 00:55:49,105
but we didn't have to make him
look like an evil felon.

785
00:55:51,608 --> 00:55:52,692
You're a total disappointment.

786
00:55:55,153 --> 00:55:57,364
Don't you think
of starting your own investigation.

787
00:55:57,447 --> 00:55:58,948
Don't you dare!

788
00:56:07,374 --> 00:56:11,252
WEATHER APP
WEATHER APP

789
00:56:13,588 --> 00:56:14,714
{\an8}It's surging again.

790
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:17,717
{\an8}He's using enough electricity
for the entire town.

791
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:19,177
{\an8}Gosh, this is electrifying.

792
00:56:21,346 --> 00:56:23,431
{\an8}Everyone must be
frantically looking for Kwon.

793
00:56:23,515 --> 00:56:25,850
{\an8}I feel bad that we're doing this here.

794
00:56:25,934 --> 00:56:27,143
{\an8}Jjoo.

795
00:56:27,227 --> 00:56:28,978
{\an8}Are you sure you want to do this alone?

796
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:32,440
{\an8}There's a reason why Gaetal
gave us a hint about the weather app.

797
00:56:33,024 --> 00:56:36,069
{\an8}If he told the police
about his secret for nothing,

798
00:56:36,152 --> 00:56:38,363
{\an8}then that means
it wasn't a secret anymore.

799
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:41,324
{\an8}He told us about the secret for...

800
00:56:42,158 --> 00:56:43,618
{\an8}Put it into simple words, please?

801
00:56:43,952 --> 00:56:46,037
{\an8}Gaetal's having problems within his team.

802
00:56:46,788 --> 00:56:49,541
{\an8}For instance, the system administrator
lost the entire system,

803
00:56:49,624 --> 00:56:52,085
or they're having internal strife.

804
00:56:52,627 --> 00:56:55,130
Are you saying
Kwon Seok-joo might have lost

805
00:56:55,213 --> 00:56:58,466
his control over the Killing Vote
to Lee Min-soo?

806
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:01,010
Then, his reason for escaping makes sense.

807
00:57:01,094 --> 00:57:02,345
Right?

808
00:57:02,429 --> 00:57:03,430
So that's why

809
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:06,015
I have to look into
Lee Min-soo's computer.

810
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:07,225
No.

811
00:57:07,308 --> 00:57:10,437
There's no way you can do that.
His place has airtight security.

812
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,646
No way.

813
00:57:13,481 --> 00:57:16,067
Jeez. None of these people
deleted the app.

814
00:57:16,151 --> 00:57:18,194
Goodness, nothing has changed.

815
00:57:18,278 --> 00:57:22,031
It's so fun that they'd risk
leaking their personal data.

816
00:57:22,115 --> 00:57:24,451
They can basically kill a person
with one click.

817
00:57:25,326 --> 00:57:26,369
Everyone's gone crazy.

818
00:57:26,453 --> 00:57:28,079
Yes, so it seems.

819
00:57:31,124 --> 00:57:32,667
I BELIEVE THE VOTE WILL HAPPEN

820
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,960
WOULD YOU LIKE TO START THE KILLING VOTE?

821
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:36,504
{\an8}<i>Hello, my fellow citizens.</i>

822
00:57:36,588 --> 00:57:39,215
{\an8}I am well aware
of your loss of faith in me

823
00:57:39,299 --> 00:57:44,179
{\an8}after the unfortunate incident
that took place recently.

824
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:46,473
{\an8}I'll keep it short.

825
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,893
{\an8}I still believe

826
00:57:49,976 --> 00:57:52,103
{\an8}that we are working together

827
00:57:52,187 --> 00:57:54,814
{\an8}to monitor and uphold justice.

828
00:57:55,315 --> 00:58:01,446
{\an8}Therefore, I will take your appeals
from the TV show seriously.

829
00:58:02,155 --> 00:58:03,490
{\an8}Bang Chun-sik.

830
00:58:04,115 --> 00:58:08,203
{\an8}His real estate scam destroyed
numerous families.

831
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:11,289
{\an8}A family crushed by debt and litigation
was pushed to commit suicide

832
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:13,541
{\an8}because of this con artist.

833
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:16,669
{\an8}Will you choose to execute him? Yes?

834
00:58:17,754 --> 00:58:19,088
{\an8}Or no?

835
00:58:19,172 --> 00:58:24,636
{\an8}Now, let the Killing Vote
on Bang Chun-sik begin.

836
00:58:36,689 --> 00:58:38,233
{\an8}Maximum transaction value.

837
00:58:38,316 --> 00:58:39,442
{\an8}And...

838
00:58:39,526 --> 00:58:40,527
{\an8}confirm.

839
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,737
{\an8}Transaction complete.

840
00:58:44,072 --> 00:58:45,573
{\an8}Don't be mad, my friend.

841
00:58:45,657 --> 00:58:48,910
{\an8}Cryptocurrency prices have plummeted,
so I added just a little interest.

842
00:58:57,293 --> 00:59:00,213
Fine. I did pretend to be a victim too.

843
00:59:00,296 --> 00:59:02,006
I sold the land knowing everything.

844
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:06,135
But you didn't have to put all the blame
on me and send me to prison.

845
00:59:06,219 --> 00:59:09,055
My wife and child died because of that.

846
00:59:09,138 --> 00:59:10,598
You scumbag.

847
00:59:14,936 --> 00:59:16,521
Five.

848
00:59:16,604 --> 00:59:17,814
Four.

849
00:59:17,897 --> 00:59:19,816
Three. Two.

850
00:59:19,899 --> 00:59:20,984
One.

851
00:59:22,777 --> 00:59:23,820
Ta-da!

852
00:59:23,903 --> 00:59:24,946
EXECUTE: 53%

853
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,125
Hold on.

854
00:59:38,793 --> 00:59:39,961
Darn it.

855
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,771
It's him, Bang Chun-sik.

856
01:00:00,732 --> 01:00:03,151
The participation rate didn't drop much.

857
01:00:03,735 --> 01:00:06,529
The people who deleted the app
were less than we thought.

858
01:00:06,613 --> 01:00:07,989
How is this possible?

859
01:00:08,072 --> 01:00:10,908
Murder has already become
like a game to them.

860
01:00:10,992 --> 01:00:13,703
Let's first compile a list
of those Bang has scammed.

861
01:00:13,786 --> 01:00:15,955
We'll start with the family
who committed suicide.

862
01:00:22,503 --> 01:00:25,173
We're living in such convenient times.

863
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:28,635
KWON SEOK-JOO, JUNG JIN-WOOK, LEE MIN-SOO

864
01:00:28,718 --> 01:00:31,304
Kwon Seok-joo, Jung Jin-wook, Lee Min-soo.

865
01:00:33,514 --> 01:00:35,433
Let me add Ko Dong-gyu here.

866
01:00:35,516 --> 01:00:36,851
Ko Dong-gyu.

867
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:38,811
-Ko Dong-gyu?
-Why over Lee Min-soo?

868
01:00:38,895 --> 01:00:41,606
Lee Min-soo isn't Gaetal.

869
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,568
{\an8}KO DONG-GYU

870
01:00:46,694 --> 01:00:47,904
Done.

871
01:00:51,991 --> 01:00:56,579
YANG HYE-JIN?

872
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:04,337
Gosh, it's not breathing at all.
Come on, breathe.

873
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,589
The router isn't routing at all.

874
01:01:06,673 --> 01:01:08,091
It must be frustrated.

875
01:01:08,174 --> 01:01:10,009
I'll do my best to fix this.

876
01:01:10,677 --> 01:01:11,719
Excuse me, ma'am.

877
01:01:11,803 --> 01:01:14,347
Is there only one router here?

878
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:17,308
There must be another one upstairs.

879
01:01:17,392 --> 01:01:20,353
I'm not sure if there's one
in their son's bedroom.

880
01:01:21,521 --> 01:01:24,607
You see, someone crashed
into a utility pole nearby,

881
01:01:24,691 --> 01:01:27,193
so the entire neighborhood
lost internet connection.

882
01:01:28,277 --> 01:01:31,781
Since you're using a lot of electricity

883
01:01:31,864 --> 01:01:34,283
and have an expensive internet plan,

884
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:36,828
there must be something upstairs too.

885
01:01:36,911 --> 01:01:39,414
I'm not allowed
into their son's bedroom either.

886
01:01:39,497 --> 01:01:41,791
Please get it done
before my boss's family returns.

887
01:01:42,709 --> 01:01:43,960
Okay.

888
01:01:50,216 --> 01:01:51,592
Connect to the internet in ten.

889
01:01:51,676 --> 01:01:53,636
-To do what?
-Just trust me.

890
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:57,223
Don't!

891
01:02:03,521 --> 01:02:05,356
Jjoo, I got it.

892
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,567
It's working now.

893
01:02:09,777 --> 01:02:11,112
-It's working.
-By the way,

894
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:14,282
could I have a glass of water
before we leave?

895
01:02:15,324 --> 01:02:16,325
One second, please.

896
01:02:36,012 --> 01:02:37,597
What? What's wrong?

897
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,223
My partner? She already left.

898
01:02:39,307 --> 01:02:42,310
She's so busy. She kept getting calls
from other households.

899
01:02:42,393 --> 01:02:43,644
I see.

900
01:02:43,728 --> 01:02:45,938
Thank you.
I will happily drink this water.

901
01:02:50,568 --> 01:02:51,819
Is this water expensive?

902
01:02:53,488 --> 01:02:56,032
Since it's expensive,
I'll have another glass. Thank you.

903
01:03:08,169 --> 01:03:09,295
What's all this?

904
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,267
How can he use
such an expensive security program

905
01:03:23,768 --> 01:03:25,770
without any ethernet sockets in the room?

906
01:03:26,479 --> 01:03:27,939
I don't even see a router.

907
01:03:30,399 --> 01:03:33,152
And there are so many IPs here.
What's going on here?

908
01:03:33,236 --> 01:03:34,737
<i>Maybe he has separate room for it.</i>

909
01:03:34,821 --> 01:03:35,863
Like a study.

910
01:03:36,656 --> 01:03:38,574
The housekeeper never mentioned that.

911
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,620
Darn it.

912
01:04:28,541 --> 01:04:30,126
Weird.

913
01:04:56,193 --> 01:04:57,194
What is this?

914
01:05:00,907 --> 01:05:02,450
There's something here.

915
01:05:07,914 --> 01:05:09,874
Have a good day.

916
01:05:09,957 --> 01:05:11,751
Have a good day, sir.

917
01:05:13,252 --> 01:05:14,879
-Have a good day.
-You too. Bye.

918
01:05:34,357 --> 01:05:36,192
What a weirdo.

919
01:06:10,059 --> 01:06:11,519
I got you now.

920

921
01:06:28,035 --> 01:06:29,537
Where's the computer tower?

922
01:06:30,955 --> 01:06:31,956
There it is.

923
01:06:48,848 --> 01:06:50,808
PASSWORD COMBINER

924
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:15,332
I got it.

925
01:07:37,104 --> 01:07:40,316
I'm on my way home.
Almost there. What about you, Mom?

926

MOVING FILES

927
01:07:55,498 --> 01:07:56,624
What?

928
01:07:56,707 --> 01:07:58,334
He locked the videos.

929
01:07:58,417 --> 01:08:00,169
I can't save or copy them.

930
01:08:00,252 --> 01:08:02,713
Even though you're using his account?

931
01:08:02,797 --> 01:08:04,632
Try changing the security settings.

932
01:08:04,715 --> 01:08:07,468
There are too many things to copy.

933
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,553
I think I'll need more storage space.

934
01:08:11,138 --> 01:08:13,557
I need more storage space.

935
01:08:14,517 --> 01:08:15,893
Darn it.

936
01:08:24,068 --> 01:08:25,111
Wait.

937
01:08:27,696 --> 01:08:28,697
No.

938
01:08:29,824 --> 01:08:31,408
The door's closed!

939
01:08:47,758 --> 01:08:49,927
Damn it!

940
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:51,428
The door's closed.

941
01:08:51,512 --> 01:08:53,139
I'm locked in here!

943
01:08:54,723 --> 01:08:56,267

01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,643

945
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:06,318

01:09:06,402 --> 01:09:08,362
<i>-Wait, I need to calm down.</i>
-What do I do?

947
01:09:08,445 --> 01:09:09,780
<i>Let's stay calm.</i>

948
01:09:16,704 --> 01:09:18,455
There's got to be something here.

949
01:09:23,878 --> 01:09:26,380
You've got to be kidding me.
