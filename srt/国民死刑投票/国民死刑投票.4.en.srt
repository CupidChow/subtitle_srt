00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,680
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
INSTITUTIONS, EVENTS, AND SETTINGS

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,830
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,980
SAFETY OF CHILD ACTORS WAS ENSURED

4
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:16,663
EIGHT YEARS AGO

5
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:56,847
You can't go in, sir.

6
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:01,602
Professor Kwon!

7
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:03,437
You can't go in. Please calm down.

8
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:21,538
No.

9
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:20,389
No!

10
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:46,832
<i>Hi!</i>

11
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:57,009
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

12
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,763
<i>Did I do a good job?</i>

13
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:02,848
<i>Look at this.</i>

14
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:07,019
How is it?

15
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:29,416
<i>Let's go.</i>

16
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,917
<i>Did you record it right?</i>

17
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,769
<i>You're my hero, Dad.</i>

18
00:04:48,852 --> 00:04:50,228
<i>Because you always keep me safe.</i>

19
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:52,481
<i>I love you, Dad.</i>

20
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:55,192
<i>I love you.</i>

21
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:57,986
<i>Bye.</i>

22
00:04:59,363 --> 00:05:01,865
<i>Are you Gaetal?</i>

23
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:07,496
Should I ask you again?

24
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:09,665
Kwon Seok-joo.

25
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:12,834
Do you know anything about Gaetal

26
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:15,087
and the Killing Vote?

27
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,213
It's Byun Woo-taek!

28
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:18,256
Mr. Byun, any comments?

29
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,015
What kind of messed-up law is this?

30
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:28,892
What kind of law
lets a criminal walk free?

31
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,435
-You call that the law?
-But still...

32
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:34,022
We must follow it.

33
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:35,774
Because it's the law.

34
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:39,236
<i>Kim Mu-chan.</i>

35
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:43,740
We were very close in the past,

36
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,118
and he told me that he respected me.

37
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:47,994
And...

38
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:51,123
He also knows about the phrase
"the devils who were deemed innocent."

39
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,256
{\an8}<i>Making sure that those</i>
<i>who deserve to die are dead.</i>

40
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:03,593
{\an8}<i>And calling the villain</i>
<i>on the gallows a victim.</i>

41
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:07,264
-Superintendent Kim Mu-chan.
-Weren't you severely injured?

42
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:08,640
Please tell us what's going on.

43
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,185
{\an8}<i>Tell me,</i>

44
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:13,645
{\an8}<i>Superintendent Kim Mu-chan.</i>

45
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:17,149
{\an8}<i>What is justice for you?</i>

46
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:25,829
THE KILLING VOTE

47
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:28,577
{\an8}KIM REPORTED TO BE IN SERIOUS CONDITION

48
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:31,955
{\an8}EPISODE 4

49
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:34,040
{\an8}<i>Are you watching, Mom?</i>

50
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,877
{\an8}Yeah, I'm watching it.

51
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,973
{\an8}<i>Initially announced</i>
<i>as being in critical condition,</i>

52
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:54,352
{\an8}<i>it was revealed that Superintendent Kim</i>
<i>only sustained minor injuries.</i>

53
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:55,479
{\an8}What?

54
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:57,814
{\an8}Is this the thing
that keeps your heart beating?

55
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:00,484
{\an8}Does that mean
that if it stops, you'll die?

56
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:03,361
{\an8}<i>...and sent the location</i>
<i>of Kim to the press...</i>

57
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:04,529
{\an8}Are you embarrassed?

58
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,990
{\an8}-It's okay--
-Embarrassed?

59
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:16,541
{\an8}<i>The rotten and corrupt police are now</i>
<i>mocking the people with fake news.</i>

60
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,669
{\an8}<i>They distorted the true intention</i>
<i>of The Killing Vote</i>

61
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:22,881
{\an8}<i>and framed me for hurting an innocent cop.</i>

62
00:07:24,883 --> 00:07:26,510
What was so wrong?

63
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:28,470
Our justice is

64
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:32,015
extremely rational.

65
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:39,564
Please give us a comment.

66
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:43,443
What are you going to do?

67
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:51,326
Please give us a few words!

68
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,135
I'm going to make an official statement.

69
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:11,012
So please stop.

70
00:08:11,596 --> 00:08:13,431
Whether you write articles
online or offline,

71
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:14,850
do whatever you want.

72
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:17,811
But I want you to include

73
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:21,815
every single word I'm about to say.

74
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,695
I'm Kim Mu-chan
from the Special Investigation Unit.

75
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:29,030
As the culprit just said,

76
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:31,575
blinded by the urge
to quickly solve the case,

77
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:35,745
I lied to you and pretended
to be seriously injured.

78
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:38,748
I deeply apologize.

79
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,628
Ridiculous.

80
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,338
Is he serious?

81
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:49,175
That's just nonsense.

82
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:53,680
Due to my actions,
I realize you've lost faith in the police.

83
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:56,349
However,

84
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:58,393
even if I could go back in time,

85
00:09:00,228 --> 00:09:01,771
I would choose to do the same.

86
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:04,441
Isn't that crossing the line?

87
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:07,861
He surely knows
how to attract the viewers.

88
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,614
Make it a close-up.
Don't miss a word he says.

89
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:15,911
The culprit has committed murder
on the pretext of rectifying injustices,

90
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:18,580
<i>and he's turned the entire nation</i>
<i>into accomplices.</i>

91
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:21,499
{\an8}<i>Right now, as a criminal receives</i>
<i>more support than the police,</i>

92
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:26,922
<i>I was willing to break rules to catch</i>
<i>this heinous criminal as soon as possible.</i>

93
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:28,548
<i>I hope everyone understands this.</i>

94
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,261
<i>Also...</i>

95
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:37,140
<i>You and The Killing Vote.</i>

96
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,686
{\an8}<i>Don't be mistaken.</i>

97
00:09:42,812 --> 00:09:45,231
{\an8}<i>You're not a hero.</i>

98
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,992
<i>You're clearly a murderer,</i>

99
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:57,827
<i>and your method is wrong.</i>

100
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:02,165
<i>I'm going to catch you no matter what.</i>

101
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:08,380
-Who's behind this?
-Are you resigning?

102
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:09,464
Is the unit disbanded?

103
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:12,008
Don't you think you're hindering
the investigation?

104
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:19,891
Fire!

105
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:21,267
-Where?
-Over there!

106
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:22,978
Run!

107
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:26,648
Fire!

108
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,447
Superintendent Kim!

109
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:35,782
Superintendent Kim!

110
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:38,827
<i>Blinded by the urge</i>
<i>to quickly solve the case,</i>

111
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:42,414
<i>I lied to you and pretended</i>
<i>to be seriously injured.</i>

112
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:45,333
<i>I deeply apologize.</i>

113
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:52,716
You shouldn't think badly of him.

114
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:56,469
You all heard about what he did
until the explosion happened.

115
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:58,888
He tried to save that pathetic woman
in that bad situation

116
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:00,765
even though he knew
it could've killed him too.

117
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:03,935
He was just doing the best he could
to fight the Gaetal craze.

118
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:05,562
Oh, my God!

119
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,397
The traffic on our website is going crazy.

120
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,899
The NPA server is already
about to go down.

121
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:11,443
Insulting posts are flooding in,

122
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:13,278
adding a page per second
to the message boards.

123
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:16,031
The server might really go down
at this rate.

124
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:18,616
You think this is funny?

125
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,784
What are you talking about?

126
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:22,203
I'm moderating the message boards now.

127
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:25,498
Hateful comments create
more hateful comments.

128
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:27,000
Before they keep showing up,

129
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,461
we have to stop them at regular intervals.

130
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:31,171
Then, erase this too.

131
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:33,757
Who does he think he is
to call our leader a psycho?

132
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,341
Can't we track his location?

133
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:36,926
We're not stupid.

134
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:39,971
Did you think we wouldn't understand?

135
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:43,808
How could you not tell us
and keep it all to yourselves?

136
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:46,478
You didn't trust us.

137
00:11:47,312 --> 00:11:48,313
Right?

138
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:51,066
The fewer people involved,
the higher the chances of success.

139
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,193
Hey. Stop mumbling and speak up.

140
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:55,820
The fewer people involved,
the higher the chances of success.

141
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:57,947
It's not that we didn't trust you.

142
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:59,866
We didn't want to drag you into this.

143
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:07,832
Hello, Choi Jin-soo of the SIU speaking.

144
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:13,546
I'm taking off now.

145
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,091
Bae Gi-chul's wife has been
found dead too.

146
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:17,258
-What?
-What?

147
00:12:21,805 --> 00:12:22,847
<i>Don't be mistaken.</i>

148
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:26,309
<i>You're not a hero.</i>

149
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:29,104
<i>You're clearly a murderer,</i>

150
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:31,231
<i>and your method is wrong.</i>

151
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:35,360
<i>I'm going to catch you no matter what.</i>

152
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:44,285
{\an8}<i>As the culprit just said,</i>

153
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,579
blinded by the urge to quickly solve...

154
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:48,498
I was worried this would happen.

155
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,209
Anyway, if people find out
why he came here,

156
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:53,128
both of us will be in trouble.

157
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:54,796
I hope they find out.

158
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,298
So we can find Gaetal.

159
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,093
What do you mean?

160
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:01,636
Wait, Professor Kwon.

161
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:04,389
Are you really connected
with the Killing Vote guy?

162
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:06,558
You're not, are you?

163
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:10,979
If the police hadn't had such suspicions,
they wouldn't have come to me.

164
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:14,274
Kim Mu-chan is not an idiot.

165
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:18,695
If they find out what I did
instead of performing labor,

166
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:21,948
they might believe
the suspicions are true.

167
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:27,412
Are you threatening me?

168
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:32,125
No way.

169
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:35,753
We're not in that situation yet.

170
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:42,302
Come in.

171
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:53,396
ROOKIE POLICE OFFICER
BRAVELY BLOWS THE WHISTLE

172
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:13,082
Inmate 0512.

173
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,500
Keep walking.

174
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:18,796
Inmate 0512.

175
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:25,136
Move.

176
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,971
Keep walking.

177
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:30,725
You little...

178
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:32,352
Motherfucker.

179
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:34,270
Have you lost your mind?

180
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:36,231
Did that tea taste good?

181
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:37,899
You think you're so great?

182
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:40,818
Look at you acting all classy
after murdering a person.

183
00:14:40,902 --> 00:14:43,029
You're nothing more than a murderer.

184
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:45,698
You piece of shit.

185
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:46,991
Because of you scumbags,

186
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:49,285
this country is never going to improve.

187
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:50,787
You useless piece of shit.

188
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,248
-Let go. Die, you bastard.
-Stop!

189
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:02,090
Darn it.

190
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:13,059
The whole country knows your face now.

191
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:15,895
Taking a cab is out of the question,
let alone staying in a hotel

192
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,146
or sleeping on the street.

193
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,857
Everyone is a paparazzi these days.

194
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:23,069
They can instantly post
your photos online, report you, and...

195
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:24,988
What are you doing?

196
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:28,825
Hey.

197
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,618
Still, this is a bit...

198
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:32,704
This isn't right.
I'll just go to Jin-soo's or Sang-jae's.

199
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:34,747
Jo-dan called.

200
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:37,959
He said that the police agency
is now surrounded by reporters

201
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,335
and our unit is quite upset too,

202
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:41,296
so you should hide somewhere tonight.

203
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:44,465
Also, Lieutenant Choi and Detective Kang
are out on duty.

204
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:50,930
Right. This is the bathroom.

205
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:52,849
Okay.

206
00:15:58,313 --> 00:15:59,439
So refreshing.

207
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:00,523
Hyun, you're home?

208
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:27,425
I get that you have nowhere to go
in this humiliating situation,

209
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,261
but you can't just come
to a ladies-only home like this.

210
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:31,971
Don't you have manners?

211
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:33,556
Or common sense?

212
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,891
Min.

213
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,646
Speaking of common sense,

214
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,231
I wonder why teenagers got involved

215
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:45,193
in a dangerous police investigation.
It's against common sense.

216
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:47,028
How could you even go to Kwon's house?

217
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:49,530
Using my common sense,
I just can't understand why.

218
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:51,074
And the kid you were with.

219
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:55,078
He significantly contributed
to our failure in catching the culprit.

220
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:56,245
What's your relationship?

221
00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:00,583
So you're one of those people
who holds grudges for long time.

222
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:05,046
Well, people are condemning me
as a senseless police officer anyway.

223
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:08,091
So I need you to tell me only the facts.

224
00:17:09,258 --> 00:17:12,053
How did you kids end up there?

225
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:14,305
-Look, mister.
-That was my mistake.

226
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:17,892
I was using her computer
when I first found Gaetal's test video.

227
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:19,727
I forgot to erase it afterward,

228
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,147
so she and her friend
found the video and analyzed it.

229
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:27,610
They actually did a great job
analyzing the background noises and space,

230
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:28,820
so I joined them.

231
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:31,322
Then, we found Kwon Seok-joo's place.

232
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:35,827
You found the house thanks to us,
so don't blame her. Okay?

233
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,124
Do you remember anything about him?

234
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:44,252
Any facial or body features?
Or any strange behaviors?

235
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,838
I was attacked from behind,

236
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:48,840
so I didn't really see anything.

237
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:51,592
Well, from the way
he was fighting with you,

238
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:54,262
he seemed to be
a professional martial artist.

239
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:57,723
I was thinking the same.

240
00:17:58,307 --> 00:17:59,308
His smell.

241
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:02,937
The smell?

242
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:05,314
His clothes smelled strange.

243
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:07,108
Ji-hoon, get him.

244
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,276
Let go, Min. Just let him go.

245
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,444
<i>Like a firecracker.</i>

246
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:12,447
<i>He had the same smell</i>
<i>as when you play with fireworks.</i>

247
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:14,866
He smelled like metal too.

248
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:17,827
Firecrackers.

249
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:19,662
Fireworks.

250
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:24,000
Gunpowder.

251
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,629
Wait.

252
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:31,299
Could he be the same person
who blew up the car?

253
00:18:31,883 --> 00:18:34,010
He might be Gaetal then.

254
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:38,514
Your sister's pretty quick-witted.

255
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:39,807
She wants to be a reporter.

256
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:41,350
You should try to avoid her.

257
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:45,021
If I'd held onto him longer,
we would've caught the man.

258
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:46,355
It's all Ji-hoon's fault.

259
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:48,900
Actually, no.

260
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:52,945
There are tons of people to be judged,
so Gaetal can't get caught just yet.

261
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:56,282
I thought you wanted to be a reporter.

262
00:18:56,365 --> 00:18:57,742
Are you taking the murderer's side?

263
00:18:58,493 --> 00:19:01,537
It is not wrong to punish
criminals who are set free

264
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:02,997
by incompetent authorities.

265
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,917
And who gave Gaetal
the right to do that? You?

266
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:07,627
The law?

267
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:12,798
Nobody has the right to kill a person

268
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:15,885
nor can one person change the rules
for an entire society.

269
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:17,720
That's what you have to criticize first.

270
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:19,972
I guess you've never experienced
injustice in your life.

271
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:22,391
-Enough.
-I bet you never had to see someone

272
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,393
live a good life
after murdering your family.

273
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:27,188
Because if it ever happened to you,

274
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:30,733
you wouldn't stick to your ideals
and blame Gaetal.

275
00:19:38,658 --> 00:19:39,700
What if I have?

276
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:45,706
If I've been through the same thing,

277
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:48,417
do I have the right to arrest him?

278
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:51,796
Hey, mister.

279
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:53,089
People call you a smart-ass, right?

280
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:55,424
Right back at you.

281
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:56,717
He's so annoying.

282
00:19:56,801 --> 00:19:58,719
Min, wait...

283
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:09,105
Darn it.

284
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:31,460
Hey.

285
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:33,254
I told you to give it a rest.

286
00:20:33,337 --> 00:20:35,965
You can't be so honest all the time.
You'll get in real trouble.

287
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:37,258
Aren't you even scared?

288
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:43,389
Come to the station
as soon as school's over tomorrow.

289
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:45,016
We need your statement.

290
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:46,434
Why should I?

291
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:49,228
Because you and your friend
saw the culprit.

292
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:51,814
Don't be scared.
Just tell them what you saw.

293
00:20:53,107 --> 00:20:54,108
Whatever!

294
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,651
The neighbors are going to gossip,

295
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:57,987
so kick him out early tomorrow.

296
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,656
And tell him to empty our recycle bin.

297
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,618
Fine.

298
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:06,412
Jeez, that temper of hers...

299
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:14,086
<i>You held a press conference on a whim?</i>

300
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,505
<i>What are you going to do</i>
<i>about this disgrace?</i>

301
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:17,590
What's more important is

302
00:21:17,673 --> 00:21:20,092
how Gaetal got the video.

303
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:21,886
We must resume the investigation now.

304
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:24,805
<i>Forget it.</i>
<i>Just lie low until I call you again.</i>

305
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:27,683
<i>-And don't talk to anyone.</i>
-I'll go back to the unit.

306
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,769
You clean up the mess,
and I'll catch Gaetal.

307
00:21:29,852 --> 00:21:31,020
That's the only way to handle

308
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:32,730
-this humiliation.
<i>-Kim Mu-chan, you--</i>

309
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:33,856
Good gracious!

310
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:52,291
{\an8}Don't bother arguing with the higher-ups.

311
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,709
{\an8}It won't do you any good.

312
00:21:54,418 --> 00:21:57,380
{\an8}Now, I'm reminded of someone.

313
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:58,464
{\an8}And that bad breath.

314
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,697
{\an8}Oh, this.

315
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:26,742
I got it from a car accident
when I was 20.

316
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:28,786
Hot shrapnel hit me.

317
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:35,459
Whenever I'm stressed out,

318
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:37,378
it starts burning.

319
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,174
Were your parents in the car

320
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:44,468
when you had the accident?

321
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:47,179
It's a common story.

322
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:50,349
At least I was all grown up
when they passed.

323
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:53,436
But my sister was still...

324
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,939
She saw our parents die,

325
00:22:58,399 --> 00:22:59,942
so she's a little too protective of me.

326
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:03,404
She's probably afraid of ending up alone.

327
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:07,199
That's why she insisted
on following me yesterday.

328
00:23:10,286 --> 00:23:11,454
It's all my fault.

329
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:23,799
Now it's your turn to open up.

330
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:26,886
Kwon Seok-joo was talking to you

331
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:31,265
as if you were Gaetal.

332
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:34,852
And there must've been a reason for it.

333
00:23:36,854 --> 00:23:40,524
What happened between you two?

334
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:03,339
EIGHT YEARS AGO

335
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:06,258
I don't like this. I feel stuffy.

336
00:24:07,384 --> 00:24:08,385
I feel so stuffy.

337
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,433
Five charges of sexual harassment.

338
00:24:14,517 --> 00:24:16,602
Two charges each of trespassing
and sexual assault.

339
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:18,729
Since he was a minor
with an intellectual disability,

340
00:24:18,813 --> 00:24:20,773
he always had his sentences reduced

341
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:22,483
or he settled with the victims.

342
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:23,943
I bet it cost a fortune too.

343
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:26,570
I wonder what kind of parents would pay

344
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:28,823
for all those settlements
for such a scumbag.

345
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:30,282
But the thing is...

346
00:24:30,366 --> 00:24:32,910
He's registered at the chairman
of Samdo Steel's address.

347
00:24:34,537 --> 00:24:36,872
You know his new wife
is an assemblywoman, right?

348
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:39,542
I'm not interested in politics.

349
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,669
Apparently, his father
is the chairman's driver

350
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:43,921
and his mother is the housekeeper there.

351
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:47,174
It seems the chairman paid
for his lawyer and settlement.

352
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:48,968
They're like family, I hear.

353
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:52,346
I bet he has money to burn,

354
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:54,849
but there must be a reason
why he paid the settlements

355
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,892
for his employee's son.

356
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:00,062
FINAL TRIAL OF BYUN WOO-TAEK

357
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:01,146
Your Honor.

358
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,731
We just received the DNA test results

359
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:05,526
{\an8}from an object belonging to the victim
that was found belatedly.

360
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:07,903
Permission to submit
this as additional evidence?

361
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:11,699
What's odd is that this new evidence
the police found

362
00:25:11,782 --> 00:25:13,784
looks very similar to... No.

363
00:25:15,286 --> 00:25:17,246
It's identical to the toy.

364
00:25:19,248 --> 00:25:21,125
Order in the court. Silence!

365
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:31,176
This is the plush toy
the victim always carried around.

366
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,178
A deliver worker
who'd often run into the victim

367
00:25:33,262 --> 00:25:35,514
found this in front of her house
and reported it.

368
00:25:35,598 --> 00:25:36,807
We had a DNA test done on it,

369
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:38,559
but unlike the prosecution's evidence,

370
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:41,979
neither the defendant's fingerprints
nor his DNA was found

371
00:25:42,396 --> 00:25:43,397
on this plush toy.

372
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:49,320
{\an8}Results show the only fingerprints
found on it belonged to the victim

373
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:51,238
and her friends and family.

374
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:54,825
Prosecution, are you sure
the toy in the photo is the victim's?

375
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:56,368
Prosecutor, please explain.

376
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:03,876
We will announce the verdict.

377
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,669
To summarize the charges,

378
00:26:05,753 --> 00:26:08,881
the defendant Byun Woo-taek
is charged with kidnapping,

379
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:12,092
killing, and concealing the body
of Kwon Na-rae.

380
00:26:12,176 --> 00:26:15,512
Initially, the defendant
admitted these charges to the police,

381
00:26:15,596 --> 00:26:18,307
but later retracted his statement
during the court proceedings,

382
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,602
which led to the loss of validity
of his confession.

383
00:26:22,353 --> 00:26:24,813
Moreover, the prosecution
claimed a plush toy

384
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:27,942
with an unidentified bloodstain
and the defendant's DNA

385
00:26:28,025 --> 00:26:30,194
belonged to the victim.

386
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:33,656
However, it was deemed to be
a different piece of evidence

387
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:35,824
from the toy the defense submitted.

388
00:26:35,908 --> 00:26:39,203
So in accordance with Article 325
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

389
00:26:39,286 --> 00:26:40,746
I declare the defendant innocent.

390
00:26:41,872 --> 00:26:43,248
Your Honor.

391
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,446
-Are we going home?
-Yes, let's go.

392
00:27:14,738 --> 00:27:15,823
Let's go home.

393
00:27:20,828 --> 00:27:21,870
Let's go.

394
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,331
Let's go home.

395
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:51,734
Thank you.

396
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,706
Hello.

397
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:38,197
Stop it.

398
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:41,325
Seok-joo...

399
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:49,750
<i>The culprit was set free</i>
<i>practically because of me,</i>

400
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,919
so he must deeply resent me.

401
00:28:52,836 --> 00:28:55,839
And that led to Kwon Seok-joo killing him,

402
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:58,675
so in a way, it is all my fault.

403
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:03,555
We investigate and catch criminals,

404
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:05,474
but we don't judge them, so why?

405
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,436
If Kwon Seok-joo still resents you,

406
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,232
I think it just means
that he needs someone to blame.

407
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:17,736
Maybe.

408
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,324
By the way,

409
00:29:22,449 --> 00:29:24,785
I wonder where Gaetal got
the video of Seorae High.

410
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:28,205
Judging by the conversation in the video,
students must've filmed it.

411
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:32,459
The Cyber Bureau had kept an eye online

412
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:35,170
in case someone uploaded the video,
but they didn't find anything.

413
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:38,048
Gaetal can't have approached
the kids first.

414
00:29:38,841 --> 00:29:40,425
Let's find the kids who filmed it first.

415
00:29:40,968 --> 00:29:42,177
Then, we might find something.

416
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:05,701
She was strangled to death

417
00:30:06,201 --> 00:30:08,912
with something that's about 2 cm thick.

418
00:30:08,996 --> 00:30:11,999
The bruises on her shoulders
suggest that he stepped on them

419
00:30:12,082 --> 00:30:14,501
to strangle her more forcefully.

420
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:18,088
The killer is presumed
to be a man about 180 cm tall.

421
00:30:18,172 --> 00:30:19,882
Since there's no ligature mark,

422
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:22,176
it seems that he used something
that's elastic.

423
00:30:22,843 --> 00:30:24,595
I'll take a look at past cases for this.

424
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:27,764
{\an8}The victim's heels are severely scraped

425
00:30:27,848 --> 00:30:30,601
{\an8}and her fingers show redness,
which shows she resisted.

426
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:35,314
It seems she fought hard against him.

427
00:30:35,397 --> 00:30:38,150
Then, the perpetrator
must have been injured too, right?

428
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:40,861
In most cases,
victims scratch the perpetrators' hands.

429
00:30:41,778 --> 00:30:43,614
But this time, we only found

430
00:30:43,697 --> 00:30:46,158
a little bit of latex
from under the victim's fingernails.

431
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:48,702
I don't think
the murderer was Gaetal this time.

432
00:30:48,785 --> 00:30:50,662
The man I fought with
at Kwon Seok-joo's place

433
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:52,581
was muscular and good at martial arts.

434
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:55,459
He would've killed her right away.

435
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:56,585
Then, who did this?

436
00:30:56,668 --> 00:30:59,254
<i>Who in the world</i>
<i>are we supposed to go after?</i>

437
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,929
SELF-STUDY

438
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:08,657
-Did you make a reservation?
-Yes.

439
00:32:10,158 --> 00:32:12,828
You'd like to resell
the Moon Night Blossom model, right?

440
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:13,912
Yes.

441
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:15,706
It seems you're a new customer.

442
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:16,873
Was it a gift?

443
00:32:16,957 --> 00:32:19,668
Stop asking me questions.
You're annoying me.

444
00:32:20,252 --> 00:32:22,421
You didn't bring the case
and the warranty card.

445
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:25,090
{\an8}Then, I'm afraid we can't take this back.

446
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:26,842
{\an8}You've got to be kidding me.

447
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:28,844
{\an8}I know this one's a limited edition,

448
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:32,139
{\an8}so I can resell it
without the warranty card.

449
00:32:32,222 --> 00:32:33,473
{\an8}Right.

450
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:35,726
{\an8}By the way, aren't you an actress?

451
00:32:38,312 --> 00:32:39,438
{\an8}No, I'm not.

452
00:32:40,397 --> 00:32:42,024
{\an8}Hello, ma'am.

453
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:43,191
{\an8}Hey.

454
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:51,616
{\an8}-Close the store.
-Yes, ma'am.

455
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,168
{\an8}Are you crazy?

456
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:03,795
{\an8}You know I can destroy
your son's life instantly, right?

457
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:05,297
{\an8}You're very loud.

458
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:08,550
{\an8}My neck hurts. Sit down.

459
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:17,684
{\an8}Are you crazy, lady?

460
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,312
{\an8}I picked the one
that suits where you belong,

461
00:33:20,395 --> 00:33:21,730
{\an8}so just keep your mouth shut.

462
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:30,030
If you ever say anything
about my son to anyone,

463
00:33:30,113 --> 00:33:32,074
it won't end like this then.

464
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:38,789
Are you kidding me?

465
00:33:38,872 --> 00:33:40,290
A 100-million-won watch

466
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:43,460
for this?

467
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,463
You should've put in some more then.

468
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:50,467
This is the problem with kids these days.

469
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:54,262
They just don't know their place
and keep wanting more.

470
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:59,684
You'll have to change jobs
starting tomorrow.

471
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:13,073
Right. I want you to order
the jewelry you recommended.

472
00:34:13,156 --> 00:34:14,908
I love it.

473
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:16,410
Thank you, ma'am.

474
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,388
Guys, look.

475
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:38,557
What is it?

476
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:41,810
What's happening?

477
00:34:46,815 --> 00:34:48,483
Should we call someone?

478
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:54,614
Guys.

479
00:34:54,698 --> 00:34:57,033
When you borrow money,
you need to pay back in time.

480
00:34:57,117 --> 00:34:59,786
I worked hard to earn that, you know.

481
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,872
You forced me to borrow it.

482
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,708
Listen to this bitch.

483
00:35:07,169 --> 00:35:08,712
The reason for that is

484
00:35:09,379 --> 00:35:11,506
you were too proud to ask me,

485
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,800
so I was being considerate.

486
00:35:13,884 --> 00:35:14,926
Aren't you grateful?

487
00:35:15,218 --> 00:35:16,720
Hey, friend.

488
00:35:16,803 --> 00:35:17,929
Pay the interest first.

489
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:20,849
The interest for 5,000 won is 50,000 won?
That's nonsense.

490
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:22,934
-I'm not paying that.
-Nonsense?

491
00:35:23,018 --> 00:35:25,604
It's not like we're stealing money
from you, is it?

492
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:27,647
Answer me, you bastard.

493
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:33,445
How about we make it fair and vote on it?

494
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:37,199
Guys, come here.

495
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:41,745
Who thinks what I'm doing is wrong?

496
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:43,455
Anyone?

497
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:46,041
Think about it. I just want my money back.

498
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:49,252
Raise your hand
if you think what I'm doing is wrong.

499
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:51,922
If over half of us think so,
I'll admit it.

500
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:53,340
No one?

501
00:35:54,174 --> 00:35:55,300
No one?

502
00:35:55,383 --> 00:35:56,801
-Okay.
-I do.

503
00:35:58,178 --> 00:35:59,221
Isn't that So-ra?

504
00:36:03,308 --> 00:36:05,185
You know you look ridiculous, right?

505
00:36:05,977 --> 00:36:08,355
Playing loan shark
and Killing Vote at school?

506
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:10,315
You think this is a game?

507
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:19,908
Guys, stand up.

508
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:21,284
Come on. Let's go.

509
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,792
That crazy little...

510
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:30,585
You little...

511
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,975
You think you own that air purifier?

512
00:36:51,058 --> 00:36:53,477
I'm feeling so stuffy.

513
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:56,105
I can't breathe.

514
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:57,731
Don't be selfish.

515
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,149
You're blocking it.

516
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:01,402
The air isn't circulating properly.

517
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,237
Why don't you turn on the AC then?

518
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,321
God, just move.

519
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:05,948
Then, everything will be fine.

520
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:07,032
Turn up the purifier.

521
00:37:07,116 --> 00:37:08,993
We all need to cool off.

522
00:37:10,536 --> 00:37:12,413
WIND SPEED

523
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,581
Sir.

524
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:38,147
I'm sorry.

525
00:37:41,317 --> 00:37:42,610
Let it slide just this once.

526
00:37:49,742 --> 00:37:51,452
I'm not afraid of the reporters

527
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,912
or the people cussing at me,

528
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,166
but I was mad at myself

529
00:37:57,249 --> 00:37:59,251
for getting all of you blamed too.

530
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,963
If you don't want me
to be your leader anymore,

531
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,048
I'll accept that.

532
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:06,383
So just say it.

533
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,344
This is hilarious.

534
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:12,890
Stop it. We know you'd rather die
than saying sorry.

535
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:14,892
This isn't like you.

536
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:16,685
You're alive. That's what matters.

537
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:18,062
Just treat us to some beef.

538
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:19,813
Yoon-ji.

539
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:23,108
Are you sure just some beef would do?

540
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:26,779
And beef brisket for the last course.

541
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:33,952
In hard times like this,
we must stick together.

542
00:38:34,036 --> 00:38:35,037
Let's just move on.

543
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,414
But the superintendent's morality
has been questioned--

544
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:40,000
No, Jjoo. This is a limited edition...

545
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,251
Darn it.

546
00:38:45,798 --> 00:38:47,091
Darn it.

547
00:38:49,051 --> 00:38:51,303
{\an8}This is where Bae Gi-chul's wife
was killed.

548
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:52,888
{\an8}We haven't found any suspects

549
00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:55,349
{\an8}around the estimated time of death, but...

550
00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:58,394
The culprit doesn't seem
to be a first-timer.

551
00:38:59,186 --> 00:39:00,771
He doesn't seem to be an expert though.

552
00:39:00,854 --> 00:39:02,940
Still, he could be a hitman.

553
00:39:03,023 --> 00:39:05,526
We're making a list
of ex-convicts with similar MOs.

554
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,112
There's a good chance

555
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:10,364
that he pretended to be Gaetal
to confuse us.

556
00:39:10,447 --> 00:39:13,075
Let the local precinct
take care of this case for now.

557
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:15,953
They could start
with possible enemies of the victim.

558
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:18,122
What about the guy from Kwon's house?

559
00:39:18,205 --> 00:39:20,499
<i>It might be the same culprit</i>
<i>for both cases.</i>

560
00:39:20,582 --> 00:39:23,919
He must know the area well.
He sneaked out through blind spots.

561
00:39:24,503 --> 00:39:26,255
One camera caught his face,

562
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:27,965
but it's hard to identify
someone in a mask.

563
00:39:30,426 --> 00:39:32,094
-Hyun.
-Yes?

564
00:39:32,177 --> 00:39:35,305
Are your sister and her friend
coming to give their statements today?

565
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:37,516
I have something to ask her friend.

566
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,268
They should've been here by now.

567
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:40,728
I'll check what's going on.

568
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,356
MIN'S HOMEROOM TEACHER

569
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:48,986
Wait. There.

570
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:54,908
Hello, this is Min's older sister.

571
00:39:58,746 --> 00:39:59,747
Superintendent Kim, that man...

572
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,420
{\an8}I think he's that taxi driver.

573
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,589
{\an8}-Ko Dong-gyu.
-Right?

574
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:10,966
But what was he doing there?

575
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:16,555
I'll be right back.

576
00:40:16,638 --> 00:40:18,182
My sister is hurt.

577
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,768
What? Min...

578
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:29,943
Who will be the next one?
I'm already scared.

579
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:32,613
I actually kind of like Gaetal.

580
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,531
For innocent people like us,

581
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:36,867
it's quite satisfying to watch the voting,

582
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,410
like a breath of fresh air.

583
00:40:38,494 --> 00:40:40,704
I agree. I like Gaetal too.

584
00:40:42,748 --> 00:40:43,749
Dr. Oh.

585
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:45,709
That patient is still under anesthesia.

586
00:40:46,293 --> 00:40:47,336
Is that so?

587
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,797
She should wake up soon.

588
00:40:50,506 --> 00:40:51,924
Let me check on her again.

589
00:40:53,926 --> 00:40:55,177
Ms. Lee Eun-ha?

590
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,683
You should wake up now.

591
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,461
Your heart rate seems stable.

592
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,130
Excuse me. Hello?

593
00:41:32,714 --> 00:41:33,757
I'll be right there.

594
00:41:33,841 --> 00:41:34,842
That pervert--

595
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,262
Are you okay?

596
00:41:39,638 --> 00:41:41,598
Are you being nosy again?
You want more trouble?

597
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:44,434
You're being a total nuisance now.

598
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:47,521
Should I just leave him, then?
I'm sure he was taking photos of her.

599
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,986
Acting without solid evidence
is just being nosy.

600
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:56,154
You can't even catch them that way.

601
00:41:57,406 --> 00:41:59,783
I know people like him pretty well.

602
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,786
You need to collect more evidence

603
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,246
and take them down in one swoop.

604
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:07,040
But while I do that,
there will be more victims.

605
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,960
That can't be avoided.

606
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:12,004
Now, that's a load of crap.

607
00:42:12,087 --> 00:42:14,882
I'd rather be a complete nuisance

608
00:42:16,258 --> 00:42:17,426
than a coward.

609
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,344
Being a nuisance is better.

610
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:26,560
What?

611
00:42:31,106 --> 00:42:34,484
The offending students
are being investigated by the police now.

612
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:36,069
Have you decided what to do?

613
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,529
He's not too hurt,

614
00:42:37,613 --> 00:42:40,073
so covering the hospital bill
should be enough.

615
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,950
-Are you sure?
-You'll see later--

616
00:42:42,034 --> 00:42:43,619
I'm looking for a student.

617
00:42:43,702 --> 00:42:46,413
Joo Min from Seorae High.
She's a school violence victim.

618
00:42:46,496 --> 00:42:47,789
One moment, please.

619
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:49,541
-Are you Min's sister?
-What?

620
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:52,169
Hello, I'm Min's homeroom teacher.

621
00:42:53,378 --> 00:42:56,757
It's just a minor scratch,
so you don't have to worry too much.

622
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,676
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

623
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,386
It's nice to meet you too.

624
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,764
Min's injury is minor
thanks to her friend Ji-hoon,

625
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,975
who got hurt more severely
trying to protect her.

626
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:09,519
The offenders are being investigated
by the police now.

627
00:43:09,603 --> 00:43:11,772
I'll go check on them
once Ji-hoon is done here.

628
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:14,483
Is Ji-hoon badly hurt?

629
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,026
Hyun.

630
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:18,946
You!

631
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,989
Hey, I'm a patient.

632
00:43:21,073 --> 00:43:22,950
You were being nosy again, weren't you?

633
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,618
You could die, you know.

634
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:25,994
I was in the pursuit of justice.

635
00:43:26,078 --> 00:43:28,080
Justice, my foot. Shut that mouth.

636
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:33,293
Ji-hoon, Min owes you once again.

637
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,003
Thank you so much, and I'm sorry.

638
00:43:35,087 --> 00:43:38,215
Well, I was in the pursuit of justice too.

639
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:40,342
So it's okay.

640
00:43:40,425 --> 00:43:42,302
I'll pay for the hospital bill,

641
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,554
so make sure to take care
of your injuries. Okay?

642
00:43:45,597 --> 00:43:46,598
Okay.

643
00:43:46,682 --> 00:43:48,684
Right. This is Ji-hoon's grandmother.

644
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:50,394
She works here at the hospital.

645
00:43:50,477 --> 00:43:53,563
You must be so worried. I'm so sorry.

646
00:43:53,647 --> 00:43:56,024
Your grandson got hurt
because of my sister.

647
00:43:56,108 --> 00:43:57,776
I'm terribly sorry.

648
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:00,362
The wound is not as serious as it seems.

649
00:44:00,445 --> 00:44:02,406
Don't worry about it.

650
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:04,658
Still, he needs to concentrate
on his studies.

651
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:06,118
I'll take good care of him.

652
00:44:07,577 --> 00:44:08,620
Ji-hoon.

653
00:44:08,704 --> 00:44:10,872
I'll tell Min to take you
to the doctor regularly.

654
00:44:10,956 --> 00:44:12,165
Get well soon.

655
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:15,002
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

656
00:44:16,628 --> 00:44:18,005
I'm sorry.

657
00:44:18,797 --> 00:44:21,049
I need to head to the police station now.

658
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:23,760
Ji-hoon, rest up.
I'll see you again later.

659
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:25,303
Yes, of course.

660
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,056
-I'm sorry.
-Get well soon.

661
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,599
Bye.

662
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,608
You better stay away from her.

663
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:42,446
Her sister is a cop, so imagine
how precarious her life is.

664
00:44:43,697 --> 00:44:44,948
I will.

665
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,785
What happened today
will never happen again.

666
00:44:49,911 --> 00:44:51,038
I really hope not.

667
00:44:53,081 --> 00:44:54,207
You can go now.

668
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,927
I'm sorry we had to meet
under these circumstances.

669
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:08,013
I'll guide her better.

670
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:09,097
Don't worry about it.

671
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:11,266
I don't need your guidance.
I'm good on my own.

672
00:45:13,518 --> 00:45:16,271
By the way, I only heard
that it was school violence.

673
00:45:16,354 --> 00:45:19,149
Will Min have to answer questions
during the investigation?

674
00:45:19,232 --> 00:45:20,650
Who are the offenders?

675
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:22,694
They were born evil.

676
00:45:22,778 --> 00:45:24,279
I should've put them behind bars.

677
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:25,947
-Hey.
-The offenders are

678
00:45:26,031 --> 00:45:28,992
so-called bullies from our school.

679
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:32,370
Min and Ji-hoon were trying
to stop them from bullying other kids.

680
00:45:32,454 --> 00:45:34,164
Ji-hoon's grandmother says

681
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:36,500
that she'll settle
for paying the hospital bills,

682
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:39,127
but we don't know
what the police will say.

683
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:42,506
The police said they might call Min
to hear about what happened.

684
00:45:43,256 --> 00:45:45,509
I'll check that
with the patrol station in charge.

685
00:45:46,468 --> 00:45:48,178
Right. I hear you're a police officer.

686
00:45:48,261 --> 00:45:50,931
Why don't you come
and give a special career lecture?

687
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:53,100
Sure. I'd be glad to help.

688
00:45:53,809 --> 00:45:54,976
I'll see you around.

689
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,561
All right. Have a good night.

690
00:45:56,645 --> 00:45:57,938
See you tomorrow.

691
00:46:00,148 --> 00:46:01,233
Isn't he awesome?

692
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:05,862
You're such an embarrassment.

693
00:46:16,123 --> 00:46:18,625
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER
RESPECTING HUMANITY

694
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,127
DEAR PROF. KWON
FROM YOUR NO. 1 FAN

695
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,296
Was this really sent to Kwon?

696
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,923
Yes. Look here.

697
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:30,178
The prison name, inmate name,
and inmate number were all written here.

698
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:33,932
You've got to be kidding me.

699
00:46:34,015 --> 00:46:36,852
This is not a good time
with the Killing Vote and all.

700
00:46:38,353 --> 00:46:40,772
If this gets out,
Inmate 0512 will have to be transferred.

701
00:46:42,482 --> 00:46:43,483
Well...

702
00:46:44,025 --> 00:46:45,652
I'm just worried.

703
00:46:45,735 --> 00:46:48,989
They'll select a new commissioner soon,
so there might be an audit.

704
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:50,949
Everything you've done for him...

705
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:53,118
Some people will get the wrong idea.

706
00:46:54,953 --> 00:46:56,454
You're right.

707
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,624
I've been quite nice to Inmate 0512.

708
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,793
Sir.

709
00:47:01,877 --> 00:47:03,628
He's a murderer.

710
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,215
Those who got human blood on their hands

711
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:08,508
never change.

712
00:47:10,677 --> 00:47:11,845
You should just get rid of him.

713
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:54,054
Hi, Hyun. It's been a while.

714
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:56,431
I was so surprised to see you
with Superintendent Kim.

715
00:47:56,514 --> 00:47:57,933
Why didn't you say you joined the unit?

716
00:47:58,016 --> 00:48:00,477
Let's skip the small talk
or we'll upset each other.

717
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:02,354
Give me Gaetal's contact.

718
00:48:02,979 --> 00:48:04,272
Why would I have that?

719
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,067
I heard you gave it to other reporters.

720
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,778
I know you heard everything
from Gaetal in advance.

721
00:48:10,362 --> 00:48:11,363
Forget it.

722
00:48:11,446 --> 00:48:13,949
If you don't have his contact,
tell me how to reach him.

723
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:16,910
{\an8}Hyun, you're still so cute.

724
00:48:17,577 --> 00:48:19,579
{\an8}This is why working with you
was so much fun.

725
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:21,248
{\an8}Fun?

726
00:48:22,457 --> 00:48:23,500
{\an8}Did you say "fun"?

727
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,585
{\an8}My gosh.

728
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,045
{\an8}I guess scumbag reporters think

729
00:48:27,128 --> 00:48:30,882
{\an8}it's fun to make a person
look like a traitor for a scoop.

730
00:48:30,966 --> 00:48:32,717
{\an8}Speaking of which,

731
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:34,970
{\an8}what did I do that was so wrong?

732
00:48:35,553 --> 00:48:37,013
{\an8}It's a fact that Min Ji-young

733
00:48:37,097 --> 00:48:39,099
{\an8}led a DDoS attack
against the election committee.

734
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:42,686
{\an8}And you were the one who got mad
about your superiors covering it up.

735
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:44,938
{\an8}All of my stories are based on facts.

736
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:46,606
{\an8}You revealed my real name!

737
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,317
{\an8}Thanks to that, my team leader was fired
and I was the scapegoat.

738
00:48:49,401 --> 00:48:50,860
But you also got a promotion.

739
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:54,197
Shouldn't we call it even?

740
00:48:58,952 --> 00:49:00,203
About the Killing Vote,

741
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:03,832
it seems to be bringing
all our enemies from the past together.

742
00:49:04,874 --> 00:49:07,627
I think there was something
between your leader and Min Ji-young too.

743
00:49:08,044 --> 00:49:09,921
Do you know anything about it?

744
00:49:17,095 --> 00:49:18,096
You know what?

745
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:21,599
Thanks to scumbag reporters,
my arresting skills have improved.

746
00:49:21,683 --> 00:49:22,726
So let's call it even.

747
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:24,686
Now, tell me how you reached Gaetal.

748
00:49:24,769 --> 00:49:27,314
Let go! I don't know anything. Let go!

749
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:31,026
Then, who sent the video of my leader
at the prison to Gaetal?

750
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:33,737
Do you want me to go through
your company's server?

751
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,114
Investigate it then
instead of assaulting me!

752
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:38,450
You.

753
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:40,493
You stabbed the police in the back,

754
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,412
and I will never let that slide.

755
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:45,915
I swear I will shake you down.

756
00:49:52,881 --> 00:49:55,633
I know you're doing this
because you can't find evidence.

757
00:49:59,846 --> 00:50:01,181
That psycho...

758
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:10,607
THE TRUTH BEHIND THE CAR EXPLOSION

759
00:50:13,693 --> 00:50:14,694
DELETE

760
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:17,030
YOUR INBOX IS EMPTY

761
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,537
This one's good.

762
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:30,168
It's almost too sweet though.

763
00:50:34,172 --> 00:50:35,173
This.

764
00:50:37,175 --> 00:50:38,676
Explain it.

765
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,262
I took the photo myself.

766
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,431
It's a letter sent to Kwon Seok-joo.

767
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:46,267
What I want to know is

768
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,811
when

769
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,146
and where you got it.

770
00:50:51,606 --> 00:50:54,067
Since Inmate 0512 was transferred here,

771
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,443
he's received tons of letters.

772
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:58,154
"What Inmate 0512 did wasn't murder."

773
00:50:58,238 --> 00:50:59,739
"It's technically self-defense."

774
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,157
Bullshit letters like that.

775
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:03,910
Since this was such a big case
and got a lot of attention,

776
00:51:03,993 --> 00:51:06,746
the warden made us
inspect his mail for the first time.

777
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,082
Because he didn't want
to be held responsible

778
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:10,917
for any weird letter he could get.

779
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,628
That's how we found

780
00:51:14,587 --> 00:51:15,964
his number one fan.

781
00:51:19,259 --> 00:51:20,301
Number one fan?

782
00:51:28,643 --> 00:51:29,644
NO. 1 FAN

783
00:51:29,727 --> 00:51:30,979
<i>One letter per month.</i>

784
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,149
<i>This person's been sending letters</i>
<i>for years without fail.</i>

785
00:51:34,232 --> 00:51:36,985
At first, I thought it was
just another psycho.

786
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:38,778
But since the letters kept coming in,

787
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:42,407
I started to take a closer look
at this Number One Fan's letters.

788
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:48,246
Just a nice big sum. No more, no less.

789
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,254
Are you suggesting a deal right now?

790
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,631
Between us civil servants?

791
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:01,092
Yes. And only in cash.

792
00:52:01,176 --> 00:52:02,719
I'm sure you know how it works.

793
00:52:02,802 --> 00:52:05,555
Did you think I'd say yes to that?

794
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:08,933
Once you read them,

795
00:52:09,017 --> 00:52:11,311
you'll know why I'm doing this.

796
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,363
Come on.

797
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:30,413
Park Chul-min,
you're under arrest for violating

798
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:33,291
Criminal Act, Article 316
and Postal Service Act, Article 48,

799
00:52:33,374 --> 00:52:35,793
for unlawful possession
of someone else's postal mail.

800
00:52:35,877 --> 00:52:37,754
You'll be charged with theft too.

801
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,132
I'll take the letters as evidence.

802
00:52:41,216 --> 00:52:43,176
Wait. This is excessive force.
My lawyer will--

803
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:45,303
My bones. Fine.

804
00:52:45,386 --> 00:52:47,805
Just buy me one more piece of cake, then.

805
00:52:47,889 --> 00:52:49,766
I was going to give them to you anyway.

806
00:52:49,849 --> 00:52:52,936
I'm sorry, sir.

807
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,045

809
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,409
Why are you still here?

810
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,702
Calling it even.

811
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:26,911
What?

812
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,289
Someone messed with me
and wants to call it even,

813
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,583
so I'm looking for a way
to mess with her too.

814
00:53:35,336 --> 00:53:38,423
You specialize in data analysis, right?

815
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:23,051
{\an8}JUSTICE, INNOCENT, DEVILS

{\an8}JUSTICE, INNOCENT, DEVIL,

819
00:54:51,537 --> 00:54:54,040
The letters were sent
from different places in the country.

820
00:54:54,123 --> 00:54:55,416
Every single one of them.

821
00:54:57,543 --> 00:54:59,379
Why do you think Number One Fan is Gaetal?

822
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,130
Listen to this.

823
00:55:03,132 --> 00:55:04,634
"To Professor Kwon Seok-joo.

824
00:55:04,717 --> 00:55:06,052
Apparently, for some people,

825
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:08,971
pleasure is what decides right from wrong.

826
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,808
And these people use wrongful methods

827
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:15,061
to maximize their pleasure,
which I find ironic."

828
00:55:15,144 --> 00:55:17,522
{\an8}<i>"Just like the news I watched today."</i>

829
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,565
{\an8}<i>These perverted criminals committed</i>

830
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,694
{\an8}<i>something they shouldn't have.</i>
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

831
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,488
{\an8}<i>I wonder what punishment</i>
<i>you would have given</i>

832
00:55:25,571 --> 00:55:27,156
{\an8}<i>to the criminals I saw...</i>

833
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,368
{\an8}<i>I thought to myself you'd stuff</i>
<i>their dirty money into their throats.</i>

834
00:55:30,451 --> 00:55:35,039
{\an8}<i>Imagining you revealing the true colors</i>
<i>of those evil beings to the people</i>

835
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,166
{\an8}<i>makes me feel better.</i>

836
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,711
"I'm glad your standards of good and evil

837
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,879
always align with mine.

838
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,297
From your Number One Fan."

839
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,094
"Stuff their money into their throats."

840
00:55:48,177 --> 00:55:49,804
"Revealing the true colors."

841
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,850
Bae Gi-chul?

842
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,269
Now, here comes the next one.

843
00:56:00,314 --> 00:56:02,817
"His sin was to never doubt Eve

844
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,319
and to sow his seeds in her womb.

845
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:09,407
{\an8}So I'm going to burn
the uterus of this evil Eve."

846
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:15,496
Uhm Eun-gyeong died from poisoning,

847
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,500
but her lower body was completely
destroyed during the explosion.

848
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,755
Does this mean this lunatic

849
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,133
has been sharing his murder plans
with Kwon Seok-joo in advance?

850
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,720
Number One Fan is, without a doubt,

851
00:56:30,803 --> 00:56:31,804
Gaetal.

852
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,976
By the way,
isn't something off about his letters?

853
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,396
The first page is just a greeting.

854
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,191
On the second page,
he describes his murder plan.

855
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,817
But the overall flow isn't natural.

856
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,444
There are some words missing.

857
00:56:46,527 --> 00:56:49,363
These letters are missing some pages
in the middle.

858
00:56:49,947 --> 00:56:52,617
We should find out
if this was Kwon Seok-joo's doing

859
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,160
or Park Chul-min's.

860
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,039
If someone did that
knowing the letters would get out,

861
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,125
and if the targets were written on them,

862
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:05,379
it must be Kwon Seok-joo.

863
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,052
{\an8}DEVIL

864
00:57:14,138 --> 00:57:16,057
NO. 1 FAN

865
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:27,068
{\an8}<i>I will kill the devils who</i>
<i>were deemed innocent for you.</i>

866
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,111
<i>Kwon Seok-joo.</i>

867
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,364
It seems

868
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:33,825
there's something he wants from us.

869
00:57:47,171 --> 00:57:48,256
Hello.

870
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,132
Hello, sir.

871
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,425
Hello.

872
00:58:14,156 --> 00:58:16,868
He has asthma caused by collapsed lung.

873
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,035
Has he been getting treatment?

874
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,914
A pretty good doctor
has been coming by regularly

875
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,125
to check up on him

876
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:25,418
and give him prescriptions.

877
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:28,713
He had a meeting with you every week.

878
00:58:30,631 --> 00:58:32,758
Do other inmates get this benefit too?

879
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,511
Why do I feel like I'm being interrogated?

880
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,556
It's just a formality,

881
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:40,474
so please don't take it personally.

882
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,902
I think I can take it from here.

883
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,278
Are you asking me

884
00:58:53,362 --> 00:58:55,031
to leave now?

885
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,574
This investigation is confidential.

886
00:59:00,953 --> 00:59:02,288
Damn it.

887
00:59:55,299 --> 00:59:56,342
Calm down.

888
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,095
And keep a neutral pose.

889
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,472
Don't stay too close or too far.

890
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:06,686
If you seem too aggressive, Kwon
will notice that and use it against you.

891
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,401
No need to bow down to him.

892
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:15,027
Remember. He's the one

893
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:16,654
who invited you here.

894
01:01:56,712 --> 01:02:00,424
THE 13TH ONE WAS WRONG

895
01:02:39,296 --> 01:02:40,840
It's nice to listen to it.

896
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:43,926
Thank you.

897
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:48,597
Gaetal may have scribbled
on your wall a bit,

898
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:50,766
but he didn't make a huge mess.

899
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,394
It had good natural lighting.

900
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,479
It was a very nice house.

901
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,161
You must be familiar

902
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:11,954
with these letters.

903
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,721
{\an8}You've violated the Privacy Act.

904
01:03:28,804 --> 01:03:31,307
{\an8}Given the severity,
you could even get a prison sentence.

905
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,727
{\an8}I just found them in the prison trash can.

906
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,523
{\an8}But you just admitted

907
01:03:41,775 --> 01:03:43,194
{\an8}that they're yours.

908
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,074
{\an8}These letters Gaetal sent
under the alias "Number One Fan"

909
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:54,121
describe in detail how the victims
of the Killing Vote would be executed.

910
01:03:54,955 --> 01:03:55,956
However,

911
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,876
some pages are missing.

912
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,255
I'm suspecting the targets

913
01:04:03,964 --> 01:04:05,257
were written on them.

914
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,720
You were just playing innocent, right?

915
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:12,514
<i>You actually know Gaetal's</i>

916
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:14,558
<i>next target, don't you?</i>

917
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,316
<i>There were no specific names on it.</i>

918
01:04:22,399 --> 01:04:26,153
<i>They had the news stories</i>
<i>that made him angry.</i>

919
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,656
{\an8}<i>If you try to guess using that,</i>

920
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,824
<i>you may be able to find his next target.</i>

921
01:04:34,995 --> 01:04:38,540
You're right.
There was information about his targets.

922
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:40,709
<i>Where are they?</i>

923
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,169
The missing pages.

924
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,435
You'll never find them.

925
01:05:13,325 --> 01:05:15,202
-But why--
-That way,

926
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,706
the police will realize they need me,
and they'll negotiate with me.

927
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:21,959
In that case...

928
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,753
Detective Kim Mu-chan.

929
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,425
<i>Don't just try to get</i>
<i>the information from me.</i>

930
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,510
<i>Get me out of here.</i>

931
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:34,179
This is an official proposal.

932
01:05:36,348 --> 01:05:38,350
On the condition of receiving
a special pardon,

933
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,894
I will cooperate with your investigation

934
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:42,938
on the Killing Vote.

935
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,118
Visiting time has ended.

936
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,166
It was a pleasure talking with you,

937
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:03,751
Lieutenant Joo Hyun.

938
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,289
Inmate 0512.

939
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:07,272
I put the letters in order,

940
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,817
and this is the part
that describes the method in detail.

941
01:07:10,567 --> 01:07:13,195
{\an8}"Since the victim had to suffer
the pain of suffocation,

942
01:07:13,278 --> 01:07:15,114
{\an8}the best way to punish him

943
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,991
would be to inflict the same pain on him."

944
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:19,827
"The pain of suffocation" probably means

945
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:22,246
that the victim was suffocated to death.

946
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:25,374
Once again, the judiciary of this country
took the perpetrator's side,

947
01:07:25,457 --> 01:07:27,167
a sex offender,

948
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:30,879
and implicitly allowed
the systematic culture of rape.

949
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:36,385
Of course, I do realize the system
is essential in this country, but...

950
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:38,929
Systematic?

951
01:07:39,012 --> 01:07:42,182
The reason why sex crimes
are often overlooked in Korea

952
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:47,771
is that most of the relationships
in this society are highly vertical.

953
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,274
Comparing your boss to your parents

954
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:54,653
or calling each other with your job titles
shows it's all about power.

955
01:07:54,736 --> 01:07:57,406
"Director," "Senior," "Teacher."

956
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:00,325
Calling people by these titles

957
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,995
gives you the feeling
that you cannot mess with them.

958
01:08:21,346 --> 01:08:25,517
There are definitely
a lot of heinous sex criminals

959
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:29,646
who cunningly get away with their crimes
thanks to legal loopholes.

960
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,732
And for some groups of people,
it's even easier.

961
01:08:32,816 --> 01:08:36,570
And Number One Fan
said this country needed that group.

962
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:41,742
It's the military.

THE KILLING VOTE

965
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,948
{\an8}<i>It's nice to see you,</i>

966
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:04,116
{\an8}<i>Kim Mu-chan.</i>

967
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:06,410
{\an8}<i>Start narrowing down</i>
<i>Kwon Seok-joo's associates</i>

968
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:07,536
{\an8}<i>to those who might be Gaetal.</i>

969
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:08,996
{\an8}Gaetal must be one of them.

970
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,498
{\an8}<i>Hello, my fellow citizens.</i>

971
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,834
{\an8}The person you'll be voting for today is

972
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:15,335
{\an8}the so-called Captain Oh.

973
01:10:15,627 --> 01:10:18,505
{\an8}<i>That bitch put me in such a bind</i>
<i>when she suddenly died!</i>

974
01:10:18,922 --> 01:10:21,675
{\an8}Superintendent Kim Mu-chan.

975
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,510
{\an8}Do you really want to save
a scumbag like that?
