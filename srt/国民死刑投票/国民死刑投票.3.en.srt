{\an8}-I can't!
-Get yourself together.

7
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:23,620
{\an8}We need to get there fast
if you want to live.

8
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:30,544
{\an8}Step on it!

9
00:00:43,557 --> 00:00:44,767
{\an8}What was that?

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,561
{\an8}Hyun...

11
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:03,535
{\an8}Step on it! Come on!

12
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,821
Hurry.

13
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:40,322
Excuse us.

What?

16
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:13,522
What's wrong with the timer?

17
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:15,899
I really could die in here.

18
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:17,693
Do something, will you?

19
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,236
Do something!

20
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:23,657
Hey, you.

21
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,825
I know you're listening.

22
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:27,161
If she is guilty just as you claimed,

23
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:29,620
we can put her on trial again.

{\an8}<i>You think that's possible?</i>

27
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:36,295
{\an8}<i>In the Republic of Korea?</i>

28
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:37,379
It is possible.

29
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:38,964
I can make it possible.

30
00:02:45,387 --> 00:02:46,805
You want to seek justice, right?

31
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,974
Didn't you tell the people to trust you?

32
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:51,685
But if I die in here along with her,

33
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:52,936
what would they say then?

34
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,106
Think about it.

35
00:02:56,565 --> 00:02:58,358
I will not take one step out of this car

36
00:02:59,776 --> 00:03:00,986
and I will not go alone.

37
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:12,122
So...

38
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:20,923
Stop the bomb, you bastard!

39
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:52,829
No.

40
00:03:58,085 --> 00:03:59,503
Mu-chan?

41
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:02,965
Hyun.

42
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:04,758
Hey, kid. It's dangerous, so get out.

43
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,512
Hey, kid!

44
00:04:36,498 --> 00:04:37,624
No, Hyun...

45
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:44,631
I'll take a picture of the scene.
How's 100,000 won?

46
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:46,550
I risked my life for these.

47
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:47,801
A little bit more please.

48
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,595
One million won.

49
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:50,887
One million?

50
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,140
You little rats...

51
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:55,475
You're asking for a lot.

52
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,769
We almost died.

53
00:04:57,853 --> 00:04:59,104
Did we?

54
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:03,859
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

55
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:06,028
Thank you.

56
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:08,030
-We admire you so much.
-One million won?

57
00:05:08,113 --> 00:05:09,406
-Thank you.
-We love you, sir.

58
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:10,574
Sure.

59
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,084
Thank you.

60
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:22,252
You can check the memory card.

61
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:23,420
Here's my ID.

62
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,944
We'll call you if we need
additional statements from you.

63
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:49,529
All right.

64
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,033
But what about her funeral?

65
00:05:53,116 --> 00:05:55,786
Her body will be released to you
once the autopsy is done.

66
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:57,746
You can make arrangements then.

67
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,331
Right.

68
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:01,083
If you refuse to take her body,

69
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,377
she'll be considered deceased
with no next of kin.

70
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:05,545
I see.

71
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:06,630
Let's go.

72
00:06:09,257 --> 00:06:11,134
So she's gone now?

73
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:12,886
We won't get beaten anymore?

74
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:14,346
No.

75
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:16,890
Ha-young, no one will beat us now.

76
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:19,309
-We're okay.
-That's her family, right?

77
00:06:19,393 --> 00:06:20,686
The one from last night's Killing Vote?

78
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,771
She should've been imprisoned years ago.

79
00:06:22,854 --> 00:06:24,981
The police are useless.

80
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,234
No. I said no.

81
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:29,194
Don't you understand me?

82
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:31,738
She deserved to die.

83
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:33,115
So what's the problem?

84
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,242
The biggest problem is

85
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:39,287
that Gaetal is doing
what you should be doing!

86
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:41,123
-That's right!
-That's right.

87
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,375
And you call yourselves the police?

88
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,459
Sir.

89
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:47,587
Please calm down.

90
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,381
You could be charged
with obstruction of justice

91
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:50,924
and assaulting an officer.

92
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:52,884
You'll need a lawyer.

93
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:54,594
A lawyer?

94
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:56,638
So what if I keep doing this?

95
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,142
-What are you going to do?
-Sir.

96
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:01,893
Keep your hands off him

97
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:04,312
and please calm down.

98
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:07,733
Who the hell are you?

99
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,320
Unbelievable. You...

100
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:13,405
Hey!

101
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:16,408
What are you doing?

102
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:32,132
{\an8}<i>The second target of The Killing Vote</i>
<i>was murdered last night.</i>

103
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:35,385
<i>This time, 87% voted "yes"</i>
<i>for Uhm's execution...</i>

104
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:37,471
A bombing at a school?

105
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:40,766
<i>-...higher than the first vote's 84%.</i>
-I'm glad the kids weren't hurt.

106
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,351
<i>The majority of the people voted</i>
<i>for her execution.</i>

107
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:46,396
<i>But due to the fact</i>
<i>an innocent person was injured,</i>

108
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,398
<i>public opinion against The Killing Vote</i>

109
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:50,650
<i>-is growing stronger.</i>
-What if the kids got hurt?

110
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:52,861
Gaetal turned out to be a bad person.

111
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:55,197
Gaetal is a bad person, Mom?

112
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,741
-You don't need to know.
-Who's Gaetal?

113
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,993
I don't know. He used to be a good person,

114
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:01,578
but they say now he's bad.

115
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:03,955
ONE MINUTE AWAY

116
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:23,934
<i>Now that two Killing Votes</i>
<i>have taken place,</i>

117
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:26,937
<i>what should be our biggest concern?</i>

118
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:30,482
<i>We agreed to the idea</i>
<i>of carrying out justice.</i>

119
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:33,276
<i>But the consequences were disastrous.</i>

120
00:08:34,444 --> 00:08:36,988
<i>The bombing was nearly a major disaster,</i>

121
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:39,074
{\an8}<i>and with news that a police officer</i>
<i>was seriously injured,</i>

122
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:41,368
{\an8}<i>the people are appalled.</i>

123
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,913
{\an8}<i>Through the statements</i>
<i>of the people who were at the scene,</i>

124
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:47,123
{\an8}<i>we were able to report</i>
<i>on the tense situation.</i>

KIM MU-CHAN

126
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:50,168
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

127
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:53,255
<i>I thought a war had broken out.</i>

128
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:56,258
{\an8}<i>I thought we were being attacked</i>
<i>with missiles, so I was terrified.</i>

129
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:58,301
{\an8}<i>The police suddenly told us to leave.</i>

130
00:08:58,385 --> 00:08:59,386
{\an8}<i>Don't get me started.</i>

131
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:01,304
{\an8}<i>You wouldn't believe how loud it was.</i>

132
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:03,515
{\an8}<i>The windows all the way here</i>
<i>started shaking.</i>

133
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:06,101
{\an8}<i>Thanks to the police's quick judgment,</i>

134
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:09,020
{\an8}<i>innocent people were not hurt or killed.</i>

135
00:09:09,104 --> 00:09:11,356
{\an8}<i>But Uhm, The Killing Vote's target,</i>
<i>was killed.</i>

136
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:14,985
{\an8}<i>And the officer who performed his duties</i>
<i>is fighting for his life.</i>

137
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:17,195
When did you get home?

138
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,447
Why didn't you pick up?
I was waiting all night!

139
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:21,741
Early this morning.

140
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:25,662
You should've washed up and gone to bed.

141
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:28,415
You're not hurt, are you?

142
00:09:28,498 --> 00:09:29,541
Are you?

143
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:32,210
<i>For showing the previous disturbing video</i>
<i>without warning,</i>

144
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:33,295
<i>we sincerely apologize.</i>

145
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:41,303
<i>But there is a reason</i>
<i>why you had to watch this clip.</i>

146
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:46,141
<i>People, what we must note</i>
<i>from this clip is</i>

147
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:47,976
<i>that the culprit, Gaetal,</i>

148
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:51,104
<i>knew an innocent police officer</i>
<i>could've been harmed,</i>

149
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:53,315
<i>but he did not stop the bomb.</i>

150
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:56,985
<i>His claim to do justice for our society</i>

151
00:09:57,068 --> 00:10:00,655
<i>has caused an exemplary police officer</i>
<i>to fight for his life.</i>

152
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:04,242
<i>Isn't this the true face of justice</i>
<i>that Gaetal was referring to?</i>

153
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:05,619
<i>In the end,</i>

154
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:07,329
<i>-who did the votes serve?</i>
-See?

155
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:09,915
That could've been you.

156
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:11,416
Do you still...

157
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:15,378
think Gaetal is right?

158
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:19,132
What?

159
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,177
You said that your friends

160
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:25,263
likened Gaetal to Batman.

161
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:27,515
A hero.

162
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:32,896
You should all wake up.

163
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,441
That bastard is a criminal.

164
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:41,112
Someone who wouldn't hesitate to kill cops

165
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:44,199
and even people like you and me.

166
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:47,035
A dangerous scoundrel.

167
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:00,423
What's wrong with her?

NATIONAL POLICE HOSPITAL

171
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:40,630
Here comes the director.

172
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:42,716
-Sir.
-How's Superintendent Kim doing?

173
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:46,970
Have you found any evidence?

174
00:11:48,972 --> 00:11:50,765
Please tell us something.

175
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:55,437
How's Superintendent Kim doing?

176
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,521
Who's Gaetal?

177
00:11:56,604 --> 00:11:58,857
Will the unit's leader be replaced?

178
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,817
Rumors are going around
about his condition.

179
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,277
How is he doing?

180
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,903
Is he conscious?

181
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:06,614
Do you know who Gaetal is?

182
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:12,620
Superintendent Kim Mu-chan
risked his life and carried out his duty

183
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:15,123
to protect civilians
from a merciless terrorist.

184
00:12:15,206 --> 00:12:18,168
The police denounces all violent acts

185
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:21,379
committed by the criminal
calling himself Gaetal.

186
00:12:21,463 --> 00:12:24,799
We shall arrest him as soon as possible
and punish him by law.

187
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:29,846
Everyone, Superintendent Kim is hovering
between life and death at this moment.

188
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:32,599
I ask that you pray for his recovery.

189
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:48,948
Sir.

190
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:59,626
VIP
PATIENT: KIM

191
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:07,759
{\an8}DO NOT ENTER

192
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:11,638
Hello.

193
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:13,807
We're here to check the crime scene.

194
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,016
-Thanks.
-You can't go in.

195
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:19,521
-We have to look at the scene--
-Please leave.

196
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:22,232
Let us go in.

197
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:26,361
It's not at all due to
poor management of the school.

198
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:30,198
The police asked for our cooperation.
They said it was really urgent.

199
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:31,616
Yes, of course.

200
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:33,993
We made sure to evacuate
the students safely first.

201
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:36,663
And we'll make sure
it doesn't affect their classes.

202
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:39,332
If parents find out we went out
for dinner last night, they'll go nuts.

203
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:40,875
The students weren't unattended.

204
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,460
There was a teacher on call.

205
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:44,170
They should've let him kill her.

206
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:45,755
Why did they have to bring her here?

207
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,423
The police are the biggest problem.

208
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:50,635
Sir, please go talk to them for us.

209
00:13:50,718 --> 00:13:51,719
We need to look for evidence,

210
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:53,429
but the guys from headquarters
won't let us in.

211
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:55,390
Just give it a rest.

212
00:13:55,473 --> 00:13:57,142
I already have too much on my mind.

213
00:13:58,309 --> 00:13:59,435
Why are they doing this?

214
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,312
Is it because the case got out of hand?

215
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:02,438
Don't tell me...

216
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:06,151
Potential murder of a police officer?

217
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:09,445
He's in really serious condition,
isn't he?

218
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:14,576
Everyone's talking about him.

219
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:15,702
"He's alive." "He's dead."

220
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:17,912
"Will he be buried
in the National Cemetery?"

221
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:20,456
And that guy over there. I hate him.

222
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,041
Do you know what he said to me?

223
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:24,752
"Is your uniform ready for the funeral?"

224
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,838
No, I didn't.

225
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:31,759
Sir, tell me the truth.
It's just between us.

226
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:33,636
It can't be...

227
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:36,764
Is he dead?

228
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:37,974
You little...

229
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:40,226
What are you talking about?

230
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,311
He's just...

231
00:14:41,728 --> 00:14:43,813
Injured. That's all.

232
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:45,773
So, how serious is it?

233
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,240
Excuse me.

234
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,075
Sir.

235
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:58,578
You can't take pictures.

236
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:00,622
I see. I'm sorry.

237
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:03,583
It's an ongoing investigation.
Please delete them.

238
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:17,347
Sir.

239
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,684
Sure. I will.

240
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:23,895
{\an8}DELETE

241
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:28,900
Are you Lee Yun-seong by any chance?

242
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:33,404
You were that student, right?

243
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:38,409
Mr. Lee Min-soo, wait up.

244
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:40,078
I need to talk to you.

245
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:43,164
He's a teacher?

246
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:49,504
So how serious is his injury?

247
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:50,797
-Come on.
-Tell me.

248
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,965
Damn it.

249
00:15:56,177 --> 00:15:58,304
Me too. I'm frustrated too.

250
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:00,765
Where are you going?

251
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:03,518
Everyone is so diligent.

252
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:11,526
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

253
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:13,069
We don't even know how he's doing,

254
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:14,612
but we're just going to sit here?

255
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:15,822
God damn it!

256
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:18,074
The police's reputation is ruined,

257
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:20,451
and our team leader is
in critical condition.

258
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:26,666
{\an8}Yes, it is definitely strange.

259
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:34,048
{\an8}Something's really fishy
with the crime scene.

260
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:35,550
{\an8}What is it now?

261
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,510
{\an8}Before we could search for evidence,

262
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:39,554
{\an8}headquarters put up barricades

263
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:41,973
{\an8}and treated us like nobodies.

264
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:43,099
{\an8}Headquarters?

265
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:46,102
{\an8}But they weren't detectives.
I've never seen them before.

266
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:48,688
{\an8}Could they be from Internal Affairs?

267
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:51,941
{\an8}The IA at a crime scene? Why?

268
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:54,694
{\an8}Maybe they want to form
another special unit at HQ.

269
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:57,572
{\an8}Since the case got bigger,
they might want a bigger team.

270
00:16:57,655 --> 00:17:00,783
{\an8}They do like to take credit
from the cases we work on.

271
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,618
{\an8}Right. What about Lieutenant Choi?

272
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:04,704
{\an8}He went straight to the autopsy room.

273
00:17:04,787 --> 00:17:07,040
{\an8}But I think he saw Superintendent Kim.

274
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:08,541
{\an8}Yes, he did.

275
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,209
{\an8}He seemed to know how he was doing.

276
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:11,544
{\an8}Yes, he knows.

277
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:14,255
{\an8}Jjoo.

278
00:17:14,714 --> 00:17:15,757
{\an8}Where is she?

279
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,384
{\an8}Her goal was always to burn out
from working too hard.

280
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:20,345
{\an8}Did her wish come true? Where did she go?

281
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:28,853
Officer Kim Mu-chan.

282
00:17:28,936 --> 00:17:30,355
There's a rumor that he is dead.

283
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:33,941
He might be. One already died
in the explosion.

284
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:35,568
Even if he survived,
he might not have long.

285
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:38,154
Why won't they announce it?

286
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:39,238
I have an appointment.

287
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,922
{\an8}<i>The culprit, Gaetal,</i>

288
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:58,633
{\an8}<i>knew an innocent police officer</i>
<i>could've been harmed,</i>

289
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:01,427
<i>but he did not stop the bomb.</i>

290
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,680
<i>His claim to do justice for our society</i>

291
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:08,434
<i>has caused an exemplary police officer</i>
<i>to fight for his life.</i>

292
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:34,377
Hey.

293
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:48,850
<i>Isn't this the true face of justice</i>
<i>that Gaetal was referring to?</i>

294
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:51,102
{\an8}<i>In the end,</i>

295
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:52,895
{\an8}<i>who did the votes serve?</i>

296
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:56,065
{\an8}"Now, that's more like the police."

297
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:57,775
{\an8}"We're rooting for Korea's police."

298
00:18:57,859 --> 00:18:59,402
{\an8}"Gaetal is just a murderer."

299
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:01,779
{\an8}"Let's pay for
Superintendent Kim's medical bills."

300
00:19:02,363 --> 00:19:05,324
{\an8}Based on these comments,
I'd say we got what we wanted.

301
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:06,826
What do you think?

302
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:10,788
You're an expert, Ms. Chae,
so I'll trust you and go with it.

303
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:13,291
But did we have to lie?

304
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:15,710
Doing this changed
the public opinion. Otherwise...

305
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:21,466
This is why the commissioner
gave his permission too.

306
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:22,550
So stop worrying.

307
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:24,844
You're right.

308
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:27,430
He stayed in the car
with a strong sense of responsibility,

309
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:28,598
and he did nearly died.

310
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:31,058
You're dealing with a criminal
who's stirring up the system,

311
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:32,685
so a ruse like this is nothing.

312
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:34,103
Entrapment is fine too.

313
00:19:34,187 --> 00:19:37,607
The police have to do marketing
to survive these days too.

314
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:39,317
Isn't that right?

315
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:45,448
Make sure to control public opinion, sir.

316
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:47,200
And open up a hotline.

317
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:49,202
We failed to get any information.

318
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:50,661
Let's at least receive tips.

319
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:52,997
All right. Just make sure
this doesn't get out.

320
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:55,583
If people find out we were faking this,

321
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,835
we'll both be hung out to dry.

322
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:24,362
LINEN CLOSET

323
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:43,589
So I have exclusive
access to entry now, right?

324
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:46,133
They'll say we're colluding.

325
00:20:46,217 --> 00:20:49,428
I'll open an official press room instead,
so make good use of that.

326
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:51,556
I'll make sure you get exclusive access.

327
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:53,849
If you wrap this case up well,

328
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:55,685
people will ask you to run for office.

329
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:08,281
Superintendent Kim!

330
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:10,366
Superintendent Kim!

331
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,201
Please!

332
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:14,287
Superintendent Kim!

333
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:01,250
Please change the sheets in Room 301.

334
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:02,335
Okay.

335
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:19,685
The direct cause of death
is cardiac arrest due to poisoning.

336
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:21,687
And post-mortem burns from the explosion

337
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:23,731
has made her face unrecognizable.

338
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:26,692
That means she'd already been poisoned
when she was kidnapped.

339
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,571
I thought she was panting
because of the bomb.

340
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:32,531
She had asthma.

341
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:34,116
And he poisoned her knowing that.

342
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:36,952
<i>Her pulse was racing from anxiety,</i>

343
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:38,537
<i>so the poison took effect quicker.</i>

344
00:22:40,164 --> 00:22:41,165
What about the bombs?

345
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,835
Both of them were detonated remotely.

346
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:47,338
Whether she got out of the car or not

347
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:49,006
<i>didn't matter from the start.</i>

348
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,841
I told you he was a lunatic.

349
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:54,220
We won't find any evidence
because the trunk was blown up.

350
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:58,724
<i>You collected all CCTV footage, right?</i>

351
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:02,395
Students could've recorded it
on their phones, so collect all of them.

352
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:05,147
I think Bae Gi-chul's body
was just released to his family.

353
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:06,565
<i>I bet his funeral will be held soon.</i>

354
00:23:07,817 --> 00:23:09,485
Let's send some more men there.

355
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,405
The killer is a vain lunatic,
so he might show up there too.

356
00:23:15,032 --> 00:23:16,158
What about Joo Hyun?

357
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:17,618
Is she at the station?

358
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:19,328
We have to keep her quiet...

359
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,459
We have to...

360
00:23:27,837 --> 00:23:30,631
Actually, I'll take care of that.

361
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,261
Hey.

362
00:23:35,886 --> 00:23:38,139
What do you think you're doing?

363
00:23:39,056 --> 00:23:40,182
Hey.

364
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:42,893
Hello?

365
00:23:42,977 --> 00:23:43,978
What's going on?

366
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:45,938
You need to look at this, sir.

367
00:23:46,021 --> 00:23:47,022
Okay.

368
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:57,867
-What? What do you want?
-You're totally fine.

369
00:23:58,409 --> 00:23:59,660
Get your hands off me.

370
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,747
Did you just con the entire nation?

371
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,708
Wow. I am just speechless.

372
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,252
It's not a con. It's media manipulation.

373
00:24:08,335 --> 00:24:09,336
Media manipulation?

374
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:13,007
So Gaetal made fools of you,

375
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,009
and in order to restore
the police's reputation,

376
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:16,927
you manipulated the media?

377
00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:19,597
Wow. I didn't expect this.
You're such a loser.

378
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:23,434
Nambu Police Agency's jerk. Wipeout.

379
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:25,269
You're called these for a reason, right?

380
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:27,313
Yeah, that's the kind of guy I am.

381
00:24:27,396 --> 00:24:30,149
That loser who never reveals
his identity, Gaetal?

382
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:31,567
He wouldn't have been caught anyway.

383
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,736
Everyone thinks he's a hero.

384
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:35,404
You saw how they changed their minds

385
00:24:35,488 --> 00:24:37,114
as soon as a cop was hurt, right?

386
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:40,910
To Gaetal, the reason for murder
is most important thing.

387
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:42,077
If we change public opinion,

388
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:44,205
we can stop The Killing Vote.

389
00:24:45,206 --> 00:24:47,708
If the police aren't
on the straight and narrow,

390
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,668
what grounds will we have
to catch criminals?

391
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:52,296
If word gets out, will you take
the fall for this humiliation?

392
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:55,090
All of Korea's police
are going to be screwed!

393
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:57,009
So let's get him.

394
00:24:57,092 --> 00:24:59,303
Isn't it more humiliating
if we fail to arrest him?

395
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,580
<i>I have an interesting video clip.</i>

396
00:25:26,664 --> 00:25:29,083
EXECUTOR:
PROVE THAT IT'S AUTHENTIC

397
00:25:30,835 --> 00:25:32,211
{\an8}I TOOK IT MYSELF

398
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:37,633
What are you so busy with?

399
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:38,801
School work?

400
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:42,179
The board of directors is talking
about closing the school for a while.

401
00:25:42,263 --> 00:25:45,432
How unnecessary. Parents don't want
their kids to fall behind.

402
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:52,481
The Killing Vote was
also gaining momentum,

403
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:54,942
but that one detective ruined it.

404
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:58,612
That Kim Mu-chan.
Why doesn't he ever change?

405
00:25:58,696 --> 00:26:00,948
You've been following
The Killing Vote too, Mom?

406
00:26:03,117 --> 00:26:06,829
In this country,
only 16% of those in their twenties

407
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:09,331
vote in the presidential elections.

408
00:26:09,415 --> 00:26:10,833
But in order to catch a criminal,

409
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:14,420
more than 40% of all citizens

410
00:26:14,503 --> 00:26:16,422
had already voted within one hour.

411
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:21,802
He's the first public speaker in Korea
with this much trust, so I do follow it.

412
00:26:23,053 --> 00:26:24,555
Gaetal.

413
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:26,807
No matter what happens,

414
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:29,393
I'll make him join me.

415
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,898
You know I will, right?

416
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:53,500
You're keeping close tabs
on Min-soo these days, right?

417
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:54,585
Yes, ma'am.

418
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:57,922
Make sure his feelings don't get hurt.

419
00:26:58,464 --> 00:26:59,548
Yes, ma'am.

420
00:27:19,693 --> 00:27:21,111
Don't push it.

421
00:27:24,448 --> 00:27:25,824
Am I mistaken?

422
00:27:25,908 --> 00:27:28,035
Your screen hasn't changed
for the past 10 minutes.

423
00:27:29,495 --> 00:27:32,081
Mr. Lee, maybe the world
became too digitalized

424
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:34,208
so it lost its humanity.

425
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:37,419
They thought
they could kill people by voting

426
00:27:37,962 --> 00:27:39,380
but then blew up a bomb at school.

427
00:27:39,463 --> 00:27:40,464
Min.

428
00:27:40,547 --> 00:27:43,175
You're not in the computer club,
so why are you here?

429
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,261
Either study in class or focus on...

430
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:48,222
I need a break too, you know.

431
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,017
Look at Kim Ji-hoon.

432
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:53,644
He's not in the computer club either.

433
00:27:53,727 --> 00:27:56,522
He wants to major in computer science.
You want to become a reporter.

434
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:58,190
And what's needed to write articles?

435
00:27:58,273 --> 00:27:59,358
A computer.

436
00:27:59,441 --> 00:28:00,943
Well, look at you.

437
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,945
So if you could help me...

438
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,739
Work hard. Okay.

439
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:10,035
Mr. Lee.

440
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,871
What?

441
00:28:13,914 --> 00:28:14,957
What?

442
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,417
What's wrong with this?

443
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:18,377
Mr. Lee.

444
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:20,254
Mr. Lee.

445
00:28:28,303 --> 00:28:29,304
Don't touch it.

446
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:33,934
Hey, this is my seat.

447
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:42,026
{\an8}SAFE MODE IN PROGRESS

448
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,154
Wow, the future computer major.

449
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,034
So, did this turn into a zombie PC?

450
00:28:52,036 --> 00:28:53,037
You know about that?

451
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,121
"You know about that?"

452
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:58,667
But no.

453
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:00,169
It's just a virus.

454
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:01,295
VIRUS HAS BEEN REMOVED

455
00:29:01,587 --> 00:29:04,006
My laptop became a zombie before.

456
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:05,090
-So my sister--
-It's done.

457
00:29:12,431 --> 00:29:13,807
Are you two dating?

458
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:14,892
Shut up.

459
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,061
That's not possible.

460
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:24,693
{\an8}Follow me! Bye, Mr. Lee.

461
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:27,738
{\an8}-Don't make any trouble.
-Okay.

462
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,221
{\an8}Hey.

463
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:55,682
{\an8}Do you like mystery novels?

464
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:57,684
Sherlock Holmes?

465
00:29:57,768 --> 00:29:58,811
Moriarty?

466
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:04,274
You...

467
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:06,276
Hang out with me today.

468
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:10,531
-He recorded it all.
-Must be nice, pal.

469
00:30:12,616 --> 00:30:14,034
Hey, where are you going?

470
00:30:14,118 --> 00:30:15,327
I said let's hang out.

471
00:30:15,452 --> 00:30:16,537
You're so lucky.

472
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,080
-I'm jealous.
-Where are you going?

473
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:26,130
I don't expect a full recovery.

474
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:27,840
I've had it for years now,

475
00:30:27,923 --> 00:30:29,591
so it feels like a friend.

476
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:32,010
I'll just have to get along with it.

477
00:30:32,094 --> 00:30:34,346
Inmate 0512. Are you done?

478
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,431
Yes, sir.

479
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:40,602
I'll see you soon, doctor.

480
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:48,277
Have you heard?

481
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,197
The detective in charge
of The Killing Vote case

482
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:54,324
was severely hurt
while pursuing the culprit.

483
00:30:55,868 --> 00:30:58,078
You know. Detective Kim Mu-chan.

484
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,960
Inmate 0512. Eyes forward.

485
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,801
So you know

486
00:31:13,594 --> 00:31:14,887
the woman Gaetal targeted?

487
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:18,348
The woman killed three of her husbands
for their insurance money,

488
00:31:18,432 --> 00:31:20,058
and while trying to save her,

489
00:31:20,142 --> 00:31:22,102
and he was blown up in the explosion too.

490
00:31:23,937 --> 00:31:25,397
It's a relief

491
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,691
that he wasn't killed.

492
00:31:29,943 --> 00:31:33,697
The news said his injuries
are so serious, he's barely hanging on.

493
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:38,952
I mean, why did he try to save a criminal
who deserved to die?

494
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:42,164
How foolish, right?

495
00:31:43,457 --> 00:31:47,794
I believe that anyone who kills
deserves to be punished the same way.

496
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,591
A murderer will always be a murderer.

497
00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:00,891
<i>There are so many of those</i>
<i>who deserve to die.</i>

498
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:03,727
How did you find this?

499
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,812
My laptop.

500
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:11,276
I told you that it was a zombie.

501
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,278
My sister found a malicious code

502
00:32:13,362 --> 00:32:15,322
that was hidden.

503
00:32:15,405 --> 00:32:18,033
She said we can catch Gaetal
if we get to the video source.

504
00:32:18,575 --> 00:32:22,079
How come you have such crucial information
to the investigation?

505
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:25,457
A reporter's...

506
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,167
intuition?

507
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:25,475
Your sister might take the fall for this.

508
00:33:28,103 --> 00:33:29,104
Right.

509
00:33:30,564 --> 00:33:31,898
Are you...

510
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:33,358
a scaredy...

511
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:37,446
-"Scaredy"?
-Scaredy-cat.

512
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:38,530
Don't you get it?

513
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:41,325
Fine, stay out of it if you're scared.

514
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,496
What do you want to do?

515
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:52,002
I've watched this video
over a hundred times.

516
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:53,920
But while Gaetal is talking,

517
00:33:54,004 --> 00:33:56,298
I swear I can hear a siren wailing
in the background.

518
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,841
Listen.

519
00:33:57,924 --> 00:33:59,426
<i>...are walking around alive.</i>

520
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:00,510
<i>I can't stand the...</i>

521
00:34:00,594 --> 00:34:03,180
You can see lights
coming in from the window too.

522
00:34:03,263 --> 00:34:05,432
Maybe we can find out
where this was recorded.

523
00:34:06,224 --> 00:34:09,186
Then, I'll try to turn up
the background noise.

524
00:34:13,857 --> 00:34:17,319
I did notice the end
of the recording wasn't clear.

525
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:21,782
But interference from the other noises...

526
00:34:21,865 --> 00:34:23,116
Listen to it.

527
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,411
<i>The devils who were deemed innocent</i>
<i>are walking around alive.</i>

528
00:34:26,495 --> 00:34:28,705
<i>I can't stand the thought of it!</i>

529
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:29,790
<i>I want to rip them...</i>

530
00:34:29,873 --> 00:34:31,583
I was right. The siren.

531
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,418
It's not from a police car.

532
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,961
A fire engine.

533
00:34:35,337 --> 00:34:36,338
Yeah, a fire engine.

534
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,590
You can tell the difference?

535
00:34:38,673 --> 00:34:40,717
Of course, my sister's a cop.

536
00:34:41,635 --> 00:34:42,969
The siren of a fire engine...

537
00:34:43,845 --> 00:34:44,888
I know it for sure.

538
00:34:50,644 --> 00:34:51,645
Right?

539
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:53,772
You're right.

540
00:34:59,986 --> 00:35:01,279
Was the place burned?

541
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:03,907
But the room looks too intact for that.

542
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:06,743
I can't exactly see how it looks,

543
00:35:06,827 --> 00:35:09,287
but I think it's been exposed
to weak light for a long time.

544
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:13,542
Right.

545
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:16,420
I heard that a cop was injured
from the explosion.

546
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:17,504
How's your sister?

547
00:35:17,587 --> 00:35:19,256
Luckily, she's fine.

548
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:22,175
Anyways, I've left
the Gaetal fan club as of yesterday.

549
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:24,219
He'd only go after those
who deserved to die

550
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:26,096
to punish the evil, so I trusted him.

551
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:28,098
But how could he hurt a cop too?

552
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,850
I'm so disappointed.

553
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:32,310
I'm suspicious of the police too.

554
00:35:32,936 --> 00:35:34,271
That injured cop...

555
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:36,064
You think he's actually hurt?

556
00:35:36,148 --> 00:35:37,941
The woman in the driver's seat died.

557
00:35:38,024 --> 00:35:39,568
So how can the cop be okay?

558
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:42,362
My sister came back frightened
and shocked.

559
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:43,864
Hey!

560
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:46,366
You...

561
00:35:46,825 --> 00:35:47,826
You little brats.

562
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:50,495
Didn't you say you'd be home late?

563
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:54,374
We were just trying
to help you catch Gaetal.

564
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:57,752
Hey, I'm a cop and you're just students.

565
00:35:57,836 --> 00:35:59,004
Are you crazy?

566
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:01,840
When did you copy this?

567
00:36:01,923 --> 00:36:03,633
You're unbelievable.

568
00:36:05,886 --> 00:36:08,930
<i>There are rotten people</i>
<i>like you everywhere.</i>

569
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:11,892
<i>Korea is a complete mess.</i>
<i>There's no room for improvement.</i>

570
00:36:13,602 --> 00:36:15,228
<i>And what made it like this are me</i>

571
00:36:15,312 --> 00:36:16,897
<i>and you.</i>

572
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,149
-Right here.
-<i>We're all at fault.</i>

573
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:21,568
A light is coming in through the window.

574
00:36:22,235 --> 00:36:23,236
Right?

575
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,405
We can hear the siren first

576
00:36:25,947 --> 00:36:27,616
and then see the light.

577
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:29,868
So they must be
the fire engine's headlights.

578
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:31,453
No.

579
00:36:33,246 --> 00:36:35,832
Unless it's a semi-basement room
by a street,

580
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:40,045
a vehicle's headlights
wouldn't light a room like this.

581
00:36:40,629 --> 00:36:41,755
This light...

582
00:36:43,006 --> 00:36:46,510
They're probably emergency lights
on a fire engine.

583
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:48,512
For emergency lights to be this visible...

584
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:49,638
A two-story house.

585
00:36:50,847 --> 00:36:53,558
Then, it's probably a two-story house.

586
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:57,687
And by the sound of the sirens,

587
00:36:57,771 --> 00:36:59,981
at least three fire engines
were dispatched.

588
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:04,069
For something that big,
the police are dispatched too.

589
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:05,904
So...

590
00:37:06,821 --> 00:37:08,365
Let's find a case of a fire

591
00:37:08,448 --> 00:37:12,202
within the past six months
where firefighters and the police

592
00:37:12,285 --> 00:37:15,288
were dispatched together

593
00:37:15,872 --> 00:37:18,208
through the NPA database.

594
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:23,088
These are the most likely candidates.

595
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:26,341
Multi-family residential area
in Gijeong-dong, Jungrang-gu.

596
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:29,511
An apartment complex
in Shinseok-dong, Mapo-gu.

597
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:31,513
{\an8}And Gaonro, Seowon-gu...

598
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:36,685
Wait.

599
00:37:38,186 --> 00:37:39,437
What is it?

600
00:37:39,521 --> 00:37:40,605
You figured it out?

601
00:37:40,689 --> 00:37:42,524
PROFILE
NAME: KWON SEOK-JOO

602
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:44,192
ADDRESS: 177 GAONRO-4GA, SEOWON-GU, SEOUL

603
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:46,152
I'll be back soon.

604
00:37:47,028 --> 00:37:48,488
-I want to come with you.
-No.

605
00:37:48,572 --> 00:37:49,823
I helped you find it.

606
00:37:49,906 --> 00:37:50,907
Hey, Joo Min!

607
00:37:50,991 --> 00:37:53,660
Then, call another cop at least.

608
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:55,745
She's just worried about you.

609
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:58,415
We don't have enough manpower
to ask for help on this.

610
00:37:58,498 --> 00:37:59,499
We're on high alert.

611
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,876
Then, we should join you at least.

612
00:38:02,836 --> 00:38:05,672
If something happens,
you need someone to call for help.

613
00:38:07,257 --> 00:38:08,675
Your name is Ji-hoon, right?

614
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:12,512
I like you.

615
00:38:12,596 --> 00:38:13,972
You're pretty smart.

616
00:38:17,684 --> 00:38:20,895
Wait up. I'm coming too!

617
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:29,005
<i>The number you have dialed...</i>

618
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:31,925
Are you sure this is his house?

619
00:38:32,842 --> 00:38:35,053
"Kwon Seok-joo."

620
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,763
Who is he?

621
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:38,181
Isn't it him?

622
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:42,435
FATHER WHO KILLED DAUGHTER'S KILLER...

623
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,561
A MISGUIDED FATHER'S LOVE

624
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:44,646
{\an8}A murderer?

625
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,690
That's unsettling.

626
00:38:47,774 --> 00:38:48,983
KIM MU-CHAN

627
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:56,616
<i>-The number you have dialed...</i>
-Damn it.

628
00:38:57,158 --> 00:38:58,326
<i>I found evidence showing</i>

629
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:01,246
<i>that Gaetal's test video was filmed</i>
<i>at Kwon Seok-joo's place.</i>

630
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:02,622
<i>I'm going in right now.</i>

631
00:39:04,165 --> 00:39:05,250
Hey.

632
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,752
Wait in front of that camera over there

633
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:09,087
so the camera can catch you.

634
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,547
Don't come in no matter what.

635
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,882
No matter what you hear,
don't get involved.

636
00:39:12,966 --> 00:39:15,051
Call it in and go to the nearest station.
Okay?

637
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:17,929
Keep your GPS on.

638
00:39:18,012 --> 00:39:19,055
Let us go in with you.

639
00:39:19,138 --> 00:39:20,473
Don't you even think about it.

640
00:39:21,474 --> 00:39:22,475
Same goes for you.

641
00:39:22,892 --> 00:39:24,060
Don't worry.

642
00:39:24,143 --> 00:39:26,020
I'll stay with Min.

643
00:39:26,104 --> 00:39:27,855
Be careful.

644
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:31,150
I'm relieved that one of you is sane.

645
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:15,820
What is that?

646
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:18,156
A location tracker Hyun and I use.

647
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:23,494
She told us to stay in a safe place.

648
00:40:54,317 --> 00:40:56,444
There's so much data.

649
00:40:56,527 --> 00:40:59,280
The team asked so many questions
while I gathered these.

650
00:40:59,364 --> 00:41:01,282
It was hard coming up with excuses.

651
00:41:01,741 --> 00:41:03,785
I brought your personal laptop too.

652
00:41:04,452 --> 00:41:06,162
Right. Your phone didn't break.

653
00:41:06,245 --> 00:41:07,872
It just needed to be charged, so I did.

654
00:41:09,248 --> 00:41:11,626
It doesn't feel right
to lie to the public like this,

655
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:14,754
but Sang-jae and Yoon-ji
were beat up pretty well this morning.

656
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:16,255
Uhm Eun-gyeong's neighbors said,

657
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,466
"And you call yourselves the police?"

658
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:20,677
When I heard it, I got so angry.

659
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,261
JOO HYUN: I'M GOING IN RIGHT NOW

660
00:41:22,387 --> 00:41:24,097
And I understood why you're doing this.

661
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,556
-So you should take...
-Jin-soo.

662
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,766
...this chance to rest.

663
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:28,309
I have to go out right now.

664
00:41:29,394 --> 00:41:31,396
Unbelievable.

665
00:41:33,564 --> 00:41:35,233
-Give me your clothes.
-My clothes?

666
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,651
Take them off now.

667
00:41:37,235 --> 00:41:38,403
Why?

668
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,363
God damn it.

669
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,120
Where are you going?

670
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:48,579
If the director finds out, I'm dead.

671
00:41:48,663 --> 00:41:49,872
Did you ride your scooter here?

672
00:41:49,956 --> 00:41:50,998
Where did you park it?

673
00:41:51,082 --> 00:41:52,500
By the tree in the back.

674
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:53,793
Why are you making me lie down?

675
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:55,420
Why would you press that?

676
00:41:55,503 --> 00:41:57,296
Superintendent Kim, wake up!

677
00:41:57,922 --> 00:41:59,465
A man's dying over here!

678
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:03,553
Are you okay? Nurse!

679
00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:04,637
Are you okay?

680
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:05,722
Nurse!

681
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,891
-Mr. Kim!
-Mr. Kim.

682
00:42:08,975 --> 00:42:10,351
-Are you okay?
-Sir.

683
00:42:10,435 --> 00:42:11,894
-Mr. Kim.
-Mr. Kim.

684
00:42:12,812 --> 00:42:13,813
What?

685
00:42:13,896 --> 00:42:15,273
Hello.

686
00:45:06,944 --> 00:45:11,991
THE 13TH ONE WAS WRONG

687
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:32,762
8-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER MISSING

688
00:45:32,845 --> 00:45:35,264
KWON CHARGED WITH REVENGE MURDER

689
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:50,529
Something's wrong.

690
00:45:51,822 --> 00:45:53,282
It's been about 20 minutes.

691
00:45:53,366 --> 00:45:54,367
You're right.

692
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,577
It's past the time we agreed on.

693
00:45:57,495 --> 00:46:00,164
But we're not going inside.
Let's call the police.

694
00:46:00,247 --> 00:46:02,124
That's what she told us to do.

695
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:04,627
You do that. I'm going inside.

696
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,003
Hey.

697
00:46:06,087 --> 00:46:07,213
What are you doing?

698
00:46:07,296 --> 00:46:09,298
-She told us to wait.
-Let go of me.

699
00:46:09,382 --> 00:46:11,133
-Let go of me.
-She told us to wait.

700
00:46:20,685 --> 00:46:21,686
What?

701
00:46:22,228 --> 00:46:23,437
Who are you two?

702
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:24,605
What are you doing here?

703
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:26,732
Mister.

704
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:28,526
How come you aren't dead?

705
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:31,904
Are you here to see my sister?

706
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:33,531
Your sister?

707
00:46:36,242 --> 00:46:38,077
You're Joo Hyun's sister?

708
00:46:40,413 --> 00:46:43,499
She brought high schoolers here?
She's crazy.

709
00:46:46,085 --> 00:46:48,129
Please find my sister, sir.

710
00:46:48,212 --> 00:46:50,965
She went in a while ago,
and I haven't heard from her since.

711
00:46:51,048 --> 00:46:52,049
How long has it been?

712
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:53,968
Exactly 22 minutes.

713
00:46:54,552 --> 00:46:56,178
By the way, are you really all right?

714
00:46:57,138 --> 00:46:58,389
I thought you were dying.

715
00:46:59,765 --> 00:47:02,059
The police are coming,
so get to the nearest station.

716
00:47:12,111 --> 00:47:14,280
My sister should be fine.

717
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:17,950
She'll be okay, right?

718
00:47:19,452 --> 00:47:20,453
Right?

719
00:48:41,867 --> 00:48:42,993
Hey, Hyun. Joo Hyun!

720
00:48:43,828 --> 00:48:44,829
Hey.

721
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,085
What happened?

722
00:48:51,168 --> 00:48:52,294
I was looking at that and someone...

723
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,174
THE 13TH ONE WAS WRONG

724
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,344
Are you okay?

725
00:49:42,428 --> 00:49:44,471
Are you all right?

726
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,641
Wait!

727
00:49:50,394 --> 00:49:51,395
Hyun.

728
00:49:53,939 --> 00:49:54,940
Min!

729
00:49:57,693 --> 00:49:58,944
Ji-hoon, get him.

730
00:49:59,028 --> 00:50:00,905
Let go, Min. Just let him go.

731
00:50:05,492 --> 00:50:06,493
Are you okay?

732
00:50:09,496 --> 00:50:10,581
That way.

733
00:50:15,628 --> 00:50:16,962
We lost him because of you.

734
00:50:17,504 --> 00:50:18,505
He was so suspicious.

735
00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:20,007
Do you have a death wish?

736
00:50:20,716 --> 00:50:22,676
Forget it.
What matters is that you're okay.

737
00:50:32,895 --> 00:50:34,021
Min.

738
00:50:34,104 --> 00:50:35,314
Hyun.

739
00:50:35,397 --> 00:50:37,566
I told you to stay far away from here.

740
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,235
What took you so long?

741
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:40,986
I thought something had happened to you.

742
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,404
What happened to you?

743
00:50:53,207 --> 00:50:54,667
Are you okay?

744
00:51:18,274 --> 00:51:19,275
Hey, you.

745
00:51:20,067 --> 00:51:21,402
-Me?
-Yeah.

746
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:24,530
Lock their front door.

747
00:51:24,613 --> 00:51:28,284
Make sure you hear the lock click
and then go home. Understood?

748
00:51:30,244 --> 00:51:31,287
Okay.

749
00:51:32,413 --> 00:51:33,497
And you.

750
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:35,916
Don't let him into your house.

751
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,168
Be sure to say goodbye at the door.

752
00:51:39,295 --> 00:51:40,504
Got it?

753
00:51:40,587 --> 00:51:41,839
-Whatever.
-Hey.

754
00:51:42,923 --> 00:51:44,717
That's what I was about to tell you.

755
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,968
Call me when you get home.

756
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:48,637
"How come you aren't dead?"

757
00:51:48,721 --> 00:51:51,015
Stop overworking my sister.

758
00:51:51,098 --> 00:51:52,766
She's injured and you're making her drive.

759
00:51:54,601 --> 00:51:55,728
Darn it.

760
00:51:59,815 --> 00:52:03,319
I think he took it too far this time.

761
00:52:05,321 --> 00:52:06,322
Hey.

762
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:08,032
What are you doing?

763
00:52:09,074 --> 00:52:10,075
Coming.

764
00:52:30,262 --> 00:52:35,642
VIEWERS' MESSAGE BOARD

765
00:52:35,726 --> 00:52:36,894
HE'S SATISFYING HIS OWN GREED

766
00:52:36,977 --> 00:52:38,562
NOW, THAT'S MORE LIKE THE POLICE

767
00:52:38,645 --> 00:52:40,230
GAETAL IS JUST A MURDERER

768
00:52:40,314 --> 00:52:41,857
GAETAL IS JUST A CRIMINAL

769
00:53:23,524 --> 00:53:26,110
Why did Joo Hyun
have to come in here alone?

770
00:53:26,193 --> 00:53:27,444
What's all this mess?

771
00:53:27,528 --> 00:53:28,821
Did she really fight on her own?

772
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:30,030
Was she always this athletic?

773
00:53:30,114 --> 00:53:32,825
You think she fought back
because she knew how to?

774
00:53:32,908 --> 00:53:36,537
You know her temper. I'm sure
she fought back with all her might.

775
00:53:39,373 --> 00:53:40,457
Sir.

776
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:42,042
Are you upstairs?

777
00:53:51,093 --> 00:53:53,137
Don't miss anything. Look carefully.

778
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,596
Hello.

779
00:53:58,350 --> 00:53:59,643
Isn't this blood?

780
00:53:59,726 --> 00:54:01,562
It smells like paint, but...

781
00:54:01,645 --> 00:54:02,688
Collect all of these.

782
00:54:10,362 --> 00:54:12,364
What?

783
00:54:20,873 --> 00:54:22,166
I need a chair.

784
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:24,960
-Jeez.
-Goodness.

785
00:54:25,043 --> 00:54:26,670
I'll do it.

786
00:54:26,753 --> 00:54:28,589
Okay, let's put it here.

787
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:56,783
Nice. Wait a minute.

788
00:54:58,243 --> 00:54:59,286
Yes, sir.

789
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:00,954
<i>Where is that bastard Kim Mu-chan?</i>

790
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:02,956
Hello? Director.

791
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,125
I'm not getting a good signal here.

792
00:55:05,209 --> 00:55:06,293
Hello?

793
00:55:07,127 --> 00:55:08,295
Hello?

794
00:55:35,617 --> 00:55:37,119
No matter how hard I think about it,

795
00:55:37,494 --> 00:55:40,539
I don't think Gaetal
is close to Kwon Seok-joo.

796
00:55:40,622 --> 00:55:42,499
If they are related somehow,

797
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:44,376
he would've avoided Kwon Seok-joo's house.

798
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,295
And the writing on the wall...

799
00:55:46,378 --> 00:55:47,546
Kwon Seok-joo

800
00:55:48,046 --> 00:55:50,048
killed his daughter's murderer himself.

801
00:55:50,716 --> 00:55:52,885
He had all of Korea
on his side at one point,

802
00:55:52,968 --> 00:55:55,137
and he had numerous followers
supporting him.

803
00:55:56,346 --> 00:55:57,681
The guy called Gaetal

804
00:55:58,223 --> 00:55:59,224
could be one of them.

805
00:56:01,435 --> 00:56:05,189
By the way, when I saw you
at Kwon's house,

806
00:56:05,564 --> 00:56:07,065
I suddenly remembered.

807
00:56:07,524 --> 00:56:08,650
For Kwon Seok-joo's case...

808
00:56:10,903 --> 00:56:13,655
You were in charge from the moment
his daughter was kidnapped, right?

809
00:56:18,452 --> 00:56:21,163
-So?
-Gaetal's test video...

810
00:56:22,623 --> 00:56:24,750
You knew where it was filmed, didn't you?

811
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,214
You knew it was Kwon Seok-joo's house.

812
00:56:36,345 --> 00:56:39,306
You'd been there before.

813
00:57:28,105 --> 00:57:29,690
Keep your heads down.

814
00:57:32,025 --> 00:57:33,610
Inmate 9141. Keep your head down.

815
00:57:34,903 --> 00:57:35,988
Turn your heads.

816
00:57:36,071 --> 00:57:37,239
Keep your heads down.

817
00:57:37,322 --> 00:57:40,075
<i>Eight years ago, Kwon Seok-joo</i>
<i>voluntarily went to prison.</i>

818
00:57:41,326 --> 00:57:42,953
<i>He said he felt absolutely no shame</i>

819
00:57:43,036 --> 00:57:44,663
<i>about having punished</i>
<i>his daughter's killer.</i>

820
00:57:52,254 --> 00:57:54,339
<i>Gaetal is just like Kwon Seok-joo.</i>

821
00:57:54,965 --> 00:57:57,175
<i>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</i>

822
00:57:57,259 --> 00:58:00,846
<i>They're both arrogant and dare to take</i>
<i>the law into their own hands</i>

823
00:58:00,929 --> 00:58:02,347
<i>if it can't solve the problem.</i>

824
00:58:06,685 --> 00:58:07,978
<i>Gaetal</i>

825
00:58:08,437 --> 00:58:10,147
<i>is definitely close to Kwon Seok-joo.</i>

826
00:58:11,523 --> 00:58:12,858
<i>Very close.</i>

827
00:58:19,031 --> 00:58:21,658
{\an8}We've found traces of Gaetal

828
00:58:21,742 --> 00:58:24,494
{\an8}in Bae Gi-chul's hideout
and Kwon Seok-joo's house.

829
00:58:24,578 --> 00:58:25,662
{\an8}These two places.

830
00:58:26,622 --> 00:58:29,833
{\an8}If there's no record of anyone logging
onto the internet from either location

831
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:31,126
{\an8}while the voting took place,

832
00:58:31,209 --> 00:58:33,170
{\an8}Gaetal must have a hideout elsewhere.

833
00:58:34,046 --> 00:58:36,882
{\an8}Even so, he wouldn't have gone that far.

834
00:58:37,883 --> 00:58:39,092
{\an8}If we look for places

835
00:58:39,176 --> 00:58:42,721
{\an8}that used more electricity than usual
around the voting periods

836
00:58:42,804 --> 00:58:44,890
{\an8}or housed a larger server

837
00:58:44,973 --> 00:58:46,725
{\an8}in the vicinity of these two places...

838
00:58:48,685 --> 00:58:50,937
{\an8}Fussing over it won't change anything.

839
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,815
{\an8}Don't underestimate Kwon Seok-joo.

840
00:58:53,899 --> 00:58:56,777
Don't show him anything
he could use to read you.

841
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:55,043
He used your place as his hideout

842
00:59:55,127 --> 00:59:57,462
and to prepare for The Killing Vote.

843
00:59:58,505 --> 01:00:01,967
We could see how interested he is in you
from the sheer amount

844
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:04,302
of information he collected about you.

845
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,180
-And...
-The rabbit is all worn out.

846
01:00:10,267 --> 01:00:12,686
It was my daughter's favorite.

847
01:00:14,187 --> 01:00:16,356
I didn't store it properly.

848
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:19,943
Are you...

849
01:00:21,695 --> 01:00:22,696
Gaetal?

850
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:36,626
THE 13TH ONE WAS WRONG

851
01:00:39,045 --> 01:00:40,172
Should I ask you again?

852
01:00:41,214 --> 01:00:42,340
Kwon Seok-joo.

853
01:00:43,133 --> 01:00:45,510
Do you know anything about Gaetal

854
01:00:46,011 --> 01:00:47,721
and The Killing Vote?

855
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:00,609
Two people will be killed every month.

856
01:01:00,692 --> 01:01:02,152
So please think carefully.

857
01:01:02,778 --> 01:01:05,155
What does the writing on the wall mean?

858
01:01:10,952 --> 01:01:12,412
My daughter Na-rae

859
01:01:13,371 --> 01:01:15,290
was stabbed with a knife 22 times.

860
01:01:18,376 --> 01:01:21,129
I did the same thing to her murderer.

861
01:01:24,633 --> 01:01:25,634
<i>Seven.</i>

862
01:01:27,135 --> 01:01:28,178
<i>Eight.</i>

863
01:01:28,595 --> 01:01:29,596
<i>Nine.</i>

864
01:01:32,557 --> 01:01:35,477
He was already dead, but I couldn't stop.

865
01:01:36,228 --> 01:01:37,646
He was the son of a bitch who dared

866
01:01:38,647 --> 01:01:40,065
to lay his hands on my daughter.

867
01:01:41,566 --> 01:01:42,567
<i>Ten.</i>

868
01:01:43,068 --> 01:01:44,069
<i>Eleven.</i>

869
01:01:44,611 --> 01:01:45,654
<i>Twelve.</i>

870
01:01:45,737 --> 01:01:49,199
<i>And then the 13th thrust...</i>

871
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,538
The knife slipped in the rain,
so the 13th stab wound was different

872
01:01:55,038 --> 01:01:57,457
from the one my daughter sustained.

873
01:02:00,335 --> 01:02:02,712
That's probably what it means.

874
01:02:03,713 --> 01:02:06,591
The 13th one
was subtly but clearly different.

875
01:02:06,675 --> 01:02:07,968
And wrong.

876
01:02:08,802 --> 01:02:10,387
Did anyone know about that?

877
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:11,972
It wasn't in the autopsy report.

878
01:02:12,055 --> 01:02:13,473
Do you remember who you told this to?

879
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,852
I just realized it too. So no.

880
01:02:18,937 --> 01:02:22,232
I'm sure someone who was very interested
in this case found out.

881
01:02:22,858 --> 01:02:26,570
Who would be
this interested in you or this case?

882
01:02:27,112 --> 01:02:28,280
Your friends, relatives,

883
01:02:28,363 --> 01:02:30,824
or someone who liked or respected you.

884
01:02:30,907 --> 01:02:33,201
Did anyone approach you as a fan?

885
01:02:33,285 --> 01:02:36,246
Was there anyone
who particularly doted on your daughter?

886
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:40,792
Kim Mu-chan.

887
01:02:44,421 --> 01:02:45,422
Pardon?

888
01:02:51,845 --> 01:02:53,638
We were very close in the past,

889
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,392
<i>and he told me that he respected me.</i>

890
01:03:01,479 --> 01:03:04,107
<i>He also knows about the phrase</i>
<i>"the devils who were deemed innocent."</i>

891
01:03:10,906 --> 01:03:12,532
The only one who fits the description

892
01:03:12,616 --> 01:03:14,284
would be Kim Mu-chan.

893
01:03:18,663 --> 01:03:20,248
Don't trust him too much.

894
01:03:21,374 --> 01:03:24,711
That's all I have to say to you.

895
01:03:25,211 --> 01:03:26,838
You've changed a lot
during your stay here.

896
01:03:28,715 --> 01:03:30,634
Talking nonsense to a cop.

897
01:03:37,974 --> 01:03:39,434
Inmate 0512. I've finished
talking with them.

898
01:03:39,517 --> 01:03:41,978
Wait. I still have more questions to ask.

899
01:03:57,911 --> 01:04:00,997

THE DAY

908
01:05:13,528 --> 01:05:15,697
{\an8}MY HUSBAND DIED

909
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:32,672
How can it be so empty?

910
01:05:32,756 --> 01:05:34,549
Seriously. I hope more mourners come.

911
01:05:38,219 --> 01:05:39,471
Money.

912
01:05:40,138 --> 01:05:41,931
-Where did it come from?
-I don't know.

913
01:05:46,603 --> 01:05:48,063
Please call 911!

914
01:05:55,653 --> 01:05:57,572
Is what Kwon Seok-joo said true?

915
01:05:57,655 --> 01:05:58,990
Were you two that close?

916
01:05:59,074 --> 01:06:01,076
The list of people
who read Kwon Seok-joo's case file,

917
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:03,953
those who were present to hear him
address the court, and acquaintances.

918
01:06:04,037 --> 01:06:05,205
Put them together for me.

919
01:06:05,663 --> 01:06:07,916
Don't avoid the question and tell me.

920
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,376
There's something more
between you and him, right?

921
01:06:11,002 --> 01:06:12,754
That's what it seemed like.

922
01:06:13,171 --> 01:06:15,006
Wait. Superintendent Kim!

THE KILLING VOTE

925
01:06:37,487 --> 01:06:39,447
{\an8}<i>Hello, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

926
01:06:39,531 --> 01:06:40,907
{\an8}Today was on short notice,

927
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:43,493
{\an8}<i>but I'm here with a special episode.</i>

928
01:06:43,576 --> 01:06:47,330
{\an8}<i>It's because I heard tragic news</i>
<i>of an innocent cop getting injured.</i>

929
01:06:49,207 --> 01:06:52,669
{\an8}<i>Shall we check</i>

930
01:06:52,752 --> 01:06:54,629
{\an8}<i>if the police has told us the truth?</i>

931
01:06:56,548 --> 01:06:58,091
<i>Take the video properly.</i>

932
01:07:00,176 --> 01:07:01,511
Somebody's moving.

933
01:07:02,345 --> 01:07:03,388
Where?

934
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,598
That's crazy. He survived it.

935
01:07:06,558 --> 01:07:08,309
<i>That is crazy.</i>

936
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:11,146
<i>Jackpot! We're going to get so many views.</i>

937
01:07:13,273 --> 01:07:14,816
Who's that woman?

938
01:07:15,733 --> 01:07:16,818
His girlfriend?

939
01:07:20,864 --> 01:07:21,948
<i>Ouch! It's hot!</i>

940
01:07:22,615 --> 01:07:24,576
Damn, that scared me!

941
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:26,077
<i>Hey, we should go!</i>

942
01:07:37,589 --> 01:07:39,549
-There they are!
-They're coming out.

943
01:07:39,632 --> 01:07:40,633
Superintendent Kim Mu-chan.

944
01:07:40,717 --> 01:07:43,094
Please tell us what's going on.

945
01:07:50,685 --> 01:07:55,315
{\an8}<i>The rotten and corrupt police are now</i>
<i>mocking the people with fake news.</i>

946
01:07:55,899 --> 01:07:58,651
{\an8}<i>They distorted the true intention</i>
<i>of The Killing Vote</i>

947
01:07:58,735 --> 01:08:02,238
{\an8}<i>and framed me for hurting an innocent cop.</i>

948
01:08:05,575 --> 01:08:07,243
{\an8}<i>Are you watching, Mom?</i>

949
01:08:07,869 --> 01:08:10,079
{\an8}Yeah, I'm watching it.

950
01:08:11,623 --> 01:08:13,416
{\an8}<i>What was so wrong?</i>

951
01:08:14,292 --> 01:08:15,501
{\an8}<i>Our justice is</i>

952
01:08:15,835 --> 01:08:18,796
{\an8}<i>extremely rational.</i>

953
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:24,219
{\an8}<i>Making sure that those</i>
<i>who deserve to die are dead.</i>

954
01:08:24,302 --> 01:08:28,139
{\an8}<i>And calling the villain</i>
<i>on the gallows a victim.</i>

955
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:37,565
{\an8}<i>Tell me,</i>

956
01:08:38,191 --> 01:08:39,525
{\an8}<i>Superintendent Kim Mu-chan.</i>

957
01:08:39,984 --> 01:08:43,196
{\an8}<i>What is justice for you?</i>

958
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:56,626
Please give us a comment.

959
01:09:08,137 --> 01:09:09,806
You and The Killing Vote.

960
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,851
Don't be mistaken.

961
01:09:14,894 --> 01:09:17,522
You're not a hero.

962
01:09:18,731 --> 01:09:20,483
{\an8}KIM REPORTED TO BE IN SERIOUS CONDITION

963
01:09:20,692 --> 01:09:22,443

{\an8}<i>Do you remember anything about that guy?</i>

967
01:10:17,749 --> 01:10:18,791
{\an8}His smell.

968
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:21,127
{\an8}<i>He had the same smell</i>
<i>as when you play with fireworks.</i>

969
01:10:21,544 --> 01:10:23,713
{\an8}<i>It might be the same culprit</i>
<i>for both cases.</i>

970
01:10:23,963 --> 01:10:25,006
{\an8}Superintendent Kim, that man...

971
01:10:25,131 --> 01:10:26,549
{\an8}I think he's that taxi driver.

972
01:10:26,883 --> 01:10:28,968
{\an8}<i>Who in the world</i>

973
01:10:29,844 --> 01:10:30,887
{\an8}Number one fan?

01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:33,264
{\an8}<i>This person's been sending letters</i>
<i>for years without fail.</i>

975
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:35,558
