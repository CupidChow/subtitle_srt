1
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,043
WOULD YOU LIKE TO VOTE?

2
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:00,078
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,462
SAFETY OF CHILD ACTORS WAS ENSURED

4
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,402
<i>How about reinstating
the death penalty? I'm totally for it.</i>

5
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:10,839
<i>Why protect the rights of those
who ruin the lives of others?</i>

6
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:14,200
<i>I agree. Bae, Eom, and Oh
from the Killing Vote</i>

7
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,118
<i>shamelessly lived good lives.</i>

8
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:18,287
<i>Tons of prisoners on death row
live comfortably.</i>

9
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,957
<i>I hate how sentences aren't carried out,
so taxes are wasted on spared criminals.</i>

10
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,126
<i>There's concern
it can turn into lawful murder.</i>

11
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,462
<i>"If one does not have
the right to kill oneself,</i>

12
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,465
<i>it's also impossible
to hand over those rights to another,"</i>

13
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:30,841
<i>which was Beccaria's logic.</i>

14
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,176
<i>People are like dogs and pigs.</i>

15
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,304
<i>There needs to be an example
so they won't keep committing crimes.</i>

16
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:39,725
Using multiple accounts on online forums
where they can remain anonymous,

17
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,393
they continue to fuel debates.

18
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,189
Do you see these punctuation marks?

19
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,609
How they use punctuation marks
reflects their habits.

20
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,569
It's from the same person.

21
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:53,948
So they're astroturfing
even though the vote will happen?

22
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,449
I wonder why.

23
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,911
At first, I thought
it was just some Killing Vote fanatic.

24
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,288
But when you investigate cybercrime,

25
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:03,207
some people just leave you
with a bad feeling.

26
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,001
Yeah, persistent psychos.

27
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,419
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

28
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,135
At the same time every day,

29
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,471
they post the same number of threads,

30
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:20,683
and they write comments
on every single one of their own posts

31
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,268
using different accounts.

32
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,104
Persistent, crazy, and competent.

33
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,565
Goodness, this one's the real deal.

34
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,024
- Right?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,359
That's for sure.

36
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,571
Lee Min-soo has an accomplice
other than Jung Jin-wook.

37
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,715
Seeing how they instigate people online,

38
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,459
it could be
the voting system administrator.

39
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,243
The motive.

40
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,620
Like Superintendent Kim said,

41
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:44,206
I don't see why they have to
instigate people before the vote.

42
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,780
The key phrases we found
from Number One Fan's fourth letter

43
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,008
were "karma," "lawful murder,"

44
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,509
"the last shield,"

45
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:56,677
and...

46
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,138
"death penalty."

47
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,433
The next target

48
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,728
must be a prisoner on death row.

49
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,232
These punks are basically recruiting
guild members to raid the prison.

50
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,902
GUILD
ORGANIZED GROUP OF PEOPLE IN ONLINE GAMES

51
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,696
KARMA, LAWFUL MURDER
THE LAST SHIELD, DEATH PENALTY

52
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,544
EPISODE 8

53
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,105
Hello.

54
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,982
Can I have one juice?

55
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,112
Here's your juice.

56
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,739
Thank you. Have a good day.

57
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,074
-Have a nice day.
- Bye.

58
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,870
-Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Lee.

59
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,459
-Morning.
- Good morning.

60
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,672
-Hello.
- Good morning.

61
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,965
-Run.
- Hurry.

62
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,092
Good morning.

63
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,177
You'll be late for the class. Run.

64
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,849
THE 13TH ONE WAS WRONG

65
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:32,690
PERSONAL INFORMATION

66
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,238
There.

67
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,240
What's that now?

68
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,574
Are you kidding?

69
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,538
HEADING TO NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

70
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,999
Isn't it nice that they look clearer now?

71
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,302
I heard you've become
farsighted due to age.

72
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,299
How's Jung Jin-wook? Still the same?

73
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,177
<i>With this spirit</i>

74
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,930
<i>And this mind</i>

75
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,724
Yes, the same and then some.

76
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,685
Thanks to him, I know
the lyrics in all four verses

77
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,228
of the national anthem now.

78
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,522
That nutjob.

79
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,233
The tenacious bastard
hasn't slept a wink for days now.

80
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,193
We've asked him
how the voting by text works

81
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,195
and where their hideout is,
but he won't answer.

82
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,864
<i>Should we just send him to jail?</i>

83
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,198
It'll be over tomorrow.

84
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,283
Let's wait and see.

85
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,535
We could have him confront Lee.

86
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:30,247
<i>Okay. And as for Bae's wife's case
the local precinct is working on,</i>

87
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,374
we got more footage from the funeral.

88
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,585
<i>Someone wasn't on the guest list.</i>

89
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,795
<i>I sent it to our group text.
You should check it out.</i>

90
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,921
Group text?

91
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,476
I guess we missed him
because he got changed.

92
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,896
I'm sure we checked
everyone who left the building.

93
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,397
Which exit did he go through?

94
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,233
He's definitely an amateur,

95
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,944
but he was pretty sly
with covering up the camera.

96
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,781
You can easily learn
how to avoid CCTV cameras online.

97
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,784
There are a lot of online communities
where those with criminal records

98
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,536
share cops' plate numbers
and schedules of crackdowns.

99
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,973
Have you ever played escape room games?

100
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,999
I guess you haven't.

101
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,961
Those glued to their computers
are making the real world crazy.

102
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,632
People like you. I heard you were arrested
for hacking into others' computers.

103
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,218
Well, that's when I was much younger.

104
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,427
I was just curious, so...

105
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,971
Also, not all hacking is the same!

106
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,933
I even got this job for helping the cops
with my hacking skills.

107
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,352
Robin Hood didn't think
he was a thief either.

108
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,604
Even quoting Robin Hood means you're old.

109
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,002
Hello, this is Kim Mu-chan.

110
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,838
Jovovich, Bae Gi-chul's wife.

111
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,757
They said she was murdered
with something that was elastic.

112
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,759
No, we don't have it yet.

113
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,720
I was thinking it might be a jump rope.

114
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,473
Yes, please consider it.

115
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,815
Wait!

116
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:20,899
- Wait!
- Min!

117
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,235
If I don't get in now,
I'll be in big trouble!

118
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,945
You said going to school was a hassle.

119
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,257
Just go to your academies for now.
I'll hire a tutor too.

120
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,658
Are you crazy? I need good attendance
for early admission.

121
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,076
Go for regular admissions!

122
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,828
You've always hated going to school.

123
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,164
You can comfortably study at home.
What's wrong with you?

124
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,999
Unbelievable. Who threw me into class

125
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,209
after I said I'd rather die
than go to school?

126
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,170
That's because you were being bullied.

127
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,881
You're still bringing that up? So petty.

128
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,549
Why are you doing this?

129
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,712
Tell me. What's this about?

130
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,052
Why are you lying
to stop me from going to school?

131
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,597
Is another bomb going to go off at school?

132
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,640
Bomb?

133
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,935
Well, something like that.

134
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,099
Anyway, it's dangerous. No!

135
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,063
Min, don't go!

136
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,566
Your homeroom teacher...

137
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,652
Darn it.

138
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,906
REINSTATE THE DEATH PENALTY

139
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,659
- Our justice is...
- Rational!

140
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,995
-Reinstate...
- The death penalty!

141
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,040
- Our justice is...
- Rational!

142
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,792
- Reinstate...
- The death penalty!

143
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,961
- Be quiet!
- Reinstate the death penalty, my foot!

144
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,339
- Reinstate...
- The death penalty!

145
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,841
Our justice is...

146
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,218
- Rational!
- Rational!

147
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,012
Our justice is rational!

148
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,223
- Rational!
- Rational!

149
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,017
This country wants the death penalty!

150
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,144
- We want it!
- We want it!

151
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,980
- Our justice is...
- Rational!

152
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,232
Reinstate...

153
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,942
- The death penalty!
- The death penalty!

154
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,778
OFFICE OF ASSEMBLYWOMAN MIN JI-YOUNG

155
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,328
REDEVELOPMENT AREA

156
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,931

CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PROJECT

158
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,681
Your office has great natural light.

159
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,308
You'll need to wear sunscreen often here.

160
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,029
Do you know why I like you, Ms. Min?

161
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,908
You work so hard
even though you don't have to,

162
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,535
which makes you very special.

163
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,835
CHAE DO-HEE'S KILLING VOTE SPECIAL

164
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,420
I loved the proposal for your show.

165
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,463
You must've been disappointed
to have it canceled.

166
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,176
Gaetal was already caught,

167
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,097
and sharing viewers' stories
without the Killing Vote would be boring.

168
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,308
So I understand
why the higher-ups canceled it.

169
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,643
I want you to resume your show.

170
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,896
I'll set everything up for you.

171
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,318
You know what
"set everything up" means, right?

172
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,322
I need a solid cue sheet
to carry on with the show.

173
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,166
Then, turn off the voice recorder.

174
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:39,598
So you're saying
there will be another Killing Vote?

175
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,932
Are you certain about this?

176
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:44,227
I've already talked to your boss,

177
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,480
so you just have to do
what you're good at.

178
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,441
For every 1% increase in viewer ratings,

179
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,276
you'll receive extra incentives.

180
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:53,987
What's wrong?

181
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:57,657
If I make the game for you to play,

182
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:58,784
does it hurt your pride?

183
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,231
Then, I'll look for someone else.

184
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,707
By any chance...

185
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,503
are you Gaetal?

186
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,385
I learned about his identity
from a reliable source.

187
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,678
And the police promised me
a scoop on it.

188
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,681
There wasn't a hint of you at all
in any intel I obtained.

189
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,850
When did this become your game?

190
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,230
Look, kid.

191
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,857
If you want to work with me,

192
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,568
don't ask about what you want to know.

193
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,488
Ask about what you should let people know.

194
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,826
All right, Ms. Min.

195
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,206
Who is the target
of the next Killing Vote?

196
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,300
Hey, have you seen
this household's electricity bill?

197
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,719
They're using more electricity
than an apartment building.

198
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,513
What are they hiding inside that house?

199
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,657
They must be hiding something.

200
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,641
Otherwise, this bill doesn't make...

201
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,143
Hello, this is KEPCO.

202
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,354
I'm calling about unusually high
electricity consumption at your home.

203
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,118
We're wondering
if it's electrical leakage.

204
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,317
We can send someone
to check if you'd like.

205
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,153
- There's no need.
- I see. No need.

206
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,237
I see.

207
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,738
Still, I'd recommend...

208
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,324
Hello? This is KEPCO.
A faulty circuit...

209
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,701
She hung up.

210
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,663
The housekeeper said
they have a patient at home.

211
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,874
I sounded awkward...
I overdid it, didn't I?

212
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,168
Their home uses
the Lockhard security system,

213
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,919
so this electricity bill is nothing.

214
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,297
Lockhard? Really?

215
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,966
I made it through two gates
but was caught at the third one.

216
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,301
I barely managed to run away.

217
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,137
Goodness.

218
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,307
The devil just whispered
in my ear. What do I do?

219
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,225
I really want
to break down that third gate.

220
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,768
See? Look!

221
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,896
- You're getting a call.
- I am?

222
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,481
I see. It's just a phone call.

223
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,316
GAETAL NUMBER ONE
NEW MESSAGE

224
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,567
It's...

225
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,027
It's actually a text.

226
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,750
AT 5:00 P.M., APRIL 20
INJEONG PARK ARCADE

227
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,448
I told them I didn't want to
do direct deals though.

228
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,951
Are you buying sneakers from people again?

229
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,245
Why does it have to be now?

230
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,751
THIRTY MINUTES

231
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,901
What are you doing? Someone has to stay.

232
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,718
We can't wait here forever.

233
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,970
If Lee Min-soo erases his link with Jung

234
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,597
and flees abroad, we'll never get him.

235
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,641
We still need more solid evidence.

236
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,559
What you found at the school isn't valid,

237
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,270
and Jung can easily change
his statements in court.

238
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,190
All we can do now is
to wait and catch him red-handed.

239
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,733
What if the vote doesn't happen?

240
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,237
It's bad enough to leave
that dangerous guy in school.

241
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,322
What if he makes
complete fools out of us?

242
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,782
There will be another vote.

243
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,991
It'll happen.

244
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,744
If we stop here,
we're admitting that Jung did it alone,

245
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,870
and the case is closed.

246
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,874
Then, Gaetal's next votes
will be considered mere copycats.

247
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,834
COPYCAT
SOMEONE WHO COPIES ANOTHER'S IDEAS

248
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,379
Also,

249
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,256
your sister.

250
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,466
She'll be fine.

251
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,009
Sang-jae and others are observing.

252
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,594
And Gaetal

253
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,805
won't do anything to kids.

254
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,848
I know Gaetal won't.

255
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,684
But Lee Min-soo could.

256
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,852
He's harmed a child before.

257
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,980
Lee Min-soo and Gaetal.

258
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,607
I keep getting this feeling
they aren't the same person.

259
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,235
Are you sure Lee Min-soo is Gaetal?

260
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,154
Maybe you just want him to be Gaetal.

261
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,951
Do I have to beg you to trust me?

262
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,498
I found something
while investigating Lee...

263
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,166
Did we have to come here?

264
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:40,589
Do you have any idea
how hard it was to get here?

265
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,386
I have to drive him around
and take him home.

266
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,138
Is he my boss or what?

267
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,394
Is that the culprit's house?

268
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,479
Stand back.

269
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,149
What? Why?

270
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,193
Do you think they saw me?

271
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,403
We're not busted, are we?

272
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,907
So you're on a stakeout, right?

273
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,975
JI-HOON, WHERE ARE YOU?
WHY AREN'T YOU HERE?

274
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,279
PLAYING HOOKY?
GIVING COLLEGE UP?

275
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,754
HEY

276
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,255
I can't believe him.

277
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,136
Guys that leave you on read are the worst.

278
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,971
I guess he's one of them. Just ditch him.

279
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:33,433
I should check on him. He's been
absent for two days without notice.

280
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
I'm the class president.

281
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,854
Maybe he went there.

282
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,147
The death penalty protest.

283
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,901
- What protest?
- It's all over social media.

284
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,194
Look. Crazy, isn't it?

285
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,156
The government
is cutting the welfare budget

286
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,919
while keeping criminals fed and sheltered.

287
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,618
How stupid is that?

288
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,119
They should just kill them all.

289
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,500
What?

290
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,584
What's gotten into you?

291
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,252
You were never interested in politics.

292
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,213
I still wouldn't be
if it weren't for Gaetal.

293
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,924
Gaetal's fan club is taking action.

294
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,133
You should join too.

295
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,845
Ji-hoon defended Gaetal
in front of Mr. Lee too,

296
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,055
so he might be there.

297
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,140
Min.

298
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,726
One second.

299
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,188
Have you heard anything
from Ji-hoon today?

300
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,857
He's absent without notice.
I can't reach his grandmother either.

301
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,276
I texted him, but he left me on read.

302
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,863
It seems Ji-hoon's family
didn't register their current address.

303
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,867
They went to his address,
but it wasn't his home.

304
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,368
We're the Victim Care team
from the police.

305
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,788
We've received
a counseling request for Kim Ji-hoon,

306
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,415
but we can't reach him

307
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,208
and his house was empty.

308
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,044
Min, do you know where Ji-hoon lives?

309
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,756
We've met near his place a few times,

310
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,175
but I don't know the exact address.

311
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,844
The Shinyeon Apartments in Seorae-dong?

312
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,595
Yes.

313
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,347
No one lives there.

314
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,183
The neighbors said
no one has ever moved into that unit.

315
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,309
What?

316
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,941
Let's all be Gaetal.

317
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,110
You can be Gaetal too.

318
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,486
Come buy Gaetal's mask.

319
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:13,992
I will execute you.

320
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,999
I will execute you.

321
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,918
- Three, two, one.
- Buy Gaetal's mask.

322
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,381
Put Gaetal's mask on
and be the executioner.

323
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,216
Come and buy Gaetal's mask.

324
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,347
Gaetal masks on sale.

325
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,932
Come buy Gaetal's mask.

326
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,074
No.

327
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,007
No, this won't do.

328
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,401
Jjoo.

329
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,653
- What?
- You have some too.

330
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,905
Give him one. I feel bad.

331
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,785
I don't have any.

332
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:21,870
Min took all of mine.

333
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,747
Gosh, I have such an unhelpful colleague.

334
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,376
Excuse me.

335
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,729
This is the Cyber Bureau's secret item.

336
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,274
Thanks.
It's certainly helping me stay awake.

337
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,568
No worries.

338
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,414
Lee Min-soo has returned home.

339
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,374
There was nothing suspicious.

340
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,460
All right. Good job today.

341
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,880
What are all these by the way?

342
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,549
They were collected at the protest.

343
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,135
They're suspiciously similar to Gaetal's.

344
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,804
Right. I wonder
if they're all from one seller.

345
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,139
Why do people love this?

346
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,658
Everyone on the street is wearing this.

347
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,018
Jeez, put it away. What an eyesore.

348
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:32,899
Gaetal said the Killing Vote
was to punish those who evaded the law.

349
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,860
But those on death row
have been officially sentenced to death.

350
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,363
So what's the point of voting?

351
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,906
Maybe you're wrong.

352
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,117
I don't know why yet,
but my analysis is correct.

353
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,471
Among all the letters from Number One Fan,

354
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,622
those words suggested
the target most clearly.

355
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,255
Though it's always been clear.

356
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,261
Illness is the most common cause of death
for condemned prisoners in Korea.

357
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,055
Next is suicide.

358
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,849
There hasn't been
an actual execution in 20 years,

359
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,811
so those sentenced to death
mostly die natural deaths in prison.

360
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:13,940
When it comes to those
who clearly deserve to die but haven't,

361
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,192
they make perfect targets
for the Killing Vote.

362
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,986
If the majority votes to execute,

363
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,530
will he kill him outside
or inside the prison?

364
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,657
Lee does have good connections,

365
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,742
but it'll be hard to kill a prisoner.

366
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,412
That's probably
why he was gathering accomplices.

367
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,746
It's to take action as a team.

368
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,456
A reverse <i>Prison Break.</i>

369
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,925
It's convincing.

370
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,719
To punishing those who deserve to die,

371
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:48,433
Jung Jin-wook can't be the only one
who's willing to sacrifice their life.

372
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:55,724
Let's narrow down the targets

373
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,527
to death row inmates
related to Lee Min-soo or Min Ji-young.

374
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,612
And share this
with Korea Correctional Service.

375
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,322
Yes, sir.

376
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:04,861
<i>Welcome, Number Three.</i>

377
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,781
<i>Now that we're all here, let's begin.</i>

378
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:15,496
I've been really anxious
ever since Number Four was caught.

379
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,249
It wasn't an easy decision
to come here today.

380
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:22,920
Are you sure he doesn't know
anything about me or you all?

381
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:26,424
<i>Number Four is keeping his promise.</i>

382
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,759
Still, this makes me anxious.

383
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:31,470
We just need to be better prepared
and stick to the plan.

384
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,347
That's what he wants as well.

385
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:38,144
Well, I do really like
the next vote though.

386
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,897
Death row inmates living on our tax money

387
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,107
will be killed all at once.

388
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,989
INMATE INFORMATION
MOON CHANG-HOON

389
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,536
Eat up.

390
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:59,081
<i>Last year, the Ministry of Justice</i>

391
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,334
<i>decided to provide each inmate
with bottled water</i>

392
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,462
<i>as a preventive measure
against potential infections,</i>

393
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,842
which is partly supported by us
through a private organization.

394
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:15,556
<i>Death row inmates are required
to get a medical checkup every six months.</i>

395
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,561
<i>After each checkup, they receive
vitamins and supplements from the doctor.</i>

396
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,689
Surprisingly,
most of the death row inmates

397
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,233
gladly take the medication.

398
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,484
Can I get some more?

399
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,907
<i>The high potassium supplement
disguised as a vitamin</i>

400
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,534
<i>will react to the hypotensive drug
mixed with the water,</i>

401
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,828
<i>causing an acute heart attack.</i>

402
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:45,253
<i>One of the death row inmates
is Number Two's mortal enemy,</i>

403
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:49,173
so it'll be like
killing two birds with one stone.

404
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,342
This plan is brilliant.

405
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,803
No one will know our real target.

406
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,513
It's just perfect.

407
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,349
This is not for Number Two.

408
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,059
We're doing this

409
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,895
to open the eyes
of the ignorant government

410
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,689
on behalf of the people.

411
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,359
We've wasted our tax money on those
who should've already died.

412
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,070
Right.

413
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,196
Sure.

414
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:15,908
Number One, you have so much to do.

415
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:18,995
This time, you'll have to manage
those in the field as well.

416
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,329
<i>We've simulated it many times,</i>

417
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,790
<i>so it'll be fine
as long as we stick to the plan.</i>

418
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,419
<i>If by chance the people vote
against the execution,</i>

419
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,421
<i>please follow our emergency protocol.</i>

420
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,881
<i>That is all.</i>

421
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,558
Does anyone know
who and where that Number One guy is?

422
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,810
Why do you care?

423
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:47,690
We take risks by planning
all of this and carrying it out,

424
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,567
but he's hiding there,
looking all pompous.

425
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,860
I don't like that.

426
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,612
You know you're breaking the rules now.

427
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,031
Don't forget.

428
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,658
The more we know about each other,
the riskier it will be.

429
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,329
I mean... Wait.

430
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:03,706
Number Two, what I'm saying is...

431
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,957
Wait. Hang on.

432
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,460
Wait, I'm just saying...

433
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,092
Okay.

434
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,219
Oh, well. I'll just wait.

435
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,679
I understand.

436
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:28,356
Goodness.

437
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,902
Wait.

438
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,822
Wait!

439
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:37,948
No!

440
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,625
Come on, hurry up.

441
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,015
Hey!

442
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:04,725
Wait!

443
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,648
Crap. He's damn fast.

444
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,795
GOOD WORK, PLEASE WAIT
FOR YOUR NEXT ORDERS

445
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:36,715
DEATH PENALTY DOESN'T NEED LOGIC

446
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,762
<i>I'm ready. How about you?</i>

447
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,031
HEADING TO CHEONGNANG PRISON NOW

448
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,075

Hey, Park.

451
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:23,923
I thought you were on leave.

452
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,766
I got an urgent call from the warden.

453
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,103
The word is there's going to be
an assessment and audit soon.

454
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,939
Maybe he's missing
some papers or something.

455
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,750
You seem busy for a weekend.

456
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,026
Right.

457
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,569
It's checkups for death row inmates.

458
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:41,864
It's been six months already?

459
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,949
Gosh, I can see the seasons change,

460
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:45,659
but I can't see how fast time flies.

461
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,870
I know, right?

462
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,048
Doctor.

463
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:01,217
Doctor?

464
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,219
Yes.

465
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,471
You're not supposed to be there.

466
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,972
It's dangerous. Go back in.

467
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,273
What's wrong with her today?

468
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,569
- I'm sure it'll taste good.
- Sure.

469
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,870
I'm so excited.

<i>Hello, are you really Gaetal?</i>

475
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,352
<i>Then, who's the person the police caught?</i>

476
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:58,232
<i>He, you, and I are all Gaetal.</i>

477
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,317
<i>We are all under one name.</i>

478
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,571
<i>Does that mean
I'll be your accomplice too?</i>

479
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:04,738
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,448

TABLE OF CONTENTS

486
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:29,430
The program will be sponsored
by one of our lesser known affiliations.

487
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:33,309
If it gets out that I'm the sponsor,
all the financial support will be cut.

488
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:35,769
And Chae Do-hee...

489
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:37,146
She's not entirely trustworthy,

490
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,024
but she's the best option
we have for now, so let's wait and see.

491
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,276
Dad opened his wallet
more easily than I'd thought.

492
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,903
You don't even have
a building under your name.

493
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,071
Of course, he should.

494
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:48,324
He doesn't treat you like a son
unlike your brothers.

495
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,718
I've been waiting for this chance.

496
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:50,743
It's okay.

497
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:54,622
He just doesn't want to pay taxes
for the son who could die at any moment.

498
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,040
I can understand him.

499
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,416
That's a terrible joke.

500
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,424
Aren't you supposed to be busy?

501
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,176
It's soon, you know.

502
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,512

The cops are here.

505
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:27,946
The cops?

506
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:29,865
Why, all of a sudden?

507
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,040
Ignore it. Don't let them in.

508
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,926
Assemblywoman Min, we're the police.

509
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,219
We'd like your cooperation.

510
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:52,137

It's been a while, ma'am.

516
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:31,844
We meet again.

517
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,392
I hope you know
what you're doing right now.

518
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,518
Mr. Lee Min-soo.

519
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,273
You're under arrest for murdering
Russian citizen Elena Jovovich.

520
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,482
Murder?

521
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:48,026
That's nonsense.

522
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,361
Call the lawyer.

523
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:50,487
Yes, ma'am.

524
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,491
- Wait...
- We're at Ms. Min's house.

525
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,076
Her son is being arrested...

526
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,329
At least tell me the reason.

527
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,133
How is that evidence?

528
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,010
I can't agree with this arrest. Get out.

529
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:16,555
- Get out!
- You'll know this isn't the only evidence.

530
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,102
Sang-jae, escort the guest.

531
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,729
- You...
- Don't.

532
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:26,440
Okay.

533
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:29,777
Don't make this harder.

534
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,112
You have the right to remain silent.

535
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:35,741
If you want to say anything,
save it until your lawyer comes.

536
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,159
For now, just be quiet.

537
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,370
You can plead the Fifth too.

538
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,164
You'll say you didn't do it anyway.

539
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,958
Min-soo!

540
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,335
Calm down, ma'am.

541
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,586
- Let go.
- Okay.

542
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,130
How long?

543
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:51,965
Please, hurry.

544
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:55,803
Get my boy out today.

545
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,389
If you're even one minute late,
I'll shut down your law firm.

546
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,150
Why doesn't he pick up his phone?

547
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:13,987
<i>The number you have dialed is...</i>

548
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,949
KIM JI-HOON

549
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,622
JOO MIN

550
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:24,945
Where's the liberal arts aisle?

551
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,501
Over there? Thank you.

552
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,339
JOO MIN

553
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,012
Are you sure about this?

554
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,265
I already have a pretty bad reputation.

555
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,393
I don't want people to think

556
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:46,270
I'm crazy like you.

557
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,690
This was your idea.

558
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:52,276
This is just the best timing.

559
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,152
That whiny guard isn't around today.

560
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,684
Gaetal is Number One Fan,
and Number One Fan is Lee Min-soo.

561
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,395
He's been sending fan mail for five years.

562
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,647
He deserves
a meet-and-greet with his hero.

563
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,901
Min told me that someone like him
is called a "successful fan."

564
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,507
You know, there was only one time

565
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,343
when I actually thought
I was going to die.

566
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,638
When I was in Lee Min-soo's car,
I had that same feeling.

567
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,223
He gave me the creeps.

568
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:08,685
He smiled, didn't he?

569
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,395
What?

570
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,189
That bastard...

571
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,360
smiled again, right?

572
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,621
Hello, Professor.

573
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,501
I had no idea we'd meet like this.

574
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,005
I've been so anxious

575
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:40,926
thinking I might never meet you again.

576
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,928
You probably had no idea.

577
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,062
I wanted to see you.

578
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,361
You sent a lot of letters.

579
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:03,949
It was you, wasn't it?

580
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:06,410
Number One Fan.

581
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:14,376
I enjoyed reading your replies too.

582
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,758
I was worried you might hate me,

583
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,804
but you showed
you completely understood me.

584
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:30,100
It meant we were
finally communicating properly,

585
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,811
which made reassured me.

586
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,149
I wrote...

587
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:39,359
replies?

588
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,033
What else do you call them?

589
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:53,373
Love letters?

590
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,835
That would be too embarrassing.

591
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:06,762
I wanted to see you,

592
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,931
because I wanted to say goodbye.

593
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,809
There's not much time left.

594
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,439
There's not much time left?

595
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,152
For me?

596
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,238
Or for you?

597
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:32,287
I wasted a long time in prison,
because of one wrong decision.

598
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,539
I realized too late
that I didn't have enough time

599
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:36,500
to make up for that mistake.

600
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,752
That is why

601
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:40,962
I decided to meet you.

602
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,673
Yun-seong.

603
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:47,594
You're Gaetal, aren't you?

604
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:52,099
You started the Killing Vote.

605
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,876
I see.

606
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,004
This is why the cops arrested me.

607
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,383
Am I Gaetal?

608
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:28,260
Gaetal?

609
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,062
Too bad.

610
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:41,565
My dear professor.

611
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:46,914
I felt like I was the only one
putting effort into our relationship,

612
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,446
so it wasn't fun anymore.

613
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,502
It hurt my pride too.

614
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,006
So I decided to make a move fast.

615
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:09,926
If I were Gaetal,

616
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:14,139
who would be the target today?
Don't you want to know?

617
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:25,609
You!

618
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:29,321
Sir!

619
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,158
What do we do?

620
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:36,828
- Hey.
<i>- Jjoo.</i>

621
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:37,954
In the last hour,

622
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:40,398
Lee Min-soo's electricity usage
has significantly increased.

623
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:43,793
It's skyrocketing now.

624
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,421
At least 30 times more
than the average household.

625
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,758
Lee Min-soo is still with you, right?

626
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,885
I feel like something's not right.

627
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,096
What are you trying to do?

628
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,932
Tell me!

629
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:01,394
Tell me now!

630
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:11,947
Ring, ring!

631
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,711
WOULD YOU LIKE TO START THE KILLING VOTE?

632
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:29,589
We'll search the house now,

633
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:31,193
so keep an eye on the electricity use.

634
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:32,693
WOULD YOU LIKE TO START THE KILLING VOTE?

635
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,511
What about Lee Min-soo's alibi then?

636
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,638
How many people are in this together?

637
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,183
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

638
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:43,478
<i>If you thought I'd been arrested
and would be gone forever,</i>

639
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,562
<i>you were wrong.</i>

640
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,273
<i>As long as you're with me,</i>

641
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:49,359
<i>I'll always be by your side.</i>

642
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,034
<i>As you probably all know,</i>

643
00:42:58,118 --> 00:42:59,703
<i>if you don't want to watch this,</i>

644
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:02,956
<i>you can just click on the X
on the top right corner</i>

645
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,374
<i>to automatically abstain.</i>

646
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,887
<i>The person you're voting for tonight</i>

647
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:22,559
<i>is a malicious man who,
under the pretense of justice,</i>

648
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:26,146
<i>led the way in suppressing human rights.</i>

649
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,361
<i>You hit me!</i>

650
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:35,655
<i>He said Woo-taek did it!</i>

651
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:37,615
<i>He hit me like this!</i>

652
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,492
<i>Also known as Wipeout.</i>

653
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,870
<i>- The official asshole</i>
- Grab your guns.

654
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,872
<i>- Of the National Police Agency.</i>
- Guns, now!

655
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:47,083
<i>The humiliating story
of how he beat a disabled person</i>

656
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,794
<i>to force a confession out of him
and tampered with evidence</i>

657
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:51,046
<i>- is very well known.</i>
- Hurry.

658
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,255
Yes, sir.

659
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,888
JOO MIN

660
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,273
WARNING
SERVER ACCESS DENIED

661
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,241
<i>He said Woo-taek did it!</i>

662
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,660
<i>He hit me like this!</i>

663
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,958
Woo-taek.

664
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:37,217
Sir, the electricity use
is surging at Lee Min-soo's house.

665
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:42,180
<i>Kim Mu-chan.</i>

666
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,475
<i>Leader of the special investigation unit
at Nambu Police Agency,</i>

667
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:49,437
<i>Detective Kim Mu-chan is a monster.</i>

668
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,899
<i>After committing
this egregious tampering with evidence...</i>

669
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,526
- What?
<i>- he wasn't fired...</i>

670
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,486
- This bastard.
<i>- and was just demoted.</i>

671
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,863
<i>It was another instance
of punishment for show</i>

672
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:02,992
<i>the police impose
to protect their own officers.</i>

673
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:06,746
Joo Hyun!

674
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,381
I've been looking for you.

675
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,716
What's wrong with Hyun?

676
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,343
Let's go search his house now.

677
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:22,637
There's something going on
at Lee Min-soo's house.

678
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,040
You can't go out. It's dangerous.

679
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,223
Kim Mu-chan.

680
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,308
You're the Killing Vote's target now.

681
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:30,311
I think you should wait here
until the voting is over.

682
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,147
We'll lose the evidence when voting ends!

683
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,650
Wait, Kim Mu-chan!

684
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:39,654
Being seen won't be good,
so you should go back in too.

685
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,030
- Sang-jae, Yoon-ji.
- Yes, sir.

686
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,493
Let's go.

687
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:54,169
What did I do to deserve this?

688
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,670
Ms. Min's sister.

689
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,630
Why are you doing this to me?

690
00:45:57,714 --> 00:45:59,424
You think playing with people is fun?

691
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,677
The previous votes
actually made some sense.

692
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,555
But not with the Superintendent!

693
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:07,932
You can't go. This is an emergency.

694
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:10,369
Hyun, hurry. We must search the house
before the voting ends.

695
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,644
- Kim Mu-chan!
- Jin-soo!

696
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,107
<i>Kim Mu-chan is an evil person.</i>

697
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,235
<i>He framed me for all kinds of crimes</i>

698
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:21,362
<i>and ruined my life.</i>

699
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,282
<i>My life was so tough,</i>

700
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,408
<i>and I made</i>

701
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,577
<i>one mistake.</i>

702
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:30,872
<i>Then, he lied about victims
who never existed,</i>

703
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,291
<i>fabricated the evidence,</i>

704
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,460
<i>and framed me for something I didn't do.</i>

705
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,506
<i>So I was in prison for ten years.</i>

706
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:45,553
<i>Because of Kim Mu-chan,
my son grew up without his father.</i>

707
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:49,474
<i>Because of Kim Mu-chan.</i>

708
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,813
He attacks and abuses innocent citizens.

709
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,690
He's a devil who was deemed innocent.

710
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:04,781
<i>Now, let the Killing Vote
on Detective Kim Mu-chan begin.</i>

711
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,492
<i>What will you choose?</i>

712
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:11,120
Yes or no?

713
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:13,873
Cast your vote now.

714
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,628
What on Earth are you doing?

715
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:20,964
Close that window.

716
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,423
- Just turn them off!
- Turn it off.

717
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:23,883
I said turn it off!

718
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:25,843
- What's your problem?
- I can't believe you!

719
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,178
How dare you? I outrank you!

720
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:28,263
I said turn it off!

721
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,016
You've got to be kidding me!

722
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:42,902
DO YOU VOTE "YES" OR "NO"?

723
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,314
KILLING VOTE SPECIAL PROPOSAL

724
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:51,160
Chae Do-hee, I'm counting on you.

725
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,579
Thank you, sir.

726
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:57,542
INFIRMARY

727
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,715
ALL SET

728
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:04,799
GAETAL NUMBER 77

729
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,890
<i>Stop. Number Five has betrayed us.</i>

730
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:16,311
Give me the medicine.

731
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,862
<i>Not now. Stop.</i>

732
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:28,948
Number Two!

733
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,162
<i>Please.</i>

734
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,330
Please stop.

735
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,094
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

736
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,976
THE KILLING VOTE

737
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:23,795
<i>He beat me up with a mop. I almost died!</i>

738
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,046
ABUSE OF AUTHORITY

739
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,381
VIOLENCE

740
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,466
<i>-Who's behind this?</i>
<i>- I'm Kim Mu-chan.</i>

741
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:30,218
VIOLENT POLICE OFFICER

742
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,636
NO MORE POLICE BRUTALITY!

743
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,513
HE LIED TO US

744
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,264
LIAR!
NO MORE POLICE BRUTALITY!

745
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:37,058
<i>I hope you understand.</i>

746
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:38,559
NO MORE POLICE BRUTALITY!

747
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:41,396
Stop it.

748
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,273
I said stop it.

749
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:46,693
What?

750
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:58,413
What are you doing?
We're on the same team.

751
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,915
Don't tell me you
fell for that lie like a fool?

752
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,879
Listen to him and stay here
for the time being.

753
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:14,637
Hey!

754
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:16,806
Don't!

755
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,474
- Hyun!
- Fix it.

756
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,059
I know you can.

757
00:50:20,143 --> 00:50:21,352
Okay, just hold on.

758
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:23,020
Hold on, okay?

759
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,151
What did I do to deserve this?

760
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,237
You have the passcode
and access to the system!

761
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:33,531
You can stop it.

762
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,366
Go on and shoot.

763
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,118
Shoot me.

764
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:38,369
Come on. Shoot.

765
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,582
Min-soo!

766
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,334
Min-soo!

767
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:54,177
Hyun!

768
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:55,678
Stop it!

769
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,039
Min-soo!

770
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,290
- Min-soo!
- Ma'am!

771
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:48,231
Min-soo!

772
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,066
Min-soo.

773
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,235
Are you okay?

774
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:54,779
Min-soo.

775
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,449
Hey.

776
00:51:58,533 --> 00:51:59,700
Min-soo.

777
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:01,702
Min-soo.

778
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:33,901
This is hilarious!

779
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,795
Ms. Yeon-jeong, sorry I'm late.

780
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:17,612
Mom.

781
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,238
Mom, wake up.

782
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:20,865
Mom.

783
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,742
Mom!

784
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:23,826
No!

785
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,578
No!

786
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:26,662
Help!

787
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:28,247
I need help!

788
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:31,459
Mom!

789
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,543
Help!

790
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:17,797
- What about Lee Min-soo?
- Min's lawyers got him out.

791
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,382
Shots were even fired.

792
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:21,258
If they try to hold Hyun responsible,

793
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:23,135
tell them they can put the blame on me.

794
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:24,971
<i>We'll take care of it. You just rest.</i>

795
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:26,681
<i>You're on leave now, so don't call.</i>

796
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:29,308
I'm not on leave. I'm being replaced.

797
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:32,353
The director is just trying
to protect you.

798
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:36,857
Things just don't add up.

799
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,981
I'm anxious and it feels
like I'm missing something.

800
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:41,112
Did you dream about your mother again?

801
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:45,366
<i>I understand how you feel.
Just be careful, okay?</i>

802
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,493
<i>- Sir!</i>
- Okay, I'm coming!

803
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:50,037
I'll stop by later at night.

804
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:51,122
Okay.

805
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,079
Hello.

806
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,249
Well...

807
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:39,754
I heard Mr. Park
still hasn't left Cheongnang,

808
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:42,506
so you must've not eaten anything
since yesterday.

809
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:44,050
You should have this.

810
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,469
It seemed like the voting had been halted.

811
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,095
What happened to Lee Min-soo?

812
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:49,555
You know what?

813
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,807
Yesterday, I saw
the epitome of overparenting.

814
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:54,810
His mother brought in
the CEO of a law firm to get him out.

815
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,063
With such strong connections,

816
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:59,774
it's no wonder
he started the Killing Vote.

817
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,110
I guess you couldn't search
his house either.

818
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:04,195
No.

819
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:08,699
As soon as the voting system went down,
the electricity use started to drop.

820
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:12,119
And Jjoo even pointed a gun
at Lee Min-soo's head,

821
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:15,498
so it'll be impossible for us
to get a search warrant.

822
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:22,046
Right. Did you get to watch
what Gaetal streamed afterward?

823
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:24,924
If you'd like to...

824
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,059
<i>Today's stream was a special episode</i>

825
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,811
<i>to show that we're still standing strong.</i>

826
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,604
<i>Everyone.</i>

827
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:41,857
<i>Gaetal isn't one person.</i>

828
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:45,820
<i>Anyone who wants to fight corruption
and promote justice in this world</i>

829
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,782
<i>can become a watchdog.</i>

830
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,534
<i>All of us</i>

831
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:53,536
<i>are Gaetal.</i>

832
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,543
Can I ask you a favor?

833
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,461
Sure.

834
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:06,423
Could you ask Mr. Park to bring me a book?

835
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,259
<i>Discovery of Justice.</i>

836
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,720
<i>Discovery of Justice...</i>

837
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:13,931
You mean the book you wrote?

838
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:15,975
Could you do that for me?

839
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,185
Sure.

840
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:20,771
Sure, I can.

841
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:30,823
Coffee? Tea?

842
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:42,626
Man.

843
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,587
Who does detective work
like this these days?

844
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,964
You're so old-fashioned.

845
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:51,343
We've got great programs
on our server, you know.

846
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:52,928
And they're free.

847
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:55,181
Nobody is stopping you from using them.

848
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,225
My goodness.

849
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,144
Can you even process
all this in your head?

850
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,106
Hey, don't touch that.

851
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,400
You can see them better this way.

852
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,277
- Like this.
- Hey.

853
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,445
Jeez.

854
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:12,865
- Stop that and come down.
- Get out of my way.

855
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,076
Can't you make it look nicer?

856
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,912
I'm not sure if you're messy

857
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,747
- or just old-fashioned.
- What are you doing?

858
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:21,582
Hey, that's...

859
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:22,875
Hey, give that back.

860
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,293
- Give me.
- Gosh, will you just...

861
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:40,142
Jeez, what's this?

862
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,689
Well-organized information

863
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:49,068
can give you new perspectives, you know.

864
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,238
Given your poor hospitality,
I've done you a big favor.

865
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:56,408
Lee's statement recording?

866
00:58:56,492 --> 00:58:57,576
Right.

867
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:05,626
Jung Jin-wook will be transferred
to custody today,

868
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,461
so make sure mobile forensics are done.

869
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,338
We need to see if he had calls with Lee.

870
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,048
To arrest him again,

871
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,467
we need evidence that he's Gaetal.

872
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:18,597
The way Lee treated
Professor Kwon seemed strange.

873
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,975
He said he was worried
Professor Kwon might hate him.

874
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,538
And what's with the love letter deal?

875
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,188
He might actually be
the professor's Number One Fan.

876
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:28,649
Even eight years ago,

877
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,831
Professor Kwon said Lee really liked him.

878
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:32,736
He even took his classes.

879
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,531
He mentioned replies. Did you check that?

880
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:38,242
I did,

881
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,619
but I found no records of correspondence.

882
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:43,080
But I found one strange thing.

883
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,167
This is Lee Min-soo's record

884
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,169
of overseas bank transfers to Korea.

885
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:53,090
After each transfer,
Professor Kwon received a letter.

886
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:57,970
I think he hired someone
to send the letters for him.

887
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:00,556
Maybe.

888
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,643
Lee Min-soo has been back
in Korea only for a year now.

889
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:09,148
Why does the case
from eight years ago keep coming up?

890
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:11,650
I'm so confused.

891
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:14,153
Because both cases
were committed by the same culprit.

892
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:15,863
Isn't it obvious?

893
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,198
Then, the motives should be the same too.

894
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,122
The murder from eight years ago
had no motives,

895
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:23,203
while the Killing Vote
is seeking justice for all.

896
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:25,831
Jung Jin-wook's rage was real.

897
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:29,084
But how did Lee Min-soo's lust for murder

898
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:32,421
and Jung Jin-wook's rage align?

899
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:36,759
I just don't understand it.

900
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:43,599
The moment you perfectly understand
the criminal's motives,

901
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,518
you become a criminal too.

902
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,688
Both criminals and cops

903
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:52,483
are all humans, after all.

904
01:01:30,396 --> 01:01:31,605
<i>I wanted to see you.</i>

905
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,316
You sent a lot of letters.

906
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,779
<i>It was you, wasn't it? Number One Fan.</i>

907
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:44,243
Come on. You know we're busy.

908
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:48,122
No way.

909
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,165
Hey, bring that to me.

910
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:53,210
I hope nothing happens today.

911
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,837
She even came to work.

912
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:57,756
I got it just now.

913
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,841
That little...

914
01:01:59,425 --> 01:02:00,801
Thank you.

915
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:01,885
And the forensic results?

916
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:03,321
Our office isn't open to the public.

917
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:05,931
- What? Nothing?
- She stood up for Kim Mu-chan.

918
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:08,350
Not even call logs? That's strange.

919
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,185
All right.

920
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:11,603
I'll ask him at the interview.

921
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:22,030
EVIDENCE RELATED TO JUNG JIN-WOOK

922
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:30,038
Five years ago?

923
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,543
That's 2018.

924
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:37,087
2018...

925
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,509
SENT ON DECEMBER 22, 2018

926
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:46,847
FROM NUMBER ONE FAN

927
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,140
DEAR PROFESSOR KWON SEOK-JOO

928
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:04,990
Thank you, as always.

929
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,658
I'm just doing my job.

930
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,577
Here you go.

931
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,996
The other guy in the back is new.

932
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:12,664
- One moment.
- Sure.

933
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:17,628
Let me check your ID.

934
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:23,050
All right. Here.

935
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:26,178
Let them in.

936
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,323
KWON NA-RAE'S DEATH

937
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:43,088
Do you really know where Fluffy is?

938
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,381
Come with me.

939
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:46,300
BYUN WOO-TAEK'S ARREST

940
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:51,054
<i>So in accordance with Article 325
of the Criminal Procedure Act,</i>

941
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:52,514
I declare the defendant innocent.

942
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,647
KWON SEOK-JOO'S ARREST

943
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:01,916
KWON IN CUSTODY FOR REVENGE MURDER

944
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,400
Do you admit to the charges?

945
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,329
-Number One Fan?
- One letter per month.

946
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,706
This person's been sending letters
for years without fail.

947
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:20,292
Jung Jin-wook said
his partner and accomplice

948
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,085
called himself Number One Fan

949
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:24,796
and destroyed the person
you loved the most.

950
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:25,881
Lee Min-soo...

951
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:29,384
- is Gaetal.
<i>- Are you sure Lee Min-soo is Gaetal?</i>

952
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,428
<i>Lee Min-soo and Gaetal.</i>

953
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,514
<i>I keep getting this feeling
they aren't the same person.</i>

954
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:36,263
You're Gaetal, aren't you?

955
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,564
I enjoyed reading your replies too.

956
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:46,026
<i>Kwon Seok-joo didn't write any replies.</i>

957
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,528
<i>But Lee Min-soo said he got them.</i>

958
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,372
LEE MIN-SOO IS NUMBER ONE FAN

959
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:01,083
<i>A reply</i>

960
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,627
<i>is an answer to a received letter.</i>

961
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:06,588
<i>"Stuff their money into their throats."</i>

962
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:08,423
<i>"Revealing the true colors."</i>

963
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:11,218
<i>"So I'm going to burn</i>
<i>the uterus of this evil Eve."</i>

964
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,846
<i>Her lower body was completely</i>
<i>destroyed during the explosion.</i>

965
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,808
<i>"Since the victim had to suffer</i>
<i>the pain of suffocation...</i>

966
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,394
<i>would be to inflict
the same pain on him."</i>

967
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:24,106
He has been sharing his murder plans
with Kwon Seok-joo in advance?

968
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,837
DEVILS WHO WERE DEEMED INNOCENT

969
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,114
The devils who were deemed innocent.

970
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,783
And the ones who can punish them are you!

971
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:36,493
"Devils who were deemed innocent."

972
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,995
You were the first one to say it,
weren't you?

973
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,539
Above all else,

974
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:44,209
I am enraged by the fact
that devils who were deemed innocent

975
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,086
<i>still exist in this country.</i>

976
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,297
<i>Then, the motives should be the same too.</i>

977
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:51,221
<i>The murder from eight years ago</i>
<i>had no motives,</i>

978
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:54,428
while the Killing Vote
is seeking justice for all.

979
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:10,152
<i>That always bothered me.</i>

980
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:13,655
Lady Justice wears a blindfold
because she's afraid

981
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:15,615
of bias in decisions.

982
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:20,537
If you don't look at cases
and the people involved clearly,

983
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,789
how can one pass fair judgment?

984
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:25,459
<i>Can judgments without experience be right?</i>

985
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:29,463
The moment you perfectly understand
the criminal's motives,

986
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:33,175
you become a criminal too.

987
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:36,720
I wasted a long time in prison
because of one wrong decision.

988
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,239
I realized too late
that I didn't have enough time

989
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:40,098
to make up for that mistake.

990
01:07:40,182 --> 01:07:41,349
That is why

991
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:43,477
I decided to meet you.

992
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,812
<i>Gaetal is just like Kwon Seok-joo.</i>

993
01:07:46,605 --> 01:07:48,482
<i>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</i>

994
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,525
<i>They're both arrogant and dare to take</i>

995
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:52,944
<i>the law into their own hands,</i>

996
01:07:53,028 --> 01:07:54,228
<i>if it can't solve the problem.</i>

997
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:57,574
KWON NA-RAE'S DEATH

998
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,367
The Killing Vote was

999
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,704
Kwon Seok-joo's reply.

1000
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,681
HUMAN RIGHTS, JUSTICE, KINDNESS

1001
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,872
Mr. Park said earlier

1002
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,501
you'd always been a model prisoner

1003
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:51,002
until five years ago

1004
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,473
when you went mad
and were sent to solitary.

1005
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,510
It was because of
Number One Fan's letter, right?

1006
01:09:02,681 --> 01:09:04,558
September 15, 2018.

1007
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,602
That's the day
Inmate 0512 was sent to solitary.

1008
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:11,815
It's also the day Lee Min-soo sent you
his first letter through someone else.

1009
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:16,444
But among these letters,

1010
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:20,574
why is the first one missing?

1011
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,954
Lee Min-soo's first letter

1012
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:27,956
is missing.

1013
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:32,502
Where is it?

1014
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:36,256
What was the letter about?

1015
01:09:50,312 --> 01:09:51,354
SUPERINTENDENT KIM MU-CHAN

1016
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:55,901
It's Kwon Seok-joo.

1017
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:01,364
What?

1018
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:06,036
It's always been him.

1019
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:08,380
The real Gaetal
who started the Killing Vote.

1020
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:10,248
It's Kwon Seok-joo.

1021
01:11:05,053 --> 01:11:06,554
Kwon Seok-joo!

1022
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,059
Kwon Seok-joo!

1023
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:54,394
<i>Stay away!</i>

1024
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:57,689
<i>-How could the two have communicated?</i>
<i>- You know none of us would ever do that.</i>

1025
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:58,773
I found it!

1026
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:00,483
<i>The secret behind Gaetal's message.</i>

1027
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:01,651
I'm gonna kill him!

1028
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:03,028
This isn't over yet.

1029
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,381
<i>It's obvious where escaped convicts hide.</i>

1030
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:07,866
We need to gather
more information about Dr. Yang.

1031
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,743
<i>Do you think they'll get the message?</i>

1032
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,162
<i>Gaetal's having problems within his team.</i>

1033
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:14,330
I got it.
