{\an8}EPISODE 6

5
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,153
{\an8}<i>The hospital's main control was hacked,</i>
<i>and all doors have shut down.</i>

6
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,489
{\an8}<i>It'll be hard to restore it from outside.</i>

7
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,949
{\an8}<i>Where's the bomb squad?</i>

8
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:15,743
{\an8}<i>Are you serious?</i>

9
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,661
{\an8}<i>Just plow through the traffic jam!</i>

10
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,288
{\an8}<i>People could die here!</i>

11
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,123
{\an8}<i>Clear the path</i>
<i>for transporting the ER patients.</i>

12
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:22,625
{\an8}<i>We can't locate Kwon Seok-joo.</i>

13
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,126
{\an8}<i>Where's the prison guard?</i>

14
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,798
{\an8}SOUND RECORD

15
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,257
{\an8}<i>We can't locate Kwon Seok-joo.</i>

16
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,675
{\an8}<i>Where's the prison guard?</i>

17
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,263
{\an8}What's my professor up to?
Is he on an outing?

18
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,728
{\an8}Interesting.

19
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,262
Car 9371 on standby.

20
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,055
Sir.

21
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,016
Hey! Move all that!

22
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,657
Everyone, move outside!

23
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,415
This way!

24
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:27,958
Hurry up!

25
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,628
Careful.

26
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,465
Evacuate them!

27
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:36,967
Move!

28
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,391
<i>Ji-hoon, where are you?</i>
<i>Pick up your phone.</i>

29
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,311
<i>Captain Oh's hostage.</i>

30
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,653
Hey.

31
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,862
Hey!

32
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,697
You little punk.

33
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,283
You texted Gaetal, didn't you?

34
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,035
It's a friend who came here with me.

35
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,787
She's waiting for me.

36
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:06,830
Can I go now?

37
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:08,791
You can't keep me here forever.

38
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,292
You're very suspicious.

39
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:12,711
How and when did you get into that room?

40
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,630
That room is for authorized people only.

41
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,551
You...

42
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:20,803
You're Gaetal's spy, aren't you?

43
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,434
You little...

44
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,395
Damn it.

45
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,525
Mr. Oh,

46
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,859
we're the bomb squad.

47
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,319
Are you in there?

48
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,071
Yes, I'm fine.

49
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,907
So please remove that bomb first.

50
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,492
You should evacuate first.

51
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,828
Defusing the bomb takes some time.

52
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,079
Damn it. It does?

53
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,419
By the way,

54
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:57,131
you're really from the bomb squad, right?

55
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,341
We're running out of time.

56
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,065
Don't come out.

57
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,818
Even if the bomb goes or the police come,

58
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,570
just stay in there.

59
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,530
<i>If you want to live, stay there!</i>

60
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,619
Right now,

61
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,747
the bomb squad is here.

62
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,168
They're with the police, right?

63
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,253
Damn it.

64
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,724
Gas.

65
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,563
If you had opened the door,

66
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,856
it would've been a quick end.

67
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,628
What are you doing here?

68
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,213
I...

69
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,882
- You need to get out. Go.
- Wait.

70
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,134
Ji-hoon is in danger.

71
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,011
Captain Oh is holding him hostage.

72
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,013
He said he'd wait here,
but I can't find him.

73
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:29,556
All my messages are left on read.

74
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,767
He's definitely been taken hostage.

75
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:36,021
Call Kim Ji-hoon's guardian
from Seorae High and locate him.

76
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,564
It seems Oh has taken him hostage.

77
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,108
<i>What? Goodness.</i>

78
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,734
<i>Get the negotiation team on standby!</i>

79
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,069
It's done, so go wait outside.

80
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,195
Let me come with you.

81
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,030
What if Ji-hoon dies? Please let me come.

82
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,240
Stop it!

83
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,243
I've got a lot on my plate already.

84
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,662
Hey.

85
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,122
Take her outside. Go.

86
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,249
- Let me come with you!
- Let's go.

87
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,625
- Hang on.
- This way.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,544
- Darn it!
- We need to hurry.

89
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,005
FIRE UNDER SURVEILLANCE

90
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,340
{\an8}MAIN CONTROL

91
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,057
We secured the main control.

92
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,854
Sir, the signal
from Kwon's ankle bracelet is off.

93
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,567
What about Hyun? She was with him.

94
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,651
<i>I can't reach her.</i>

95
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,362
The last signal was
in the hospital's underground parking lot.

96
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,531
Could he have hurt Jjoo?

97
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,993
Yoon-ji, find Kwon Seok-joo.

98
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,411
Jin-soo, Sang-jae, to the ER.

99
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,621
Upstairs!

100
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,791
Jo-dan, take care of the entrance.

101
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,251
And Joo Hyun...

102
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,880
Yoon-ji, get an ambulance ready.

103
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,631
I'll try to unlock the entrance.

104
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,519
Kwon Seok-joo!

105
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,192
Let go! Stop it!

106
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,823
Are you trying to kill him?

107
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,792
I had to knock him out.

108
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,171
Anyway, thanks for saving me.

109
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,215
He almost knocked my head off.

110
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,806
What happened to your ankle monitor?

111
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,977
I had no other choice.

112
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,230
I had to cut it off

113
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,357
to make the police come here.

114
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,193
That was the only way to chase Gaetal.

115
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,696
Gaetal? But the superintendent
is dealing with him right now.

116
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,076
We caught him
for planting a bomb in the ER.

117
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,329
- And...
- He used to deliver packages to my place.

118
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,581
He should know me well.

119
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,586
Gaetal detonated a bomb
to get Captain Oh,

120
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,922
and Oh's holding
a student hostage. It's a mess.

121
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,173
A student?

122
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,383
The student from Seorae High.

123
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,719
{\an8}Give him first aid and get him out.

124
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:13,845
{\an8}ONE MINUTE

125
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,430
Keep an eye on him. He's a suspect.

126
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,640
Wait!

127
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,685
Step back.
Don't even think about anything funny!

128
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,688
I have nothing to lose right now.

129
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,033
Kill me if you want to!

130
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,454
But are you going to kill this boy
just to get me?

131
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,916
Do it if you dare. I have nothing to lose!

132
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,715
Back off!

133
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,098
You clever asshole.

134
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,732
You're making it so hard to kill you.

135
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,943
Blame your dumbass brain, you bastard.

136
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,447
Move forward.

137
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,633
Please don't kill me!

138
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,844
Oh Jung-ho,
for the murder of Lim Yoo-jung,

139
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,555
I sentence you to death.

140
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:40,891
Stop!

141
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,739
Drop the knife. It's all over now.

142
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,034
Don't shoot. This room is filled with gas.

143
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,553
Ji-hoon?

144
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,521
Whether you kill him or not,
you'll be arrested.

145
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,022
So stop it here.

146
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:32,484
Do you know him?

147
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,696
Isn't it better to be
remembered as someone

148
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,824
who sought justice?

149
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,661
Money. I'll give you money.

150
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,873
If you don't kill me,
I'll give you as much money as you want.

151
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,751
- Shut it!
- You've been caught anyway.

152
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,672
So just take the money and let me live.

153
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,055
Money sounds great.

154
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,976
Why didn't you ask for money too?

155
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,230
When that woman came to you
asking to erase the video,

156
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,606
you raped her again.

157
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,692
You filmed that
and spread it online again.

158
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,528
You blackmailed her,
forced her out again, and again!

159
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,615
Detective,
if that happened to your family,

160
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,909
would you still be opposed to killing him?

161
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,207
Tell me.

162
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,545
Do you really want
to save this scumbag's life?

163
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,090
Seeing this scumbag live a good life...

164
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,926
I don't like it either.

165
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,636
So let's make it miserable enough

166
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,638
to make him give up on life.

167
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,058
Within the law.

168
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,857
You've got to be kidding me.

169
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,942
God damn it!

170
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,904
Look where that stupid bitch got me.

171
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,575
Just shoot him.

172
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,828
Shoot him, damn it!

173
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,707
Just shoot him, you coward!

174
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,501
- Oh Jung-ho!
- Kill him!

175
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,449
Ji-hoon!

176
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,297
Ji-hoon. Are you okay?

177
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,632
Let's go.

178
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:01,758
Let's go!

179
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,970
Superintendent!

180
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,222
Jin-soo, Oh Jung-ho!

181
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,891
Darn it.

182
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,991
Ji-hoon, are you okay?

183
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,075
Snap out of it, Ji-hoon.

184
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,285
Ji-hoon!

185
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,727
{\an8}<i>A man suspected to be Gaetal,</i>
<i>the mastermind of The Killing Vote,</i>

186
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,313
{\an8}<i>was apprehended</i>
<i>at a hospital in Seoul today.</i>

187
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,316
{\an8}<i>The suspect was shot</i>
<i>following a confrontation with the police,</i>

188
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,735
{\an8}<i>but the injury is reportedly</i>
<i>not life-threatening.</i>

189
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,613
{\an8}<i>And there were no additional casualties.</i>

190
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,657
{\an8}<i>However, the third person</i>
<i>targeted by The Killing Vote,</i>

191
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:08,783
{\an8}<i>Oh Jung-ho,</i>

192
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:12,454
<i>also known as "Captain Oh,"</i>
<i>was killed by Gaetal at the scene.</i>

193
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,956
<i>So far, Gaetal has executed Bae Gi-chul...</i>

194
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,709
What's going to happen
to our show for The Killing Vote now?

195
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,586
What do you think will happen?

196
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,087
Don't you know <i>"The show must go on"</i>?

197
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,255
<i>The identity and motives</i>

198
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,883
<i>of Gaetal have yet to be revealed.</i>

199
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,593
What's wrong with her?

200
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,179
She needed more people
to die for her show,

201
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,181
but she's bitter now that it's over.

202
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,768
{\an8}<i>...will conduct the investigation.</i>

203
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,738
You were lucky.

204
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,449
It missed the main artery.

205
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,370
With proper treatment, it won't
even leave a scar. So don't worry.

206
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:59,084
He's a minor, so he'll also receive
counseling for victims.

207
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,044
I'll inform his guardian about it.

208
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,677
I had no idea you'd be here.

209
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,639
I'm sorry you're always
in these awful situations.

210
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,060
What's your grandmother's number?

211
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,104
I'll explain what happened.
She must be worried.

212
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,064
That man...

213
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,654
He's really dead, right?

214
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,661
Hey, Kim Ji-hoon!

215
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,373
What are you doing?

216
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,838
I thought you were dead!

217
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,715
I...

218
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,718
- I'm sorry.
- Why didn't you pick up the phone?

219
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:50,885
I was worried about you.

220
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,513
Why didn't you run
for your life, you idiot?

221
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,640
Why did you make me buy the sandwich?

222
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,810
If I'd been by your side,

223
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:02,564
this horrible thing
wouldn't have happened to you.

224
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,482
Excuse me. Am I invisible?

225
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,317
Hey, you're the one who didn't pick up...

226
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,027
Are you okay?

227
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,405
Why aren't you saying anything?

228
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,614
I'm hurt too!

229
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,284
- Did you hurt your head?
- I said I'm fine.

230
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,079
Oh, my gosh. Look at all the blood.

231
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,332
Why did you do that?

232
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,210
Why?

233
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,712
What are you doing?

234
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,130
What do you think you are doing?

235
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,673
Someone has died because of him.

236
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,592
How is that our fault? It's...

237
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,056
Damn it.

238
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,267
If it weren't for the sprinkler,
Oh wouldn't have died.

239
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,269
Why did you do that?

240
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,396
You wanted to kill him too.

241
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,067
Isn't that what matters?

242
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,073
You crazy...

243
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,867
Superintendent!

244
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,369
Reporters are flooding in,
so let's send him back.

245
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,580
If they find out about him,
we'll get in big trouble.

246
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,415
We've caught the culprit.

247
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,680
Hey, that man had no fingerprints
on any of his ten fingers.

248
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,856
In any case, Oh Jung-ho was a civilian.

249
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,609
We failed to keep him safe,

250
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,194
so the superintendent is pretty upset.

251
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,571
I understand.

252
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,617
Let's go before people recognize him.

253
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:39,828
Let's go.

254
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,331
I'll get him a new tracker.

255
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,209
I didn't know it'd break so easily.

256
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:51,047
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

257
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,175
Name?

258
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,389
Your name.

259
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,691
Resident registration number?

260
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,236
You have no ID, of course.

261
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,405
And you've mutilated
all your fingerprints.

262
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,992
Open your mouth.

263
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,412
Open up.

264
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,955
Wider.

265
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,751
You should've erased
your dental records to avoid the DNA test.

266
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,420
Or at least remove your teeth.

267
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,424
Did you know
the late Lieutenant Lim Yoo-jung?

268
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,759
Were you close?

269
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,429
It was an adequate case
for The Killing Vote.

270
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,723
I guess my question was too hard.

271
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,100
I'll make it much easier for you.

272
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,229
Number One Fan.

273
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,691
Are you the Number One Fan?

274
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,945
How do you know Kwon Seok-joo?

275
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,030
Why did you approach him?

276
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,824
Will this reduce my sentence?

277
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,162
Then, let's say I know him.

278
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,334
If you were Gaetal,
you'd say you know him very well.

279
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,045
Didn't you guys prepare
yourselves for this?

280
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,213
You didn't do this on your own.

281
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,506
Where are the others?

282
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,471
Oh Jung-ho, Bae Gi-chul, Uhm Eun-gyeong.

283
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,140
I killed them all by myself.

284
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,309
And the broadcasts were pre-recorded.

285
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,728
The public gladly voted to kill them,

286
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,189
because I made sure
to select ones who deserved to die.

287
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,649
So it wasn't that hard...

288
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,194
You're admitting to murder
without telling your name.

289
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,112
Does that make sense?

290
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,322
It's not working, you bastard.

291
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,991
Tell me who you're working with!

292
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,979
He's Jung Jin-wook.

293
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,897
I told you Jung Jin-wook's dead.

294
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,608
Lieutenant Lim's fiancé. He died on duty.

295
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,614
{\an8}They sometimes fake the deaths
of soldiers in special operations.

296
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,616
And they're discharged
with new identities.

297
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:29,706
That burn scar on his neck
must be from removing his service number.

298
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,169
Let's get his blood for a DNA test
and ask Jo-dan for his military records.

299
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,296
They must have his DNA
for identification purposes.

300
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,426
He started The Killing Vote
to avenge his girlfriend's death?

301
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,386
What about the first two victims?

302
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,138
Did he kill them just to fool us?

303
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,306
It doesn't add up.

304
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,475
He cut Oh Jung-ho's jugular in one swipe.

305
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,477
He's professionally trained
in ways to kill.

306
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:09,704
Come in.

307
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:39,442
Wait.

308
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,321
I'm glad the guard didn't come.

309
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,835
Are you sure about this?

310
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,964
This is the least I can do for someone

311
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:03,925
who saved my life.

312
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,535
Oh, that's...

313
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,204
You seemed very worried, so...

314
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:44,757
Let me see.

315
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:49,470
You should've asked us to treat you.

316
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,222
You're more foolish than I thought.

317
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,516
Take these.

318
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,063
Thanks for everything.

319
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,424
I'll go upstairs for a bit.

320
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,342
Okay.

321
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,679
By the way,

322
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,183
in case you haven't noticed,

323
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:39,145
I'm placing
a great deal of trust in you now.

324
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,647
There are CCTV cameras everywhere
in this neighborhood.

325
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:43,357
Even if I ran away, I'd be caught soon.

326
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,131
Come and catch me, Dad!

327
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,849
Wait up!

328
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,478
Are you going into the tent?

329
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,563
- No.
- Are you going there?

330
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,275
No!

331
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,319
- Yay!
- Yay!

332
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,864
- The bunny wants to fly.
- Does it?

333
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,701
Something like a cake.

334
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,119
Meat.

335
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:46,689
- Why did you go into my daughter's room?
- Well...

336
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:50,151
That's where I was hit in the head
by someone we suspect is Gaetal.

337
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,360
And I was hit hard.

338
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,654
Considering where he hit me,

339
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:55,656
it was the same guy we arrested yesterday.

340
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:59,744
But his physique seemed different
from Gaetal's in the test video.

341
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,830
But the video
was definitely recorded there,

342
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:07,084
so I wanted to double-check the details,
like the furniture and photos on the wall.

343
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,462
There was

344
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,005
a test video?

345
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,926
While I was investigating
a cybercrime case before this one,

346
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,304
I found the video on a zombie computer.

347
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,565
I'm not entirely sure he is Gaetal.

348
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,944
He doesn't fit the profile,
and something seems off.

349
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,405
Although there's one thing

350
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:39,200
he has in common
with the man in the video.

351
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,788
Rage from losing their loved ones.

352
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,875
The intense desire to kill the culprit.

353
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,754
The Gaetal from the test video
seemed to have that too.

354
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,048
The superintendent must not have noticed,

355
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,675
but I could see that.

356
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:58,636
And I understood it.

357
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,519
Lady Justice wears

358
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,980
a blindfold because she's afraid
of bias in decisions.

359
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:11,982
That always bothered me.

360
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,612
If you don't look at cases
and the people involved clearly,

361
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,823
how can one pass fair judgment?

362
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,742
Can judgments without experience be right?

363
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,788
Only after losing my daughter

364
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:29,500
did I realize I was qualified
to judge others.

365
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:34,046
If you understand Gaetal

366
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,841
for the reason I believe,

367
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,219
I feel...

368
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:43,597
deeply for you.

369
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,485
So this must be you,

370
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,404
and this must be your daughter.

371
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,657
This person can't be her mother.
It looks like a man.

372
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,326
He was the best friend

373
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:06,537
of my daughter.

374
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,810
You said Superintendent Kim didn't notice,

375
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:31,604
but I don't think so.

376
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,688
I'm sure he did.

377
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:34,857
What?

378
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,609
That terrible rage.

379
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:38,694
He knows what it's like.

380
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,390
Goodness gracious!

381
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,602
You bastard.

382
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:14,480
I'm your boss, you know.

383
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:17,441
Why disband the investigation unit
when we haven't solved anything?

384
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,693
We caught Gaetal.

385
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,779
We just need to wrap it up now.

386
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,114
So why spend a fortune
on maintaining the unit?

387
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,992
Squads are up in arms
about being short-staffed.

388
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,787
People have died because of him.

389
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,497
And the suspect hasn't even said his name.

390
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,083
He's not talking because he's Gaetal!

391
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,712
The commissioner says
he'll give you all the credit.

392
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,548
So let's just wrap it up here.

393
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:45,469
Didn't you say you wanted
to join the HQ Investigation Team?

394
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,808
Let's say Jung Jin-wook's
not the head of Gaetal's gang.

395
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,727
But guys like him
are attention-seeking losers.

396
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:57,982
By disbanding the unit, we can show them
that we've arrested the culprit,

397
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:03,445
so no matter what they do from now on,
they'll be nothing but copycats.

398
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:07,575
Then, the culprit will either give up
or lower their guard.

399
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,412
Is that the official stance of the police

400
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,081
when it comes to treating a felon?

401
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:15,958
We deal with crimes

402
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,420
as an organization, not as individuals.

403
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,213
We look at the big picture.

404
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:31,599
Send Kwon Seok-joo back too.

405
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,944
To indict him for premeditated murder,

406
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,614
{\an8}the prosecution needs proof
he brought the gas tanks.

407
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:50,367
{\an8}A medical device transportation vehicle
had been parked there for days.

408
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:52,453
{\an8}It looks like the hacker
couldn't gain access

409
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,954
to footage from a few days ago.

410
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:57,750
As the superintendent said, the suspect
has been identified as Jung Jin-wook.

411
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,502
He was the fiancé
of the late Lieutenant Lim.

412
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,714
He once went to see Oh Jung-ho
to blame him for Lim's death.

413
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:07,217
Just as he was about to kill Oh
with an illegal weapon,

414
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:10,929
the military police arrived, but who knows
if that was a good or bad thing.

415
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,098
Since it was a serious case,

416
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,643
the military reported Jung Jin-wook dead,

417
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,603
gave him a new identity,
and discharged him.

418
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,438
Here.

419
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,652
PERSONAL INFORMATION

420
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,570
Has he been doing
only contract work since?

421
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:29,865
Yes, and his longest job
was as a security guard.

422
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:31,867
Guess where he worked.

423
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,995
{\an8}SAEHYEON HOSPITAL

424
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,082
No wonder why he was familiar
with the hospital floor plan.

425
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,500
We could use this as proof.

426
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,752
Nice work, Cyber Bureau.

427
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:42,836
Thank you.

428
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,891
- Wait. Rewind that.
- Yes, sir.

429
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,814
Keep rewinding.

430
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,201
{\an8}I don't see anything suspicious.

431
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:15,869
No one got out of the car.

432
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:17,162
Exactly.

433
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,415
You're at the hospital,
but why aren't you getting out?

434
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,542
- Where's the superintendent?
- On the rooftop.

435
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,261
<i>If you understand Gaetal</i>

436
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,680
<i>for the reason I believe,</i>

437
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:36,598
<i>I feel</i>

438
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,059
<i>deeply for you.</i>

439
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,526
Anything that wasn't recorded
that's bothering you?

440
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:52,823
No.

441
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:01,582
Send Kwon Seok-joo back tomorrow.

442
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,208
Why? We haven't solved the case.

443
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,627
We've arrested the culprit.

444
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,173
We had him at the scene,
but there's no proof he did it alone.

445
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,091
We still don't know
who killed Bae's wife.

446
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,801
Yesterday's vote wasn't pre-recorded.

447
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,595
You know it was live.

448
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,764
That means there is
at least one accomplice.

449
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,098
We can't stop here.

450
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,058
Send him back.

451
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,687
Why do you

452
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,064
hate Kwon Seok-joo so much?

453
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,485
Is it something
besides his daughter's case?

454
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:33,155
Something happened
between you two, didn't it?

455
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,073
Kwon Seok-joo even said

456
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,242
you may be Gaetal.

457
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:42,206
I told you not to let him toy with you.

458
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,209
He has you totally fooled.

459
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:50,047
There's still so much we can get from him!

460
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,509
I have to analyze Gaetal's speaking habits
and his relationship with Kwon...

461
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,677
Kim Mu-chan, you asshole!

462
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,639
You have no respect for my investigation!

463
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,724
MIN JI-YOUNG'S FAMILY

464
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:03,811
MIN POSTS FAMILY PHOTO ON SOCIAL MEDIA
"LOVING HUSBAND AND THREE KIDS"

465
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,402
Sir, you have to see this.

466
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:15,322
Let's investigate Jung Jin-wook's house
and the people around him.

467
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,825
- Can we transport Kwon tomorrow?
- This is urgent.

468
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,956
Remember Assemblywoman Min's son,
Lee Yun-seong?

469
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,708
He was at that hospital yesterday.

470
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,955
Why are you so quiet?
You asked me to come.

471
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,416
You insisted on coming.

472
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,461
Why aren't you coming
to school, scaredy-cat?

473
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:16,550
Think of it objectively.

474
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,844
That man deserved to die,

475
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,847
and nobody cries
over the death of someone like him.

476
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,018
I killed him.

477
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,148
"This scumbag shouldn't be alive."

478
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,734
That's the only thought I had.

479
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,820
That devil was set free
by our incompetent legal system.

480
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,615
If he wouldn't be punished
by the law or by God,

481
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,202
I thought he should at least
be punished the people.

482
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,080
But...

483
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,674
But seeing him die because of me...

484
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,264
My parents

485
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:08,185
died because of a repeat drunk driver.

486
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,522
I know who he is and where he lives.

487
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,192
I spy on him sometimes.

488
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:19,863
If somebody is willing to kill him for me,
I'd let them do that.

489
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,909
I'm sure those who had to suffer
because of him will agree.

490
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,998
He didn't die because of you.

491
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,847
Hey, do you want to try some alcohol?

492
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,307
My sister taught me how to drink.

493
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,811
- Are you crazy?
- Scaredy-cat.

494
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:54,982
Then, promise me you'll have
your first drink with me when we graduate.

495
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,235
Cheers.

496
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,989
Come on. Play along.

497
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:05,492
Cheers.

498
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,939
Number One Fan will definitely
reach out to you again.

499
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:37,649
Let me know right when he does.

500
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,320
Aren't you sending me back
because you caught the culprit?

501
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:45,198
We both know
the real Gaetal hasn't been caught.

502
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,160
But the higher-ups don't think so.

503
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,039
A lot of people saw you at the scene too.

504
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,540
So go back for now.

505
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,004
He doesn't know you're out.

506
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:02,382
That persistent bastard
has been writing to you for five years.

507
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:04,801
He won't quit
just because his accomplice was caught.

508
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:08,680
He'll never stop.

509
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:13,143
So we'll pretend we stopped
the investigation and set a trap.

510
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,817
You were like this back then too.

511
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,320
Actually, you've always been like this.

512
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,781
You wouldn't think twice
about setting a trap.

513
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:29,159
Eight years ago,

514
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,163
DNA from two people was found
on my daughter's doll.

515
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,331
One was Byun Woo-taek,

516
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,209
and the other one was never identified.

517
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,879
But you know who it is.

518
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,341
The ones who killed Na-rae.

519
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,345
You know Byun Woo-taek

520
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,639
had an accomplice.

521
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,064
Is this a crime scene?
Is it a homicide or accident?

522
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,359
When's the briefing?

523
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,860
Please tell us about the case.

524
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,237
What's the culprit's motive?

525
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,655
Please say a word!

526
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,906
Was this homicide?

527
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,324
Exactly how...

528
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,577
Who is it?

529
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,208
I don't know.

530
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,794
You set a trap but failed to catch them.

531
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,296
And I thought Byun was the only culprit.

532
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,215
Tell me now.

533
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,968
Who is it?

534
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,930
If I tell you, will you go kill him too?

535
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:36,476
After killing someone,
murder's a piece of cake now?

536
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,483
I wished

537
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:45,902
you were Gaetal.

538
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,614
Due to your misguided goodwill,

539
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:51,658
you lost the culprit,
and due to that regret,

540
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:56,872
and I wished you were punishing the devils
who were deemed innocent!

541
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,215
Is it...

542
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,052
really not you?

543
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,768
I'm a cop.

544
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:24,107
Then, who are you suspecting?

545
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,904
If you're suspecting

546
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,572
that person from eight years ago...

547
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:35,035
If you're using me as bait
to set a trap to catch him, go ahead!

548
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,286
However,

549
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,413
if you miss him again,

550
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,833
this time...

551
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,211
I'll never forgive you.

552
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,295
No.

553
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:48,006
I won't.

554
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,390
EIGHT YEARS AGO, ACCOMPLICE

555
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,205
What is he saying?

556
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,087
Gosh, this is so frustrating!

557
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,297
What the hell did he say?

558
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,066
IS HE THE CULPRIT OR AN ACCOMPLICE?

559
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,321
{\an8}DELETED AT SUBJECT'S REQUEST

560
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,952
"Kim Mu-chan knows what it's like too."

561
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:00,996
"Kim Mu-chan knows..."

562
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:05,834
Does he...

563
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:08,420
feel for Kim Mu-chan too?

564
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,382
Gosh, what does that even mean?

565
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:13,925
- Are they in love or what?
- Gosh!

566
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:15,885
You scared me.

567
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,305
What did he say at the end?

568
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,557
Hyun.

569
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,642
Shouldn't Ji-hoon receive counseling?

570
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,438
He's acting so weird.

571
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,065
He thinks Captain Oh died because of him.

572
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:30,150
He's skipping school too.

573
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:32,610
He seems super depressed.

574
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:33,903
The worst I've ever seen.

575
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,698
Really? That's worrisome.

576
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,408
I'll talk to him.

577
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,911
- There's not a lot left!
- Don't be so stingy.

578
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:44,831
I need this to stay awake and study.

579
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,084
I appreciate your cooperation.

580
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,254
- These are all mine.
- Don't take them all!

581
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,591
Gosh, I can't believe her.

582
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:58,803
Of course.

583
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:00,847
I totally understand.

584
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,308
As much as we appreciate
the police's hard work,

585
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:06,353
we as the press must also take
the viewers' needs into consideration.

586
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,813
This is killing me too.

587
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:11,733
She's grilling me like crazy
as if she's my boss.

588
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:12,817
Sir.

589
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,821
She has no idea what's going on,
so she wants to play by the book.

590
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:19,282
And the higher-ups scold us
for not following trends.

591
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:22,160
Commissioner, please cut me some slack.

592
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,622
I understand what position you're in.

593
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,416
Remember I promised to treat you
like my older brother?

594
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:33,213
Just trust me. Yes, sir.

595
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:35,840
What?

596
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:37,801
You canceled the new show
for The Killing Vote.

597
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,763
Of course. How could we when Gaetal
has been caught? It's old news.

598
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,640
You'll ignore the promise to the viewers?

599
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,059
Despite over 20,000 complaints
on our message boards?

600
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,394
Didn't you hear what I said?

601
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:50,355
Gaetal has been arrested.

602
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,942
What kind of idiotic show chases
a culprit who's been caught?

603
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,653
If Gaetal has been arrested,

604
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,822
then we can make a new Gaetal.

605
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,407
What?

606
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:22,679
It'll look like you came back to prison
and then received a pardon.

607
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:25,932
The lawyer we've appointed
will visit you soon.

608
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:30,979
By the way,

609
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,483
do you still think
our superintendent might be Gaetal?

610
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,908
It's just strange to me

611
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:46,244
you'd suddenly claim that
without any evidence.

612
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,163
It's not like you.

613
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,252
At the end of every semester,

614
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,546
I used to say this to my students.

615
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:01,134
"Don't trust everything that I teach you."

616
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,261
"If your own research,

617
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,889
then you'll find a different answer."

618
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:30,830
{\an8}REVEAL THE TRUTH
OF MY DAUGHTER'S WRONGFUL DEATH

619
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,213
What do you want?

620
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:41,925
This man almost became your son-in-law.

621
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:43,635
You don't know him?

622
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,846
Move aside.
You're blocking my daughter's photo.

623
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,229
It doesn't matter if you don't know him.

624
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,605
He made a confession.

625
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:58,733
But if we leave him be,
he'll get in serious trouble.

626
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:01,861
He doesn't seem interested in living on.

627
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:05,073
Your daughter knew this,
she wouldn't like that.

628
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:30,974
Jin-wook.

629
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,225
What are you doing here?

630
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:35,603
Why are you in there?

631
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:40,441
Yoo-jung wouldn't have wanted this.

632
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:46,155
Actually, no. You did a great job.

633
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:48,116
I'm proud of you, son.

634
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,119
I would've killed him
if he were in front of me.

635
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,123
He's innocent.

636
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,374
This is all my fault.

637
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:59,961
This happened to my kids

638
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,589
because of my incompetence and misfortune.

639
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:05,300
He doesn't belong here.

640
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:07,677
Open this door.

641
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,804
Open it!

642
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:10,888
I'm sorry,

643
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,349
Mr. Lim.

644
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:23,901
You have to move on!

645
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:28,823
Only then can you live!

646
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:47,425
I have an accomplice.

I don't have hiking clothes.

00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:08,112
Come on. Just buy one.
It's not even that expensive.

651
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:09,322
I'll do it soon, sir.

00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,282

If you want to peep at others,

675
00:53:16,152 --> 00:53:17,528
you should pay for it.

676
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:24,660
Darn it.

677
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,964
Darn it.

678
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:49,894
What the hell?

679
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,438
How could a civilian have access
to Lockhart security program?

680
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:53,773
It's so expensive.

681
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:56,275
Even I've never used it before!

682
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,737

{\an8}DETAILS

684
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:07,328
AT 11:15 P.M., MARCH 15, 2023

685
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,373
It's just after the second Killing Vote.

686
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,376
Something smells fishy.

687
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,503
Something's definitely fishy.

688
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,840
We agreed he'd be in charge
of the technical aspects

689
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,676
and I'd be out in the field.

690
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,637
We've only communicated online
through the dark web.

691
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,181
I've never met him in person before.

692
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,225
By "in the field,"

693
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,394
do you mean the killing?

694
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:35,314
If it was for revenge,
you could've killed just Oh.

695
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,484
Why join something
as cumbersome as the Killing Vote?

696
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,654
Because I didn't want to be
just another murderer.

697
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:44,365
I started this because of Yoo-jung,

698
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,367
but we've never killed just random people.

699
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:49,078
<i>We carefully selected people</i>

700
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:52,957
<i>who were nothing but harmful</i>
<i>to this society.</i>

701
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,835
<i>And the voting results proved it.</i>

702
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,965
<i>Stop the bomb, you bastard!</i>

703
00:55:06,262 --> 00:55:07,513
Unbelievable.

704
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,599
No matter what you say
to justify what you did,

705
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:14,353
under Korean law, you'll be charged
with the crime of premeditated murder.

706
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:18,566
Name of your accomplice.

707
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:23,779
Number One Fan.

708
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:32,163
He furiously said we're condemned

709
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:35,583
to watch the devils
who were deemed innocent walk free

710
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:39,170
just because we were born
in a country with a constitution.

711
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,049
He also said
the person he admired the most

712
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,051
was now locked up in prison

713
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:46,969
for pursuing justice.

714
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,847
I found out it was Professor Kwon Seok-joo

715
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,975
after looking into the cases
he'd mentioned

716
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:54,894
from time to time.

717
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,439
What was his relationship with him?

718
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,942
Since he often used
the word "admire" to describe him,

719
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:04,987
I thought he might have been his student.

720
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:06,947
Then one day, he said

721
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:10,951
that he had destroyed the person
Kwon Seok-joo loved the most,

722
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:14,330
so Kwon must hate him.

723
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,724
Your breathing sounds fine.

724
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:35,434
Nothing has worsened.

725
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:40,272
I was worried because you didn't come
for a checkup last time.

726
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:42,650
The guard said you went
to the disciplinary unit,

727
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:45,236
but other inmates guessed
you had been transferred.

728
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:48,906
You know a lot of things
that happen here cannot be shared.

729
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:51,242
You're right.

730
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:54,954
But when it comes to sharing,
kids these days seem even worse.

731
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:59,291
My grandson never shares anything with me,
and it frustrates me so much.

732
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:02,002
A few days ago,
he almost got seriously hurt,

733
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:03,963
and I didn't know
because he didn't tell me.

734
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,174
So he's not hurt badly?

735
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:09,426
It's just a scratch.

736
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,761
It seems he's pretty shocked.

737
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:13,305
He's always been quiet,
but he's quieter than usual.

738
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:15,141
It hurts me to see him like that.

739
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:16,976
He's still a kid, after all.

740
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:21,564
When I'm released,
I'll make sure to visit your hospital.

741
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:25,484
It'll be more effective
to keep receiving treatments from you.

742
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:32,366
I guess I can't retire until then,
Inmate 0512.

743
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,600
PERSONAL INFORMATION
LEE YUN-SEONG

744
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,477
RECORD OF STATEMENTS

745
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,855
Na-rae, you always look so adorable.

746
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,191
<i>She's an elementary school girl</i>
<i>living next door.</i>

747
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:07,610
<i>I've seen her around.</i>

748
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,947
<i>One day, we said hi to each other,</i>

749
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:14,867
<i>and I noticed</i>
<i>he kept staring at her afterwards.</i>

750
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,036
<i>It was a little strange.</i>

751
00:58:20,623 --> 00:58:23,667
<i>It was the night</i>
<i>after the girl went missing.</i>

752
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:28,964
<i>I saw Woo-taek leaving the house</i>
<i>with a pink backpack.</i>

753
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,926
<i>I didn't ask him where he'd been.</i>

754
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:09,213
Wait.

755
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,647
TIRE PRESSURE

756
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:27,731
What the hell?

757
00:59:30,276 --> 00:59:31,694
Come on.

758
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:38,450
Damn it.

759
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:43,747
What the...

760
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,376
You've got to be kidding me.

761
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:51,380
Are you here for Min?

762
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,161
{\an8}Lee Min-soo, the teacher at Seorae High.

763
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:23,662
He did change his name.

764
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:25,789
His original name was Lee Yun-seong.

765
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:28,292
And I found out
that Seorae High School's Foundation

766
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,044
is run by Assemblywoman Min's family.

767
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:36,342
That means Lee Min-soo was born
with a silver spoon in his mouth.

768
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,511
But he's too young to be a teacher.

769
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:40,929
He dropped out of middle school,

770
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:43,974
got his GED through homeschooling,

771
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:46,101
and graduated early from college abroad.

772
01:00:46,185 --> 01:00:48,103
He got pretty good grades too.

773
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:51,190
Anyway, since his family runs
a private school foundation,

774
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,233
he must've gotten his teaching job easily.

775
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,362
He's always been a smart kid.

776
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,863
He even...

777
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,743
I wonder why he majored
in philosophy of law though.

778
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,204
Because most of the awards
he won in the US

779
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:07,039
are related to computer science.

780
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,999
Are there any hacking-related ones?

781
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:10,084
Yes, definitely.

782
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,920
He even ranked fourth
in an international competition.

783
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:16,465
He must be good
at both liberal arts and science.

784
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:18,717
I've got to ask this question.

785
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:22,429
Let's say the person Kwon Seok-joo
loved the most was his daughter.

786
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:26,475
And he killed her murderer himself.

787
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:30,229
So why are we suddenly
investigating Lee Min-soo now?

788
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:31,563
I can explain.

789
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,857
Back then, there was a boy
Superintendent Kim suspected

790
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:35,859
of being an accomplice.

791
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,195
The house owner's son.

792
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:42,116
<i>But we had to let him go</i>
<i>due to a lack of evidence.</i>

793
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:48,747
And he's Lee Min-soo?

794
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:49,998
There's one more thing.

795
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,293
Lee Yun-seong...

796
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:55,754
I mean, Lee Min-soo's mother,
Assemblywoman Min Ji-young,

797
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:58,090
attended Kwon Seok-joo's final trial.

798
01:01:58,674 --> 01:02:00,592
She knew "the devils
who were deemed innocent."

799
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,778
Are you okay?

800
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:25,284
Yes. I had a guest over last night,
so I couldn't sleep well.

801
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,286
I see.

802
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:35,586
I just learned your mother
is Assemblywoman Min Ji-young.

803
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:39,423
There's some history
between the two of us.

804
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,134
She was once investigated

805
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,262
because of an illegal DDoS attack, right?

806
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:46,346
Wait.

807
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,098
Hold on.

808
01:02:48,182 --> 01:02:49,725
Were you the investigator

809
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,686
who hacked our server
and found the hacker?

810
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,149
What a small world.

811
01:02:57,232 --> 01:03:00,110
At the time,
because of her incompetent aide,

812
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:02,070
it was really tough on my mother.

813
01:03:02,154 --> 01:03:05,657
My family isn't really
on good terms with the police.

814
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:08,285
I see.

815
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:10,162
About eight years ago,

816
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:14,041
I was even suspected of being a murderer.

817
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,545
I didn't know that.

818
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,550
I thought that was
why you came to meet me.

819
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:28,472
No, that wasn't why...

820
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:37,022
Where are we going now?

821
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:38,982
This isn't the way to our police agency.

822
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,737
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

823
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,018
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

824
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,779
Hello?

825
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,698
<i>Is this Mr. Lee Min-soo?</i>

826
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:30,951
I'm Lieutenant Choi Jin-soo
from the Killing Vote investigation unit.

827
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,870
Why am I being called
by the investigation unit?

828
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:37,583
We just wanted to check if you heard
that your student, Kim Ji-hoon,

829
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:40,377
was held hostage
before Gaetal was arrested.

830
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,296
You did hear about it.

831
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:45,132
We'd like him to come in
and make a statement.

832
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,216
And we were wondering

833
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,844
if you could come with him
as his guardian.

834
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,971
From what I know,

835
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,390
he's supposed to be
accompanied by his parents.

836
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:54,975
<i>Given the severity of the case,</i>

837
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:58,061
<i>we're trying to keep this investigation</i>
<i>as discreet as possible.</i>

838
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:01,565
When parents get involved,
things often get more complicated.

839
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,275
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

840
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:05,777
Right. Having me as his guardian

841
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:08,989
will make it look more trustworthy
to the school too.

842
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,074
Okay. I'll be there with Ji-hoon tomorrow.

843
01:05:11,158 --> 01:05:13,827
Sir, this is Joo Hyun
from the Cyber Bureau.

844
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:16,538
Lieutenant Joo?

845
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,126
He's driving me to our agency now.

846
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:22,753
I'll see you in a bit.

847
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:32,012
We're here.

848
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,739
It's a new road. I guess you didn't know.

849
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:54,451
I guess I didn't.

850
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:57,162
It's my first time hearing about it.

851
01:05:57,245 --> 01:05:58,705
About what we were discussing...

852
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,335
Let's continue next time. It'll be fun.

853
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:06,880
Sure.

854
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:08,674
Thank you.

855
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:33,907
What a jerk.

856
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:38,078
<i>It always comes up.</i>

857
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,788
<i>You seem to really like attention.</i>

858
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:41,415
<i>I am indeed an attention-seeker.</i>

859
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,835
What are the ratings for this TV show?

860
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,003
It has the most views,
both weekly and monthly.

861
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:51,091
Report it to the chairman's secretary
and request production support from HQ.

862
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,260
Make sure I'm on the show next month.

863
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:56,930
I'll make it look like it was their idea.

864
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,015
Those kind of shows don't suit you.

865
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:02,060
Why don't you try some other shows
about education or fashion?

866
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:05,814
TV show ratings are proportional
to approval rates these days.

867
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,442
Look at Kang slowly earning
votes through that show.

868
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,736
Fashion programs won't do.

869
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:13,780
Call the chief secretary now.

870
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:15,157
Yes, ma'am.

871
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,795
{\an8}<i>This is where Jung,</i>

872
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:31,423
{\an8}<i>the suspected mastermind</i>
<i>of The Killing Vote, was apprehended.</i>

873
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:33,008
{\an8}<i>As you can see...</i>

874
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:35,427
That case is similar
to the Kwon Seok-joo case.

875
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:38,847
To avenge his daughter's death,
he also killed a man.

876
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:42,768
It's understandable though.
His family member died.

877
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:46,229
By the way, Yun-seong.

878
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:49,608
Yes?

879
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,991
Why are you killing people again?

880
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,306
You got me.

881
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:32,067
I can never seem to fool you, Mom.

882
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:38,365
By the way, Mom.

883
01:08:39,074 --> 01:08:42,410
I have a present for you.

884
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:45,288
You're going to love it.

885
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:48,291
<i>This will be a wake-up call</i>
<i>for the criminals...</i>

886
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:53,630
<i>Meanwhile, questions have risen</i>
<i>over the use of guns</i>

887
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:58,468
<i>and potential excessive force</i>
<i>during the arrest process.</i>

888
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:09,229
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

889
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:14,860
Shall we?

890
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:22,826
Wait.

891
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:27,998
Let's go.

892
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:37,382
{\an8}FROM NUMBER ONE FAN
TO KWON SEOK-JOO

893
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:03,658
Let me report
last week's opinion poll results.

894
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:04,594
MIN-SOO

895
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:06,096
HERE'S YOUR GIFT

896
01:11:07,806 --> 01:11:12,060
Do you want to have The Killing Vote,

897
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:15,188
Mom?

898
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:24,382
{\an8}<i>Do you remember me?</i>

899
01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:26,426
{\an8}<i>How could I forget you?</i>

900
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,595
{\an8}<i>You killed Kwon Na-rae, didn't you?</i>

901
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:30,305
{\an8}<i>You suspect...</i>

902
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:32,223
{\an8}<i>my teacher may be Gaetal, right?</i>

903
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,933
{\an8}There's no reason for it.

904
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:37,145
{\an8}<i>He said his accomplice destroyed</i>
<i>the person you loved the most.</i>

905
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,398
{\an8}This looks like our schoolyard.

906
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:44,778
{\an8}<i>I got you.</i>
