[Episode 34]

00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,560
Uncle Jin said

4
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,450
Director also

5
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,509
grew up in the welfare house.

6
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,509
She was an orphan too,

7
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,270
just like us.

8
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,360
She told me

9
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,120
my grandparents

10
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,079
passed away before I was born.

11
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,160
Uncle Jin and I

12
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,840
have confirmed this.

13
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,130
Director indeed

14
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,710
grew up in the welfare house.

15
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,540
Very few people

16
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,720
know about it.

17
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,710
Because she doesn't want others

18
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,160
to make a big deal out of it.

19
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,950
That is also why

20
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,800
Director is so kind to those children

21
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,590
and cares so much about them.

22
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,000
It's not that she doesn't love you.

23
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
She just doesn't know

24
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,800
how to love you.

25
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,150
She never learned how.

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,840
Actually, we all can see that you both

27
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,310
care about each other very much.

28
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
It's just that

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,910
you don't know how to express it.

30
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,870
Chun,

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,560
to be honest,

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,870
Tongsheng and I envy you.

33
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,430
Because you have a family.

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,960
Auntie,

35
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,079
please come in.

36
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,310
Director.

37
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,590
Chun, talk properly.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,560
You two...

39
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,240
Talk properly.

40
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,390
Chun.

41
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,960
I'm hungry.

42
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,780
I'll make you some noodles.

43
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,960
Tongsheng told me everything.

44
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,870
I was so careless.

45
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,040
I didn't even know what you

46
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,950
have been through recently.

47
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,960
When you were struggling

48
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,050
and needed warmth the most,

49
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,870
I actually

50
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,120
slapped you that day.

51
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,190
It must have broken your heart.

52
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,320
Why...

53
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,630
didn't you tell me

54
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,480
that you also

55
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,750
grew up in the welfare house?

56
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,160
You already know?

57
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,240
Yes.

♫I've seen the sunset countless times on my way to find you♫

59
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,830

67

69
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,390

♫You'll think of me when you see birds flying♫

72
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,010
Maybe because that wish

73
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,600
was too strong,

74
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:59,050
♫That's what I tell myself at night♫

75
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,950
I started to believe

76
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,510
all children felt the same way.

77
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,830
♫You must be very happy if I see you again♫

psychology seminar program,

131
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,370
though primarily designed for academic exchange,

132
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,380
is undeniably top-tier

133
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,510
in its field.

134
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,450
So I think this place

135
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,450
perfectly meets your needs.

136
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,480
Moreover, Chad Hahn University

137
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,030
has a history of over 200 years,

138
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,910

I'm just worried...

145

You don't need to worry.

146
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,510
I've already made arrangements

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,550
for you over there.

There won't be any issues.

149
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,090

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,840
of your recommendation letter

151
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,120
and application materials too.

152
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,450
All that's left is for you to get ready

153
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,410
and get your visa,

154
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,720

Why are you grateful to me?

158

I didn't do much.

Everything's been settled.

164
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,510
It's just

165
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,510
I still need some time

166
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,930
to adjust myself.

167
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,360
Then I remembered

168
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,360
what you said about studying psychology.

169
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,240
It does seem like a good fit for me.

170
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,500
That's great.

171

I've already taken care of it.

189

Don't be so polite.

191
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,940

198
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,600

Wait.

201
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,760
I did hear that you haven't been

202
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,030
in a good state lately,

Thank you, Chief Wu.

Actually, there are some things

211
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,670
I've never told you before.

212
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,390
I have a much stronger sense

213
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,340
of empathy than most people.

214
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,000
So for years,

215
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
I've been experiencing

216
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,510
every victim's life.

217
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,630

their pain,

220
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,740
and their emotions.

221
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,420
They've left

222
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,130
invisible weight on me.

223
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,960
I have tried

224
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,910
different ways

to cope,

226
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,420
but I realized

227
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,670
I could

228
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,240
only relieve the pressure temporarily.

229
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,790
In fact, the weight

230
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,080
never truly faded.

231
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,750
Instead, it

232
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,030
kept piling up inside me.

233
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
Until what happened to Danning.

234
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,000
At that moment,

235
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,270
I almost fell apart.

236
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,690
I even started to doubt myself.

237
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,750
I started to doubt

238
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,060
whether uncovering

239
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,829
the truth for the dead

240
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,640
was really

241
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,640
the right thing to do.

242
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,650
Of course, it's not just

243
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,350
about work.

244
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,750
There're also some personal matters.

245
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,520
My relationship with my mother

246
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,310
over the years

247
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,550
has never been good.

248
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,240
And now it has gotten worse.

249
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,410
Still,

250
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,880
I don't know what to do either.

251
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,480
Anyway, all these things

252
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,350
have had a huge impact on me.

253
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,530
During that time, I felt I was like

254
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,510
someone drowning,

255
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,610
lost in a vast,

256
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,510
gray ocean.

257
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,980
And it seemed I was unable

258
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,440
to find a way out.

259
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,540
But I was lucky.

260
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,140
Because

261
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,510
I had so many colleagues

262
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,410
and friends who love me.

263
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,510
They all supported me,

264
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,350
understood me,

265
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,420
and kept telling me

266
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,520
that my job is meaningful.

267
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,550
They also tried their best

268
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,920
to mend things

269
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,270
between my mother and me.

270
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,340
But I knew very well

271
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,960
I couldn't just rely on them to help me with that.

272
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,170
I had to figure it out on my own.

273
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,730
Then, one moment,

274
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,170
I finally understood

275
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,920
that being able to empathize with the deceased

276
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,500
is not my flaw.

277
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,670
Instead, it's a kind of ability.

278
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,520
As long as I adjust my mindset

279
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,420
and use it properly,

280
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,270
it will become

281
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,560
my greatest weapon

282
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,790
to speak for the deceased.

283
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,690
Look, you've already

284
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,240
figured it out.

285
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,160
Why do you insist on resigning?

286
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,880
Understanding something

287
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,110
and being able to act on it are two different things.

288
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,830
To be honest,

289
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,830
I still haven't been able to

290
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,070
completely heal myself.

291
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,680
I still need some time

292
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,920
and still need to find the right way.

293

Not long ago,

294
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,810
Danning and I made pottery together.

295
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,110
The pot cracked.

296
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,560
I'm just like that pot.

297
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
Maybe I still need some space

298
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,270
and some time

299
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,590
to mend my cracks

300

But don't worry.

Inside, I feel full.

303
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,650
Because I know

I have everyone's love and support.

305
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,380

385
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,850
This is not bad.

386
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,480
Come on, cheers.

387
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:56,960
Cheers.

388
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,000
Cheers.

389
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,750
So, Tongsheng,

390
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,650
what do you think of this belated

391
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,350
birthday party for you?

392
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,440
Are you happy? Do you like it?

393
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,200
Are you satisfied?

394
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,580
I don't know if he's satisfied or not.

395
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,590
Anyway, when I came,

396
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,650
I was quite nervous.

397
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,440
Don't you remember last time?

398
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,000
You and I came here

399
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,330
and decorated this room with a bunch of things.

400
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,720
But he threw all of them out.

401
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,970
Are you satisfied with the new things

402
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,150
we bought for you this time?

403
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,410
No.

404
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,610
Why not?

405
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,640
A birthday without gifts.

406
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,570
Why should I be satisfied?

407
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,260
What gifts do you want?

408
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,820
Aren't we two gifts?

409
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,160
Chun, where did you learn to be

410
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,970
glib-tongued?

411
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,830
From him?

412
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,920
How come you're acting more and more like you did

413
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,830
when you were a child?

414
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,850
I can act like that,

415
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,040
but you better not.

416
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,500
Alright, alright, alright.

417
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,550
The auspicious time has come.

418
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,640
Blow out the candle.

419
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,480
Here, let me light it for you.

420
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
-Let me light it for you.
-Come on.

421
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,130
Make a wish.

422
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,100
♫Happy birthday to you♫

423
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,000
♫Happy birthday to you♫

424
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,400
♫Happy birthday to you♫

425
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,510
♫Happy birthday to you♫

426
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,130
Okay.

427
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,880
I'm blowing it out.

428
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,350
Okay.

429
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,640
Let me do it.

430
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,680
Okay.

431
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,240
Here.

432
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,190
Since we're so happy today,

433
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,390
I

434
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,240
am going to tell you

435
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,160
something happier.

436
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,200
Go ahead.

437
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,030
I have already

438
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,400
submitted my resignation letter.

439
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,750
Resignation letter?

440
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,430
When did you decide to resign?

441
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,550
Don't look at me like that.

442
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,680
It's a good thing.

443
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,310
I didn't act on impulse.

444
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,610
I've thought about it for a long time.

445
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,690
I've also figured out

446
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,960
what path I should take

447
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,160
in the future.

448
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,110
That's why I made

449
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,960
this decision.

450
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,610
Wait, does that mean

451
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,720
you don't want to be a forensic doctor anymore?

452
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,110
Of course not.

453
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,880
I...

454
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,890
want to study

455
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,940
and improve myself,

456
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,790
so I can become

457
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,640
a better forensic doctor.

458
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,180
And I want to thank you both.

459
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,400
A lot of things

460
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,920
have happened recently.

461
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,200
If it weren't for your company

462
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,180
or help,

463
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,030
I wouldn't have gotten through it so quickly.

464
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,430
I might still be

465
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,240
hiding in some dark corner.

466
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,370
But because of you,

467
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,570
I was

468
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,930
able to heal so quickly

469
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,750
and make

470
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,070
such a brave decision.

471
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,860
Chun.

472
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,420
You just said

473
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,030
"thank you" to me.

474
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,090
Actually,

475
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,000
compared to what you've done for me,

476
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,920
what I've done for you

477
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,740
is barely worth mentioning.

478
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,480
Don't say that.

479
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,230
So,

480
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,180
no matter what decision you make,

481
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,990
whether as your friends

482
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,250
or your family,

483
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,550
we both support you.

484
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,150
Since you put it that way,

485
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,560
what else can I say?

486
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,080
I definitely support you.

487
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,150
That's good.

488
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,290
Understanding is above all.

489
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,390
We'll wait for you to come back.

490
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,990
You're not planning

491
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,960
on leaving for good, are you?

492
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,210
What are you talking about?

493
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Of course not.

494
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,380
Didn't I just tell you

495
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,070
I want to be a better forensic doctor?

496
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,830
Alright.

497
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,720
We'll be

498
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,780
best friends forever,

499
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,650
okay?

500
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,510
Alright, stop talking.

501
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,430
I'm about to cry.

502
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,070
Then cry.

503
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,910
Grant me a wish, will you?

504
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:10,980
Let's take a photo.

505
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,110
I'm a bit sad.

506
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,230
I'm not in the mood.

507
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,520
What's wrong?

508
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,750
We've been good friends for so long,

509
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,840
but we've never taken a photo together.

510
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,110
Come on, let's take one.

511
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,720
Use your phone.

512
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,590
-Come on.
-Come on.

513
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,130
Come on, look at the camera.

514
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,590
Come on.

515
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,830
Three, two, one.

516
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:00,960
Chun.

517
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,010
Chun.

518
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,510
Weren't you in the archives

519
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,500
looking up information?

520
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,720
Danggui told me

521
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,720
you came back to pack your things.

522
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,040
How could I still be in the mood to look up information?

523
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,210
I rushed here immediately.

524
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,430
Pai.

525
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,350
From now on...

526
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,240
you'll be in charge here.

527
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,070
Chun,

528
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,200
if I hadn't

529
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,030
come here today,

530
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,680
were you planning

531
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,400
to just leave like this?

532
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,150
What else should I do?

533
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,900
Ask you guys

534
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,360
to throw me a farewell party?

535
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,370
Work is exhausting enough as it is.

536
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,690
Instead of that,

537
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,830
you might as well go home and rest.

538
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,910
Besides,

539
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,000
I can't stand

540
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,350
emotional scenes.

541
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,650
It's not like we won't stay in touch.

542
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,790
Yes.

543
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,470
You... You contacted everyone else.

544
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,060
What about me,

545
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,470
your Pai?

546
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,200
Don't you have anything to say to me?

547
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,170
What are you doing?

548
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,200
Take it back.

549
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,340
I just said I don't like

550
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,680
these emotional scenes.

551
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,160
I was going to

552
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,270
the archives to you.

553
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,790
Chun,

554
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,720
can't you stay?

555
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,200
A-Aren't you worried that I might

556
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,830
make a mistake

557
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,400
and then

558
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,750
Chief Wu and Captain Shen will scold me?

559
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,680
Yuan Zhoulyu,

560
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,160
you need to have confidence in yourself.

561
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,240
It's not that easy

562
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,200
to make a mistake.

563
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,270
When I first started

564
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,530
as a forensic doctor,

565
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,190
I faced plenty of challenges too.

566
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,220
This profession

567
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,680
is especially demanding for women.

568
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,180
Take entering a crime scene as an example.

569
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,130
I've always believed

570
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,050
women are at a disadvantage at a crime scene.

571
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,410
But I didn't care what others thought.

572
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,300
If I thought I could do it, I went for it.

573
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,820
And all these years,

574
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,590
I have never

575
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,760
let myself fall short.

576
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,290
Yes, Chun.

577
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,480
Just because I know that,

578
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,160
for all these years,

579
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,850
I've always considered you

580
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,670
as my role model.

581
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,460
A role model

582
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,930
isn't meant to be admired.

583
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,280
It's meant to make you believe

584
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,110
that one day,

585
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,350
you can become someone like that too.

586
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,110
If you always think

587
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,880
you're not ready

588
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,000
to stand on your own,

589
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,180
that day will

590
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,270
never come.

591
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,150
I'm just worried

592
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,190
that I don't have enough experience

593
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,790
to handle those unknown crime scenes I'll face.

594
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,650
No one

595
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,790
is born into this world

596
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,200
with enough experience.

597
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,320
Don't panic when you encounter problems.

598
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,960
You need to believe

599
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,540
that you have the ability to solve problems.

600
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,670
Then half the battle

601
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,640
is already won.

602
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,350
Okay.

603
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,590

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440

605
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,730
are very brave,

606
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,510
and your skills are strong.

607
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,910
It's just that sometimes,

608
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,110
you're a bit impatient.

609
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,100
Calm down,

610
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,130
and focus on the details.

611
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,450
Instead of battling

612
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,720
invisible emotions,

613
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,310
ground yourself in the present.

614
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,940
Remember,

615
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,560
in this world,

616
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,680
there is no such thing as a perfect crime.

617
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,240
There are only clues that have yet to be discovered.

618
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,440
The bodies delivered

619
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,350

623
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,550

624
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,600
Don't worry, Chun.

625
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,790
I'll

626
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,350
keep that in mind.

627
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,100
You can do it.

It's her first day of school,

00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,440
so there'll be a lot to take care of in the university.

649

767
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,030
Now when I smell it,

768
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,850
it...

769
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,740
really reeks.

770
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,320
I believe after Chun stays abroad for a while,

771
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,800
her tastes will change too.

772
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,960
Adviser Xu, I advise you

773
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,320
to eat more Western food.

774
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,760
Chun won't.

775
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,960
I've known

776
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,070
Chun since I was 12.

777
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,510
She hasn't changed much.

778
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,280
Well, that's not true.

779
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,230
She's become more beautiful.

780
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,740
Adviser Xu.

781
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,030
Why exactly did you

782
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,590
ask me here today?

783
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,190
Here's the thing.

784
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,500
Normally,

785
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,480
Chun's friends

786
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,440
are my friends.

787
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,880
We all know each other well.

788
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,600
But this time is an exception.

789
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,590
You two are so close,

790
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
but she barely mentioned you.

791
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,510
So I'm...

792
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,110
a bit curious.

793
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,440
Are you curious

794
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,070
or worried?

795
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,790
I'm...

796
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,490
a bit worried too.

797
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,930
Because Mr. Han,

798
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:55,730
you are

799
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,320
hard to read.

800
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,320
Here.

801
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,920
Beef offal.

802
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,920
Mr. Han.

803
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:15,920
You like Chun, right?

804
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,320
Why are you asking this?

805
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,180
Because getting a civil servant a chance

806
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,540
to study abroad is not easy.

807
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,770
You've done her such a big favor.

808
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,940
Isn't it because you like her?

809
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,960
That was nothing

810
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,090
for me.

811
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,360
Of course,

812
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,810
the most important thing is Chun

813
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,760
is very outstanding.

814
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,590
Adviser Xu.

815
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,090
Why do I feel

816
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,550
you secretly have a crush on Chun?

817
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,320
I can

818
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,920
tell you very honestly

819
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,590
that I care about her very much.

820
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,390
That's true.

821
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,920
I care about her too.

822
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:00,840
She's abroad now,

823
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,150
living alone in a foreign country.

824
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,800
I will care about her even more in the future.

825
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,000
Chun

826
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,530
won't stay abroad for too long.

827
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,100
She's a good forensic doctor.

828
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,390
She will definitely come back.

829
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,450
Nothing is definite.

830
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,050
You don't want her to come back?

831
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,190
What I want doesn't matter at all.

832
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,920
But I understand one thing.

833
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,360
Look, people can't even

834
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,450
control their own fate,

835
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,530
yet they want to control others.

836
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,550
Don't you think that's just wishful thinking?

Fire Safety in Rental Housing:

840
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,560
Rental properties have high foot traffic,

841
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,330
making fire safety especially crucial.

842
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,330
Fire exits

843
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,040
and stairwells must remain unobstructed at all times.

844
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,440
Emergency exits should be accessible and operable.

845
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:33,330
Flammable materials must not be used to create room dividers.

846
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,240
Kitchens should be separate

847
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,400
from living spaces and divided by brick walls.

848
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,170
Each floor's common areas must have fire extinguishers,

849
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,010
with at least two in working condition

850
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,400
and regularly maintained.

851
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,840
Wiring and electrical equipment should be maintained regularly.

852

and overloading circuits by using multiple high-power appliances simultaneously,

854
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,890
as this may cause fires.
