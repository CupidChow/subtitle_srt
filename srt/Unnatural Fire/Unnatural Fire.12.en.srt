00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,850
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,920
Yu Fan.

4
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,210
Which Yu Fan?

5
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,300
There's someone named Yu Fan in our class.

6
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,280
but I don't

7
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,310
have any impression about her.

8
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,710
No impression?

9
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,479
Not even a little?

10
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,000
Right.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,850
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,530
It's okay. Thank you.

13
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,690
Do you know Yu Fan well?

14
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,410
Not really.

15
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,480
Did you know she died?

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,140
She's dead?

17
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,180
She's dead?

18
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,639
I don't know.

19
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,510
We and that Yu Fan

20
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,410
weren't even close.

21
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,680
If you don't mention,

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,240
we all

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,530
can't remember who she was.

24
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,190
But someone said you and her

25
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,470
had a conflict before.

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,400
I don't think so.

27
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,660
Cornering her on the road,

28
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,590
pushing her around,

29
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,390
not letting her go to class.

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Remember now?

31
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,680
Let me tell you,

32
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,820
this is a criminal case.

33
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,240
Concealing and lying

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,310
won't do you any good.

35
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,700
Officer,

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,110
this really isn't a big deal.

37
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,800
Yu Fan's death

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,100
has absolutely nothing to do with us.

39
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,500
Although

40
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,520
we did

41
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,810
give her some minor trouble.

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,470
But we were forced to do it.

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,050
It was Gao Yarui

44
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,180
made us do this.

45
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,520
She said Yu Fan

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,800
was too bored alone

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,530
in the dorm,

48
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,930
So she deliberately made us pick on her,

49
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,410
then Gao Yarui would appear.

50
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,320
She thought it would be fun.

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,710
Our family business

52
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,130
still needs their family's support.

53
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,370
[Yu Fan] [Jin Yan] [Gao Yarui] [Cheng Sisi] [Fang Ni]

54
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,430
We can only listen to her.

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,700
Fun, huh?

56
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,970
Gao Yarui thinks bullying is fun?

57
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,530
Later, I asked other people.

58
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,470
There are quite a few people

59
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,960
who have been bullied by Gao Yairui.

60
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,520
In the end, they all became her friends.

61
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,710
It’s like

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,060
she’s expanding her power.

63
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,150
assimilating them,

64
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,870
and then making them obey her.

65
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,950
[Yu Fan] [Jin Yan] [Gao Yarui] [Cheng Sisi] [Fang Ni]

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,790
Next are a few other people.

67
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,590
Since in this dorm,

68
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,810
only Yu Fan and Gao Yarui

69
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,740
[Yu Fan]

70
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,850
[Gao Yarui bullies]

71
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:19,790
were in the same class,

72
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,720
the others were in different majors.

73
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,020
So I went to ask

74
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,180
the people in the neighboring dorms.

75
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,829
According to them,

76
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,600
before Gao Yarui moved into the dorm,

77
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,750
Yu Fan and Jin Yan were the closest,

78
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,310
Between them and Cheng Sisi and Fang Ni,

79
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,740
it was a normal roommate relationship.

80
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,590
No one had heard

81
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,500
of any conflicts between them.

82
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,050
But after Gao Yarui moved in,

83
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,250
those with Yu Fan

84
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,470
now included Gao Yarui.

85
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,460
And Cheng Sisi and Fang Ni

86
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,840
also gradually

87
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,170
got closer to Gao Yarui.

88
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,030
And people around had seen.

89
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,620
I'll take you to check out a restaurant.

90
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,579
It's super delicious.

91
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,010
I haven't even tried it yet.

92
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,130
From the current situation,

93
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,640
the deceased Yu Fan

94
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,710
had a weak personality,

95
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,380
was just a nobody in class.

96
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,600
She would only endure whatever happened to her.

97
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,720
Logically speaking,

98
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,100
she wouldn't offend anyone.

99
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,530
As for the others,

100
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,930
Gao Yarui has been bullying others.

101
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,710
As for Fang Ni and Jin Yan,

102
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
and Cheng Sisi,

103
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,260
they don't seem to have

104
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,590
any obvious conflicts with the deceased.

105
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,660
What do you think?

106
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,600
So you're saying

107
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,600
we can't find

108
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,959
a motive for killing Yu Fan,

109
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,600
right?

110
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,860
Adviser Xu,

111
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,080
do you have any thoughts?

112
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,720
Is there any other information?

113
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,390
No.

114
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,280
Then I have no ideas.

115
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,490
Captain Shen,

116
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,600
I have an idea,

117
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,670
but I'm not sure if I should say it.

118
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,190
Go ahead, Jiang Li.

119
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,590
Speak freely.

120
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,250
Well, it's like this.

121
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,730
Right now, our understanding of the whole case

122
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,820
is quite vague.

123
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,650
Throughout this process,

124
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,770
there are quite a few suspicious points.

125
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,110
From this perspective,

126
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,630
we actually can't

127
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,360
distinguish

128
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,920
which of their behaviors are normal

129
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,680
and which are abnormal.

130
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,640
So...

131
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,680
Why don't

132
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,920
we go and play

133
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,820
this LARP game ourselves?

134
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,960
Experience firsthand

135
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,270
the entire process of the crime.

136
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,070
What do you think?

137
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:05,790
Yeah.

138
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,080
Not a good idea.

139
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,260
No need to go to such trouble.

140
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,650
Just have the owner

141
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,560
recount the process in detail.

142
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,290
That should be enough.

143
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,600
Why not?

144
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,360
There are many things at the scene

145
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,760
that can be overlooked by mere deduction.

146
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,770
In many cases,

147
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,890
during the reenactment process,

148
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,650
details and blind spots

149
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,920
that were previously unnoticed are discovered.

150
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,920
Adviser Xu,

151
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,750
don't you know this?

152
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,390
Also,

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,240
Jiang Li, Mao Mao,

154
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,090
I think you two

155
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,100
made excellent points.

156
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,160
Fire investigation needs

157
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,420
people like you two.

158
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,170
Danggui,

159
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,310
go and bring the owner here.

160
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,300
Okay.

161
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:45,970
Stand there.

162
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,470
Here?

163
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,210
Can you still play

164
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,040
"The Missing Classmate"

165
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,750
in your store now?

166
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,620
Officer,

167
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,620
as you've seen,

168
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,320
our store

169
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,600
has been burned to that state.

170
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,880
Now we probably can't

171
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,750
play anything anymore.

172
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,940
Do you have any other stores?

173
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,210
We want to play it again.

174
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,850
Yes, there are other stores.

175
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,340
I have another branch.

176
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,250
The setup and scene there

177
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,600
are exactly the same

178
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,070
as the burned store.

179
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,390
Can it be 100% recreated?

180
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,240
No problem.

181
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,390
What are you doing with your hands?

182
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,150
Put them down.

183
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,300
I want to say a few words to this gentleman.

184
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,250
I don't know if my

185
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,700
branch store's fire safety is up to standard.

186
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,600
That store of mine

187
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,610
hasn't officially opened yet.

188
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,680
Alright, alright.

189
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,570
Danggui,

190
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,720
take the owner to get ready.

191
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,070
Okay.

192
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,480
Yes.

193
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:36,920
Let's go.

194
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,880

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,850
Buddy, you two put them in your pockets then.

389
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,670
Let's go quickly.

390
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,480
Keep it.

391
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,710
I don't have pockets.

392
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,350
Take it back.

393
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,970
[The Missing Classmate]

394
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,260
On the day of the incident,

395
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:33,140
[Yu Fan] [Jin Yan] [Gao Yarui] [Cheng Sisi] [Fang Ni]

396
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,120
the victim died during the fourth round.

397
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:27,960
However, based on

398
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,300
our review today,

399
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,240
during the fourth round,

400
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,240
the victim shouldn't have entered

401
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,310
the "Sorrow Room" where the incident occurred,

402
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,510
[Game Hall] [Sorrow Room] [Contemplation Room]

403
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,670
[Game Hall] [Sorrow Room] [Contemplation Room]

404
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,510
but rather the room before it,

405
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,280
the "Contemplation Room".

406
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,000
We don't know what

407
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,000
problem occurred in between,

408
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,920
causing everyone

409
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,400
to move one room further than they should have,

410
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,080
resulting in the victim entering the Sorrow Room.

411
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,510
What we can confirm now is that

412
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,550
this Sorrow Room had been tampered with.

413
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,620
Moreover, I've asked the owner,

414
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,680
and the prop that should have been

415
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,000
in the Sorrow Room

416
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,920
was supposed to be water.

417
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,280
However, on the day of the incident,

418
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,270
it was mysteriously

419
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:03,900
replaced with

420
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,850
flammable alcohol.

421
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,210
The glass container that should have been

422
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,510
at the crime scene

423
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,000
wasn't found there either.

424
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,170
This was clearly intentional.

425
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,120
Therefore,

426
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,320
this was a

427
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,890
carefully planned murder.

428
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,630
The target

429
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,080
was the person who should have entered

430
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,860
the fatal Sorrow Room in the fourth round.

431
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,240
[Gao Yarui bullies]

432
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,970
How's your relationship

433
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,830
with the other four people?

434
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,490
We get along pretty well.

435
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,140
Although we're not exactly best friends,

436
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,410
we do get along quite well.

437
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,140
There are no major conflicts between us.

438
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,920
Who are you closest to?

439
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,270
I'm not particularly close to anyone.

440
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,050
If I had to choose,

441
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,870
I'd say Cheng Sisi.

442
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,250
We get along relatively well.

443
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,510
Who do you get along with the least?

444
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,660
No one.

445
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,110
I've already said,

446
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,790
we don't have any major conflicts.

447
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,410
On the day of the incident,

448
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,160
when you entered

449
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,160
the room where it happened,

450
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,350
did you notice anything unusual?

451
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,530
I was just playing the game according to the script.

452
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,350
There was nothing unusual.

453
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,890
I saw you pouring something on the table.

454
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,920
What were you pouring?

455
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,680
I think...

456
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,650
It might have been alcohol.

457
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,290
When I was pouring it,

458
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,640
I smelled alcohol.

459
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,510
But the script

460
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,720
said to pour alcohol, right?

461
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,420
I was thinking at the time

462
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,200
that the prop was quite realistic.

463
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,290
Who gave you the prop?

464
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:41,940
Gao Yarui.

465
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,460
I remember it clearly.

466
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,640
Don't try to blame

467
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,550
Gao Yarui.

468
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,800
But she really did give it to me!

469
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,480
We're friends.

470
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,630
Why would I try to

471
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,200
smear her?

472
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,720
Are you really good friends?

473
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,400
If you hadn't gone into

474
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,710
the wrong room that day,

475
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,270
the person who died should have been Gao Yarui.

476
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,860
We went into the wrong room?

477
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,810
Are you asking me?

478
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,180
I'm asking you.

479
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,910
Why did you go into the wrong room?

480
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,970
What were you thinking?

481
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,450
I... I think I remember now.

482
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,610
I think there was a sudden power outage.

483
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,110
Then the NPC

484
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,270
came out chasing us.

485
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,340
We were panicked and scared,

486
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,940
so we just felt our way into a room.

487
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,430
Maybe

488
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,400
that's when we went into the wrong room.

489
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,170
What do you think about the relationship

490
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,240
between Gao Yairui and Yu Fan?

491
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,270
Well...

492
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,670
In public,

493
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,030
Gao Yarui is quite nice to Yu Fan.

494
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,480
But in the dorm...

495
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,130
Tell me about

496
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,200
your relationship with the other four.

497
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,790
Relationship?

498
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,440
We're just normal roommates.

499
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,750
I get along a bit better with Fang Ni.

500
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,200
Then who do you get along with the least?

501
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Among us,

502
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,740
there aren't any major conflicts.

503
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,110
Who I get along with the least...

504
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,610
I can't really say.

505
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,560
On the day of the incident,

506
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,110
when you entered the room where the accident happened,

507
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,400
did you notice anything unusual?

508
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,570
I was just playing according to the script.

509
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,030
There was nothing unusual.

510
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,930
From the surveillance footage,

511
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,210
I saw you pouring something on the floor.

512
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,270
What were you pouring?

513
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,260
The wine.

514
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,030
In my script,

515
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,450
the instruction was to pour wine.

516
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,560
I smelled it,

517
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,240
and the alcohol scent was strong.

518
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,470
Who gave you the prop?

519
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,490
Gao Yarui.

520
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,190
Before you got the prop,

521
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,030
was this bag

522
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,240
always in Gao Yarui's possession?

523
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,080
It was always

524
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,480
held by Gao Yarui herself.

525
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,720
During the fourth round,

526
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,640
there was a power outage.

527
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,510
Do you remember?

528
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,800
I remember.

529
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,340
I was already afraid of the dark,

530
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,490
and the lights were flickering on and off.

531
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,800
There were also NPCs grabbing me.

532
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,650
I was really scared at that time.

533
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,690
I screamed many times.

534
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,840
I was thinking at that moment,

535
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,240
In the future,

536
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,210
I won't play any scripts

537
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,290
with NPCs anymore.

538
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,080
Do you know that you all

539
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,110
went to the wrong room?

540
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,950
We went to the wrong room?

541
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,130
No, we didn't.

542
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,750
The people in front and behind me were all correct.

543
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,560
On the day of the incident,

544
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,210
all of you went forward

545
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,310
one more room.

546
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,940
If you hadn't gone to the wrong room,

547
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,620
the person who died should have been Gao Yarui.

548
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,660
Gao Yarui?

549
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,130
What do you think about the relationship

550
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,270
between Gao Yairui and Yu Fan?

551
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:46,720
Her relationship with Yu Fan was like

552
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,360
a master and a dog.

553
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,070
Relationship?

554
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,750
I have a good relationship with Yu Fan.

555
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,750
As for the others,

556
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,830
they're just ordinary roommates to me.

557
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,310
There's nothing much to say about them.

558
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,520
Who do you have the worst relationship with?

559
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,270
I don't think there's anyone.

560
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,700
We all get along fine.

561
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,640
On the day of the incident,

562
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,080
when you entered the room where the incident occurred,

563
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,270
did you notice anything unusual?

564
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,960
Do you remember this bottle?

565
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,080
This is the bottle

566
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,240
I was asked to put in during the task.

567
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,580
What was it for?

568
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,830
I think there was a candle on it at the time.

569
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,520
after I put it in as instructed,

570
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,200
I was told to light it.

571
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,780
Who else has touched this?

572
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,790
Gao Yarui gave it to me.

573
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,720
I don't know

574
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,550
who else might have touched it.

575
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,750
During the fourth round,

576
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,510
there was a power outage.

577
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,380
Do you still remember that?

578
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,350
Yes, I do.

579
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,130
An NPC in white

580
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,240
suddenly appeared.

581
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,140
It was quite scary.

582
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,740
We were all panicking

583
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,790
and quickly hid in the rooms.

584
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,480
Didn't you notice you went into the wrong room?

585
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,370
On the day of the incident, all of you

586
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,970
moved one room further than usual.

587
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,620
If you hadn't made that mistake,

588
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,110
the person who died should have been Gao Yarui.

589
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,180
What do you think about the relationship

590
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,480
between Gao Yarui and Yu Fan?

591
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,910
It’s definitely not a good one.

592
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,580
Don't ask Gao Yarui anymore for now.

593
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
I need to go back and do an experiment.

594
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,760
What? Have you got a lead?

595
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,790
Let's talk after I finish.

596
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,080
Let's go. I'll come with you.

597
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,590
[Professional Experiment. Please do not imitate]

598
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,880
Gao Yarui,

599
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:29,750
tell us about your

600
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,750
relationship with the others.

601
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,430
Just normal roommate relationships.

602
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,920
Is it really just a normal roommate relationship?

603
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,510
You think we

604
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,510
haven't done a background check?

605
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,960
Alright,

606
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,250
Officer,

607
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,700
I'll be honest with you.

608
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,000
There are only two kinds of people around me.

609
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,320
One kind,

610
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,800
those who listen to me.

611
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,870
The other, my enemies.

612
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,440
Which type do you think

613
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,720
those girls are?

614
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,880
I can't tell. Which type are they?

615
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,920
Of course, they're the ones who listen to me.

616
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,400
Do they really listen to you?

617
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,680
Of course.

618
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,120
Let me reconstruct

619
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,740
what happened that day.

620
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,380
You all went to play a LARP game together.

621
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,430
When you got to the "Sorrow Room",

622
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,260
the process was like this:

623
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,780
The first person goes in

624
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,810
and pours water on the table.

625
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,100
The second person goes in

626
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,000
and pours water on the floor.

627
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,890
The third person goes in and lights candles.

628
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,680
You should have been the fourth person to go in,

629
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,470
the one solving the puzzle,

630
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,040
right?

631
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:32,640
Yes.

632
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:34,850
But on the day of the incident,

633
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,720
was it really like that?

634
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:36,910
First,

635
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,800
the water poured on the table and floor

636
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,290
was replaced with high-proof alcohol.

637
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,260
Second,

638
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,470
the glass bottle with a candle inside

639
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,660
was replaced with a sugar jar.

640
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,200
The sugar jar and the candle formed

641
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,550
a delayed ignition device.

642
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,370
When it burned out, it ignited the alcohol,

643
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,860
thus burning the person inside to death.

644
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,400
Why are you telling me this?

645
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,370
I don't care

646
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,480
how Yu Fan died.

647
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,480
Before the fourth round began,

648
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,790
do you remember that power outage?

649
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,420
Yes, I do.

650
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,480
It was because of that power outage,

651
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
all of you went forward

652
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,720
one more room.

653
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,000
Yu Fan also moved forward

654
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,920
one more room.

655
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,070
She entered the Sorrow Room.

656
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,200
She was burned to death.

657
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,610
If it weren’t for that accident,

658
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,480
the one who should have died in the fire would have been you.

659
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,230
Someone was trying to kill you.

660
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,740
Do you understand?

661
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,790
Do you still think they listen to you?

662
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,170
Let's talk about them one by one.

663
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,920
What grudge do you have against Fang Ni?

664
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,590
This bag is so hard to get.

665
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,520
I asked a friend

666
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,400
to bring it back from abroad.

667
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,610
For this,

668
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,410
I treated her to

669
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,530
quite a few meals.

670
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,120
This bag is really beautiful.

671
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,960
The craftsmanship is extraordinary too.

672
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,270
When you get tired of carrying it,

673
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,810
can I borrow it for a couple of days?

674
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,080
Of course,

675
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,410
you can carry it if you like.

676
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,590
Fang Ni, you're so nice.

677
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,260
What are you talking about?

678
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,540
This style is very hard to find.

679
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,740
Where did you buy it?

680
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,060
It was a gift from my mom's business partner.

681
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,640
Business partner?

682
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,240
Your mom must be quite impressive.

683
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,020
You're new here, so you don't know yet.

684
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,740
Our Fang Ni is very low-key.

685
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,740
There's nothing to brag about.

686
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,740
Is it that woman?

687
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,170
Are you sure?

688
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,240
Don't mess with me.

689
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,320
You're here.

690
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,290
Please, sit down.

691
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,960
Why did you ask to meet here?

692
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,140
The hand-grabbed pancakes here are delicious.

693
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,660
The bosslady is especially skilled.

694
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,250
It has a special

695
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,840
taste of home cooking.

696
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,590
Fang Ni, you know what?

697
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,480
You and the bosslady

698
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,380
look quite similar.

699
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,490
Don't you think so,

700
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:55,610
Yu Fan?

701
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,670
You don’t even dare to acknowledge

702
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,520
your own biological mother.

703
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,170
Are you even human?

704
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,100
What are you trying to do?

705
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,239
Nothing much.

706
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,070
I just feel that usually

707
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,489
you don't really listen to me.

708
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,960
Go ahead, glare at me.

709
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,429
Pretending to be a rich kid every day,

710
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,440
isn't it exhausting?

711
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,520
How about this?

712
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,860
From now on, you obediently listen to me.

713
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,590
As for money,

714
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,679
when I'm happy,

715
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,380
I'll reward you.

716
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,230
What if I don't listen?

717
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,630
If you don't, I'll expose you.

718
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,330
You and your mom can close down this shabby stall

719
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,199
for good.

720
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,800
Go home and starve.

721
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:47,989
Yu Fan, let's go.

722
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,590
The hand-grabbed pancakes here are indeed delicious.

723
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,239
Whether we can eat them again in the future

724
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,949
is uncertain.

725
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,480
She pretended to be a rich kid.

726
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,590
I even gave her money.

727
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,080
And she still tried to kill me?

728
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,190
When I get out, I'll definitely...

729
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,020
Get out and do what?

730
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,170
What else do you want to do?

731
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,220
Is this her motive for killing you?

732
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,230
What else did you do to her?

733
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,050
Fine.

734
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,260
I admit it.

735
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,000
A few days ago,

736
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,210
I wanted to mess with her.

737
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,510
So I didn't give her the money.

738
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,200
She kept nagging me for a few days.

739
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Just because of this little thing,

740
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,630
she wanted to kill me.

741
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,550
That person is really shameless.

742
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:26,290
So this is what you call

743
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,290
a good relationship?

744
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,760
I just look down on her.

745
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,970
She's just so vain.

746
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,670
It's true that she pretended to be rich, right?

747
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,170
Her mother selling pancakes

748
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,290
at the school gate is true, right?

749
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,550
It's true that I gave her money, right?

750
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,380
Is this my fault?

751
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,710
Alright, next one.

752
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,520
Cheng Sisi.

753
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,110
Oh, her.

754
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,270
Sir,

755
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,960
I really can't fail this course.

756
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,700
I can't afford not to graduate.

757
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,230
I can't afford to study for another year.

758
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,640
All of you,

759
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,290
I tell you to review properly during the semester,

760
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,150
but you never listen.

761
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,390
Now that graduation is approaching,

762
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,690
you suddenly remember to come and find me.

763
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,670
Where did you learn these crooked ways?

764
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,610
Sir,

765
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,980
I'm different from them.

766
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,090
My situation is more difficult than theirs.

767
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,120
None of these are valid excuses.

768
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:22,800
Sir,

769
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,370
I'm being honest.

770
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,140
If you let me graduate,

771
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,140
Sir, what I mean is,

772
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,320
if you could let me graduate...

773

775
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,120
How shameless!

776
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,880
Get out!

777
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,310
Get out of here!

778
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,520

00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,000
what are you trying to do?

783
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,750
So young and already up to no good.

784
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,710
Shameless!

785
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,290
What else was there?

786
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:58,940
Get out!

787
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,880
What do you mean?

788
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,940
What are you going to do?

789
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,010
You're getting angry with me now?

00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,690

791
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,860

792
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,050
so willing to go to such lengths.

793
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,290
Stop slandering me!

794
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,730
Slander?

795
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:22,790
Slander?

796
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,490
Don't!

797
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,740
These amazing photos of yours,

798
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,250
it would be such a shame to tear them up.

799
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,410
Luckily, I have digital copies of all of them.

800
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,540
And there are videos too.

801
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,800

What exactly do you want to do?

812
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,030
What do I want to do?

813
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,270
I want you to listen to me.

00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,800
Understand?

819
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,380
I'll do as you say.

820
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,710
So you're being obedient now?

823

Please don't send out those photos.

I didn't spread it around.

830
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,480
isn't even worth it.

831
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,480
Officer,

832
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,150
you should have seen her

833
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,240
in that photo.

I'm telling you,

835
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,700
I'm just too kind-hearted.

836
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,700
I didn't send that photo of hers

837
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,800
all over the place.

838
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,200
I should have let everyone know

839
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,070
what kind of trash she is.

840
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,730
I'm telling you,

841
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,960
it's disgusting.

00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,880
Next, Jin Yan.

843
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,630
I haven't done anything to Jin Yan,

844
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,440
nothing at all.

00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,590

00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:57,880
Well,

847
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,960
it could really be her.

848
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,650
I can’t stand people like you.

849
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,160
You two, hold her down.

Go get me the water hose.

853
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,770
Spray her face.

854
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,340
spray her face,

855
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,340
spray her face.

856
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,110
Do you know how to spray or not?

857
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,560
Can you do it or not?

858
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,110
You're so stupid.

859
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,590
Did Jin Yan offend you before?

860
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,670
She didn't offend me.

861
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,410
She didn't do anything

862
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,550
outrageous either.

863
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,590

Tell me,

869
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,960
is she really that kind of person,

870
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,050
or is she just putting on an act for others?

871
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,910
Take her back.

872
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,340
Come on, take her away.
