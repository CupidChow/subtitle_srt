The man's name is Ying Youchang.

The woman's name is Zhang Yulan.

Get me an evidence bag.

17
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,470
Based on the initial assessment,

18
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,710
this should be a homicide scene.

19
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,829
Not just that.

20
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,910
Why?

21
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,400
Look.

22
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,470
Here, here,

23
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,230
here,

24
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,570
and the edges of the victim's clothing

25
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,680
were all the points of ignition.

26
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,680
Combined with the burn

27
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,990
and spread traces,

28
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,520
it's possible

29
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,680
that combustion improver was used.

30
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,760
So,

31
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,079
this was arson.

32
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,800
What kind of combustion improver?

33
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,310
We'll need to run tests for specifics.

34
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,710
Chun, what about you?

35
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,470
Have you found anything?

36
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,280
The male victim, Ying Youchang,

37
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,390
was lying face down on the ground,

38
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,960
with his limbs bent in a fist-like position.

39
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,750
Both of his hands

40
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,910
show signs of having been bound.

41
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,960
The areas of his body in contact with the ground

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,710
weren't burned.

43
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,470
The creases at the outer corners of his eyes

44
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,080
make it difficult to determine if they were reflexively shut.

45
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,300
No soot was found in his corneas

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,070
or conjunctival sacs.

47
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,240
Based on all this,

48
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,800
we can conclude

49
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,110
the victim was bound

50
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,390
and placed face down

51
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,560
before death.

52
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,480
But it's unclear

53
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,390
whether the fire started

54
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,430
before or after he died.

55
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,980
Bound before death?

56
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,630
Placed face down?

57
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,570
Any external injuries?

58
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,720
There's a fresh impact wound

59
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,450
on his forehead,

60
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,070
with signs of vital reaction.

61
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,510
I guess he sustained the injury

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,390
right before the fire started.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,159
So you mean

64
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,470
the male victim

65
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,680
might have been

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,630
attacked by the murderer

67
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,560
before the fire was set?

68
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,480
Full details

69
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,720
require further autopsy.

70
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,510
What about the female victim?

71
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,050
The female victim was lying on her back,

72
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,000
with burn injuries

73
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,330
that are almost identical to those of the male victim.

74
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,010
But there was a knife,

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,750
approximately 3 cm wide,

76
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,870
embedded in her chest.

77
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,560
The entire blade

78
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,630
was fully buried in her body.

79
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,590
The wound

80
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,100
shows clear signs of vital reaction.

81
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,920
It means she was stabbed

82
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,600
before she died.

83
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,950
So the cause of her death was likely the stab wound.

84
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,560
She was stabbed in the chest,

85
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,800
and her body was burned after death.

86
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,630
That's brutal.

87
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,830
The male victim had deep strangulation marks,

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,870
and the female victim was stabbed so violently

89
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,870
that the entire blade went in.

90
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,430
I can't imagine

91
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,560
what kind of grudge

92
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,870
would drive someone to do this.

93
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,240
And there were multiple ignition points

94
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,070
inside this house.

95
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,830
Once the fire started,

96
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,240
escape was impossible.

97
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,380
Multiple ignition points.

98
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,750
This could be

99
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,070
a particularly severe case

100
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,110

106

Okay.

107
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,120

still isn't answering his phone.

112

Keep calling.

113
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,920
Ask around

114
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,120
and see if anyone knows his address.

115
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Get in touch with the family as soon as possible.

116
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:54,800
Okay.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,800
I'm going out to ask around.

118
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,830

119
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,700
you're piecing together the door?

121

Be thorough.

129
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,600
Don't be careless.

pieced that glass back together last time,

134
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,430
I could tell you're very meticulous.

135

141

They asked me to take

142
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,810

Okay. I'll be right there.

I won't disturb you further.

what's going on? You can't get in?

165
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,270
We shouted, but he won't wake up.

166
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,920
Sir!

167
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,490
Sir, wake up!

168
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,430
He's sleeping like a log.

169
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,480
If this doesn't work,

170
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,390
Huang Qi said he has an idea.

171
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,190
Put it away.

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,480
Huang Qi,

173
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,380
check under the mattress.

174
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,070
Already did, Captain Shen.

175
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,070
We also checked the flowerbed. Nothing there.

176
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,000
I really didn't expect this.

177
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,390
If you had, you'd be the captain.

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,580
Sir!

179
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,950
Come on, wake up.

180
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,190
Get up.

181
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,080

do you need?

185

I'll pull it up for you.

186
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,320
No need, we'll do it ourselves.

Okay.

189

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,890
[Northwest corner]

195
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,840
This person.

196
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,960
Zoom in a bit.

197
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,390
[Northwest corner]

198
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,480
I can't see anything clearly.

199
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,790
Why is it so blurry?

200
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,550
Rewind.

201
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,600
Rewind to 10:45 p.m.

202
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:33,070
[Northwest corner]

203
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:34,720
Fast forward.

204
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,720
The rest is just the fire response.

205
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,670
Investigate this person.

206
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,460
[Northwest corner]

207
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,960
How about this?

208
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,030
You two make a copy

209
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:48,840
of this tape

210
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,890
and process it back at the station.

211
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:50,720
Okay.

212
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,320
That sign

213
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,710
was removed the day before yesterday.

214
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,700
Men's restroom is on the left!

215
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,750
Women's restroom is on the right!

216
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,670
Xu, take the left side!

217
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:57,980
Adviser Xu!

218
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,390
You've finished investigating?

219
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,300
Well...

220
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,520
You've finished checking the surveillance footage?

221
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,310
Yes.

222
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,600
But the footage is a bit blurry.

223
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,910
I need the tech department to process it.

224
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,630
Why aren't you going in?

225
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,320
You didn't find one you like?

226
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,630
Or do you need someone to accompany you?

227
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,160
I'm done.

228
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,520
Just kidding.

229
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,370
Being unable to tell left from right

230
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,030
is nothing to be ashamed of.

231
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,840
Next time you get confused,

232
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,030
just

233
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,240
touch this side.

234
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,980
That's left.

235
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,150
Come on.

236
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,240
Let me clarify

237
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,320
the identities of the two victims.

238
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,720
Zhang Yulan.

239
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,870
Ying Youchang.

240
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,200
Through investigation,

241
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,490
they were not a couple.

242
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,320
But they had lived together

243
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,200
for many years.

244
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,520
I'll start with Ying Youchang.

245
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,910
[Zhang Yulan] [Lived together] [Ying Youchang]

246
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,790
He returned

247
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,870
to this village after retiring.

248
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,530
[Photo of the scene]

249
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,440
He had no living relatives,

250
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,150
and his social connections were very simple.

251
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,030
Before retirement, Ying Youchang

252
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,390
worked at a construction site.

253
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,440
After an injury,

254
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,390
he had to rely on a wheelchair.

255
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,910
He had no job during the past two years.

256
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,440
The other victim, Zhang Yulan,

257
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,210
[Zhang Yulan] [Lived together] [Ying Youchang]

258
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,670
lost her husband early in life.

259
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,390
Her son, Hao Chengcai,

260
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,360
[Son: Hao Chengcai] [Husband and wife] [Daughter-in-law: Wang Yingying]

261
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,470
is a sales director at a foreign company.

262
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,790
His wife, Wang Yingying,

263
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,750
is an office clerk.

264
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,370
[Son: Hao Chengcai] [Husband and wife] [Daughter-in-law: Wang Yingying]

265
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Her grandson, Hao Tianyou,

266
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,240
is in elementary school.

267
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,000
[Grandson: Hao Tianyou]

268
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:36,040
[Photo of the scene]

269
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,630
According to the neighbors' statements,

270
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,550
Zhang Yulan spent most of her time

271
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,790
taking care of her grandson at Hao Chengcai's place.

272
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,910
Hao Chengcai's family of three

273
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,150
rarely returned to the old house.

274
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,510
Zhang Yulan was a kind person

275
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,550
and never had

276
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,270
conflicts with anyone.

277
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,890
[Photo of the scene]

278
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,960
From their social circles,

279
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,370
neither of the two victims

280
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,790
had offended anyone.

281
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,150
The most useful lead now

282
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,870
is the surveillance footage.

283
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,600
How's

284
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,320
the recovery going?

285
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,120
Captain Shen,

286
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,120
Zhao, who usually handles this, is on a business trip.

287
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,270
Others have stepped in,

288
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,320
but the progress will be slower.

289
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,080
Hello, Captain Shen.

290
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,310
Adviser Xu.

291
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,790
Yesterday at the village committee,

292
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,960
we got a surveillance tape.

293
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,790
Is Mao Mao from your team

294
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,360
handling it?

295
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:25,960
Yes.

296
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,510
Here's the thing.

297
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,600
Our tech expert is on a business trip.

298
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,270
Members of the criminal investigation

299
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,960
and fire investigation joint team are like family.

300
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,030
When you're done processing it,

301
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,840
can you send me a copy?

302
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,870
Okay, no problem.

303
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,630
That's great.

304
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,510
Do you have

305
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,360
any new findings?

306
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,360
The combustion improver test results

307
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,080
are out.

308
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,270
It was the Baijiu from the scene.

309
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,670
So we can't rule out

310
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,080
the possibility of a crime of passion— an impulsive act of arson.

311
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,510
A crime of passion— an impulsive act of arson?

312
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,870
Adviser Xu, you're indeed efficient.

313
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,030
We're truly like family.

314
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,440
Alright then.

315
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,150
Alright, I'm hanging up.

316
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,960
Sorry for disturbing you.

317
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,030
Once the surveillance footage is processed,

318
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,870
send it to Captain Shen.

319
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,000
No problem.

320
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,550
These are all the clues we have for now.

321
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,910
Let me brief you on the task.

322
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,800
[Photo of the scene]

323
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,320
We need to conduct a more detailed investigation

324
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,910
into the backgrounds of the two victims.

325
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:09,750
Dismissed.

326
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,960
-Yes.
-Yes.

[Photo of the scene]

328
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:34,900
[Zhang Yulan] [Lived together] [Ying Youchang]

329
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,510
Go ahead.

330
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,600
Captain Shen,

331
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,790
an elderly lady claiming to be

332
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,080
Zhang Yulan's close friend for decades

333
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,360
insists on seeing you.

334
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,430
Let me in.

335
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,720
I want to see your leader!

336
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,840
I just want to see my old friend,

337
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,320
my dear friend of decades.

338
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,510
I heard her.

339
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,630
Bring her to the conference room.

340
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,590
Well, I...

341
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,480
Yulan... Well...

342
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,200
I... You don't understand. She...

343
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:52,720
Auntie.

344
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,550
Calm down.

345
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,910
Captain Shen will talk to you later.

346
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, who?

347
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,480
Captain Shen.

348
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,030
I... I... I...

349
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,910
I brought Lin Jingxiang here.

350
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,720
I... I...

351
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,530
Auntie.

352
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,440
Go to the conference room first.

353
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:00,750
Okay.

354
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,530
Get her a glass of water.

355
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,310
I'll be right there.

356
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,000
Auntie, let's go.

357
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,960
Let's go to the conference room first.

358
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,360
You know what? Her whole life...

359
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,480
Listen, her entire life...

360
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,060

363
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,550
You go.

364
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,930
Ask them to identify the body and conduct routine questioning.

365
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,960
Come, Auntie, have a seat.

366
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,550

around about me?

382
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,790
You don't know my relationship

00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,630
with Yulan?

384
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,390
We were friends for almost 40 years.

385
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,440
Yulan's life

386
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,480
was so hard.

387
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:50,870
Listen,

388
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,670
Yulan and I...

389
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,840
Since we were little, I...

390
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,080
We lived close to each other.

391
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,630
We went to school together,

392
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,390
walked home together,

393
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,440
and did homework together.

394
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,120
Then she got married first.

395
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,240
I remember it so clearly.

396
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,510
I got married after her.

397
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
When I got married,

398
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,030
she even gave me a red envelope.

399
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,200
Yulan lived frugally for a whole month

400
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,910
just for the red envelope.

401
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,480
She ate nothing but cornbread buns

402
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,480
for an entire month.

403
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,150
Have you... Have you ever eaten cornbread buns?

404
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,750
Auntie, I've never eaten cornbread buns.

405
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,440
Come, Bai Zhi.

406
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,080
Drink some water.

407
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,750
Auntie, have some water.

408
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,320
I... I... I...

409
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,360
What did

410
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,550
Zhang Yulan usually do?

411
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,390
Did she interact much with others?

412
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,030
Yu... Yulan...

413
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,150
Back then, she... she...

414
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,270
she always complained about back pain.

415
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,360
So I bought her medicated plasters.

416
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,200
I went to her house

417
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,200
to help her apply them.

418
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,080
Then I helped her with housework.

419
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,870
Later, she stopped contacting me.

420
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,720
I knew why she stopped contacting me.

421
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,120
Well...

422
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,790
She had another companion

423
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,870
called Ying.

424
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,080
Ying Youchang.

425
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,670
You knew him?

426
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,270
Ying was truly a good person.

427
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,150
He was

428
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,200
very nice to Yulan.

429
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,360
But that

430
00:16:59,390 --> 00:16:59,960
caused

431
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,840
many people to gossip.

432
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,080
Auntie,

433
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,440
about the gossip

434
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,550
you just mentioned,

435
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,550
who spread it?

436
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,480
Well...

437
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,960
who else could it be?

438
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,510
I can repeat

439
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,510
some of the words,

440
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,960
but there are some other words I just can't repeat.

441
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,550
She...

442
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
They were together,

443
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,160
but others gossiped. Why?

444
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,640
Because

445
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,960
they didn't have marriage certificates.

446
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,460
That was why others gossiped.

447
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,430
People, you know...

448
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,720
Auntie, we already knew

449
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,680
about what you just said.

450
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,030
About Zhang Yulan,

451
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,720
is there anything else

452
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,440
you want to tell us?

453
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,470
Yulan is dead.

454
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,550
Yulan, you're dead,

455
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,960
yet someone's here

456
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,750
asking questions about you.

457
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,000
Whenever I think about it,

458
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,270
it breaks my heart.

459
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,790
Auntie, don't be too sad.

460
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,110
You lost a good friend.

461
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,830
We completely understand how you feel.

462
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,960
Have some water.

463
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,200
Captain Shen,

464
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,740
it's mealtime. Should I...

465
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,550
get you something?

466
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,440
Auntie,

467
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,200
it's mealtime.

468
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,680
Is there anything you want to eat?

469
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,830
I'll go get you some.

470
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,400
It's mealtime?

471
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,480
I... I don't want to trouble you.

472
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,680
I don't... don't want to trouble you.

473
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,720
I don't want to trouble you.

474
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,200
You are very busy.

475
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,200
Are you out

476
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,720
in the field more,

477
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,550
or do you spend more time

478
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,480
in the office?

479
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,080
Both are common.

480
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,500
Both are common?

481
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,830
Anyway, you need to eat on time.

482
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,290
Yes.

483
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,640
You can't work properly

484
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,290
if you don't eat well.

485
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,240
When I was young, I was like you.

486
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,480
I didn't eat on time.

487
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,110
I always...

488
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,350
skipped meals, so...

489
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,640
I wasn't in good health.

490
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,350
Now,

491
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,070
if I don't eat on time,

492
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,830
I get low blood sugar.

493
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,000
Right now, as I'm talking to you,

494
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,920
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

495
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,720
Then what would you like to eat?

496
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,400
Just tell me.

497
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,520
I'll go prepare it for you.

498
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,790
I'm not picky.

499
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,880
Actually, even a bowl

500
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,640
of instant noodles would make me happy.

501
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,030
Okay.

502
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,480
I'll get you a bowl of instant noodles.

503
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,640
According to the rules,

504
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,000
please cooperate and wear a mask.

505
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:42,720
Here.

506
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,480
Chun.

507
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,350
These two are

508
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,720
Zhang Yulan's son and daughter-in-law.

509
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,830
You need to be mentally prepared.

510
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,680
You can't step forward later.

511
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,240
Mom.

512
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,480
Mom!

513
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,240
Calm down.

514
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,790
Mom!

515
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,720
Mom.

516
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,750
Calm down.

517
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,510
Mom,

518
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,920
how did you get burned like this?

519
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,200
Mom!

520
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,960
Mom! I'm unfilial!

521
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,590
Mom!

522
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,510
Mom!

523
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,110
Mom!

524
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,240
Mom.

525
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,310
Young man,

526
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,680
is what I told you

527
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,400
useful?

528
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,110
Yes.

529
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,550
What you told me is very helpful

530
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,240
to our investigation.

531
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,270
That's good.

532
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,790
I've finished eating.

533
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,550
I feel much better now.

534
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,590
This reminds me of the old days

535
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,160
with Yulan.

536
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,640
When we were together,

537
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,510
I loved instant noodles.

538
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,060
We both loved instant noodles.

539
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,790
It's just that

540
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,550
this bowl

541
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,830
is really too small.

542
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,540
It's not enough to fill me up.

543
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,640
Auntie,

544
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,820
are you still hungry?

545
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,680
In that case, here,

546
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,710
you can eat mine.

547
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,440
Is it appropriate for me to eat your noodles?

548
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,670
It's fine, eat.

549
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,160
Captain Shen.

550
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,720
What's up?

551
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,680
Hao Chengcai and Wang Yingying

552
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,590
have completed the body identification.

553
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,840
They're ready for questioning.

554
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,550
So you...

555
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,070
I'm not finished here yet.

556
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,750
You go first.

557
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Hao Chengcai is here?

558
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,740
Yes. He came for routine questioning.

559
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,720
That guy...

560
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,270
Listen,

561
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,310
the son

562
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
of Yulan...

563
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,800
Auntie,

564
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,520
what about her son?

565
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,270
Her son...

566
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,510
I don't know what to say.

567
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,110
Listen,

568
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,270
actually, her son

569
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,400
and my son

570
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,640
grew up together.

571
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,070
Back then, people said her son

572
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,270
was very smart

573
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,720
and promising.

574
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,240
But over the years,

575
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,790
I haven't seen him amount to much.

576
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,110
He's grown up,

577
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
but I don't think he's all that great.

578
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,160
Still, he's a guy working for someone.

579
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,790
Last time,

580
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Yulan told me

581
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,150
her son is a leader,

582
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:32,880
and his suits

583
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
are tailor-made.

584
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,920
Although they are tailor-made,

585
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,200
they... they're still suits.

586
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,790
In my opinion, her son is wasteful.

587
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,480
He insisted on

588
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,200
buying a...

589
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,240
A brooch?

590
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:42,920
Yes.

591
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,480
All shiny and dangling.

592
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,590
It cost a lot of money.

593
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,310
My son and I...

594
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
My son is practical.

595
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,580
I'm telling you,

596
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,270
I think her son is wasteful.

597
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,440
Take... Take a look.

598
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,240
Look.

599
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,160
My son is more practical.

600
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,000
My son

601
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,480
works at... at the neighborhood committee.

602
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,240
He also... He also...

603
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,480
serves over 100 people.

604
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,240
On every festive occasion,

605
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,200
my son always brings me eggs,

606
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,830
noodles,

607
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,480
and milk.

608
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,030
It's so practical.

609
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,590
Tell us about your

610
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,440
basic information.

611
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,640
My name is Hao Chengcai.

612
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,550
I currently work at a foreign company

613
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,960
as a sales director.

614
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,350
I admit

615
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,070
I...

616
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,590
I didn't pay enough attention

617
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,750
to my family,

618
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
especially my mother.

619
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,640
But I've been too busy with work.

620
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,830
I manage a small team

621
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,310
of dozens of people.

622
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,200
But I told my mother

623
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,110
more than once

624
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,680
that she should

625
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
move in with us.

626
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,920
The house is big enough.

627
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,070
There's plenty of room.

628
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,590
But...

629
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,830
But she just wouldn't agree.

630
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,310
She said...

631
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,830
She said she was used to living

632
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,790
in the old house.

633
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,880
She was worried she wouldn't be able to adjust if she moved.

634
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,720
If...

635
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,270
If she had listened to me,

636
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,030
this wouldn't have happened,

637
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,270
right?

638
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,790
And her daughter-in-law.

639
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,160
Her daughter-in-law

640
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,720
is all about living the high life.

641
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,310
She drinks bird's nest soup every day.

642
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,440
Two bottles a day.

643
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,590
But I've never seen her

644
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,400
give... give any

645
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,640
to Yulan.

646
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,680
Besides,

647
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,640
bird's... bird's nest soup is not a substitute for a meal.

648
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,000
In my opinion, bird's nest soup

649
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,350
isn't as practical as instant noodles.

650
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,510
If I... If I eat this,

651
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,400
what should you eat?

652
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,030
It's okay.

653
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,200
I'll make another bowl for myself.

654
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,030
You need to eat, young man.

655
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,160
Then how

656
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,720
did you all get along

657
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,270
in the family?

658
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,310
My mother raised me

659
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,590
by herself.

660
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,270
So I was very close

661
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,270
to my mother.

662
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,880
Even my son,

663
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,000
Tianyou.

664
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,310
Tianyou's grandmother

665
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,030
was his favorite.

666
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,030
I got along well with Mother too.

667
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,920
We lived together.

668
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,240
What about Ying Youchang?

669
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,480
I rarely saw him.

670
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:10,480
Him?

671
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,830
I rarely

672
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,000
visited the old house,

673
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,680
so...

674
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,400
I was not close to him.

675
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,510
Did your mother

676
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,160
have enemies?

677
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,240
Or

678
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,200
did she have conflicts

679
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,270
with anyone?

680
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,160
No.

681
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,830
Absolutely not.

682
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,720
My mother was

683
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,720
always easygoing.

684
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,880
She was very kind to everyone.

685
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,680
All the neighbors here know that.

686
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,960
You can ask around.

687
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,720
What did you do last night?

688
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,030
Did you contact

689
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,680
your mother?

690
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,550
Do you know

691
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,510
what happened at home?

692
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,350
Auntie,

693
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,680
last night,

694
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,880
why didn't I see you at the scene?

695
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,480
I was sleeping.

696
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,000
There were fire alarms

697
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,510
and police sirens going off last night.

698
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,510
Your sleep quality

699
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,400
is pretty good.

700
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,640
Let me tell you.

701
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
As soon as

702
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,830
I get into bed

703
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,310
and my head hits the pillow,

704
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,550
I can fall asleep

705
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,110
within three minutes.

706
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,590
I sleep straight through until morning.

707
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,590
That's great.

708
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,920
This morning,

709
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,590
I heard my husband telling my son

710
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,200
something happened.

711
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,110
My... My son cooperated

712
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,590
with your investigation today, right?

713
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,160
Yesterday at the neighborhood committee,

714
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,240
that was your son?

715
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,240
Is he handsome?

716
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,750
He's as tall as you.

717
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,030
This is the restored surveillance footage

718
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,070
from 10:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.

719
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,750
Take a look.

720
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,160
Auntie,

721
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,750
I need to take another look at your photo.

722
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,480
Auntie, continue eating.

723
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,680
Captain Shen.

724
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,240
Danggui,

725
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:35,790
where's Hao Chengcai?

726
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,480
He left.

727
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,960
Come with me to stop him.

728
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,200
What's wrong, Captain Shen?

729
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,960
At 10 p.m. last night,

730
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,640
the person who went to the victims' house

731
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,470
was Hao Chengcai.

732
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,350
He already told us.

733
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:46,500
[Criminal Investigation Division of Binxi Branch Bureau of the Beixun Municipal Public Security Bureau]

734
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,430
Look.

735
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,380
[Inquiry notes]

736
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,070
[Actually, I went to see my mom at 10 p.m. last night.]

737
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,030
Actually, last night,

738
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,110
I went to see my mom.

739
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,550
It was...

740
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,590
around 10 p.m.

741
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,000
What for?

742
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,240
Nothing.

743
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,070
I hadn't seen her for a long time,

744
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,200
so I went to check on her.

745
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,670
But during the visit,

746
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,310
we got into an argument.

747
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,030
I quarreled with my mom,

748
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,790
so I didn't stay long.

749
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,920
I left...

750
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,510
at around

751
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,550
10:30 p.m.

752
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,360
Young man.

753
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,720
Yu... Yulan wasn't burned

754
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,070
to death, was she?

755
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,400
Was she murdered by someone?

756
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,200
Auntie,

757
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,880
we can't disclose

758
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,000
details of the case.

759
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,590
But please rest assured,

760
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,750
we will give you

761
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,440
an explanation.

762
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,960
Has the video been sent?

763
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,110
Yes.

764
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,000
I sent it as soon as the restoration was done.

765
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,460

00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,160
Are you okay, He Xi?

958
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,750
Thanks.

959
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,320
You'd better go home.

960
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,630
Go straight.

961
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,360
Take the first right.

962
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,360
The main gate is at the end.

963
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,440
Xu Heng.

964
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,250
This is the left side.

966
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:29,940
Captain Shen,

967
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,590
I've restored

968
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,550
another half hour of the video.

969
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,320
I've sent it to your email.

970
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,630
Thank you, Mao Mao.

976
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,880
[Actually, I went to see my mom at 10 p.m. last night.]

977
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,500
Danggui.

978
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,860
Captain Shen.

979
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,360
Go bring Hao Chengcai in

980
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,230
for questioning.

981
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,270
Yes.

982
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,710
Officer Shen,

983
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,760
why did you call me here

984
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,880
again today?

985
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:23,990
Tell us

986
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,850
about your movements last night.

987
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,070
I already

988
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,880
told you once, right?

989
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,800
Why do I have to repeat it?

990
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:31,920
We need to

991
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,110
go over the details again.

992
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,630
Okay.

993
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,000
Last night,

994
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,530
around 10 p.m.,

995
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,630
I arrived at my mother's house.

996
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,670
Then

997
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,280
something unpleasant happened.

998
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,400
My mother and I

999
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,550
got into an argument.

1000
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,960
I didn't stay long,

1001
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,440
and then I left.

1002
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,000
What time did you leave?

1003
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,030
Around 10:30 p.m.

1004
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,670
On my way back,

1005
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,550
I was in a bad mood.

1006
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,190
So I...

1007
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,480
wanted to smoke.

1008
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,550
But at that time,

1009
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,710
almost all the shops on the street were closed.

1010
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,150
I found...

1011
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,320
a 24-hour convenience store.

1012
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Do you remember what time

1013
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,030
you got to the convenience store?

1014
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,960
A little past

1015
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,550
11:10 p.m., I...

1016
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,710
I think.

1017
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,920
If you don't believe me,

1018
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,840
you can check the convenience store's surveillance footage.

1019
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Everything I said is true.

1020
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,320
Do you smoke often?

1021
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,550
Not really.

1022
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:36,800
I only smoke

1023
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,710
when I'm upset.

1024
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,110
So I usually don't carry cigarettes with me.

1025
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,230
I buy them when I want to smoke.

1026
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,360
Now let's do this.

1027
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,960
Recount your movements

1028
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,880
last night

1029
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,670
in reverse order.

1030
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,480
Why?

1031
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,760
I told you

1032
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,400
we need to go over the details again.

1033
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,480
Please cooperate.

1034
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:57,550
Okay.

1035
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,840
I wanted to smoke,

1036
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,360
so I went to the convenience store to buy cigarettes.

1037
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,280
It was very late at that time.

1038
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,150
And before that?

1039
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,550
Before that, I was in my car.

1040
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,150
I was driving,

1041
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,550
and then... I went back to my mom's house.

1042
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,840
Then I saw...

1043
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,800
What did you see?

1044
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:19,840
Nothing.

1045
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,360
I'm asking you what you saw.

1046
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,440
I didn't see anything.

1047
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,190
A slip of the tongue.

1048
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,110
It was a slip of the tongue.

1049
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,440
You did see something, didn't you?

1050
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,880
How far is the convenience store

1051
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,840
from your house?

1052
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,550
A few kilometers.

1053
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,320
It's roughly halfway between my house

1054
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,510
and my mother's house.

1055
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,800
It's a 30-minute drive from

1056
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,030
Zhang Yulan's house to yours.

1057
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,000
You said the convenience store is in the middle.

1058
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,320
That means it's a 15-minute drive

1059
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,440
from Zhang Yulan's house

1060
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,360
to the convenience store.

1061
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,000
You left

1062
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,030
Zhang Yulan's house at 10:30 p.m.,

1063
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,840
but you arrived at

1064
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
the convenience store after 11:10 p.m.

1065
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,070
It was supposed to be a 15-minute drive,

1066
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,400
but it took you over 40 minutes.

1067
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,280
What did you do

1068
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,830
during that half-hour?

1069
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,590
You don't remember?

1070
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,280
Here,

1071
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,870
let me show you something.

1072
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,360
Take a good look.

1073
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,710
You saw your mother's house was on fire.

1074
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,150
Did you think I couldn't see you because

1075
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,000
you were hiding in the crowd?

1076
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,840
Why did you lie before?

1077
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,070
Yes.

1078
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,670
I did go back.
