This explains why

227
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,320
the murderer was so certain

that Zhen Boshi would spray a large amount of ethanol.

ruled as an accident.

248

Since Shen Yi

249
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,330
was the one in charge,

and with public pressure mounting at the time,

251
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,230
in the end, Shen Yi resigned.

573
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,720
Shouldn't I make

574
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,150
full use of this opportunity?

575
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,640
And

576
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,210
it'd be great if he really targets me.

577
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,640
That way,

578
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,550

579
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,300
escape unscathed

580
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
under police protection.

581
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,960
I could also have my

582
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,620
news material.

583
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,960
And the police could establish

584
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,900
a positive public image.

585
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,960
It's a win-win situation,

586
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,640
isn't it?

587
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,000
First of all, we

588
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,000
don't need you

589

to help us establish our image.

590

Second,

591
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,990
even if you get first-hand information,

592
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,370
for the sake of case confidentiality,

593
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,800
you can't publish it.

594
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,060
Third,

595
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,830
my personal advice is

596
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,870
you'd better stay here.

597
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,450

598

599

600
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,160
to restrict my personal freedom, right?

601
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,970
We will assign someone to protect you.

602
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,740
Please cooperate with us.

603
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,000
Okay.

604
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,020
As long as I can go out to work,

605
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,670
I'll cooperate however you need.

606
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,680
Danggui,

607
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,300
stay sharp.

608
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,720
Make sure nothing happens to Hu Xie.

609
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,870
Contact me anytime if anything happens.

610
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,350
Okay.

611
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,760
Pull up the surveillance footage

612
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,440

613
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,110
Okay.

614
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,350
Rather than Hu Xie, I'm more worried Shen Yi

615
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,300
would go after

616
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,670
the target we don't know.

617
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,660
Because from Shen Yi's perspective,

618
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,200
he believes he did nothing wrong back then,

619
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,350
and someone framed him.

620
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,750

We've been checking city-wide surveillance footage,

but we haven't found any trace of Shen Yi so far.

769
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,570
Could it be...

770
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,300
our security measures are too tight,

771
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,950
making it impossible for him to make a move,

772
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,440
so he's been lying low?

773
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,530
It's a good thing he's not making a move.

813

to come home

815
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,730
and turn himself in.

816
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,710

817

And unexpectedly,

818
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,650
he started killing the next day.

00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,020
what's your opinion?

00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,150
I checked the cemetery's surveillance footage.

822
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,740
He wrote those words on the tombstone

823

824
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,080
It was also on the night of the day

825
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,030
you published the article to look for him.

826
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,680
I think the timing was

827
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,630
too coincidental.

828
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,710
Do you think

829
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,200
when he has nowhere left to run,

830
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,340
he would want to see you one last time?

832
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,680
No.

833
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,830
After he escaped,

834
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,810
he tried very hard

835
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,960
to stay hidden.

836
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,890
But suddenly,

837
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,840
he began killing in a high-profile manner.

838
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,880

839

was the same as giving it to you,

Help!

951
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,480
Help! Is anyone here?

952
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,030
Someone! Help!

953
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,290
You're awake.

954
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,050
Bro!

955
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,360
I know your rules.

956
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,940
I won't look at your face.

957
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,900
I won't ask for your name either!

958
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,010
Just tell me how much money you want!

959
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,230
Let me go!

960
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,080
And we can work something out!

961
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,010
You submitted the documents, didn't you?

962
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,800
What do you mean?

963
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,500
Have you got the wrong person?

964
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,390
What documents? I don't know anything about that!

965
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,460
Stop playing dumb.

966
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,790
Besides you, no one else

967
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,780
has access to those things.

Static electricity can cause fires.

971
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,380
Autumn and winter are dry seasons,

972
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,980
and static electricity is everywhere.

973
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:34,080
During these seasons, try to choose clothes made from natural fibers,

974
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,560
such as cotton and linen.

975
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,260
Wash your hands frequently, drink plenty of water,

976
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:39,990
and keep your skin moisturized.

977
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,240
Maintain indoor humidity

978
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:43,630
to prevent static electricity.

979
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,360
When refueling, park and turn off the engine.

980
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,150
Touch a metal surface to release static before fueling.

981
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,360
Keep the fuel nozzle inside the tank while fueling

982
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,550
to reduce fuel vapor during the process.

983
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,640
Avoid getting in and out of the car while refueling,

984
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,590
and refrain from making phone calls.
