[Episode 16]

3
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,360
Dad.

4
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,280
You scared me to death.

5
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,840
Well, why aren’t you sleeping late at night?

6
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,310
Instead, you sit here.

7
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,500
Say something.

8
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,320
What's wrong, Dad?

9
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,510
I... last night...

10
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,280
I was working overtime.

11
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,960
After I came back,

12
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,810
I went to take a shower.

13
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,590
When I came back after showering,

14
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,540
I just lay down and fell asleep.

15
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,960
I... I forgot to drink it.

16
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,870
Dad.

17
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,110
Please don't take it to heart.

18
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,850
The team has been

19
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,010
quite busy lately.

20
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,630
We've formed a

21
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,750
quick response team

22
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,190
with the fire investigation department.

23
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,800
Now we have so many cases

24
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,960
piling up on our hands.

25
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,560
After I came home after work,

26
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,360
I sat in your room,

27
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,870
and saw this spoiled milk.

28
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,510
This is the first time

29
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,760
since you were little

30
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,510
that you didn't drink.

31
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,590
My child has grown up.

32
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,630
Don't wash it.

33
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,400
I've already washed it.

34
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,640
The things Dad can do for you

35
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,620
are getting fewer and fewer.

36
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,130
This...

37
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,240
What's wrong with this?

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,120
The TV is broken too.

39
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,620
Oh, right.

40
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,840
That new house you bought,

41
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,380
the furniture is almost all set up.

42
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,920
You should move in when you're ready.

43
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,300
Dad, don't say that.

44
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,550
I bought that house for you.

45
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,330
Besides,

46
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,870
you've been taking care of me

47
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,590
since I was little.

48
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,150
If I were to leave you,

49
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,070
I could hardly do anything.

50
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,920
If we're going to move,

51
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,000
we'll go together.

52
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,770
Don't be angry with me, okay?

53
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,250
It's getting late.

54
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,210
Go wash up and get some sleep.

55
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,100
Last time I went to your house,

56
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,000
I saw your childhood drawings.

57
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,820
They were quite good.

58
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,100
Why did you stop drawing when you grew up,

59
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,100
instead, you became a police officer instead?

60
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,390
When I was little, I liked to draw.

61
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,750
But that doesn’t mean I’ll do it

62
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,040
when I grow up, right?

63
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,610
I want to be a police officer in the future.

You're not joking with me, are you?

70
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,510
He Xi.

71
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,510

72
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,920
is He Xi?

73
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,450
How I grew up

74
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,600
is very clear in my mind.

75
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,900
My father is Shen Yi.

76
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,500
My name is Shen Ye.

77
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,860
Remember that.

78
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,270
His current life path is wrong.

79
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,190
We need to get him back

80
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,260
on the right path.

81
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,510
He doesn't need you

82
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,450
to make choices for him.

83
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,600
Whether his life path is wrong or not,

84
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,490
it's not for you to judge.

85
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,200
You don't have any evidence to prove

86
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,270
that the current life

87
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,690
is harmful to Shen Ye.

88
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,360

Why don't you go sit down for a while?

00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,550

What's your name?

144
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,080
My name is Wang Yuqian.

145
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,280
The "Qian" in my name is written with a grass radical on top.

146

The "You" is the same as in "have."

150

Do you remember what happened during the incident?

00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,020
Well...

152
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,910
I was cooking in the kitchen at that time.

153
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,900
Everything was in chaos.

154
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,370
I can't remember clearly.

155
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,970
When I turned around,

156

the oil pan had already caught fire.

157
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,700

I don't know.

161
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,190
Were you alone in the kitchen at that time?

162
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,360
Yes, just me.

163
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,410
Does your kitchen have an outside window?

164
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,720

168
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,800
is an exterior wall of the factory.

And it was already night,

170
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,330
how could anyone have passed by?

171
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,000

No.

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,960
My husband and I

175
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,670
are both honest and straightforward people.

176
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,500

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,680
we just run

a small business.

179
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,690
And those who come to our place

180
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,670
to eat are mostly

181
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,070

182
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,870

that when the fire broke out,

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,300
you were alone in the kitchen.

188

00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, at that time,

191
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,580
I was actually already outside.

192
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,840
It's just that my phone

the exact point of origin right now,

303

The owner stopped her,

315
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,400
and ended up trapped inside.

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,080
That's basically consistent with what Wang Yuqian said.

00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
There seemed to be a strange noise.

331

It sounded like thunder.

332
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,320
But I'm not sure.

333
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,160
It was muffled.

334
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,920
Was it before or after the fire started?

335
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,350
I just asked them.

336
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,360
They weren't sure either.

337
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,680

before the fire started,

519
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,200
someone at the scene heard

520
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,200
a strange sound.

521
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
Plus, the point of origin

522
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,550
was clearly near the kitchen.

523
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,110
So I inspected the electrical panel

524

outside the kitchen

525
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,310
and found a wire

connected to the restaurant.

527
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,260
This wire was illegally connected,

528
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,030

that at the time of the incident, it was like this:

This illegally connected wire

532
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,090
short-circuited, causing the fire.

533
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,580
The sound that someone heard at the scene

534
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,460
was the sound of the wire short-circuiting.

536
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,660
spread to the restaurant,

537
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,750
and then along the wire,

538
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,410
burned our electrical panel.

539
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,310
This is the molten bead I found

540
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,490
at the electrical panel.

541
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,180
The results show it's a secondary molten bead,

indicating that our electrical panel

was burned after the fire started.

that the lightning rods were not struck.

on the fused beads and remanent magnetization.

557
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,310
However, the results

558

you can also compare

Adviser Xu,

571
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,440
we can't just pity or favor the couple

572
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
from the small restaurant

573
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,750
simply because they are

574
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,290
a vulnerable group.

575
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,610
We are the real victims here.

576
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,260
The workers in our factory,

577
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,020
they are also vulnerable groups.

578
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,590
You can't turn a blind eye

579
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,750
to our losses, right?

580
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,440
You just said the cause of the fire

581
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,600
was illegal electrical wiring?

582
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,370
That's correct.

583
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,840
First,

584
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,000
the sound of a short circuit

585
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,510
wouldn't be loud enough

586
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,830
for everyone dining here to hear.

587
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:35,800
Second,

588
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,390
a short circuit

589
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,090
would definitely produce a primary molten bead.

590
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,480
Did you find any at the scene?

591
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,700
Adviser Xu is not an outsider.

592
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,910
The scene was burned,

593
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,030
not finding all the molten beads

594
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,070
is a normal situation.

595
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:46,720
So you don't have

596
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,980
direct evidence to prove

597
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,160
that illegal wiring and short circuit

598
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,200
was the cause of the fire, right?

599
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,400
The factory's electrical panel

600
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,880
was destroyed after the fire started.

601
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,270
The restaurant's wiring was illegally connected.

602
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,270
Other sources of ignition

603
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,030
have all been ruled out.

604
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,240
This can fully constitute

605
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:57,750
the cause of the fire accident.

606
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,590
Other causes of the fire

607
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,680
have not been completely ruled out.

608
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,240
What you've ruled out

609
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,260
is only the electrical panel.

610
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,350
So your earlier conclusion

611
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,440
that illegal wiring and short circuit

612
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,310
was the cause of the fire

613
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,250
cannot be established.

614
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,480
We cannot issue a report.

615
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,350

616
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,380
trying to delay?

617
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,250
Don't forget,

618
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,220
the longer this drags on,

619
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,770
the greater the factory's losses will be.

620
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,400
Your momentary impulse

621
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,720

Only discovering the truth

629

This is an indisputable fact.

642
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,130
In any case,

643
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,790

for a case like ours,

672
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,880
how much would it cost for a full recovery?

673
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,030
That would depend on

00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,430
the specific circumstances.

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,830

the exact amount

A qualified power strip should have 3C certification marked on the packaging.

951
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,100
It should also feature safety shutters on the sockets

952
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,330
and a thickened power cord with clear markings.

953
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,880
These designs help prevent safety hazards

954
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:15,810
such as poor contact,

955
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,720
children accidentally touching live wires, and overheating.

956
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,650
If a power strip at home shows signs of damage or aging,

957
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,310
stop using it immediately and replace it with a new one.
