the origin of the fire

195
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,000
Keep pressing on it.

196
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,510
Nurse!

197
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:09,530
[Emergency Room]

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,740
Nurse!

199
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,590
Nurse!

200
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,070
What's wrong?

201
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,870
Just now,

202
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,000
when I removed the needle for my son,

203
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,980
it bled a little.

204
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,910
Could you take a look?

205
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,610
Okay.

206
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,620
It has been confirmed that

207
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,760
those items

208
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,550
are the remnants of drug manufacturing equipment.

209
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,550
And they appear to be quite old,

210
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,120
instead of coming into use recently.

211
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,260
Eighteen years ago,

212
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,360
when anti-drug efforts were intensified,

213
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,320
we once

214
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,480
seized a batch of

215
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
drugs of unknown origins

216
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,390
and arrested several drug dealers.

217
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,080
A year ago,

218
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,670
we discovered a batch drugs

219
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,170
that were very similar to

220
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,740
those from 18 years ago,

221
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,420
as the P2P Drug-Making Method was used in both cases.

222
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,460
We kept investigating the source,

223
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,100
but after a period of investigation,

224
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,780
the clue suddenly hit a dead end.

225
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,790
Until recently,

226
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,750
it has started to appear again.

227
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,560
While we were trying our best to investigate it,

228
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,910
we didn't expect that something like this would happen.

229
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,790
So you mean

230
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,600
the source might be right here?

231
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:00,940
Most likely.

232
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,030
The drugs found at the scene

233
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,460
are slightly different

234
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,710
from traditional meth.

235
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,990
The final products are blue crystals,

236
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,190
instead of white powder.

237
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,580
And the suspected drugs found at the scene

238
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,600
are blue crystalline powder exactly.

239
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,030
Of course,

240
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,600
we'll have to wait for the composition analysis

241
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,810
and the identification report to be finished

242
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,730
before drawing any conclusions.

243
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,600
However...

244
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,280
Do you think there are any other issues?

245
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,510
Based on the pit at the scene,

246
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,390
where the equipment was found,

247
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
its surroundings didn't have

248
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,870
the proper conditions for drug production.

249
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,210
It was obvious that

250
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,000
the criminals were just

251
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,490
temporarily storing the equipment there.

252
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,670
We have to find

253
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,080
the actual drug manufacturing site.

254
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,940
[No smoking]

255
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,410
I know.

256
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,340
Come with me.

257
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,360
Captain Wang,

258
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,790
in this basement,

259
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,030
an advanced waste gas

260
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,450
treatment system has been adopted.

261
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,510
What's more,

262
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,240
suspicious water storage tanks

263
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,590
have been found in the factory.

264
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,530
In such a factory,

265
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,120
such a good device system

266
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,130
was used to deal with waste gas.

267
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,050
It's like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

268
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,690
Now it looks like

269
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,810
this basement is fully equipped with

270
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,750
the conditions for drug production.

271
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,340
Three months ago,

272
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,270
Ducheng Processing Factory

273
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,390
attracted a lightning strike due to

274
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,760
abnormal electricity consumption.

275
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,550
The lightning struck a small restaurant nearby.

276
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,090
During our investigation,

277
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,200
we discovered a batch of

278
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,950
cryptocurrency mining machines.

279
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,960
Now it looks like

280
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,210
that was just a smokescreen

281
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,060
created by the criminals.

282
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,750
Their real purpose

283
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,190
was drug production.

284
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,290
The factory director

285
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,270
is a major suspect.

286
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,260
The factory director is called Gao Weiyuan.

287
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,920
He was suspected of stealing state electricity

288
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,360
and was criminally detained.

289
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,800
He was also dismissed from his post as factory director.

290
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,530
The one who took over the factory

291
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,530
was Han Jun, the president of the Han Group.

292
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,180
What is Gao Weiyuan's

293
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,590
current situation?

294
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,480
Not long ago, he was released after serving his sentence.

295
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,270
Then he just appeared at the explosion site again.

296
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,590
He's suspected of intentional homicide

297
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,710
and has been arrested by us.

298
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,440
Alright.

299
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,600
You guys can interrogate him first.

300
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,660
In this previous case,

301
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,630
did you find

302
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,790
any other suspicious individuals?

303
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,320
Oh, right.

304
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,720
There were two

305
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,140
workers guarding the mining machines

306
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,340
who behaved suspiciously.

307
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,550
They only worked at night.

308
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,690
They also had difficulty communicating due to the dialect.

309
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,220
We couldn't find these two people

310
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
in the factory's personnel list, either.

311
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,060
Now in terms of the situation,

312
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,540
I suspect that they're connected

313
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,580
to the drug production.

314
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,280
On the debris of the equipment,

315
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,380
we happened to find two sets of fingerprints.

316
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,970
Ask them to compare these fingerprints.

317
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,790
But one of them

318
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,270
was killed in the explosion.

319
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,630
Go arrest the other one at once.

320
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,590
Hand him over to the narcotics squad after you arrest him.

321
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,200
Yes.

322
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,900
You can go with them.

323
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,730
Now there's still one issue

324
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,790
which I can't figure out all this time.

325
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,440
When we were searching

326
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,120
the factory,

327
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,740
we didn't find that pit.

328
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,080
Its hidden location was one of the reasons.

329
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,460
The other reason was that at that time,

330
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,270
there was no sign showing that

331
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,040
they had dug a new pit.

332
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,230
Just think about it.

333
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,660
With so much soil,

334
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,880
how did they dispose of it?

335
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,550
We implemented strict surveillance back then.

336
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,510
They couldn't have

337
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,120
moved the soil away

338
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,450
right under our noses, could they?

339
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,870
But I couldn't find

340
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,330
this soil in the factory, either.

341
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,620
However, this pit was undoubtedly newly dug.

342
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,160
Up until now,

343
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,150
I still can't determine

344
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:33,720
when this pit

345
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,770
was actually dug.

346
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,180
And how did they manage to

347
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,320
do that while hiding it

348
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,000
from us?

349
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,010
Oh, by the way, Wang...

350
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,510
Your previous clue

351
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,240
suddenly hit a dead end.

352
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,320
When did that happen roughly?

353
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,420
Half a year ago.

354
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,760
That matches up.

355
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,290
A year ago,

356
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,550
Han Kun, the head of the Han Group

357
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,400
and the master of the family,

358
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,940
suddenly died of an illness.

359
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,480
Then the Han Group

360
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,440
was handed over to his eldest son, Han Pei.

361
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,510
Half a year ago,

362
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,800
Han Pei died on the spot in a car accident.

363
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,440
Then the Han Group

364
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,230
was handed over to his twin brother,

365
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,050
Han Jun.

366
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,410
A year ago, when Han Pei

367
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,790
took over the factory,

368
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,480
drug trafficking began.

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,790
Half a year ago, when Han Pei died,

370
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,030
the drugs disappeared.

371
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,340
This indicates that

372
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,950
Han Pei

373
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,390
is probably the actual controller

374
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,330
of the drug production.

375
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,090
But three months ago,

376
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,340
the drugs reappeared.

377
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,590
After Han Pei's death,

378
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,080
who exactly

379
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,730
restarted the drug production line?

380
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,830
How deeply is Gao Weiyuan

381
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,060
involved in this?

382
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,020
And is Han Jun

383
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,910
aware of it?

384
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,270
I'll go meet this Han Jun first.

385
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,320
Alright.

386
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,140
Han Jun.

387
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,310
Currently, you're directly

388
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,300
in charge of the factory.

389
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:06,970
Right?

390
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,790
That's right. I'm in charge of it now.

391
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,349
Officers,

392
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,000
I'd like to know

393
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,200
why my factory

394
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,200
suddenly exploded.

395
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,480
I was just about to sell it.

396
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,550
With this explosion,

397
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,510
my losses are really substantial.

398
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,839
Alright, alright.

399
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,920
I'm the one asking you questions,

400
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,150
not the other way around.

401
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,560
Now it's not about money anymore.

402
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,569
Your factory was manufacturing drugs.

403
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,640
Do you know that?

404
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,480
What did you say?

405
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,200
Manufacturing drugs?

406
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,450
Alright.

407
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,270
Stop pretending.

408
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,830
I don't believe that

409
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,880
you know nothing about it.

410
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,990
Officers,

411
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,750
for such a serious matter,

412
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,230
you need to provide evidence when making accusations.

413
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,920
I've just come back from abroad.

414
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,350
I really don't know anything about this.

415
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,690
Moreover, I don't understand

416
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,830
what exactly you want to ask about

417
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,510
by summoning me here.

418
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,510
This is quite a coincidence indeed.

419
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,810
Look. As soon as you came back,

420
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,770
Han Pei died.

421
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,240
You wanted to sell the factory,

422
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,410
and then the factory was blown up.

423
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,550
All these critical moments

424
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,770
were encountered by you, right?

425
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,450
You're aware of the situation.

426
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,310
I was also at the scene on the day of the car accident.

427
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,610
I was so lucky that I escaped death.

428
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,420
Then speaking of this factory,

429
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,890
since I was going to sell it,

430
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,440
why would I blow it up?

431
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,720
By turning it into ruins,

432
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,790
what benefits would I get?

433
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,810
In both of these incidents,

434
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,590
I'm the victim.

435
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,250
That's right.

436
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,910
From a common-sense perspective,

437
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,470
when a normal person tries to hurt others,

438
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,790
he wouldn't hurt himself in the process.

439
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,310
Right?

440
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,220
However, as the saying goes,

441
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,880
high risks bring high rewards.

442
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,920
I think you understand that better than I do, right?

443
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,170
Now that your brother is dead,

444
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,130
the Han Group, such a large corporation,

445
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,750
has fallen into your hands.

446
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,720
That counts as a high reward, doesn't it?

447
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,590
Whether it's high or not,

448
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,110
I really haven't considered it.

449
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,840
You can investigate it.

450
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,240
So far, regarding the Han Group's

451
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,550
assets which I've sold,

452
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,070
not a single penny

453
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,590
has been transferred to my personal account.

454
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,480
Alright.

455
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,520
We'll investigate that.

456
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,480
Now let's continue to talk about

457
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,500
what happened to the factory.

458
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,070
On the surface,

459
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,640
the factory was blown up,

460
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,560
and you suffered losses.

461
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,550
But don't forget this.

462
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,610
This was a drug manufacturing factory.

463
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,130
So, doesn't it mean that we can't

464
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,400
use normal logic

465
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,130
to analyze this matter?

466
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,770
Of course,

467
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,160
I'm not saying that the factory

468
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,380
was definitely blown up by you.

469
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,920
But don't I have the right

470
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,790
to suspect that you know

471
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,070
about the drug production?

472
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,800
You might even have been involved in it.

473
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,420
Right?

474
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,640
I can

475
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,240
responsibly tell you that

476
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,090
I don't know about it.

477
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,750
Currently, the prime suspect for the drug production

478
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,880
is your brother.

479
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,480
Are you really completely unaware of this?

480
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,030
Han Pei was making drugs?

481
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,900
How could he possibly be involved with drugs?

482
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,020
Our mother died because of drugs!

483
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,750
Mind your emotions.

484
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,520
I'm sorry.

485
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,920
We didn't know that your mother

486
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,920
had died because of drugs.

487
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,740
I've just told you that

488
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,640
I left home to go abroad when I was 18.

489
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,350
The reason was that I hated this

490
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,030
family that killed my mother.

491
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,850
As far as I can remember,

492
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,880
my parents were on bad terms

493
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,960
with each other.

494
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,830
I felt that my father

495
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,200
just forcibly kept my mother

496
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,510
by his side.

497
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,790
And my mother

498
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,960
told me more than once,

499
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,130
"Kid,

500
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,160
if it weren't for the fact that

501
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,400
I had you and Han Pei at that time,

502
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,640
I would have died long ago."

503
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,160
She hated my father.

504
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,450
Later, I suspected that

505
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,070
my father was giving her drugs

506
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,750
in order to control her.

507
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,250
But I had no evidence!

508
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,250
However, I never expected that

509
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,970
Han Pei would actually make drugs.

510
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,080
Then why didn't you

511
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,270
tell on him at that time?

512
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,520
I was still a child back then.

513
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,380
And that was my mother.

514
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,170
So after you became an adult,

515
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,880
the first thing you did

516
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,910
was choosing to leave this family?

517
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,610
That's right.

518
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,970
For me, this family

519
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,820
is just a nightmare.

520
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,110
I stayed abroad for so many years

521
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,220
without coming back.

522
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,280
And I don't want to know

523
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,880
anything about the Han Group.

524
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,920
It has nothing to do with me.

525
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,140
I'm not interested, either.

526
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,480
But if I had known that

527
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,550
Han Pei was selling drugs,

528
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,720
I would've been the first one to tell on him.

529
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,780
[Take the medicine in time]

530
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,270
With your current physical condition,

531
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,240
there's no rush to return to the team, right?

532
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,200
No rush.

533
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,490
I'd like to rest for a few more days.

534
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,440
I want to eat pork ribs. Could you make some?

535
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,530
Braised pork ribs?

536
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:02,520
[Take the medicine in time]

537
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,030
Stewed pork ribs.

538
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,510
Alright.

539
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,040
You're Li Si, right?

540
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,580
We're from the narcotics squad.

541
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,790
You're under arrest.

542
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,550
Behave yourself!

543
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,150
What are you doing?

544
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,890
Let's go.

545
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,070
Mom!

546
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,150
His working time

547
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,040
was contrary to others'.

548
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,190
He slept at home during the day

549
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,830
and only worked in the factory at night.

550
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,110
I once told him that

551
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,650
this was not good for his health.

552
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,480
He said he had no choice.

553
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,080
This was the factory's requirement.

554
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,620
In our family,

555
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,590
he was the only one

556
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,720
earning money to support us.

557
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,590
Now he's gone, too.

558
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,880
Have you ever seen

559
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,730
those things inside?

560
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,310
Do you know when they were bought?

561
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,480
I've never seen them before.

562
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,200
I don't know

563
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,240
when he bought them.

564
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,750
What's your family's

565
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,400
ordinary income?

566
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,590
What's Fan Yi's educational background?

567
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,240
Our income is only

568
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,590
enough to buy two meals a day.

569
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,030
He didn't receive much education,

570
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,590
and he's not well-educated.

571
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,590
The two of us

572
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,590
couldn't even ensure our son's education.

573
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,840
Recently, has Fan Yi

574
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,140
said anything special to you?

575
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,690
No, he hasn't.

576
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,050
Last night,

577
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,270
when he left,

578
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,480
he suddenly said something.

579
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,130
He said he didn't want his son

580
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,720
to be like him,

581
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,590
being stuck in the village for his entire life.

582
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,580
My mom contacted someone to

583
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,480
arrange this job for me.

584
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,820
The boss paid me wages,

585
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,070
so I worked for him.

586
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,790
I helped him make those

587
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,000
big hard blue candies.

588
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,830
Our boss was very mysterious.

589
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,910
He didn't tell us the secret formula.

590
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,920
He just told us to follow a few

591
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,370
steps to make the candies.

592
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,450
I'm not very smart,

593
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,200
so this was kind of

594
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,270
an easy job to me.

595
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,000
I didn't need to think much,

596
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
and there wasn't much technical difficulty.

597
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,860
Our boss did tell us

598
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,360
to wear more clothes to cover up ourselves well

599
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,310
when working.

600
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,290
Maybe it was for food safety.

601
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,070
In addition, our boss didn't often

602
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,540
come to check on our work.

603
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,350
We all thought that the boss

604
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,240
was just saying it casually,

605
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,310
so we didn't pay much attention.

606
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,030
Uncle Fan and I usually

607
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,550
didn't care much about these things.

608
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,270
Sometimes when working,

609
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,350
we just wore our own clothes

610
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,920
and shoes to do the job.

611
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,960
It didn't seem to make any difference.

612
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,360
Gao Weiyuan.

613
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:52,960
Here!

614
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,850
How long have you been out of prison?

615
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,640
Do you want to go to prison again?

616
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,860
Officers,

617
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,720
I'm innocent.

618
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,240
I really didn't do anything this time.

619
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,180
Really?

620
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:04,960
I remember that you said

621
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,960
the same thing last time.

622
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,750
Really?

623
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,400
I'm sorry.

624
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,860
I won't say that next time.

625
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,010
Alright. Let me ask you.

626
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,400
As a dismissed

627
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,750
former factory director,

628
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,550
why did you show up at the Ducheng Processing Factory

629
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,000
late at night instead of

630
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,550
sleeping at home?

631
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,650
Well, I have a temporary residence

632
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,140
in Ducheng Village.

633
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,960
I've been living there recently.

634
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,480
I couldn't sleep at night,

635
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,510
so I wanted to go to the factory

636
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,690
for a walk.

637
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,430
After all, I'm the former

638
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,270
director there.

639
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,260
I was reminiscing about

640
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,830
the time when I was the director.

641
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,340
Enough, Gao Weiyuan!

642
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,240
Just think about where

643
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,110
you are now.

644
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,570
Don't beat around the bush here.

645
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,960
Just tell me honestly.

646
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,410
Does the explosion at the Ducheng Processing Factory

647
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,400
have anything to do with you?

648
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,970
What does it have to do with me?

649
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,240
As you know,

650
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,200
I'm the former director.

651
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,430
If there's any problem

652
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,360
with the factory now,

653
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,440
you should go find Han Jun.

654
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,480
We should find Han Jun, huh?

655
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,000
Why did you run away at that time?

656
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,850
There was an explosion. I surely had to run away.

657
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
Well, what if I got injured

658
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,270
in the explosion?

659
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,030
Gao Weiyuan!

660
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,920
I could

661
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,030
arrest you in the factory

662
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,440
because I had gained

663
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,110
a lot of evidence.

664
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,070
I'll give you one last chance.

665
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,310
Answer me honestly.

666
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,140
Why did you go to the factory?

667
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,360
Speak!

668
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,610
Alright.

669
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,970
I'll tell you the truth.

670
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,580
I was...

671
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,020
I was following Fan Yi to the factory.

672
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,450
Why were you following him?

673
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,080
Wasn't I arrested by you before

674
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,240
because of mining?

675
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,480
I suspect that Fan Yi and his men were the ones

676
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,770
who told on me.

677
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,900
As I had fired them previously,

678
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,180
they told on me in order to

679
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,460
take revenge against me.

680
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,570
Isn't that right?

681
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,200
I followed him.

682
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,480
To be frank, I just wanted to kill him.

683
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,550
But that day,

684
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,850
I saw him acting suspiciously

685
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,960
and sneaking around.

686
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,130
He must have been up to no good.

687
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,520
So I thought that

688
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,930
I'd help you investigate it.

689
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,300
I wanted to make a contribution, too.

690
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,000
What did you find out?

691
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,240
Before I could find out about anything,

692
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,480
the explosion happened, didn't it?

693
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,430
Did that guy

694
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
get killed in the explosion?

695
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,150
He was killed in the explosion.

696
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,470
Look.

697
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,860
Evil deeds result in bad consequences.

698
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,300
Gao Weiyuan, stop pretending.

699
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,630
According to our investigation,

700
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,970
in the basement, it wasn't about

701
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,210
the mining machines at all.

702
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Their job

703
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,360
wasn't monitoring the mining machines, either.

704
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,190
It wasn't about the mining machines?

705
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,730
That's impossible.

706
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,130
When I discovered the basement,

707
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,440
there were only mining machines inside.

708
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,970
You can't ask me about this.

709
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,200
If you want to ask about it, go ask Fan Yi.

710
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,400
Oh, right. He's dead.

711
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,390
What a coincidence.

712
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:07,970
Gao Weiyuan.

713
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,710
Yes.

714
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,370
Considering the current situation of the factory,

715
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,330
you can't leave.

716
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,280
During your time at the public security bureau,

717
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,920
I hope that you can think carefully about whether

718
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,310
there's anything you haven't told us.

719
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,610
I'll be waiting for you anytime.

720
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,470
Sir,

721
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,470
don't worry.

722
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,920
I will absolutely cooperate with the government

723
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,020
and with the officers.

724
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:24,900
I'll think about it.

725
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,290
I'll think about it carefully.

726
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,680
I'll think about it day and night.

727
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,240
I'll do my best to think about it.

728
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,320
I'll think about it.

729
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,710
I'll think about it.

730
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,970
I'll keep thinking about it.

731
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,430
Then I might not be able to remember anything.

732
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,290
There are obvious contusions on the finger joints of both hands.

733
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,960
Some of the metacarpal bones have fractures.

734
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,440
The left lower leg has a comminuted fracture.

735
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,550
And the ends of these fractures

736
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,220
all have anterior cruciate ligaments.

737
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,220
They look very much like injuries caused by

738
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,750
forceful self-inflicted strikes against hard objects.

739
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,990
However, the fracture in the right leg

740
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,750
looks like it was caused by a strike from a heavy object.

741
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,040
His fatal wound

742
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,510
is only on the skull.

743
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,470
Ma'am.

744
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,110
Why don't you go take a rest?

745
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,760
I'm fine.

746
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,780
Let's freeze the corpse first.

747
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,690
What's wrong, Ma'am?

748
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,680
Just now, I already felt that

749
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,790
you were not in a good state today.

750
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,730
How about this?

751
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,830
You can go rest for a while.

752
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,060
I'll clean up this place.

753
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,180
I'm fine.

754
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,710
I just haven't eaten anything all day.

755
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,780
Could you go buy me something to eat?

756
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,270
Sure.

757
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,070
Then I'll go buy you something to eat.

758
00:30:59,190 --> 00:30:59,980
Just as usual?

759
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,480
Yes.

Is dinner not ready yet?

762
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,370
It'll be ready soon.

764
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,640

769
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,680
Is Danggui there?

770
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,450
Yes.

771
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,810
I found something.

772
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,130
Chun.

773
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,510
Fan Yi's finger joints of both hands

774
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,720
all have obvious contusions.

775
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,440
His left lower leg has a comminuted fracture.

776
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,410
We can deduce that

777
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,880
this injury was caused by forceful self-inflicted

778
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,400
strikes against hard objects.

779
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,170
This indicates that before his death, he had been

780
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,880
kicking and pounding on doors,

781
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,850
which was clearly

782
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,920
a behavior to seek survival.

783
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,100
Therefore,

784
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,870
it's impossible that he committed suicide for fear of punishment.

785
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,400
From the perspective of facts,

786
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,690
this corroborates our hypothesis.

787
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,400
Fan Yi wasn't the one who planted the bomb.

788
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,640
In the restaurant's fire case,

789
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,920
the narcotics police discovered that two men

790
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,060
always acted strangely at night.

791
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,880
They were actually responsible for

792
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,280
making drugs in the old basement.

793
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,310
But these two men

794
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,400
had received limited education,

795
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,030
so they only knew to

796
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,110
follow their boss's instructions.

797
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,230
They didn't even know that

798
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,270
they were making drugs.

799
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Moreover, Fan Yi's entire family

800
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,380
depended on him alone to make a living.

801
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,280
He had no reason

802
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,160
to blow himself up.

803
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,690
However, based on the bomb-making materials

804
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,440
found in Fan Yi's home,

805
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,110
Mao Mao has compared them

806
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,170
with the bomb fragments

807
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,830
found at the scene.

808
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,200
The result shows that they match.

809
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,850
This might be

810
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,790
a frame-up.

811
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:17,830
Based on the information

812
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,980
we currently have,

813
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,240
Gao Weiyuan is the most likely person

814
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,590
to have planted the bomb.

815
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,470
His motive was to kill them.

816
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,510
But as for the footprints

817
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,490
we collected at the scene,

818
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,300
we only found those of Adviser Xu and Fan Yi.

819
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,210
There's no evidence showing that

820
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,600
Gao Weiyuan entered the scene.

821
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,590
If Gao Weiyuan really moved

822
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,550

00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,800

the drug production,

826
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,350
and then used Bitcoin mining machines

827
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,390
to deceive everyone...

828
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,880
But we have no evidence,

829
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,240
and he's adamantly denying it.

830
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,130

to the lab for inspections.

849
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,220
They must be thoroughly inspected.

850
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,750
Be careful and don't miss anything.

851
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,880
The comparison results are out.

853
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,070
The footprints on the asphalt

854
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:42,880
belong to Gao Weiyuan.

855
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,880
The soil under the asphalt

856
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,960
indicates that Shen Ye's hypothesis

857
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,790
is correct.

858
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,930
With such big movements,

859
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,340
they couldn't have hidden it from the director,

860
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,180
Gao Weiyuan, while doing this secretly.

861
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,050
I'm surely he knew

the existence of this new pit.

Our previous work

865
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,990
might have had some oversights.

866

good morning.

870
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,370
How is it,

Director Gao?

872
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,510
Do you have anything to say?

873
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,730
To be honest with you,

874
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,080
last night,

875
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,320
I really thought about it for you.

876
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,230
I kept thinking about it.

877
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,040
Guess what?

878
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,110
As I was thinking about it,

879
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,630
I fell asleep.

880
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,750
I slept quite soundly, too.

881
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,510
Sir,

882
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
how was your sleep?

883
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,630
I didn't sleep very well actually.

884
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,150
Because I kept thinking about this.

885
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,000
How could someone who has done bad things

886
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,280
sleep so well without anxiety?

887
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,810
I've heard that you really

888
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,230
missed those days when you had been

889
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,470
the factory director, right?

890
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,460
You often went back there for a stroll.

891
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,460
You're familiar with this flower bed, huh?

892
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,460
Take a look.

893
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,050
What's the difference between these two photos?

894
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,640
Do you still think that

895
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,810
we don't know

896
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,850
how you transferred the equipment?

897
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,070
After the restaurant's fire accident,

898
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,630
you were actually quite worried that

899
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,040
we would investigate the factory.

900
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,550
Because we would discover

901
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,590
your drug-making equipment.

902
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:38,780
Right?

903
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,150
But at that time,

904
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,550
our surveillance of the factory was very strict.

905
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,080
You couldn't move it at all.

906
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,070
So you came up with a plan.

907
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,690
You dug a new pit overnight

908
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,250
and transferred the drug-making equipment

909
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,680
which had been in the basement originally.

910
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,470
Then you put the mining machines

911
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,750
in the basement

912
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,970
and scattered the soil from the new pit

913
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,480
over the flower bed.

914
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,480
You thought all of this

915
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,000
was flawless.

916
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,150
That was why you could

917
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,470
sleep so well without anxiety last night!

918
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:09,570
Am I right?

919
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,220
I don't understand

920
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,280
what you're saying.

921
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,260
What pit?

922
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,560
What equipment?

923
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,370
I don't know anything about them.

924
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,970
These are the tools we found

925
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,840
in the flower bed.

926
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,510
We did a trace analysis.

927
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,250
Your fingerprints are on them.

928
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,420
Moreover, we compared the soil

929
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,870
from the flower bed with the soil samples

930
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,730
from the explosion site.

931
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,160
They match perfectly.

932
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,070
So not only do you know about

933
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,930
the pit and the basement,

934
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,070
but you had also been there

935
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,000
before the explosion.

936
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,260
I don't know anything.

937
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,440
At the explosion site, we found these

938
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,440
one and a half shoeprints which belong to you.

939
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,460
Those are not my shoes.

940
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,160
Indeed, they're not your shoes.

941
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,780
They're Fan Yi's.

942
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,390
But you're the one who was wearing them.

943
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,150
Look.

944
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,900
About these one and a half shoeprints,

945
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,810
the heels are heavy but small in area

946
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,770
with obvious heavy pressure on the back edges of the heels.

947
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,070
But the foot arch area

948
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,050
doesn't show any pressure.

949
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,470
The edges of both sides of the shoe's sole

950
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,620
are barely visible in the flat shoeprint

951
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,110
and are faint in the 3D shoeprint.

952
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,550
This is a typical feature of

953
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,770
a big foot wearing a small shoe.

954
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,720
The small shoe worn by the criminal

955
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,510
is one centimeter shorter

956
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,170
than his bare footprint.

957
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,840
In other words, Fan Yi's shoes

958
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,650
were small for you,

959
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,920
but you could still

960
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,350
squeeze your feet into them.

961
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:15,900
Alright.

962
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,630
Come on.

963
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,180
Take a look at them.

964
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,430
Do they look familiar?

965
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,930
They're Fan Yi's shoes.

966
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,670
I've even prepared the soil

967
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,650
samples from the scene for you.

968
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,000
Why don't you put them on now

969
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,860
and take a few steps?

970
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:33,750
Gao Weiyuan.

971
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,190
Do you really think that

972
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,520
what you did was flawless?

973
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,690
After our investigation, we found that

974
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,350
the dash cam

975
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,910
[October 12, 2023]

976
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,360
from a car

977
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,510
near Fan Yi's house

978
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,200
had captured some footage.

979
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,180
It shows that the day before the incident,

980
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,790
you were in disguise

981
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,000
with a package in your hands

982
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,000
and secretly sneaked into Fan Yi's house.

983
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,880
In other words,

984
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,930
the physical evidence found in Fan Yi's house

985
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,030
was planted by you, right?

986
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,250
Even if you keep denying it,

987
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,300
according to the footage

988
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,450
and based on your posture, gait

989
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,000
and various other details, I can still

990
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,110
determine that this man was you.

991
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,610
Gao Weiyuan,

992
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,860
you are the mastermind

993
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,110
behind this explosion case.

994
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,460
You're also suspected of drug manufacturing and trafficking.

995
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,950
The evidence is conclusive.

996
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,570
Do you have anything to say?

997
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,480
Your family is now

998
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,720
under our protection.

999
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:54,020
You can be absolutely assured of that.

1000
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,720
Just confess.

1001
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,820
I want to see my lawyer.

1002
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,970
The evidence is clear, and the facts are indisputable.

1003
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
No matter how many lawyers you hire,

1004
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,290
it's impossible to overturn the case.

1005
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,860
It's none of your business whether I can overturn it!

1006
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,040
It's my right to have a lawyer!

1007
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:14,950
I want to see my lawyer.

1008
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,770
I want to see him now!
