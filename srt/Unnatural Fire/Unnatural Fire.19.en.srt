the motive isn't in the basement?

That basement has existed

for at least ten years.

102

ten years ago,

107
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,160
what was in the basement

108
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,190
definitely wasn't the Bitcoin mining machine.

109
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,270
Because Bitcoins

110
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,470
appeared in 2009,

111

happened in 2005.

113
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,390
So you think the mining machine

114
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,830
is just a smokescreen?

115
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,120
Yes.

116
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,360
If what was originally

117
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,920
in the basement wasn't the mining machine,

118
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,070
what else could cause

119
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,159
the lightning due to

120
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,690

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,110
I suspect that

00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,990

00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,560

193
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,990
and the steamed fish head.

194
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,480
They're good.

195
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:18,870
Alright. Okay.

196
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,550
Order more if you like.

197
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay.

198
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,480
I need to answer the phone. Please wait a moment.

199
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,030
Alright.

200
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,480
Danggui, speak.

201
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,510
Captain Shen, where are you?

202
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:27,960
We can start interrogating

203
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,050
Gao Weiyuan and Wu Yu now.

204
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,750
Chief Wu is already

205
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,600
waiting in the surveillance room.

206
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,060
Okay. I'll be right back.

207
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,720
I'm sorry, sir.

208
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,120
It's official business.

209
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,870
Let's go back to interrogate

210
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,750
Gao Weiyuan and Wu Yu first.

211
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,760
We'll come here again another day.

212
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,390
Okay. Sure.

213
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,450
Please eat here next time.

214
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,790
Take care.

215
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,850
What's your name?

216
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,090
Gao Weiyuan.

217
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,690
How old are you?

218
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,750
I'm 47.

219
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,010
Where do you live?

220
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,160
I'm a local.

221
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,990
Marshal Gu?

222
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,620
Marshal Gu.

223
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,190
What brings you here?

224
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,990
I didn't graduate from high school.

225
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,410
This case has far-reaching impacts.

226
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,010
The higher-ups

227
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,960
and the public

228
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,320
are both paying close attention.

229
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,170
I'm here to check on the progress.

230
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,670
Go on.

231
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,510
Gao Weiyuan,

232
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,680
you were illegally using the Bitcoin mining machine

233
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,500
in the basement of the Ducheng Processing Factory,

234
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,260
which led to excessive power consumption

235
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,500
and resulted in a fire in the restaurant next to the factory

236
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,850
with people suffering burns.

237
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,420
Currently, the equipment has been seized.

238
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,170
About these things,

239
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,630
do you have anything to say?

240
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,730
Captain Shen,

241
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,210
I really didn't know that

242
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,230
mining would also be considered as a crime.

243
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,120
It looks like you haven't

244
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,700
understood the charges against you yet.

245
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,030
Stealing state electricity for mining

246
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,680
poses a serious threat to

247
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,050
both financial and social order.

248
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,930
Moreover, because of

249
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,200
your illegal activities,

250
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
other people's lives and property

251
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,320
were put at risk.

252
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,570
How can you still try to deny it?

253
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:52,930
No, no.

254
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,170
I'm not denying it.

255
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,330
If you say that I committed a crime,

256
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,910
then I must have committed a crime.

257
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,910
There's nothing I can say.

258
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,640
Say something you can say.

259
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,420
What's your relationship with Wu Yu?

260
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,780
You mean Wu?

261
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,460
I...

262
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,160
I don't have any relationship with him.

263
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
I didn't even know him before.

264
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,320
After that small restaurant caught fire,

265
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,620
Wu came to see me initiatively.

266
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,690
He said he majored in a certain subject

267
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,500
and graduated from a certain university.

268
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,170
He was particularly skilled in

269
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,160
fire investigation.

270
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,660
He also said that as long as I paid enough money,

271
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,390
he could solve any problems for me.

272
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,160
Gao Weiyuan,

273
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,650
you're sitting right here.

274
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,870
Do you think

275
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,000
what you're saying is credible?

276
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,270
Captain Shen,

277
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,200
everything I'm saying is the truth.

278
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,910
I've already given

279
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,280
full authority to Wu.

280
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,990
He's a professional.

281
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,310
Captain Shen,

282
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,360
I just wanted the factory to

283
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,650
resume production sooner.

284
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,050
That was why I hired him to

285
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,280
help with your investigation.

286
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,870
On the third day after the incident,

287
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,930
[E-Bank Transfer] [Transfer] [Consumption]

288
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
200,000 yuan was withdrawn from

289
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,000
your personal account.

290
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:00,940
Soon after that,

291
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,900
200,000 yuan appeared

292
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,970
in Wu Yu's account.

293
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,690
You hired an expert and paid the bill through a personal account.

294
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,160
How do you explain that?

295
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,740
He took advantage of the situation.

296
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,790
Originally, I didn't intend to

297
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,750
give him that much money.

298
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,980
This fire was not that simple.

299
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,220
If you want me to continue helping you,

300
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,460
firstly, you need to tell me honestly

301
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,100
what exactly you guys did.

302
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,980
Well, what could we possibly do?

303
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,200
Well...

304
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,200
That day,

305
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,870
we were in a rush to finish an urgent order.

306
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,270
All the machines in the factory

307
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,580
were running overtime.

308
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,510
All the machines were running overtime?

309
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,640
What was the power consumption?

310
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,700
How would I know how much power was used?

311
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,080
Anyway, all the machines were running,

312
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,260
so it wouldn't be small.

313
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,000
Well,

314
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,520
what does this have to do with the fire?

315
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,820
Hearing what you're saying,

316
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,420
I have a rough idea now.

317
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,130
But you're not telling me the whole truth, are you?

318
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,450
What do you mean?

319
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,870
If the power consumption is high enough

320
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,240
to exceed a certain threshold,

321
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,360
the lightning that should have

322
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,360
struck the lightning rod

323
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,120
would probably be diverted to nearby areas.

324
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,330
Do you understand what I'm saying?

325
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,650
I don't understand.

326
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,820
I don't care.

327
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,840
Anyway, you have to cover this up

328
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,550
for me.

329
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,070
Don't let them trace this back to our factory.

330
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,640
I do have a solution.

331
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,620
[Ducheng Processing Factory]

332
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,340
But as far as I know,

333
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,900
the power level required

334
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,990
[Wu Yu]

335
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,150
to divert lightning from a lightning rod

336
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,240
is far beyond what normal manufacturing

337
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,630
processes can reach.

338
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,780
So what exactly were you guys doing?

339
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,840
Wu, I'm warning you.

340
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,120
Don't ask questions you shouldn't ask.

341
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Don't pry.

342
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,150
Didn't you also break the rules

343
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,000
by entering the scene

344
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,140
and disrupt the investigation?

345
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,790
These two things

346
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,980
are enough to make you get into trouble, huh?

347
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,120
You associated those two charges with the statement

348
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,720
of knowing nothing just like that.

349
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,070
Compared with this so-called terrifying big ship,

350
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,160
I'd rather choose the former.

351
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,460
Alright. I'll tell you.

352
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,480
I was mining Bitcoins.

353
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,840
Alright.

354
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,510
I can help you solve this problem.

355
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,060
But the price will

356
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,440
increase by ten times.

357
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,890
Later, he said

358
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,240
all these things

359
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,750
could be attributed to natural disasters.

360
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,640
He raised the price exorbitantly,

361
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,960
and I didn't dare to refuse.

362
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,840
It was still better than going to jail, right?

363
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,490
So you mean

364
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,880
Wu Yu blackmailed you?

365
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,910
Do you have any evidence?

366
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,030
Yes, I do.

367
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,720
I have evidence.

368
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,910
I have an audio recording.

369
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,540
Director Gao said he encountered some trouble.

370
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,020
He asked me to assist with the investigation.

371
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,160
Soon after the incident,

372
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,460
you entered the scene

373
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,160
and took away the molten beads without authorization.

374
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,870
So you think this was assisting with the investigation?

375
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,270
Firstly,

376
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,080
I did enter the scene

377
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,070
before you guys arrived,

378
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,720
but I didn't cause

379
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,910
any damage to the scene.

380
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,640
Secondly,

381
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,600
I provided information about the residual

382
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,630
magnetism of the lightning rod.

383
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
The molten beads from the electrical panel

384
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,610
were also found and tested by me.

385
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,150
These results have been reviewed

386
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,270
by your professional institutions,

387
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,360
and there aren't any errors.

388
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,060
Thirdly,

389
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,980
the conclusion that the fire source was lightning

390
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,270
was also discovered and proved

391
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,290
by me at first.

392
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,080
Officers,

393
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,600
all the clues and evidence I provided

394
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,550
were pointing in the right direction.

395
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,840
Do you still insist that it was not assisting with the investigation?

396
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,270
[E-Bank Transfer] [Transfer] [Consumption]

397
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,510
What?

398
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,960
Is this illegal?

399
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,720
My professional expertise

400
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,910
is worth this price.

401
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,550
If I hadn't been the first one discovering that

402
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,610
the real cause of the fire was lightning,

403
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,240
you'd still be running around to investigate the case

404
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,360
like headless chickens, right?

405
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,840
Would that Adviser Xu

406
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,910
be able to find the real

407
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,960
cause of the fire?

408
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,550
It's fine that you don't give me

409
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,910
a commendation banner,

410
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,000
but you even want to charge me with a crime?

411
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,130
Officers,

412
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,010
isn't this a bit too absurd?

413

[Gao Weiyuan, Wu Yu, Phone Call Recording]

414
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,200
The power level required

415
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,440
to divert lightning from a lightning rod

416
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,310
is far beyond what normal manufacturing

417
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,940
processes can reach.

418
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,750
So what exactly were you guys doing?

419
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,510
Alright.

420
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,460
I'll tell you.

421
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,440
I was mining Bitcoins.

422

[Gao Weiyuan, Wu Yu, Phone Call Recording]

423
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,990
Alright.

424
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,750
I can help you solve this problem.

425
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,540
But the price will

426
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,750
increase by ten times.

427
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,590
Do you still want a commendation banner?

428
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,630
Wu Yu,

429
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,460
you are suspected of covering up crimes,

430
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,730
extortion

431
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,310
and disrupting the order of case handling.

432
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,390
You will face legal punishment.

433
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,730
Gao Weiyuan.

434
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:44,910
When did you

435
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,930
start mining Bitcoins?

436
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,630
I've just started it recently.

437
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,030
Mr. Han used to do this.

438
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,840
It... It was Han Pei who did this.

439
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,290
He was always so secretive.

440
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,710
I also didn't know what he was doing.

441
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,120
Later, he died.

442
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,080
Only then did I dare to go down and take a look.

443
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,120
I didn't know

444
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,240
what that stuff was.

445
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,620
Later, after I looked into it,

446
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,410
I found that this stuff was really profitable.

447
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,640
Just think about it.

448
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,510
Who doesn't want to make money?

449
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,670
Right?

450
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,500
Did you operate all this by yourself?

451
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,119
I wasn't capable of that.

452
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,119
Later, I consulted some foreigners

453
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,960
who engaged in this field,

454
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,720
and that was how I figured it out.

455
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,640
When was

456
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,680
this basement built?

457
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,420
I don't know about that.

458
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,000
Since I discovered that Mr. Han

459
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,110
went there,

460
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,440
it's been several years till now.

461
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,200
Be more specific.

462
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,920
Which year?

00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,600
Captain Shen,

464
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,190
why would I memorize that?

465
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,860
The boss's business

466
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,310
is not something we dare to meddle in, right?

467
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,480
After Han Pei died,

468
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,550
you've been quite bold, haven't you?

469
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,350
This... This is all for making money.

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,490

Okay.

No, I don't.

480
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,120
Alright.

481
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,940
Thank you all for your hard work.

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,160
Thanks to your persistence,

483
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,780

484
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,300
Adviser Xu's expertise,

485
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,670
now we've finally

486
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,930
figured out the details

487
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,960
of this case.

488
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,710
And we've also

489
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,310
discovered

490
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,960
the activity of illegal mining.

491
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,710
That's good.

492
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,580
Now both the confessions and evidence

493
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,860
are conclusive.

494
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
The fact proves that

495
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,260
your joint investigation team

496
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,080
has been established effectively.

497
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,850
Of course, we should also thank

498
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,370
Marshal Gu for his concern and support.

499
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,620
So,

500
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,760
shall we close the case?

501
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,730
What do you think?

502
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,550
Let's close it.

503
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,160
Okay.

504
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,320
Alright. Let's get this done in one go.

505
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,380
Gao Weiyuan.

506
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,510
You stole state electricity

507
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,310
to mine Bitcoins,

508
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,000
which caused a fire that seriously injured others.

509
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,640
You also deliberately interfered with the investigation.

510
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,750
What awaits you

511
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,200
is the punishment of the law.

512
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,410
Okay.

513
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,640
Then...

514
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,400
Then just punish me.

515
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,300
Punish me with the law.

516
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,110
Xu.

517
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,830
Gao Weiyuan is just

518
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,960
a submissive person.

519
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,160
Han Pei probably didn't tell him

520
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,140
many things.

521
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,520
We also couldn't get much information from him.

522
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,800
Don't take it to heart.

523
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,350
I know.

524
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,510

Why... Why aren't you back yet?

532
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,530
I'll be back as soon as I get things done here.

533
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,170
How's your blood pressure today?

534
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,110
I checked it.

542
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,210
[The fire started from the kitchen table of Quanyou Restaurant located in No. 18, Lingxiang Road, Ducheng Village, Beixun District.]

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,170

544
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,170
Adviser Xu.

545
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,360
Adviser Xu.

546
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,510
Where's Captain Shen?

547
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,480
He has just stepped out. He'll be back soon.

548
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,790
Are you looking for him?

549
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,400
I'm here to deliver an identification report.

550
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,440
You can give it to me.

551
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,230
Is Chun

552
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,270
in the autopsy room now?

553
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,410
I think she's there.

554
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,070
Alright.

555
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,650
I have to go.

556
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,050
Bye.

557
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,980
Come in.

558
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,450
Pai.

559
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,110
Have you found the files?

Chun.

561
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,720
Why are you here?

562
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,640
As such a busy man, you never come unless

563
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,470
you need something.

564
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,660
I...

565
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,750
I'm here specifically to apologize to you.

566
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,240
You don't need to apologize.

567
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,160
This case

568
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,680
has been solved so nicely, hasn't it?

569
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,690
Well, you should be angry about this.

570
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,350
Indeed...

571
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,070
Why are you angry?

572
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,960
How did you irritate our Chun

573
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,440
again?

574
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,160
Come on, Chun,

575
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,830
Sign here.

576
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,420
Here.

577
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,990
It's nothing.

578
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,140
He just stood me up.

579
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,430
I'm sorry, Chun.

580
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,530
Here's the thing.

581
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,400
That case

582
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,350
is related to a thunderstorm.

583
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,670
It happened to be raining that day,

584
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,110
so I went directly to the crime scene.

585
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,880
You dared to stand her up when it was raining?

586
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,570
Chun, you didn't get wet in the rain, did you?

587
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,300
How would I let myself get wet in the rain?

588
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,900
But it was quite awkward that day.

589
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,910
He stood me up,

590
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,930
and I stood up Han Jun.

591
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,570
In the end, I still ran into Han Jun.

592
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,890
-Han Jun?
-Han Jun?

593
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,050
Yes, Han Jun.

594
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,570
He went abroad after he turned eighteen.

595
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,040
When the accident happened to our family,

596
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,170
he was still in China.

597
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,630
Perhaps he knows

598
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,400
what that basement

599
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,560
was used for previously.

600
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,370
It's not impossible.

601
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,110
Now he's

602
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,240
the boss of the Han Group.

603
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,040
That's perfect.

604
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,210
Today, let's summon him here for an interrogation.

605
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,880
Let's go together.

606
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,410
Let's go.

607
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,660
Chun, then we'll...

608
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,160
Just go.

609
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,540
Let's go.

610
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,670
Chun, I'm really...

611
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,760
It's alright. Just go.

612
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,930
I really didn't expect that

613
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,510
I would help to clean up this mess.

614
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,140
-Mr. Han.
-Captain Shen.

615
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,340
Hello.

616
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,200
Have a seat.

617
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,960
We've met again.

618
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,620
Adviser Xu.

619
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,880
Well, you must have heard about

620
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,170
Gao Weiyuan's case, right?

621
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,070
This officer just

622
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,110
told me about it.

623
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,010
Such an incident

624
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,550
has caused trouble for you.

625
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,920
Due to Ducheng Processing Factory's

626
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,780
illegal mining during the business time,

627
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,510
which caused a fire that injuried others seriously,

628
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,740
thus, subsequently,

629
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,120
it will be closed for rectification

630
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,860
and undergo fire safety inspections.

631
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,820
That's appropriate.

632
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,450
I really didn't expect that

633
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,000
Director Gao would do

634
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,960
something like this.

635
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,890
So you know this Gao Weiyuan?

636
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,350
He's been working in the Han Group

637
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,500
for a long time.

638
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,070
I've heard of his name before.

639
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,440
So, before you went abroad,

640
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,510
he was already in the Han Group?

641
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,620
I can't remember that clearly.

642
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,070
If you can't remember it, why did you just say that

643
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,170
he had been working in the Han Group for many years?

644
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,640
Perhaps that was the case.

645
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,920
What's wrong, Adviser Xu?

646
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,270
Is there a problem?

647
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,830
There aren't any big issues.

648
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,240
We mainly want to figure out

649
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,070
whether the basement of this processing factory

650
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,270
had existed before you went abroad.

651
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,100
I don't know about that.

652
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
I'm not interested in

653
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,270
the Han Family's affairs.

654
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,960
I don't know these details.

655
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,250
You don't know.

656
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,850
Then as for your brother, Han Pei,

657
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,460
I think you know him well, huh?

658
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,830
Why are you talking about Han Pei again?

659
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,460
Here's the thing.

660
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,270
According to Gao Weiyuan's confessions,

661
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,840
it turns out that it was

662
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,170
Han Pei who did the mining.

663
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,640
After his death,

664
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,790
Gao Weiyuan took it over.

665
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,200
So we want to ask you

666
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,880
whether you know

667
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,350
when Han Pei started

668
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,270
the mining operation.

669
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,760
I really don't know about that.

670
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,240
After I left home and went abroad,

671
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,640
I rarely contacted the Han Family.

672
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,750
Han Pei only occasionally

673
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,990
gave me a call.

674
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,350
It was just to say hello

675
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,440
and talk about the daily life.

676
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,750
As for the mining operation,

677
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,000
he never mentioned it.

678
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,400
I don't know about it.

679
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,310
According to what you said,

680
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,200
it seems that the relationship between you and him

681
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,460
wasn't quite close.

682
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,390
But we found out that Han Pei

683
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,750
had an overseas account.

684
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,240
Why has he kept

685
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,490
transferring money to you all these years?

686
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,240
Transferring money to me?

687
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,740
You must be talking about Han Pei

688
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,440
transferring the money to my overseas

689
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,470
charitable foundation.

690
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,530
Hey, why are you all

691
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,720
looking at me

692
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,890
like that?

693
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,750
Are you suspecting that I helped him launder money?

694
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,350
Let me tell you.

695
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,440
First of all,

696
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,350
I don't know where his funds

697
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,460
came from.

698
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,400
Secondly,

699
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,920
the foundation's accounts

700
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,100
are open and transparent.

701
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,710
You can check them anytime.

702
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,600
Not a single fund has flowed back.

703
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,990
Han Pei even donated money for charity.

704
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,070
I really didn't expect that.

705
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,960
Maybe he did

706
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,720
too many bad things,

707
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,780
so he donated money for charity

708
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,640
to ease his guilty conscience.

709
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,440
Since I took over the Han Group,

710
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,310
I've shut down

711
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,890
all of his improper

712
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,600
business.

713
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,820
After I sold off those assets,

714
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,880
I transferred all the money

715
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,640
to the overseas foundation's account.

716
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,400
Han Jun's answer is fine.

717
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,070
He went abroad when he was 18.

718
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,920
It's normal that he doesn't know about these things.

719
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,350
Xu,

720
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,200
don't dig too deep into this.

721
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,960
We need to change our approach.

722
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,400
There's a problem.

723
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,400
I'm sure there's a problem.

724
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,550
[Refuse] [Answer]

725
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,550
[Dad]

726
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,700
Dad.

727
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,760
I'm about to get off work.

728
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,350
Okay.

729
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,010
I'm off work now.

730
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,360
Oh, right. About that fellow,

731
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,000
Chen Quanyou,

732
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,030
is he going to be discharged from the hospital soon?

733
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,640
Let's find some time to

734
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,670
go visit him.

735
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,270
I'm following up on the restaurant's rectification.

736
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,670
You're doing well in keeping an eye

737
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,100
on the follow-up work.

738
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,790
When that restaurant

739
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,960
reopens,

740
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,640
let's go there to show our support.

741
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,820
Xu.

742
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:30,420
[Quanyou Restaurant]

743
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,700
Hello, Shen Ye.

744
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,200
Send the factory workers' information

745
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,170
to me.

746
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,400
I want the files with photos.

747
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,760
Adviser Xu,

748
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,750
I'm really sorry.

749
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,510
Logically speaking,

750
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,920
I should make you a cup of tea.

751
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:37,680
Thank you.

752
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,310
I'll definitely pay attention to fire safety from now on.

753
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,250
There won't be any improper wiring again.

754
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,600
I've checked it. It's very good.

755
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,480
It's all done according to your requirements.

756
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,380

is that a couple of days ago,

00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,710
You keep mentioning those two people.

946
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,520
We don't even know them.

947
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,810
I'm not acting strangely.

948
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,760
They owe me money.

949
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,760
They haven't come for so long.

950
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,470
How can I not be anxious?

951
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,750
I see.

952
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,020
We'll keep an eye out for your sake.

953
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,200
We'll keep an eye out.

954
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,640
Okay. Thank you very much.

955
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,680
You're welcome.

956
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,060
Thank you. Thank you so much.

957
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,960
Alright.

958
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,880
Come on,

959
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,090
Let's have a drink!

960
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,000
Let's have a drink. Cheers.

961
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,400
We're out of beer. Go get some beer.

962
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,220
I'll go get the beer.

963
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,400
Come on.

964
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:29,960
Let's have a drink.

965
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,640
This is so good.

966
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,930
The boss lady's cooking is good.

967
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,000
It's you again, you scumbag.

968
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,250
You think we're not miserable enough?

969
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,530
Buddies, come here!

970
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,130
Darn it! He's here again!

971
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,290
What do you want to do now?

972
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:39,800
What are you

973
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,080
doing here alone?

974
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,340
What do you want?

975
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,490
I'm just here to figure out the truth.

976
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,660
To figure out the truth?

977
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,280
You're still investigating it?

978
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,700
Our factory has already gone bankrupt.

979
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,810
Guys, harmony brings wealth.

980
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,320
Don't talk about harmony.

981
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,920
We've lost our jobs.

982
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,440
Ma'am!

983
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,440
Call Shen Ye.

984
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,110
Okay.

985
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,070
Now you're turning against us.

986
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,070
If we have no work to do,

987
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,110
you won't have any business, either.

988
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,400
Just wait to go bankrupt.

989
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,560
What do you guys want to do?

990
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,200
What do we want to do?

991
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,490
We want to beat you up!

992
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,480
Speak.

993
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
Officer Shen!

994
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,930
Please come over here now.

995
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,590
We can't hold on much longer here.

996
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,440
What happened?

997
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,190
Don't panic. Tell me slowly.

998
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,190
Adviser Xu is being beaten up right now.

999
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,690
They're beating him up quite heavily.

1000
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Please come here now.

1001
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,650
Is he in your restaurant?

1002
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,890
Yes, I'm in my restaurant now.

1003
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,420
Could you please come here now?

1004
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,220
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

1005
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,510
Dad, I have to go out now.

1006
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,670
Dad.

1007
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Dad, what's wrong?

1008
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,620
Dad.

1009
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:10,750
Are you alright?

1010
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,810
I'm fine.

1011
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,400
It slipped from my hand.

1012
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,850
Go ahead with your work.

1013
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,440
You won't eat at home anyway.

1014
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,330
I don't need to

1015
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,630
prepare this meal anymore.

1016
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,630
As for the dishes,

1017
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,190
by that time,

1018
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,630
I'll throw away

1019
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,570
or dump them.

1020
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,890
Go ahead with your work.

1021
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,400
Something happened to a colleague from the Fire Investigation Department.

1022
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
I need to go help him.

1023
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:28,920
The Fire Investigation Department?

1024
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
Now you're practically a member

1025
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,090
of the Fire Investigation Department.

1026
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:32,880
Just go.

1027
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,320
Well, Dad,

1028
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,550
this is for work, isn't it?

1029
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,190
I didn't say I would interfere with your work.

1030
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,440
Go ahead with your work.

1031
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,790
I'll save some food for you.

1032
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,190
I'll save it for you after I finish cooking.

1033
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,920
[Shen Ye]

1034
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,990
[Quanyou Restaurant]

1035
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,580
Zhang, sorry for the trouble.

1036
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,780
[Police]

1037
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,110
How about this?

1038
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,940
Next time when you come to my place,

1039
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,230
well, just give me a call.

1040
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,350
I'll treat you to a meal.

1041
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:24,940
It's alright.

1042
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,170
Alright. No need to see us off.

1043
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,840
I'm leaving.

1044
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,450
Bye.

1045
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,110
Get back to work.

1046
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,230
Does it still hurt?

1047
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,230
I'm really fine.

1048
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,670
I wasn't helpful...

1049
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,000
Come on. Let me take a look.

1050
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,990
I'm fine.

1051
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,560
Don't you need to treat that facial injury in the hospital?

1052
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,230
No need.

1053
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,760
Wasn't the case closed?

1054
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,300
Why did you fight with them this time?

1055
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,800
You were still fine yesterday.

1056
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,120
How did you end up like this today?

1057
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,260
What was the reason?

1058
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,310
Well, it's all my fault.

1059
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,110
It has nothing to do with Adviser Xu.

1060
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,660
Well, how did the fight start?

1061
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,010
Stop talking. Let me explain.

1062
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,230
Here's the thing.

1063
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,270
I mentioned to Adviser Xu that

1064
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,410
there were two workers who could only speak

1065
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,250
their own dialect.

1066
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,050
They always ate

1067
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,530
in my restaurant late at night.

1068
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,370
Then Adviser Xu asked me to find out

1069
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,670
whether they were in the list

1070
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,080
of the factory's personnel.

1071
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,580
It turned out that they weren't in the list,

1072
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,910
so Adviser Xu suspected that

1073
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,150
there might be a problem with those two guys.

1074
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,510
Then he asked me to invite some workers

1075
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,880
to our restaurant for a meal

1076
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,600
to see whether I could

1077
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,810
find out anything.

1078
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,970
Before I could ask them clearly,

1079
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,330
Adviser Xu was discovered by them.

1080
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,510
That was why they fought with each other.

1081
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,050
Alright. I got it.

1082
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,960
Did you ask me for the list

1083
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,200
because of this matter?

1084
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,630
If you suspected it,

1085
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,030
you should have told me.

1086
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,400
How many times have I told you?

1087
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,030
Just don't act alone.

1088
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,840
Just don't act alone.

1089
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:34,580
I won't do that again.

1090
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,510
I really won't.

1091
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,440
Where are those workers?

1092
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,360
They're detained.

1093
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,440
Alright. How about this?

1094
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,560
Accompany me

1095
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,500
to see Gao Weiyuan.

1096
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,310
Then we'll interrogate the workers.

1097
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,080
Now you know to tell me about it

1098
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,160
instead of keeping it to yourself?

1099
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,890
Yes, I know.

1100
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,930
Stop lecturing him.

1101
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,590
It's really my fault.

1102
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,030
He'll stop it.

1103
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,190
Is your face really okay?

1104
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,230
It's okay. Let's go.

1105
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,760
Be more careful next time.

1106
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,630
Alright. I got it.

1107
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,150
I got it.

1108
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,760
Your face is hurt.

1109
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,260
I'm really sorry for causing you trouble.

1110
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,310
Tell me about the other young one.

1111
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,610
That one is probably in his twenties.

1112
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,600
His hairstyle is

1113
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,840
about the same as mine.

1114
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,590
Does he have a moustache?

1115
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,590
No, he doesn't.

1116
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,770
How tall is he approximately?

1117
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,030
How tall? About 175 cm.

1118
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,720
None of you know them?

1119
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,280
I've never seen them before.

1120
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,120
I've never seen them before.

1121
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,620
What's wrong?

1122
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,280
This person looks a bit like

1123
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,000
a coworker I knew

1124
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,950
when I was young.

1125
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,240
But the age difference is too big,

1126
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,670
so this probably isn't him.

1127
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,190
What does he mean?

1128
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,070
He's saying that this person

1129
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:42,630
looks like someone he knew

1130
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,440
when he was young.

1131
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,510
But the age doesn't match,

1132
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,400
so he must be mistaken.

1133
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,150
Are you sure?

1134
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,400
Yes, I am.

1135
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,560
Are you sure?

1136
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,630
The young one you mentioned is this one?

1137
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,810
Yes, that's the one.

1138
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,890
And then...

1139
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,490
This person is the one...

1140
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:10,630
The one who had difficulty walking?

1141
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:10,960
Yes.

1142
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,720
Alright. Thank you.

1143
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:16,800
His name is Fan...

1144
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,200
Fan Yi and Li Si, right?

1145
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,370
Which one is Fan Yi?

1146
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,030
This one looks more like him.

1147
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,840
The older one, right?

1148
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,520
Yes, yes, yes.

1149
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,670
Which house?

1150
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,640
W-Which house?

1151
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,450
I think it's the second house.

1152
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,290
It's the second house, right?

1153
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,580
Okay. Thank you.

1154
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:30,960
How much is this?

1155
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,740
One yuan.

1156
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:40,930
Five yuan.

1157
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,900
Are you Li Si?

1158
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,230
Who is it?

1159
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,000
Coming.

1160
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,550
Are you Fan Yi?

1161
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,760
Yes, I am.

As these places have limited space

and are densely populated,

1172
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,070
they usually have major potential safety hazards.

prepare fire safety facilities according to the standards

1177

and keep evacuation passageways and safety exits open.
