[Episode 31]

3
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
What documents? I don't know anything about that!

4
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,520
Stop playing dumb.

5
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,789
Except you, no one else

6
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,570
has access to those things.

7
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,720
Shen Yi.

8
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,720
Are you Shen Yi?

9
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,380
Put me down!

10
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,920
Han Jun.

11
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,480
You look exactly like Han Pei.

12
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,870
You're also as ruthless as Han Kun.

13
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,750
All the members of

14
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,680
your Han family are bad guys.

15
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,310
You didn't know me,

16
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,530
but you were still trying to harm me.

17
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,120
Right?

18
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,970
I wasn't trying to harm you!

19
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,079
Let me explain.

20
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,310
While I was sorting out Han Pei's

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,470
belongings after his death,

22
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,800
I found these things.

23
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,680
I thought that

24
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,510
these things should be handed over to the police.

25
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,690
They should be handed over to the police?

26
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,530
Then why did you mail them

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,280
to my home?

28
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,890
You deliberately wanted me to see them, didn't you?

29
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,090
Listen to me.

30
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,190
Alright.

31
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,950
I saw them.

32
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,750
I really didn't expect it.

33
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,610
Han Kun has been dead for so long.

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,010
What do you think is the point of

35
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,420
mailing these documents?

36
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,630
Listen to me.

37
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,579
Whether Han Kun is dead or not

38
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,120
has nothing to do with me!

39
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,610
I hate him!

40
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,090
I just

41
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,350
wanted to expose all

42
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,930
his scandals!

43
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,310
I only knew Officer Shen at that time.

44
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,430
I didn't think much about it,

45
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,140
and I just mailed the things to him.

46
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,270
Who knew you would see them?

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,670
I didn't know!

48
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,150
A silver-tongued sophist.

49
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,610
That's an appropriate description of you.

50
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,950
Shen Yi.

51
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,750
Can't we talk this over calmly?

52
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,060
Put me down.

53
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,360
I'll give you ten million yuan.

54
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,100
And I absolutely won't call the police.

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,780
I'll keep my word!

56
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Do you think money has

57
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,360
any significance to me now?

58
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,810
Did I bring you here for money?

59
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,680
It's because your surname is Han

60
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,500
and you're Han Kun's son.

61
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,490
So you have to pay the debts.

62
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,560
I want your Han family...

63
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,150
Is anyone there? Help!

64
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,390
To be exterminated!

65
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,460
He's coming.

66
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,960
My son is coming.

67
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,180
Shen Yi.

68
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,930
Shen Yi!

69
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,330
I hate them, too!

70
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,130
I also want to kill them!

71
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,000
Wait a moment!

72
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,070
I didn't harm you!

73
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,540
It has nothing to do with me!

74
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,430
Please...

75
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,970
Please put me down now!

76
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,610
Don't turn it into a terrible mistake!

77
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,920
If you stop now,

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,510
it won't be too late!

79
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,060
Whether it's related to you or not,

80
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,090
go to hell and ask

81
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,190
your dad yourself.

82
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,830
You look exactly like Han Pei.

83
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,270
You're also as ruthless as Han Kun.

84
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,420
All the members of

85
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,270
your Han family are bad guys.

86
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,159
I won't play with you any longer.

87
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,470
[Police]

88
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,130
Danggui, Huang Qi.

[Police]

90
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,030
Take a team to go upstairs with me.

91
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,659
Yes.

92
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,280
Xu,

93
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,320
wait here.

94
00:05:59,370 --> 00:05:59,920
Bai Zhi,

95
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,510
protect him.

96
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes.

97
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,450
Let's go.

98
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,120
Be careful.

99
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,970
Don't worry.

100
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,720
Huang Qi, Danggui!

101
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,240
Save him!

102
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,860
Squad 1, what's the situation?

103
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,040
Okay. Got it.

104
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,430
Danggui,

105
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,140
send him to the hospital.

106
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:38,830
Yes.

107
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,800
Up! Up!

108
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,470
Ye.

109
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,540
Come to the rooftop alone.

110
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,220
I have something to tell you.

111
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,860
Alright, Chief Wu.

112
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,590
I know what I'm doing.

113
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,470
You guys can stay here temporarily.

114
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,240
Captain Shen.

115
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,450
What if Shen Yi...

116
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,180
Don't worry.

117
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,059
Since the day when I

118
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,480
agreed to let you attend the police academy,

119
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,910
I've thought about

120
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,200
the possibility of a day like this.

121
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,000
If you hadn't done those things,

122
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,270
this day wouldn't have come.

123
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,910
Ye.

124
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,500
I remember that you were 12 at that time,

125
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,650
and you had just escaped from the fire.

126
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,190
You were so little.

127
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,640
You were just this tall.

128
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,660
You got totally stunned.

129
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,320
I ran over

130
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,720
and held you in my arms.

131
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,070
Your whole body kept trembling.

132
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,460
At that moment, I made up my mind that

133
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,000
I would let you grow up well.

134
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,030
When the Xu family's house exploded,

135
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,040
you were at the scene.

136
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,570
You were involved in it.

137
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,600
As father and son,

138
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,100
can we only talk about these things?

139
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,080
In your mind,

140
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,600
do you only care about the cases?

141
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,030
There's so much I want to

142
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,120
say to you.

143
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,150
You don't have any patience to listen,

144
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,760
do you?

145
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,080
Indeed.

146
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,730
I know.

147
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,890
In your eyes, I'm just...

148
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,600
a bad person.

149
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,980
I've done many wrong things.

150
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,100
I admit that

151
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,620
I'm a murderer whose hands are stained with blood.

152
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,600
But there's one thing that's true.

153
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,030
My feelings for you are true.

154
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,210
I sincerely want the best for you.

155
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,000
Then why didn't you tell me

156
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,080
the truth earlier?

157
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,750
Because you had lost your memories at the time.

158
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,600
I didn't want you to have

159
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,240
a traumatic childhood.

160
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,050
So I followed the doctor's advice.

161
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,170
I concealed your past from you

162
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,280
and gave you a new identity.

163
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,670
I just wanted you

164
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,960
to have a healthy,

165
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,540
happy and carefree

166
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,240
childhood

167
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,680
just like other children.

168
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,820
Was I wrong?

169
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,000
And I did it, didn't I?

170
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,570
I raised you so well.

171
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,840
I gave you all that

172
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,080
I could get.

173
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,870
I gave you everything.

174
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,250
Then why did you sell drugs?

175
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,510
Why did you kill people?

176
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,110
Why?

177
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,140
You're too selfish!

178
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,370
You think I wanted to do that?

179
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,480
It was all because of

180
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,840
that bastard, Han Kun!

181
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,030
He set a trap for me

182
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,360
and framed me.

183
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,960
What exactly happened

184
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,840
to the Xu family back then?

185
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,330
Tell me.

186
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,840
Is that what you want to know?

187
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,580
Fine. I'll tell you.

188
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,870
That's right.

189
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,460
Han Pei killed Xu Qingsong.

190
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,510
Back then, Xu Qingsong

191
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,780
came to the factory to check their fire safety measures.

192
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,030
We thought he had discovered

193
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,150
our secret of drug production,

194
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,030
so we wanted to kill him.

195
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,600
In order to gain

196
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,670
his father's trust,

197
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,320
Han Pei took the initiative to kill Xu Qingsong.

198
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,600
It was that simple.

199
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,840
What else do you want to know?

200
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,320
Tell me!

201
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,000
Ask me now!

202
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,680
Ask me now!

203
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,890
Come here.

204
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,190
Go back with me.

205
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,570
Ye.

206
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,580
In your eyes,

207
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,340
I'm a drug dealer,

208
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,540
a crazy murderer

209
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,130
and a bad guy.

210
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,550
But you don't think of me

211
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,510
as a father who loves you.

212
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,070
Right?

213
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,750
Fine.

214
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,520
I promise you.

215
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,870
I have just one last request.

216
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,440
Let me hug you one more time.

217
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,360
Okay?

218
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,850
Captain Shen.

219
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,660
We're ready to kill the suspect anytime.

220
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,270
Without my order,

221
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,120
no one is allowed to take action.

222
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,350
Go back with me.

223
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,790
Then explain everything you've done

224
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,550
in detail.

225
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,950
Face the trial.

226
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,720
Okay?

227
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,200
No one can judge me...

228
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,120
except myself!

229
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,040
[Police]

230
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,900
[Police]

231
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,530
Dad.

232
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,060
Xu Heng.

233
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:00,600
♫Looking down at the city's ashes♫

234
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:08,710

245
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,320
Hello.

246
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,520
Xu,

247
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,290
this is Chief Chang Zhen.

248
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,160
He's Xu Tongsheng, the adviser of the Fire Investigation Department.

249
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,680
Hello, Chief Chang.

250
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,440
Hello.

251
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,350
In the entire investigation process of

252
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,570
the Ducheng Processing Factory's case,

253
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,130
they all assisted us and followed up with it.

254
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,560
Have a seat.

255
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,020
Thanks for your hard work.

256
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,700
Adviser Xu.

257
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,850
We've asked you to come here this time

258
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,350
mainly because we need to

259
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,520
do a comprehensive review on

260
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,910
the entire investigation process

261
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,140
of this series of cases.

262
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,440
After all, you personally went through

263
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,130
many of these events.

264
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,720
That's why we've asked you to come here.

265
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:03,880
Let's begin.

266
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,340
Eighteen years ago,

267
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,770
Xu Qingsong, who was then the commissioner of the Fire Investigation Department,

268
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,290
and Adviser Zhao Zhiyuan

269
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,680
conducted a routine fire safety inspection

270
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,200
on the Ducheng Processing Factory.

271
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,560
After the inspection,

272
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,100
Commissioner Xu requested a re-inspection.

273
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,300
Soon after that,

274
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,080
they received death threats.

275
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,790
Adviser Zhao Zhiyuan

276
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,820
was perfunctory in the subsequent inspections.

277
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,480
But Commissioner Xu

278
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,510
still didn't give up.

279
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,400
This floor is too messy.

280
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,240
Okay.

281
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,200
When we came last time,

282
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,640
it was like this.

283
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,680
Why hasn't it been changed yet?

284
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,030
There are also too many things piled up

285
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,730
on both sides.

286
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,440
Alright.

287
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,030
Look.

288
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,640
Look.

289
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,030
[Ducheng sincerely reminds you to collaborate well, work hard, stay innovative and create glory together.]

290
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,410
In fact, at that time, Commissioner Xu

291
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,750
didn't find out about their secrets.

292
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,080
But Han Kun and Shen Yi

293
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,070
believed that Commissioner Xu

294
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,880
posed a great

295
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,400
threat to them.

296
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,360
It's almost done, huh?

297
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:06,800
Let's go.

298
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,000
Take care, officers.

299
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,600
Bye.

300
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,920
On the day of the incident,

301
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,810
I saw Han Pei

302
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,890
in the Xu family's house.

303
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,180
He Xi, help me open the door!

304
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,200
On the afternoon of the incident,

305
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,590
when my parents

306
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,620
were not at home,

307
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,790
Han Pei disguised himself as a repairman

308
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,790
and entered our house.

309
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,110
He replaced the original blower of

310
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,000
the gas water heater

311
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,400
with a high-power blower which only

312
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,090
the Han family could get at the time,

313
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,700
and then loosened the gas connector,

314
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,710
causing a gas leak.

315
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,720
To ensure that Commissioner Xu

316
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,640
would use the water heater

317
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,030
when he returned home,

318
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,550
Han Pei asked someone

319
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,210
to splash paint on Commissioner Xu

320
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,000
on his way back home.

321
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,930
That day,

322
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,830
when Xu Tongsheng and I

323
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,010
went out to get photos,

324
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,570
I returned to

325
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,410
the Xu family's house midway.

326
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,510
But I didn't expect that...

327
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,070
Xi?

328
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,200
Xi.

329
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,310
Xi.

330
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,240
Why are you here?

331
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,580
Speak louder.

332
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,700
Kid!

333
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,400
Kid.

334
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,950
Be a good boy.

335
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,480
Don't be afraid, kid.

336
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,310
I'll bring you a gift.

337
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,940
Okay?

338
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,840
Kid.

339
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,210
This doll

340
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,400
is a small bag.

341
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,930
You can put your important things

342
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,140
into this bag.

343
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,440
It's safer than

344
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
holding them in your hands,

345
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,200
isn't it?

346
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,000
Uncle.

347
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,790
Uncle.

348
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,190
You're awake.

349
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,830
You're talking.

350
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,910
Uncle.

351
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,420
Who are you?

352
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,030
Where am I?

353
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,550
You...

354
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,070
Do you know your own name?

355
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,240
From that day on,

356
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,620
I became Shen Ye.

357
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,480
Until I met Adviser Xu again.

358
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,070
After I found out about

359
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,920
Captain Shen's true identity,

360
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,750
I kept trying

361
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,960
to help him regain his memory.

362
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,950
My childhood photo.

363
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,920
I looked handsome, huh?

364
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,310
He Xi.

365
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,190
Your name is He Xi.

366
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,750
Shen Yi is not your biological father.

367
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,240
Everything about you is fabricated.

368
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,440
You only have one relative,

369
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,450
that is, your grandma!

370
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,970
She's been waiting for you in the welfare house!

371
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,600
From that day on,

372
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,710
I regained my memory thoroughly.

373
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,120
I recalled that on the day of the incident,

374
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,500
I ran into Shen Yi

375
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,740
near your house.

376
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,360
So I concluded that

377
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,660
he was connected to

378
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,750
your family's case.

379
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,550
After you regained your memory,

380
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,310
you should have told me.

381
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,120
We could have investigated it together.

382
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,440
You guys wouldn't have allowed me

383
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
to stay by Shen Yi's side.

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,500
I was also afraid of alerting the suspect.

385
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,350
I stayed at home to observe Shen Yi

386
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,680
and found that he was plotting against Adviser Xu,

387
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,460
so I secretly sent people to protect him.

the entire process of this explosion.

394
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,000
It means that

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,750
so far,

396
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,480
there has been no evidence showing that

397
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,510
it was your fault, right?

According to the previous case,

425
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,720
we've learned that

426
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,690
Han Kun recruited Shen Yi later.

00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,130
They collaborated to make drugs.

I'm sorry.

476
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,050
Why are you saying sorry?

477
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,640
I think

478
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,350
I've owed you an apology all this time.

479
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,920
After I found out that you were He Xi,

480
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,680
in order to uncover the truth,

481
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,440
I've been using various methods

482
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,110
to force you to recall the past.

483
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,960
Actually, I thought about giving up halfway.

484
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,310
Because I thought that

485
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,440
when you started a new life

486
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,680
with your new identity,

487
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,070
you were happier and more

488
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,680
content than before.

489
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,920
Maybe that would

490
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
have been the best outcome.

491
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,870
Don't say that.

492
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,160
I'm doing pretty well now, aren't I?

493
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,160
Actually, all these years,

494
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,200
the loneliest person

495
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,880
must have been you.

496
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,370
It was you alone

497
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,000
who silently endured all of this.

498
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,990
If I had remembered it earlier,

499
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,960
you wouldn't have suffered so much.

500
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,810
Speaking of making apologies,

501
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,920
I should apologize, too.

502
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,600
But the good thing is...

503
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,880
we've met again

504
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,440
in another way.

505
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,410
Let's go.

506
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,270
Take me to visit my grandma.

507
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,900
Let's go.

508
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,590

509
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,620
I'm having difficulty making a choice.

510
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,250
You can order whatever you like.

511
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,430
I like eating everything.

512
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,720
Alright. I'll choose then.

513
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,650
You're such a busy person.

514
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
It's rare for you to have time

515
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,410
to join me for afternoon tea.

516
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,520
I should order carefully to

517
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,550
reward you with good food and drinks.

518
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,580
Alright.

519
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,670
That's all for now.

520
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,390
Danning.

521
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,000
Have you had

522
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,180
insufficient rest lately?

523
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,720
I've noticed that your dark circles are quite prominent.

524
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,500
Recently, I've been

525
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,550
constantly dreaming about

526
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,590
our school days.

527
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,110
Although back then,

528
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,310
the academic pressure was intense,

529
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,690
when I'm recalling those days now,

530
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,800
it was actually

531
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,160
the purest period of our lives.

532
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,160
Apart from studying,

533
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,700
there wasn't much other pressure.

534
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,000
Hard work always led to visible results.

535
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,480
At least, the scores we got

536
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,550
were not deceptive.

537
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,310
Did something happen to you?

538
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,060
All these years in Haishi,

539
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,280
I've hardly recalled these things.

540
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,000
Now that I'm back in Beixun,

541
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,360
maybe the surroundings have stirred up these memories.

542
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,860
Or perhaps I've been so tired lately that

543
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,750
I've got a bit sentimental.

544
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,110
Hearing what you're saying,

545
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,310
I completely understand how you feel.

546
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,440
A couple of days ago, we went back to our school

547
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,400
for the high school alumni reunion.

548
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,300
As soon as I got there,

549
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,880
all those memories from back then

550
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,720
came flooding back.

551
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,650
Just as you said,

552
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,160
back then, we were

553
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,000
at the purest

554
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,950
and most carefree period.

555
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,510
After we grew up,

556
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,400
the world indeed

557
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,780
turned out to be different from what we had imagined.

558
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,230
Especially for you.

559
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,590
While you were working away from home,

560
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,640
the pressure must have been even greater.

561
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,850
It's good that you're back now.

562
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,640
You can relax a bit.

563
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,740
Not necessarily.

564
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,680
Actually, now that I'm recalling the past,

565
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,880
you've always been very tolerant

566
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,580
and considerate towards me.

567
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,370
As my husband said,

568
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,640
I may seem

569
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,830
capable and shrewd,

570
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,480
but I actually need a lot of

571
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,720
care from people around me.

572
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,440
