00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,830
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,850
It smells so good.

4
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,759
It's completely different from

5
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,800
what you usually eat.

6
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,070
Hurry up and get it done.

7
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,110
He'll be back soon.

8
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,280
I'm exhausted from

9
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,230
blowing up balloons.

10
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,050
God!

11
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,079
Your lung capacity

12
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,390
is impressive.

13
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,840
You think my police academy training was for nothing?

14
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,880
Let me show you something.

15
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,280
Oh my!

16
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,000
Impressive.

17
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,760
Keep it up.

18
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,960
Where are we at now?

19
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,710
Okay.

20
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,150
Let me know

21
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,079
as soon as the results are out.

22
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,240
I'm hanging up.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,220
I'll check this tomorrow morning.

24
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,560
♫Happy birthday to you♫

25
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,330
♫Happy birthday to you♫

26
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,450
♫Happy birthday to you♫

27
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,000
♫Happy birthday to you♫

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,260
Happy birthday, Xu!

29
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,030
Happy birthday!

30
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,680
Tongsheng,

31
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,710
blow out the candles.

32
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,360
Thank you.

33
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,990
Xu,

34
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,710
stop.

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,150
Chun and I spent the whole afternoon on this.

36
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,160
Thank you.

37
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,290
I know you don't like celebrating birthdays,

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,530
but don't you think this birthday

39
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,040
is...

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,450
is different from before?

41
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,900
What's different about it?

42
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,250
Xu.

43
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,950
Well, don't be angry.

44
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,880
Chun and I

45
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,900
just wanted to give you a surprise.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,680
That's all.

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,700
If you don't like it...

48
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,850
That's why I already said it.

49
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,140
I said thank you.

50
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,060
I'm going to rest now.

51
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,000
You two go back.

52
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,540
Tongsheng, let me explain.

53
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,800
Don't you know me?

54
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,150
Listen to me.

55
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,910
This isn't...

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,920
Chun, stop explaining to him.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,090
You want to do this, right? I'll help you!

58
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,230
Come on! Do it!

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,000
Xu Tongsheng,

60
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,500
let me make this clear.

61
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,320
You want to dig into your past,

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,560
that's your choice.

63
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,800
No one's stopping you.

64
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,530
But celebrating your birthday today

65
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,600
was my idea.

66
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,900
It has nothing to do with Chun.

67
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,390
What's wrong with you?

68
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,190
Also,

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,450
why are you taking

70
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,270
your anger out on Chun?

71
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,810
Whether I celebrate my birthday or not is my choice.

72
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,050
It has nothing to do with you, right?

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,240
So I'm an irrelevant person too, huh?

74
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,530
Shen Ye.

75
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,900
Tongsheng,

76
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,950
today, we really just wanted to...

77
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,870
Alright, no need to explain to him!

78
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,570
Let's go!

79
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,400
This... This...

80
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,720
Tomorrow is Heng's birthday.

81
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,660
Let's go to the amusement park together.

82
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,850
We're going out.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,690
We'll make you a feast when we get back tonight.

84
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,150
I... I need to use the bathroom.

85
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,040
Who is it?

86
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,240
The repairman from the shop at the entrance.

87
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,190
Your mom asked me to come here

88
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,990
to fix something.

89
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,170
He Xi, help me get the door!

90
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,780
Look at you, all messy.

91
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,920
Go get changed

92
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,850
and wash up.

93
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,950
Hello, Uncle, Auntie.

94
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,050
He Xi.

95
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,540
Where are you two going?

96
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,630
We're going to pick up some photos.

97
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,560
We'll be back soon.

98
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,360
Okay.

99
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,120
Come back early.

100
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,560
Dad.

101
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,070
What happened to you?

102
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,090
Just now, your mom and I

103
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,510
passed by a newly renovated store.

104
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,720
One of the workers

105
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,000
accidentally got me all messed up.

106
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,130
It's fine. I'll just wash it off.

107
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,400
You two come back early for dinner.

108
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,120
Okay, Uncle.

109
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,800
Let's go.

110
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,900
Look, it's good, right?

111
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:30,690
Not bad.

112
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,610
Four yuan in total.

113
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,430
Okay.

114
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,470
Oh no, I forgot to bring money.

115
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,650
What should we do?

116
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,360
Your stomach hurts again?

117
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,540
Then... you go to the bathroom.

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,840
I'll go back to get some money.

119
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,190
The money is in the drawer

120
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,140
of my bedside table.

121
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,750
Okay.

122
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,250
Step back! Step back!

123
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,340
Step back!

124
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:07,840
Marshal Gu.

125
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,110
Everyone's busy?

126
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,810
Mentor.

127
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,980
Here, let me help you with that.

128
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,920
Here.

129
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,330
No big deal.

130
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,480
I just came

131
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,980
to check in on everyone.

132
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,170
You didn't need

133
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,230
to bring so many things.

134
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,020
Hurry.

135
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,920
Hurry. Share them.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,510
Don't finish them all at once.

137
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,710
Here's the thing.

138
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,200
I just got back from a meeting at the Provincial Department.

139
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,190
The higher-ups

140
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,700
praised you all.

141
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,900
Let me relay what they said.

142
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,150
Their exact words.

143
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,620
The

144
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,010
quick response system

145
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,340
is very efficient.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,120
It is worth learning from

147
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,060
and can be further promoted.

148
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,909
Such high praise.

149
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,690
Alright.

150
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,320
I hope you all keep up the hard work.

151
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:48,960
-Yes.
-Yes.

152
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,290
Yes.

153
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,610
Hurry, get back to work.

154
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,730
If you ask me,

155
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,480
we shouldn't rely too much on this system.

156
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,150
A strong start followed by a decline is very possible.

157
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,810
What opinion do you have now?

158
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,020
No opinion at all.

159
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,490
I'm just giving a heads-up in advance.

160
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,680
Stop beating around the bush.

161
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,680
Listen,

162
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,800
this time, stepping on me won't help you.

163
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,990
We have some internal cohesion issues.

164
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,120
It's not a big deal though.

165
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,270
Cohesion issues? Who do you mean?

166
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,430
You all look pretty cohesive to me.

167
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,350
The least cohesive one here is you.

168
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,240
Come out with me.

169
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,390
And, you too.

170
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,360
See? You've got us into trouble by stepping on me.

171
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,600
You and your big mouth.

172
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,470
Let me ask you.

173
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,539
Adviser Xu...

174
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,000
hasn't been around lately?

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,260
He hasn't. So what?

176
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,720
Can't we solve cases without him?

177
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,790
Look at you.

178
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,420
I knew it.

179
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,240
Tell me,

180
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,820
what did you do to offend him?

181
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,840
Nothing.

182
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,060
Marshal Gu,

183
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,740
it's actually nothing serious.

184
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,610
I guarantee

185
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,840
they'll be fine after a while.

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,010
You can't guarantee that.

187
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,220
Xu is

188
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,790
unpredictable.

189
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,550
It's hard to get along with him.

190
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,910
I can't believe you.

191
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,100
Why are you so fussy?

192
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,790
No, Mentor,

193
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,150
I'm not fussy.

194
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,160
It's him.

195
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,870
He always asked me

196
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,020
all sorts of questions,

197
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
digging into my family history.

198
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,500
He has no sense of boundaries.

199
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,640
So I thought

200
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,210
maybe

201
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,220
he wanted to be brothers with me.

202
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:14,720
Fine,

203
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,790
let's get closer.

204
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,320
Right?

205
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,360
So I treated him better.

206
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,180
But what happened?

207
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,630
He's as changeable as the weather.

208
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,360
He can't handle relationships well.

209
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,310
That's his problem.

210
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,440
Enough.

211
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,120
Listen,

212
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,600
a hedge between keeps friendship green.

213
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,640
As for work,

214
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,900
just get the job done.

215
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,180
Fine, I'll act like a gentleman then.

216
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,440
Actually, it's not all

217
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,370
his fault.

218
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,610
Marshal Gu...

219
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,150
Wait, you have a problem too?

220
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,790
It has nothing to do with her.

221
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,850
It's my problem.

222
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,150
Look,

223
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,930
you two are both experienced officers.

224
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,830
You're not fresh out of the police academy.

225
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,280
You can't solve cohesion issues?

226
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,150
I hope when I come next time,

227
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
this won't happen again.

228
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,670
Listen,

229
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,250
the quick response team must exist

230
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,290
and must operate normally

231
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,480
and efficiently.

232
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,430
Understand?

233
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,720
Yes.

234
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:18,480
Yes.

235
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,680
You're such a handful!

236
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,640
That's what you get for talking too much.

237
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,360
Nobody asked you,

238
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,590
and you walked straight into the line of fire.

239
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,630
I can't believe you.

240
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,440
It's all your fault.

241
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,810
Electrical fires

242
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,770
are the leading cause,

243
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,950
accounting for 42.7%.

244
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,910
Next is careless use of fire.

245
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,410
Come on, everyone,

246
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,930
stop what you are doing.

247
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,780
Director Zhao.

248
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,770
I'd like to say a few words.

249
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,240
The higher-ups

250
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,860
have praised our

251
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,830
quick response system

252
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,860
with the Criminal Investigation Division.

253
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
And the Publicity Department

254
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,910
is planning a new feature

255
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,770
on us.

256
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,970
This is Deputy Director Chen

257
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,600
from the Publicity Department.

258
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,390
Let's welcome her.

259
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,310
Alright, thank you all for your hard work.

260
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,720
For our next edition

261
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,750
of The Most Outstanding Firefighter,

262
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,770
we'll select someone from the Fire Investigation Department.

263
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,140
That's great news!

264
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,870
Finally,

265
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,330
it's our Fire Investigation Department's turn.

266
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,500
Thank you.

267
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,620
Rest assured.

268
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,480
I will definitely

269
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,550
carry forward the spirit

270
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,790
of the Fire Investigation Department!

271
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,510
Can't you be a bit more low-key?

272
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,020
Let's hear what Deputy Director Chen has to say.

273
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,870
Actually,

274
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,300
I visited the division before.

275
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,420
I had interactions with Adviser Xu.

276
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,400
Isn't that perfect?

277
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,130
Tongsheng,

278
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,610
have a proper talk

279
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,540
with Deputy Director Chen.

280
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,430
Director Zhao,

281
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,610
maybe we should...

282
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,790
Excuse me.

283
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,450
Hello, this is the Fire Investigation Department.

284
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,060
[Police]

285
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,380
[Police]

286
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,150
Did you report the case?

287
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,350
Yes.

288
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,090
You're the owner?

289
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,750
Yes.

290
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,840
Your name.

291
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,380
Zhen Qiang.

292
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,370
Your age.

293
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:07,540
Male.

294
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,830
Age.

295
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,920
43 days short.

296
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,470
He asked for your age.

297
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,440
Three days short of 40.

298
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,690
It's okay.

299
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,750
Don't be nervous.

300
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,200
Just tell us

301
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,330
what happened.

302
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,750
Tell us as much as you can remember.

303
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,200
I remember...

304
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,620
today,

305
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,160
there were...

306
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,060
five girls.

307
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,790
They booked

308
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,970
a Live Action Role Playing (LARP) game at 2 p.m.

309
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,080
One...

310
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,190
of them isn't very tall.

311
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,850
She seemed to be the leader.

312
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,390
And another girl...

313
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,370
[05
Physical Evidence of the Fire Scene]

314
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,670
[05
Physical Evidence of the Fire Scene]

315
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,990
[03
Physical Evidence of the Fire Scene]

316
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,060
Hurry, give me the evidence bag.

317
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,510
Yes.

318
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,710
[02
Physical Evidence of the Fire Scene]

319
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,260
[01
Physical Evidence of the Fire Scene]

320
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,800
Captain Shen.

321
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,840
What's the situation here?

322
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,910
The person who reported the case

323
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,010
is the owner of this shop.

324
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,240
His name is Zhen Qiang.

325
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,930
He said around 2 p.m. today,

326
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,910
the deceased and four girls

327
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,470
came here to play an LARP game.

328
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,860
Later, he noticed from the surveillance room

329
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,470
that a fire broke out in the room.

330
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,340
He called the police

331
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,500
was around 3:10 p.m.

332
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,080
Firefighters discovered the victim's body

333
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,370
while putting out the fire.

334
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,970
The victim's name is Yu Fan.

335
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:13,680
Female.

336
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,060
22 years old.

337
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,870
She was a senior student at Binjiang University.

338
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,550
What about the other four girls?

339
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,600
The owner said they appeared

340
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,740
to be classmates.

341
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,960
So Huang Qi has already taken a team

342
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,360
to Binjiang University to find them.

343
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,630
The school and the students' parents

344
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,630
should also be interviewed.

345
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,100
Go.

346
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,580
Chun, what's the situation on your side?

347
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,000
The victim is female.

348
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,060
Her clothing was almost entirely burned,

349
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,610
and the tongues of her shoes were destroyed.

350
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,490
Her body sustained third-degree burns.

351
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,700
There's black residue around her mouth and nose.

352
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,210
But the strange thing is

353
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,380
her eyes

354
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,030
and eyelashes

355
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
were completely burned off.

356
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,870
Why?

357
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,130
Normally,

358
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,360
when people face a fire,

359
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,390
out of fear,

360
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,000
their natural reflex is to shut their eyes tightly.

361
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,790
So the eyelashes

362
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,100
should be protected.

363
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,820
In fire-related deaths,

364
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,710
eyelashes are usually somewhat preserved.

365
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,180
We need further autopsy results

366
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,430
to understand the full details.

367
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,750
One more thing.

368
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,850
White fragments were found

369
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,250
on the soles of her shoes.

370
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,720
But we need further testing

371
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,200
to determine

372
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,150
what exactly they are.

373
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,480
Okay.

374
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,720
The Fire Investigation Department.

375
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,900
Has the Fire Investigation Department

376
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,050
found anything?

377
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,670
First, this room

378
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,510
has major

379
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,490
fire safety issues.

380
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,260
The smoke detector is covered by construction materials,

381
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,470
making it less sensitive.

382
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,400
Second,

383
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,360
there are no clear

384
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:32,930
emergency exits

385
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,980
or escape signs in the room.

Third,

387
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,870
the props used

388
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,970
are highly flammable materials,

389
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,340
including alcohol-based flammable liquids.

390
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,860
Actually, this shop was previously ordered

391
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,180
to make corrections.

392
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,420
The owner must have been operating secretly.

393
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,080
Are there any other clues?

394
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,120
No?

395
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,490
Jiang Li, Mao Mao,

396
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,200
update us immediately

397
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,200
if anything comes up.

398
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,890
Yes, sir.

399
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,440
Chun, thank you.

400
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,030
Some of you from the Fire Investigation Department,

401
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,170
thank you as well.

402
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,650
That should be all.

403
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,620
Take him away.

404
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,890
Wait. Let me ask a few more questions.

405
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,800
You're the owner?

406
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,600
Yes.

407
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,400
Where were you when the incident occurred?

408
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,790
I was in the surveillance room.

409
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,890
I was removing my makeup while watching the monitors.

410
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,600
Where are the cameras?

411
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,480
Every room has a camera.

412
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,180
The footage is stored on the computer.

414
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,310
Captain Shen.

415
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,000
Go to the surveillance room.

416
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:26,600
Yes.

417
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,710
Put it away.

418
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,540
Everything had been fine here all along.

419
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,720
I just want to ask

420
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,360
why a fire suddenly

421
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,470
broke out.

422
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,910
You were ordered to make corrections,

423
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,230
but you continued to operate secretly.

424
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,410
This is a big venue.

425
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,720
There are so many flammable materials.

426
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,610
And you even used alcohol-based flammable liquids.

427
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,890
How could it not catch fire?

428
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,600
What are alcohol-based

429
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,320
flammable liquids?

430
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,070
Things like methanol and ethanol.

431
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,310
Officer,

432
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,380
you must investigate thoroughly.

433
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,450
Our game does have a scene

434
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,050
where alcohol is splashed around,

435
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,670
but I run

436
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,930

437
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,160
There's no way I'd use real alcohol.

438
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,140
It was just tap water.

439
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,990
Change your clothes first.

440
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,980
Take him back for questioning.

441
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,369
Go check the surveillance footage.

442
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,109
Okay.

443
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:12,859
Take him away.

444
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,680
Do I really have to go?

445
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,190
Is there no other option?

446
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,319
Is this all the footage?

447
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,650
This is all that's left.

448

Captain Shen,

449
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,150
Zhen Qiang is too stingy.

450
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,170
He only turned on the cameras

451
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,400
when there were customers.

452
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,340
And the footage older than a week

453
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,480

It was probably part of the storyline.

Tell us about your background.

I'm 22 years old.

491
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,110
I'm a local.

My mom does business.

496
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,240

I have a younger brother in high school.

How was your relationship with Yu Fan?

501
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,620
Yu Fan and I are both locals.

502
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,520
We've known each other since childhood.

503
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,520
After we went to college,

504
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,350
we became roommates.

505
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,080
Every day, we went to class together

506
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,230
and returned to the dorm together.

507
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,590
Yu Fan and I were just roommates.

508

We got along well.

510
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,230
Why did you leave after the fire started?

511
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,960
I was too scared.

512
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,550
Then someone said we should

513
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,350
go back to the dorm first.

514
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,210
So I left with them.

515
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,940
The fire was so big at that time.

516
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,440
Of course we should run far away.

00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,460
I remember Gao Yarui suggested it.

518
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,040
We were too scared at that time,

519
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,670
so we went back to the dorm together.

520
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,830
Tell us more about the people in your dorm.

521
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,930

522
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,020
Yu Fan,

523
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,680
Fang Ni, and Cheng Sisi in the dorm.

524
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,490
I usually only hung out with Yu Fan.

525
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,210
Gao Yarui moved into our room later.

526
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,220
Her family is pretty wealthy.

00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,640
She has a strong presence.

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,280
Then naturally,

529
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,680
she became the dorm leader.

Yes, I did.

734
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,240
The fire was too big at that time.

735
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,640
There was nothing we could do.

736
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,110
So I took them back to the dormitory.

00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,270
How was your relationship with Yu Fan?

738
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,530
We were roommates.

739

We got along...

740
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,610
pretty well.

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,640
Mainly...

742

00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,010
Well, one day...

745
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,750
She's coming.

746
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,790
Go, bump into her.

747
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,740
Sorry.

748
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,690
I'm sorry.

749
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,890
Look, it's red.

750
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,560
It must hurt so much.

751
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,120
Why are you so selfish?

752
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,790
Aren't you even gonna check

753
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,920
how badly you hit me?

754
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,440
But I got hit too.

755
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,690
You hit me with the books.

756
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,900
That's different!

757
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,000
Let's go to the school infirmary later

758
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,190
to check your bones.

759
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,880
You need to go with us.

760
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,150
I'm really sorry.

761
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,690
I really didn't see you.

762
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,550
Are... Are you okay?

763
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,660
I need to go

764
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,590
to class soon.

765
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,030
