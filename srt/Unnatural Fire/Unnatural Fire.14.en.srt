[Episode 14]

3
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,500
So you killed her.

4
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,470
Yes!

5
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,680
I took advantage of her guilt.

6
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,340
I made her believe

7
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,320
that we were back to

8
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,840
when I was being bullied.

9
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,820
I made her pour water.

10
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,010
Alright.

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,290
Don't be angry anymore.

12
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,740
I can't believe this.

13
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,180
I never thought she was this kind of person.

14
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,580
Is what you said true?

15
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,280
How do you even have a friend like that?

16
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,370
Yeah.

17
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,890
I treated her so well.

18
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,680
But at critical moments,

19
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,340
she's completely useless.

20
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,180
The thing is, it's just too unethical.

21
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,130
Indeed.

22
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,020
So what do you plan to do from now on?

23
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,860
Just stop associating with her. Let her do whatever she wants.

24
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,440
I'll give her the cold shoulder whenever I see her.

25
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,100
Yu Fan, your takeout.

26
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,960
Thank you.

27
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,560
I saw it and just

28
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,480
brought it back for you.

29
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,990
You can sit here and eat.

30
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:33,710
It's fine.

31
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,430
And Sisi,

32
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,280
yours.

33
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
What did you order?

34
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,430
This is really delicious.

35
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,280
It's from a Northeastern cuisine restaurant.

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,470
Hurry, try some.

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,500
Really? Can I try?

38
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,440
Of course.

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,970
I order from it often.

You can start eating.

Jin Yan.

47
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,390
What's wrong, Fan?

48
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,829
I entered the wrong room.

49
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,570
What?

50
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,770
I entered the wrong room.

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,630
Gao Yarui didn't enter the Sorrow Room.

52
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,490
I came in instead.

53
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,670
It's okay.

54
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,550
Don't show any sign of panic.

55
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,750
There's a camera inside.

56
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,780
We can't alert her.

57
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,600
In the future,

58
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,130
we still have plenty of opportunities to kill her.

59
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,240
Do you understand?

60
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,930
How could this happen?

61
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,090
Did you destroy the delayed ignition prop?

62
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,120
I... I'll blow out the candles

63
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:42,990
first.

64
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,780
I can't blow them out!

65
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,850
Hurry up.

66
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,030
Don't let it catch fire.

67
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,820
Find a way to extinguish them.

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,210
Stay out of the camera's view.

69
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,530
What's wrong, Fan?

70
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,190
You're breathing so heavily.

71
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,240
Are you out of breath?

72
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,970
Is it hot?

73
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,620
Is that room already on fire?

74
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,910
On fire?

75
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,390
Where?

76
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,960
Turn around and look at me!

77
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,440
I'm on fire!

78
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,760
I'm on fire!

79
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,920
Can you see it?

80
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,750
Gao Yarui, that bad girl,

81
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,950
is burning me!

82
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,560
She's burning me!

83
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,860
It hurts so much!

84
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,030

right?

88

You'll save me, right?

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,680
You won't just stand by and watch me die,

90
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,480
right?

91
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,460
It hurts so much!

92

You want to save me, right?

101
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,910
Save me, Fan!

102
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,160

103
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,110

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,490
There's a pot on the altar.

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,640
A pot?

107
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,240
Yes.

108
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,960
Where?

109
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,800
Look for it.

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,270
-There's a pot on the altar.

Hurry! Look for it!

112
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,180
It's so hot! I can't stand it anymore!

113
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,600
Where's the pot?

114
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,170
Hurry! Pick it up!

115
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,460
Help me put out the fire!

116
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,380
Hurry!

117
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,830
Hurry!

118
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,000
Is this it?

119
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,960
Yes! Hurry!

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,320
Don't burn her!

121
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,350
Don't be afraid!

122
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,060
Yan, I'm here to save you!

123
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,510
I'm here to rescue you!

124
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,290
Thank you.

125
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,100
Fan.

126
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,850
Don't be scared.

127
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,409
Don't be scared.

128
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,620
Don't be scared.

129
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,160
I was wrong, Yan.

130
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,160
We'll be best friends

131
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,360
forever.

132
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,340
I'm sorry!

133
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,320
I know I shouldn't

134
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,750
have taken revenge on her like that.

135
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,870
But why...

136
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,809
why couldn't I figure it out?

137
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,800
She was my best friend,

138
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,730
yet I caused her death.

139
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,030
Actually, after I did it,

140
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,480
I regretted it immediately.

141
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,150
I should have sought help from the beginning

142
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,670
instead of seeking revenge.

143
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,240
How did we become

144
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,560
like this?

145
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,910
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,080
There were others

147
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,410
involved in the plan

148
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,960
to kill Gao Yarui, right?

149
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,520
That plan was made by Yu Fan.

150
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,540
Fang Ni,

151
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Cheng Sisi,

152
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,910
and I were all involved.

153
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,930
The two of them were responsible for preparing

154
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,660
the ethanol.

155
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,440
I was in charge of preparing the sugar bottle

156
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,620
to hold the ethanol and the candles.

157
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,360
Tell us the details.

158
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,590
Actually, we...

159
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,740
already played that game before.

160
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,320
We're very familiar

161
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,720
with every part of it.

162
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,320
For the first three rounds,

163
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,940
we set up the scene.

164
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,270
By the fourth round,

165
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,520
as long as Gao Yarui entered the room,

166
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,600
she would be burned to death

167
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,060
by the pre-set

168
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,360

Jin Yan,

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,140
the age you are at now should be

177
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,710
the best time of your life.

we all

182
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,640
may encounter in life.

183
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,870
We shouldn't stay silent.

184
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,250
We shouldn't retaliate with violence!

185
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,720
Why didn't you use the law

186
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,130
to protect yourself?

187
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,840
Why didn't you trust us?

188
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,030
Why didn't you choose us?

189
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,450
All of this

190
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,120
should never have happened.

191
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,870
Now, what awaits you

192
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,070
is the judgment of the law.

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,920
We should bravely stand up against bullying,

194
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,570
actively seek help from our family,

195
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,770
school, and the police,

196
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,370
instead of remaining silent.

197
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,090
And we shouldn't become accomplices.

198
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,370
Bullying not only harms others,

199
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,980
but also comes with consequences.

200
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,820
Abusers will get what they deserve.

201
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,150
I shouldn't have been so vain,

202
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,320
chasing things beyond my means.

203
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,580
In the end, I only hurt my family and friends.

204
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,400
Everyone,

205
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,090
stop what you are doing and come here.

206
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,050
I have a few words to say.

207
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,710
You've all been working hard lately.

208
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,000
Although Binjiang University's case

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,960
is an isolated incident,

210
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,100
it has prompted many schools

211
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,550
to take bullying and students' mental health

212
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,440
more seriously.

213
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,910
Parents are also paying closer attention

214
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,250
to their children's well-being at school.

215
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,360
The case is now closed.

216
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,800
Hurry up and organize the case files.

217
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,050
Submit them as soon as possible

218
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,470
so that we can wrap this up and get some rest.

219
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,320
Get to work.

220
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,040
Captain Shen.

221
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,090
What's the final ruling

222
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,650
on this case?

223
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,090
I guess

224
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,080
Jin Yan will be charged with intentional homicide.

225
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,540
Fang Ni and Cheng Sisi will be charged

226
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,360
with attempted murder.

227
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,680
Gao Yarui will be charged with intentional injury.

228
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,050
As for the owner of the LARP game shop,

229
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,210
due to fire safety violations,

230
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,450
he won't escape criminal liability.

231
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,560
It'll give the Fire Investigation Department a proper explanation.

232
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,730
Not a single one would be let off.

233
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,550
So we can't name an LARP game shop

234
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,700
carelessly.

235
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,900
The Missing Classmate?

236
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,840
Someone really disappeared.

237
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Plus, this is

238
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,770
a case of psychological manipulation.

239
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,440
It's really weird.

240
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,550
Looks like in the future,

241
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,520
we need to do more school outreach programs.

242
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,840
I hope we can help today's young people

243
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,800
prevent such things from happening.

244
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,290
Actually, psychological manipulation

245
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,170
has a basis.

246
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,550
From the very beginning of this case,

247
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,960
Gao Yarui

248
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,320
exploited everyone's weaknesses

249
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,360
to bully and control them.

250
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,510
In the end,

251
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,210
Jin Yan took advantage

252
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,160
of Yu Fan's guilt

253
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,320
to carry out her murder plan.

254
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,350
That's right.

255
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
However, the method

256
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,270
still requires many preconditions.

257
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,000
Yu Fan's guilt towards Jin Yan

258
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,890
is one aspect.

259
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,750
Jin Yan must accurately grasp

260
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,550
and exploit this guilt.

261
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,520
But even so,

262
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,340
success isn't 100% guaranteed.

263
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,320
So,

264
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,200
she must have thought

265
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,360
if it didn't work this time,

266
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,490
she could try again

267
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,400
another time.

268
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,000
From the previous case of Ying Youchang

269
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,430
to Yu Fan's case this time,

270
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,070
it seems that psychological influence

271
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,140
is something we really need to take seriously.

272
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,270
Our Chun

273
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,390
is truly an outstanding forensic doctor.

274
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,930
Even psychology is her strong suit.

275
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,650
Stop flattering me.

276
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,150
But I still want to say

277
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,750
psychological factors

278
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,290
can actually influence

279
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,580
a person's cognition,

280
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,210
mental state, memory,

281
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,160
and many other aspects.

282
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,820
So when we handle cases in the future,

283
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,480
we should

284
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,770
pay closer attention to this aspect.

285
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,570
Memories can be affected too?

286
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,640
Theoretically, yes.

287
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,250
But like I said,

288
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,940
it still requires many preconditions.

289
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,970
Preconditions?

290
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,800
Right, Xu,

291
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,630
make sure to share

292
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,840
the relevant documents with me.

293
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,870
Huang Qi.

294
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,320
Huang Qi!

295
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,030
Yes!

296
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,170
What's wrong?

297
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,170
There's no one else in the office.

298
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,840
Can you two lower your voices?

299
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,300
Come here, keep your voice down.

300
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,860
What do you think is wrong with Captain Shen lately?

301
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,790
I don't know.

302
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,260
He seems pretty down lately.

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,710
Something's not right.

304
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,080
Could it be that he confessed to Chun

305
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,250
and was refused?

306
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,040
Don't joke about the boss.

307
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,440
But it's possible.

308
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,680
[Stay Loyal to the Party, Serve the People, Be Impartial in Law Enforcement, and Be Well-disciplined]

309
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,190
What brings you here?

310
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,070
I just delivered Luosifen noodles to Chun.

311
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,750
I brought you this.

312
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,630
[Stay Loyal to the Party, Serve the People, Be Impartial in Law Enforcement, and Be Well-disciplined]

313
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,890
Luosifen noodles?

314
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,960
You're quite thoughtful.

315
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,370
It's so hot!

316
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,680
I just filled it with boiling water.

317
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,460
I'm so unlucky today.

318
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,260
I can't even drink water without getting burned.

319
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,109
Well, what's wrong?

320
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,780
Don't even ask.

321
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,290
Ever since my dad left home,

322
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,079
nothing's gone right for me.

323
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,180
I woke up late this morning.

324
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,609
I got bird poop on my windshield.

325
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,710
From my house to the division,

326
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,930
there are 13 traffic lights in total.

327
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,030
And I hit every single red one.

328
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,099
You have very dark circles.

329
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,950
You didn't sleep well?

330
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,780
That makes me angrier.

331
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,740
As soon as night fell, my house lost power.

332
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,760
I went out and saw

333
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,040
all the other buildings had their lights on.

334
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,079
Only my house was dark.

335
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,430
Probably just a tripped circuit.

336
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,720
You think I wouldn't know if it was a tripped circuit?

337
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,250
Then maybe your electricity card has run out of credit.

338
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,490
So I use

339
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,750
an electricity card?

340
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,790
How novel!

[Stay Loyal to the Party, Serve the People, Be Impartial in Law Enforcement, and Be Well-disciplined]

My dad used to handle that.

343
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,260
Anyway, now

344
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,540
I can't take a hot shower.

345
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,940
I can't charge my phone either.

346
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,040
And my electric razor is being charged.

347
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,220
Look at my stubble.

348
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,730
My place has everything.

349
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,370
Are you trying to make me jealous?

350
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,820
Then I'll just stay at your place.

Forget it, forget it.

352
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,070
Your house

353
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,310
is practically empty.

354
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,520

Are you coming or not?

358
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,490
Yes.

359
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,260
Then I'll move in tonight.

360
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,170
I'm leaving.

00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,430
Gosh, this smell!

381
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,800
Coming.

382
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:48,750
Come.

383
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,560
You've arrived.

384
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,440
Sorry to bother you.

385
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,200
Come in.

386
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,690
Give it to me.

387
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,600
Come in.

388
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,350
No need to change your shoes.

389
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,300
He seems quite happy.

390
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,360
This is a completely different attitude from this morning.

391
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,370
I bought you some fruits.

392
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,500
How polite of you!

393
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,880
What do you think? Take a look.

394
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,910
Are you satisfied?

395
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,640
Did you buy this?

396
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,980
If you don't like it, I can change it.

397
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,050
Don't.

398
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,370
I used to believe in light too.

399
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,100
Look.

400
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,250
Me too.

401
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,000
I'll go get you some water.

402
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,000
Okay, okay.

403
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,890
He bought an Ultraman-themed one.

404
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,440
You're quite thoughtful.

405
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:29,880
You even prepared

406
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,440
slippers for dry and wet areas.

407
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,710
Gotta cover all the details.

408
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,710
This cup is also newly bought.

409
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,860
It's a gift for you.

410
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,890
Do you like it?

411
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,820
Well... even if I don't like it,

412
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,780
I should say I like it.

413
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,830
I'll go prepare some fruits for you.

414
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,310
Alright.

415
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,400
Don't bother.

416
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,870
I'll... I'll do it.

417
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,970
These are your dirty clothes?

418
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,270
I'll wash them for you.

419
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,050
Okay.

420
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,750
Just throw them

421
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,800
in the washing machine.

422
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,310
Okay.

423
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,130
This toy bear can't be washed.

424
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,690
I need to sleep with it at night.

425
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,990
My childhood photo.

426
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,050
Handsome, right?

427
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,730
He Xi.

428
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,190
He Xi.

429
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,000
He Xi, He Xi.

430
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,410
This is great.

431
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,880
This is great. You're still alive.

432
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,200
Xu, Xu, Xu.

433
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,790
Xu, let go first.

434
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,620
Let go, let go.

435
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,800
I am He Xi?

436
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,330
Yes, you are He Xi.

437
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,310
Do you remember this photo?

438
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,000
It was taken at our elementary school graduation arts performance.

439
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,300
My dad took the photo of us.

440
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,340
Xu, what kind of joke is this?

441
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,450
This photo

442
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,510
was taken by my dad when I

443
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,480
graduated from elementary school.

444
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,050
There was another person standing next to me.

445
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,370
That was my art teacher.

446
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,200
No.

447
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,620
It was not your teacher. It was me.

448
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,510
After the performance,

449
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,160
we were both at the entrance.

450
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,910
Look.

451
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,260
Think. It was us!

452
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,910
How could it be you?

453
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,550
If it was you,

454
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,550
how come I don't remember you?

455
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,910
My dad doesn't remember you either.

456
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:42,730
Right?

457
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,880
Besides, if you have the photo,

458
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,350
take it out

459
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,260
and let me see.

460
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,320
There's...

461
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,550
There's only one copy of this photo.

462
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,270
I looked for the negative

463
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,000
but couldn't find it.

464
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,970
See? You can't find it, right?

465
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,750
Let me tell you

466
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,310
how I got this photo.

467
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,380
My dad told me

468
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
when I was little,

469
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,390
I played with fire at home.

470
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,480
I almost set our house on fire.

471
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,110
This photo

472
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,170
is meant to serve as a warning to me.

473
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,990
Got it?

474
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,140
No, it's not like that.

475
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,440
Xu,

476
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,510
calm down.

477
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,830
Chun told me about what happened

478
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,910
to your family.

479
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,660
Your friend's name is He Xi, right?

480
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,480
Maybe you just miss him too much.

481
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,090
B-But I'm really not him.

482
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,470
No, no, no.

483
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,340
Afraid of dogs.

484
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,420
How do you explain that you're afraid of dogs?

485
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,460
He Xi was also afraid of dogs.

486
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,800
Well, his fear of dogs is his business.

487
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,910
My fear of dogs is a reflex.

488
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
What about this?

489
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,380
He Xi taught me this too.

490
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,340
Clip the pen cap

491
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:29,940
to tell left from right.

492
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,480
Well, bro,

493
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,510
isn't that what everyone does

494
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,240
when someone can't tell left from right?

495
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,240
That day, I had a pen cap with me.

496
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,600
So I just clipped it on you.

497
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,140
Why can't you remember?

498
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,790
You are He Xi!

499
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,590
What exactly happened to you?

500
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,400
Think harder!

501
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,630
It was really me in the photo!

502
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,410
Xu, Xu,

503
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,910
let's both calm down, okay?

504
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:43,920
Okay?

505
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,640
How about this?

506
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,770
After you wake up tomorrow,

507
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,440
take another look at me.

508
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,660
See if I look like him, okay?

509
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,400
You...

510
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,300
I was busy with work all day.

511
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,240
I want to take a shower.

512
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,110
Okay?

513
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,010
Why?

514
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,410
Why can't he remember?

515
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,470
Shen Yi.

516
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,440
He's not dead?

517
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:11,460
[Specimen Management Rules in the Autopsy Room]

518
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,010
You're not joking with me, are you?

519
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,240
Shen Ye

520
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,810
is He Xi?

521
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,920
Didn't you say

522
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,850
he died in the fire back then?

523
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,530
How did he escape?

524
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,480
I don't know how he

525
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,330
survived.

526
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,830
He doesn't remember that either.

527
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,070
This is too sudden.

528
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,330
It's too incredible.

529
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,760
Your childhood friend

530
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,550
died in a fire,

531
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,220
but actually, he didn't die.

532
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,190
And he has become your colleague.

533
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,520
And he's Shen Ye.

534
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,350
So this is very important to me.

535
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,110
There's one more thing.

536
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,470
In the previous case,

537
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,880
Ying Youchang couldn't stand up

538
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,050
because of PTSD.

539
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,510
Is it the same for Shen Ye?

540
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,500
According to what you said,

541
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,480
if Shen Ye really is He Xi,

542
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,160
it's not

543
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,000
PTSD.

544
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,330
It should be...

545
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,820
psychogenic amnesia

546
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,300
triggered by trauma.

547
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,130
It's a psychological

548
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,880
defense mechanism to avoid pain.

549
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,210
To Shen Ye,

550
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,880
that explosion

551
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,960
was a huge blow.

552
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,960
He couldn't accept

553
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,480
the sudden change,

554
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,830
so he automatically chose

555
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,110
to forget that

556
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,680
to avoid the pain.

557
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,510
Then how can we help him

558
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,480
recover his memories?

559
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,370
The most direct way is

560
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,740
to go to the hospital.

561
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,100
I'll arrange it now.

562
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,040
Wait a moment.

563
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,930
No rush.

564
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:48,970
Come, sit down.

565
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,250
Don't be so anxious.

566
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,960
Let me finish.

567
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,540
When you told Shen Ye

568
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,680
that he is He Xi,

569
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
how did he react?

570
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,780
Did he think you were crazy?

571
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,190
In this matter,

572
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,240
you believe Shen Ye is He Xi

573
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:06,830
and he has amnesia.

574
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,790
It won't help.

575
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,980
Whether it's professional treatment

576
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,270
or medication intervention,

577
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,240
he must voluntarily

578
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,000
accept a medical diagnosis.

579
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,410
What if he doesn't accept it?

580
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,540
His current life path is wrong.

581
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,270
We need to help him

582
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,470
get back on the right path.

583
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,100
Listen to yourself!

584
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,700
Is he a child?

585
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,340
He's an adult.

586
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,110
He doesn't need you

587
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,930
to make choices for him.

588
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,180
Whether his life path is wrong

589
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,060
is not for you to judge either.

590
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,000
Besides,

591
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,500
he's not alone now.

592
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,760
He has a family.

593
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,750
He has a father.

594
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,250
Shen Ye's father treats him very well.

595
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,430
Everyone in the division knows that.

596
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,860
He takes care of him with great attention.

597
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,460
Their father-son relationship is very harmonious.

598
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,240
Shen Yi isn't his biological father.

599
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,070
Is it that important

600
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,200
whether he's his biological father or not?

601
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,680
What's important is

602
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,030
how Shen Yi treats Shen Ye.

603
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,220
You don't have any evidence to prove

604
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,220
that the current life

605
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,770
is harmful to Shen Ye.

606
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,000
Right?

607
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,090
Chun,

608
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,900
all these years,

609
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,070
I owe him.

610
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,650
Back then,

611
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,220
if I hadn't called him to my house,

612
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,880
and if I were the one who went back

613
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,720
for the money,

614
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,750
he wouldn't have...

615
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,450
he wouldn't have been burned to death.

616
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,520
I thought I would never have...

617
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,590
have a chance to make it up to him.

618
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,720
But now he's back.

619
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,180
I'm glad he's He Xi.

620
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,680
Because this way,

621
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,160
I'll have a chance to make it up to him.

622
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,500
Shen Ye has had amnesia for many years.

623
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,850
It's not easy to recover

624
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,850
his memories.

625
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,920
It takes a long time

626
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,230
and needs the right time.

627
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,180
Maybe tomorrow,

628
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,360
he could recover his memories.

629
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,000
But it's also possible

630
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
that he might never

631
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,200
remember for the rest of his life.

632
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,380
Are you ready

633
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,050
to accept all the outcomes?

634
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,930
No matter what the outcome is,

635
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,460
I will do my best.

636
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,150
So,

637
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,990
help me.

638
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,120
Right now, the most suitable treatment for Shen Ye

639
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,260
is subtle psychological therapy.

640
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,660
You can try

641
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,910
to think about the scenes

642
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,070
of your past life together

643
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,810
and reenact those scenes

644
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,020
to trigger his memories.

645
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,970
Reenact those scenes?

646
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,800
However, this method

647
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,680
may not work.

648
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,750
Because you need to find

649
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,390
Shen Ye's trigger spot.

650
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,750
The trigger spot is not easy to find.

651
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,960
Maybe what you think

652
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,450
is an important thing

653
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,820
won't trigger any reaction.

654
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,930
Or

655
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,100
he might recover part of his memories

656
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,360
but forget it again soon after.

657
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,420
And maybe

658
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,920
his trigger spot

659
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,210
is not a specific event,

660
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,550
but a person

661
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,790
or an object.

662
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,430
In any case,

663
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,750
you need a lot of

664
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,750
patience and time.

665
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,420
Chun,

666
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,210
I queued for a long time

667
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,400
to buy this stinky tofu.

668
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,690
Try it while it's hot.

669
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,150
Thanks.

670
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,970
Um...

671
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,050
do you still think I look like him today?

672
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,330
I was too anxious yesterday.

673
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:37,930
It's okay.

674
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,160
I... I can understand.

675
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,740
I didn't take it to heart.

676
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,920
I understand.

677
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,270
About your case,

678
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,280
if there's anything you need,

679
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,420
feel free to ask me anytime.

680
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,520
Right, Chun,

681
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,510
um... are you free tomorrow?

682
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Let's go out for a meal together.

683
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,270
A new restaurant

684
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,470
recently opened nearby.

685
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,000
A new restaurant?

686
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,110
What kind of cuisine?

687
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,300
Home-style dishes.

688
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,650
Let's go hiking instead.

689
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,160
The Changli Mountain.

690
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,480
It's close to the downtown.

691
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,110
The Changli Mountain?

692
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,400
No.

693
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,480
Let's go have a meal.

694
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:08,960
Danggui said

695
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,350
their food is really good.

696
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,410
No, let's go hiking.

697
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,160
I was planning to go hiking.

698
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,140
Perfect.

699
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,530
We can eat anytime.

700
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,400
Let's go hiking together.

701
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,870
Hiking is so tiring.

702
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,610
I've been quite tired lately.

703
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,360
Why don't you two go without me?

704
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,660
I'll pass.

705
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,940
Well... I have something to do.

706
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:29,980
I should get going.

707
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,030
What time should we meet tomorrow?

708
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,500
Anytime is fine. It's up to you.

709
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:37,650
How about this?

710
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,660
At 8:50 a.m. tomorrow.

711
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,750
Since neither of you has a car,

712
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,750
I'll pick you up.

713
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,070
Chun, hurry up!

714
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,480
Otherwise, it'll be time for lunch!

715
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,670
Hold my bag for me.

716
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,740
Let's go.

717
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,949
How much stuff did you bring?

718
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,449
Get in the car from this side.

719
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,870
This place is really nice.

720
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,980
Why didn't I find this place earlier?

721
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,420
Because you hadn't met me earlier.

722
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,030
If you had, I would have brought you here long ago.

723
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,380
I found a really beautiful place

724
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,230
when I was making a hiking strategy yesterday.

725
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,510
I'm not sure where it is.

726
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,050
Let me see.

727
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,830
It's the mountaintop for sure.

728
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,460
How about this?

729
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,239
Since we're already here,

730
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,590
let's have a competition.

731
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,820
Let's see who can reach the top first.

732
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,430
The last one to arrive there should treat us to a meal.

733
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,440
When we arrive

734
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,190
at the place you want to go,

735
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,000
tell me.

736
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,500
I can't lose!

737
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,900
He's quite happy.

738
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,250
God!

739
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,650
I can't do this.

740
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,210
Wait, wait.

741
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,740
Hold on, hold on.

742
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,970
Let's rest for a while.

743
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,290
Listen,

744
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,280
I just did leg day yesterday.

745
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,690
Otherwise,

746
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,540
I would be at the top already.

747
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,170
Stop making excuses.

748
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,950
Let's rest for a bit then.

749
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,470
You're even weaker than me.

750
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,550
Listen,

751
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,760
you two are professionals.

752
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,190
Look at you two—

753
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,390
fully equipped.

754
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,880
And look at what I'm wearing.

755
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,290
They say this place is really nice.

756
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,070
Look at the pavilion,

757
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,350
the bamboo forest,

758
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,370
the waterfall, and the stream.

759
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,100
Right?

760
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,650
It's so picturesque!

761
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,800
Of course.

762
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,330
Let's rest for a bit.

763
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,350
You two professionals,

764
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,740
give me some food and drinks.

765
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,070
This is when you need me.

766
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,730
The whole bag is full of snacks.

767
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,750
Give me the camera.

768
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,520
Alright.

769
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,580
You two stay here.

770
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,510
Wait for me here.

771
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,280
I'm going to take a look around.

772
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,040
I'll be back soon.

773
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,880
Be careful.

774
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,420
This is indeed better than staying at home.

775
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,030
This is your first time here?

776
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,710
Indeed.

777
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,730
I've lived in Beixun for so many years,

778
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,870
but this really is my first time here.

779

Last time I went to your house,

783
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,730
I saw your childhood drawings.

784
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,440
You were really good.

785
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,550
Why did you stop drawing when you grew up

786
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,560
and become a police officer instead?

787
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,330
Liking to draw as a kid

788
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,680
doesn't mean I have to do it

789
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,030

790
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,920
That's true.

Being a police officer is great.

792
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,000
You can protect the people around you.

793
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,990

What about you?

795
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,600
Did you ever think about

796
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,710
what you wanted to be when you grew up?

797
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,560
Me?

798
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,530
I wanted to be a scientist

799
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,600
and build a robot.

800
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,260

801
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,460

802
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,210

805
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,860
and understand everything you say.

806
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,900
With it, you'll never feel lonely.

807
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,050
I want to be a police officer in the future.

808

809
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,370
and protect everyone around me.

810
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,990
Then go for it, Captain He.

811

Impossible.
