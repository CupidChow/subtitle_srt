00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,120
so I got a bit greedy.

195
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,830
But I really meant well.

196
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,150
I saw that everyone

197
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,690
was making money from the tourists,

198
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,270
so I wanted to ask him to join me.

199
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,070
He worked hard all day raising cattle,

200
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
yet he didn't earn much money.

201
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,680
I wanted to rent his house

202
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,050
and run a homestay together.

203
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,550
I'd pay for the renovations,

204
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,550
and we'd split the profits

205
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,330
fifty-fifty.

206
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,580
Wasn't that a good deal?

207
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,960
He didn't refuse me outright at the time

208
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,120
and hesitated a bit.

209
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,400
He said their

210
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,310
cow was about to give birth

211
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,650
and wanted to talk about it later.

212
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,500
As bad luck would have it,

213
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,800
I had a guest

214
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,560
who got drunk at night...

215
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,750
and threw a bottle

216
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,680
into their yard.

217
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,650
That pregnant cow got startled,

218
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,080
had a difficult labor,

219
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,120
and the calf died.

220
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,400
I felt really bad about it too.

221
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,789
I knew

222
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,080
that the calf growing up

223
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,590
might have been

224
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,490
their family's income for the entire year.

225
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,480
I compensated them right away.

226
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,150
I thought

227
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,120
that would be the end of it.

228
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,510
But as more visitors came...

229
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,960
they got more demands.

230
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,840
One day, a kid

231
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,750
insisted on setting off firecrackers, no matter what.

232
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,850
You know, the customer is king,

233
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,910
so we couldn't refuse.

234
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,450
But when they set them off...

235
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,080
all the cattle in the yard were startled.

236
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,030
He spent the whole night soothing them.

237
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,960
From that point on...

238
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,910
our feud was established.

239
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,940
Every time I had guests at my place,

240
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,840
he would throw cow dung into our yard.

241
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,650
Liu Bo!

242
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,700
Liu Bo!

243
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,210
You guys go ahead.

244
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,970
What's wrong?

245
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,020
It's the middle of the night,

246
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,530
and you're making such a racket.

247
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,840
You don't sleep,

248
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,330
but our cattle need to sleep.

249
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,420
Your cattle are sleeping?

250
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,030
Bullshit.

251
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,910
How can they sleep amidst all this noise?

252
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,950
Then you should go back to sleep too.

253
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,870
It's not like I'm deliberately trying

254
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,250
to keep your cattle awake.

255
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,080
Customers are king.

256
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,960

257
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,790
No "king"

258
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,270
should be making noise like that.

259
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,120
Alright, buddy.

260
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,530
Don't start trouble.

261
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,660
Go home and get some sleep.

262
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,080
How am I supposed to sleep with all this noise...

263
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,900
Let's continue!

264
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,640

265
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,620
Liu Bo!

266
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,940

[Farmhouse Inn]

268
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,400
Sir,

269
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,840
your music is way too loud.

270
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,290
We can't sleep at all!

271
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,120
I'm so sorry.

272
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm really sorry.

273
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,720
Give me five minutes.

274
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,360
I'll take care of it right away.

275
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,540
Please go back inside and rest.

276
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm so sorry.

277
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,600
What the hell?

278
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,750
Sorry, sorry.

279

He Lin.

280
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,830

We're still trying to sleep here.

283
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,340
Experts say

284
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,790
that listening to music

285
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,810
makes the cattle's meat more tender.

286
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
I'm not playing it at your place.

287
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,240
Why are you making such a fuss?

288
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,060
Fine.

289
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,040
This is not over.

290

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,690
drinking tea kills you faster.

292
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,030
Go to hell.

00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,600
My inn

of the entire village.

and choose our place

and affordable.

00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,510
And they all sleep well and eat well at my place.

303
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:05,910
Rest assured.

304
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,180
I will definitely provide you with...

305
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,100
He Lin,

306
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,980
what are you doing?

307
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,080
I'm working. Can't you tell?

308
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,070
No, no, no, guys,

309
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,150
look, we're almost there.

310
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,400
We're all almost there.

311
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,880
Well, what kind of person would do that?

312
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,070
He didn't do a homestay,

313
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,440
yet he kept getting in the way of me making money.

314
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,740
I have a bad temper too,

315
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,080
so I got into a feud with him.

316
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,670
I just felt

317
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,190
that he couldn't stand to see me doing well.

318
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,590
But even so, you shouldn't have dug up his family's grave.

319
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,730
Whose idea was that?

320
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,370
Mine.

321
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,620
Who did it?

322
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,440
You hit the Fire Goddess.

[Imperial Ancestral Temple]

324
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,680
Who did that?

325
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,930
If she were really a goddess,

326
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,600
she would have dodged it.

327
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,840
The Fire Goddess will no longer bless you.

328
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,320
Oh my, oh my, oh my!

329
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,440
Enough, enough!

330
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,620
You really believe this stuff, huh?

331
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,680
Since the Fire Goddess wouldn't bless him anymore...

332
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,070
I wanted to make it even bigger.

333
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,870
Plus, before that,

334
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,140
he had thrown the bone at the shamaness.

335
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,160
I just wanted to get back at him

336
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:24,910
and make his life miserable.

337
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,760

339
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,620
I really had no other choice...

340
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,200
so I dug up his uncle.

341
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,360
So, how did you

342
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,270
get involved in this case?

343
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,150
What case?

344
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,910
I wasn't involved in any case.

345
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,100

347
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,370
I...

348
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,900
I gave Liu Bo a real scolding.

349
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,840
I said, "What are you doing?

00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,520
Then he said

357
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,480
that he was going to throw something

358
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,640
into Lin's yard.

359
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,020
And then,

360
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,600
he asked me to make up a story.

361
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,030
Something like, "See?

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,970
I really just wanted to scare him a little.

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,580
Who would have thought

373
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,290
it would actually summon the ghost fire?

374
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,570
You didn't start that fire?

375
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,000
Of course, I didn't start it.

376
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,390
If a fire starts,

377
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,120
that would become a completely different matter.

378
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,560
How could I possibly do such a thing?

379
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,880
I really just wanted to scare him a little

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,760
I'm receiving a tour group.

383
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,390
If all goes well, I could earn more than 10,000 yuan.

384
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,550
How could I have set it?

385
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,180
That was really the Fire Goddess demonstrating her divine power.

386
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,400
You young people

387
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,070
shouldn't be so skeptical.

388
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,050
It was really the Fire Goddess.

389
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,480
Otherwise, why would there suddenly be

390
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,510
a display of divine power,

391
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,800
with sacred fire appearing out of nowhere?

392
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,690
Why else would

393
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,680
it only burn Lin's cattle shed

394
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,830
while nothing happened to other houses?

395
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,190
What Fire Goddess?

396
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,800
There are no ghosts or gods in this world.

397
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,570
All good and evil originate in the human heart.

398
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,850
Liu Bo.

399
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,570
Liu Qiao.

400
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,960
You are suspected of desecration,

401
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,990
theft,

402
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,360
and intentional damage to human remains.

403
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,720
You used feudal superstition

404
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,800
to disrupt social order.

405
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,820
You will face the punishment you deserve.

406
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,980
You young people...

407
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,840
Adviser Xu,

408
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,690
the lab results are out.

409
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,230
There's indeed a problem with the soil samples.

410
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,520
We found

411
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,460
traces of ethanol residue

412
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,460
at a very high concentration.

413
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,480
This isn't something villagers

414
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,880
would typically use when visiting graves.

[Test Report]

416
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,700
Looks like you already have a theory.

417
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,780
Let's hear it.

418
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,870
Phosphine is slightly soluble in water

419
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,880
but dissolves in ethanol.

420
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,090
And we found

421
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,060
these

422
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,470
high concentrations of ethanol residue at the scene.

[Test Report]

424
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,670
This means we can't rule out the possibility

425
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,390
that someone prepared

426
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,720
phosphine dissolved in ethanol.

427
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,930
As the ethanol evaporated,

428
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,840
the phosphine spontaneously ignited,

429
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,000
creating the illusion of ghost fire.

430
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,760
In reality,

431
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,730
it was just arson.

432
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,820
Good analysis.

433
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,990
Well done.

434
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,880
I've taken another historic step

435
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,460
toward becoming like my idol.

436
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,810
Then, Adviser Xu,

437
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,930
I'll go write the report now.

438
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,260
Wait a moment.

439
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,420
The method part

440
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,510
indeed has no problems.

441
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,720
We have the blessing performance tomorrow,

442
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,960
but will the ghost fire appear?

443
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,630
Look, our inn is fully booked.

444
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,850
The guests are expecting a show!

445
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,040
Let's do this:

446
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,340
tonight,

447
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,880
come with me to Liu Village.

448
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,060
-Yes.
-Yes.

449
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,230
Idol.

450
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,210
Look at the village

451
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,020
bustling with people for the market.

452
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,610
But look at us here.

453
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,730
The cold wind is whistling,

454
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,610
making my back shiver.

455
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,910
What wind?

456
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,350
The weather forecast said there'd be no wind.

457
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,520
Do you think

458
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,270
anyone will actually show up?

459
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,890
They should, probably.

Let go of me!

Let go of me!

00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,500

That's the sacred fire of our Liu Village!

Don't step on it!

473
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,880
So, it was you

474
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,860
using phosphine to create ghost fire.

475
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,470
That's not ghost fire.

476
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,800
That's the sacred fire

477
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,630
bestowed upon our Liu Village by the Fire Goddess!

478
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,610
You can't do this!

479
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,980
We've been filming here for a while

480
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,390
and have brought testing equipment too.

481
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,420
Still going to deny it?

482
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,720
Your village doesn't need ghost fires and spirit dancing

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,840

485
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,310
leave the rest to us.

486
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,900
I've noted down everything you said.

487
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,110
When he arrives later, speak properly

488
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,140
and mind your attitude.

489
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,680
Yes, Officer.

490
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,500
Liu Lu,

00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,160
they say

492
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,680
it was you who burned down our cattle shed.

493
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,660
Is that true?

494
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,320
I'm just raising my cattle.

495
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,580
How have I offended you?

496
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,960
Is it really necessary for you all

497
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,060
to target me like this, one after another?

498
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,440
First, it was my uncle,

499
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,430
and then it was arson.

500
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,950
What the hell do you want?

501
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,160
Calm down first.

502
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,040
I've gathered you here today

503
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,720
just to

504
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,610
understand the situation

505
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,780
and help resolve your issues.

506
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,890
How can it be resolved?

507
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,850
Just sentence him as you did Liu Bo!

508
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,120
Lock him up!

509
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,550
Calm down.

510
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,440
Let's sit down first.

511
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,080
No, He...

512
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,720
It's like this.

513
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,720
The situations of Liu Lu and Liu Bo

514
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,600
are quite different.

515
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,850
Let us briefly explain

516
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,070
the overall situation to you.

517
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,270
Go ahead.

518
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,130
The reason your village

519
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,180
had ghost fires so frequently

520
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,170
is that

521
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,480
Liu Lu was trying to attract tourists

522
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,920
by artificially creating them.

523
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,440
Now I get it.

524
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,920
So, you and Liu Qiao

525
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,390
were in this together, right?

526
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,600
All that supernatural nonsense, just to deceive people, right?

527
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,420
Fine, you can have your ghost fires all you like,

528
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,290
but why burn down our cattle shed?

529
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,620
He,

530
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,960
you have to believe me.

531
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,990
I swear to heaven,

532
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,170
I really don't know how that ghost fire

533
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,680
ended up drifting to your place.

534
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,720
He Lin,

535
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,230
after our investigation, it was indeed

536
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,640
an accident that Liu Lu burned down

537
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,070
your cattle shed.

538
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,360
Liu Lu,

539
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,450
no matter what,

540
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,640
you must compensate

541
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,860
He Lin for his cattle shed

542
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,770
and bear

543
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,830
the corresponding legal responsibility.

544
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,440
Officer...

545
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,750
I'll take responsibility.

546
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,690
I'll compensate.

547
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,450
I'll use my own money to compensate.

548
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,470
I didn't admit it before

549
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,430
because if I had,

550
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,600
and people found out I'd set the ghost fire,

551
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,160
no one would visit our village anymore.

552
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,130
No tourists

553
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,210
mean no income for everyone.

554
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,890
I was really trying to do what's best for our villagers!

555
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,340
He,

556
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,210
I'm sorry. I apologize.

557
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,590
I'm sorry.

558
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,480
Enough, enough, enough.

559
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,610
You're not young anymore.

560
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,220
Look what you have done.

561
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,670
Currently,

562
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,440
your village

563
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,340
still has naturally occurring ghost fires.

564
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,460
The solution you previously sprayed

565
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,310
still poses

566
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,910
a significant fire hazard.

567
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,230
We will work with the fire department

568
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,770
to thoroughly eliminate these risks.

569
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,570
Thank you, Officer.

570
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,130
I'm sorry.

571
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,550
He, I'm sorry.

It's all your fault.

You moved away for work right after graduation.

629
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,680
specifically came back to Beixun?

630
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,660
No.

I missed my hometown here.

There happened to be an opportunity to come back,

to be promoted to consultant lawyer,

636
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,180
so I accepted it.

So, from now on,

638
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,070

exceptionally outstanding.

She is your good friend.

666
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,320
I definitely trust her abilities.

667
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,380
Thank you, Senior.

668

Senior,

679
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,430
your speech just now was really good.

680
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,720
One can sure tell

681
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,500
that you've spent some time abroad.

682
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,920
You've got a whole new vibe coming back.

683
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,830
Alright, alright.

684
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,230
Stop teasing me.

685
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,990
But honestly,

686
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,610
coming back this time...

687
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,810
makes me feel quite a lot.

688
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,450
So many years have passed,

689
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,590
yet everything remains the same.

690
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,700
If you're not in a hurry,

691
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,160
let's

692
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,310
take a walk around the campus together.

693
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,110
Senior,

694
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,240
I suddenly remembered something.

695
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,850
Do you remember

696
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,250
when we were in high school,

697
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,190
we buried time capsules together?

698
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,110
I remember.

699
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,580
Then, let's go find them together

700
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,760
and see if they are still there.

701
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,160
Let's go.

702
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:28,920
Let's go look for it.

703
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,470
Okay.

704
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,240
If I remember correctly,

705
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,480
it should be around here.

706
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:52,770
Come on.

707
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,490
My memory is still pretty sharp, right?

708
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,540
Of course,

709
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,860
you're a big-shot lawyer after all.

710
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,070
What's wrong?

711
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,620
Senior.

712
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,850
I remember that back then

713
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,140
I buried one too.

714
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,440
Where did I bury mine?

715
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,850
You buried one too?

716
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,230
Yeah.

717
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,810
No, wasn't it

718
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,680
that I buried one,

719
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,810
and you buried one too?

720
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,200
Yours is under this tree.

721
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,910
Where did I bury mine...

722
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,210
Jin Chun,

723
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,200
even though this happened

724
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,660
18 years ago,

725
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,850
you don't think it's been so long

726
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,000
that I can't remember it clearly, do you?

727
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,640
Well, time capsules

728
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,070
are really something magical.

729
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,970
The moment we dig it out,

730
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,680
it instantly takes me

731
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,790
back to the past.

732
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,030
I remember at that time,

733
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,720
my family

734
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,150
was going through a lot.

735
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,760
Even when I was at school,

736
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,480
I felt miserable.

737
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,190
The only truly happy time

738
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,530
I had was when we

739
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,430
prepared for the graduation ceremony together

740
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,350
before I

741
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,960
went abroad.

742
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,720
So I remember it very clearly.

743
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,630
I always thought...

744
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,080
you felt the same way.

745
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,760
Of course.

746
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,610
Co-hosting the graduation ceremony with you, Senior,

747
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,430
is one of...

748
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,910
my happiest memories.

749
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,980
Then how could you forget?

750
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,240
At that time,

751
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,750
we only buried one time capsule.

752
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,510
We put the things we both wrote

753
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,310
in this one

754
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,700
time capsule.

755
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,310
Look.

756
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,810
This is mine.

757
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,050
Jin Chun, here's yours.

758

[Jin Chun]

759
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,550
Senior,

760
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,470
look at my memory.

761
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,250
I really remembered it wrong.

762
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,390
I'm really sorry.

763
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,510
It's okay.

764
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,310
After all, it's been so long.

765
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,250
Just, Junior,

766
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,030
don't doubt

767
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,910
my memory again.

768
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,210
I'm not doubting you.

769
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,230
I really just remembered it wrong.

770
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,200
How about this:

771
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,280
I'll make it up to you.

772
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,940
Let me treat you to dinner tonight,

773
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,530
okay?

774
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,890
I'm afraid that tonight won't work.

775
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,450
I have plans for tonight.

776
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,760
How about...

777
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,660
Last time I invited you to boxing, and you couldn't make it.

778
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,730
This Saturday,

779
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,750
let's go boxing.

780
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,440
How does that sound?

781
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,390
Sure, no problem.

782
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,560
I'll definitely make it this time.

783
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,270
Okay.

784
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,980
Adviser Xu,

785
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,550
the roll of film that you had someone send over last time

786
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,470
has been developed.

787
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,490
I'll send them to you.

788
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,460
This person

789
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,200
looks a bit like a coworker

790
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,460
I knew when I was young.

791
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,350
But the age difference is too big,

792
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,690
so this probably isn't the same person.

793
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,750
You guys go to Liu Village.

794
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,820
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

795
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,830
Come in.

796
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,640
Ms. Du, someone is here to see you.

797
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,720
Danning.

798
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,620
Senior?

799
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,970
Please, have a seat.

800
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,680
Thank you.

801
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,040
You've got a nice office here.

802
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,750
It's alright.

803
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,720
Here.

804
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:03,790
Thank you.

805
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,370
Senior,

806
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,640
what brings you here today?

807
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,650
We're old classmates,

808
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,310
so I'll get straight to the point.

809
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,690
Ever since I came back to the country,

810
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,600
I've been dealing with

811
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,960
various family matters.

812
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,440
I've run into a bit of trouble recently.

813
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,720
As luck would have it, I ran into you the other day.

814
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,920
So, I wanted to ask you...

815
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,720
if you could represent me.

816
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,720
I have quite a lot of work

817
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,400
on my plate recently.

818
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,830
But if it's from you,

819
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,140
Senior Han Jun,

820
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,400
I'll definitely make time for it.

821
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,140
That's great.

822
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:35,790
Senior,

823
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,750
you can briefly tell me

824
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,720
the issue you're facing.

825
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,690
Okay.

826
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,810
So, here's the thing.

827
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,790
Our group has

828
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,970
a processing factory.

829
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,020
Take a look.

830
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,860
This is the relevant information.

831
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,980
It mainly produces...

832
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,390
cheese sticks.

833
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,610
A child

834
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,920
has eaten one of our cheese sticks

835
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,310
and had some reactions.

836
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,220
Because I don't think

837
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,070
there's anything wrong

838
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,070
with our product.

839
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,790
It's clearly written here.

840
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,480
Every standard of our products

841
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,670
meets the national

842
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,440
food safety law

843
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,200
regulations.

844
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,750
Chun,

845
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,200
thank you for coming today

846
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,240
to be our mainstay.

847
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,070
Without my idol here,

848
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,330
I wouldn't feel confident.

849
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,270
It's nothing.

850
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,400
I'm just here to help out.

851
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,400
Where did your idol go?

852
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,960
He said he had something urgent to attend to,

853
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,200
but what exactly he went to do,

854
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,130
I... I don't know.

855
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,070
Alright, when we get there,

856
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,880
we'll divide the work by zones,

857
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,270
okay?

858
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,240
-Okay.
-Yes.

859
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:33,870
Yah yah.

860
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,430
Yes, yes.

861
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,430
I always feel like I've seen him somewhere before.

862
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,510
He looks exactly the same as him.

863
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,940
What's his name?

864
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,930
His name is...

865
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,890
Li Daqiang.

866
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,100
His name is Li Daqiang.

867
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,400
When you showed it to me last time,

868
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,620
I thought they

869
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,120
looked exactly alike.

870
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,870
Does this Li Daqiang have a son?

871
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,120
He has a son.

872
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,340
He has a son.

873
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:00,800
Where does he live?

874
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,630
That building...

875
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,980
He lives...

876
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,600
there, just down this way.

877
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,900
Okay, thank you.

878
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,950
Don't mention it.

879
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,390
Who are you?

880
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,770
You knew my dad?

881
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,030
Yeah,

882
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,000
I knew him a long time ago.

883
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,030
How's your dad doing now?

884
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,870
He died a long time ago.

885
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,250
You won't find him.

886
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,840
I'm not here to find him.

887
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,430
I just wanted to ask...

888
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,920
did you and your dad

889
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,660
do the same jobs at the factory?

890
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,670
I don't know.

891
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,470
I don't know what my father

892
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,370
used to do.

893
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,190
But me,

894
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,120
I'm just a gatekeeper.

895
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:14,990
How did your dad die?

896
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,620
He got sick.

897
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,640
He died at the small clinic

898
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,380
in the village.

899
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,550
If he was sick,

900
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,080
why didn't he go to a bigger hospital?

901
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,160
I don't know either.

902
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,750
None of our family has ever been to

903
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,720
a hospital outside the village.

904
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,510
Why?

905
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,320
We just can't go.

906
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,370
Not just the hospitals outside,

907
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,240
but other places outside the village

908
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
are also forbidden.

909
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,160
We can't go anywhere.

910
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,890
My mom said

911
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,100
we must stay in the village.

912
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,720
That's the only way to eat well, drink well,

913
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,470
and live well.

914
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,120
So, I just listen to my mom.

915
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,000
Do you know Fan Yi?

916
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,790
Uncle Fan?

917
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,710
Uncle Fan...

918
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,610
Actually, I

919
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,170
didn't know him before.

920
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,170
He came back

921
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,600
to the village only last year.

922
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,510
But Uncle Fan is very nice to me.

923
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,580
What's his family situation?

924
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,160
He has a wife.

925
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,990
That auntie is also very nice to me.

926
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,450
She gives me snacks.

927
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,110
And they have a son

928
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
who's in high school.

929
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,610
I heard

930
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,920
he's doing quite well in his studies.

931
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,790
Okay, thank you.

932
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,410
Who is it?

933
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,540
What are you doing?

934
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,640
Because of your son,

935
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,140
I'm giving you one last chance.

936
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,970
Are you kidding me?

937
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,470
I've told you to leave me alone!

938
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,810
I don't know anything!

939
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,510
You, you...

940
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,840
Eighteen years ago,

941
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,489
you and Li Si's father were coworkers,

942
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,219
working together at the Ducheng Processing Factory.

943
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,090
Just because you both knew

944
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,540
what was really hidden in the basement,

945
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,510
the factory

946
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,940
wouldn't let you leave the village.

947
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,370
When you get sick,

948
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,260
you can only go to the village clinic.

949
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,739
Your children

950
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,219
can only attend the village school.

951
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,290
Is that it?

952
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
What, what...

Twenty years ago,

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,530
he resigned due to a

995

The victim of that explosion

00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,840
was He Runian.

have sunk into the ground.

1003
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,070
So I suspect

1004
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,480
that someone has tampered with that grave.

1005
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,130
Then, when digging up the coffin,

1006
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,820
they removed the tombstone,

1007
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,330
and when putting it back,

1008
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,790
they found the hole was loose,

1009
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,760
so they dug deeper.

1010
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,190
But what's more bizarre is...

1011
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,030
the person buried in this grave

1012
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,670
is He Runian.

1013
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,840
He Runian?

1014
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,630
I looked into it later.

1015
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,800
This He Runian

1016
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,230
died in a

1017
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,520
laboratory explosion back then.

1018
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,970
So I'm wondering

1019
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,770
if it might be because of that explosion

1020
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,770
that someone has tampered with his grave.

1021
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,440
If that's the case,

1022
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,630
there's definitely something fishy going on.

1023
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,280
What do you plan to do?

1024
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,560
Open the grave

1025
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,480
and investigate thoroughly.

1026
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,450
And I've checked.

1027
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,580
He Runian's only recorded relative

1028
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,090
is his mother.

1029
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,440
This elderly lady

1030
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,200
also suffers from Alzheimer's disease.

1031
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,880
So if we want to open the grave,

1032
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,400
we must submit an application

1033
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,320
to the Civil Affairs Department.

1034
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,550

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,510
if the deceased

1039
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,190
had things buried with him,
