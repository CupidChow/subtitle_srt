00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,729
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,039
The description is quite vivid.

4
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,509
You're talking about the two of them, right?

5
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,280
I can see

6
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,000
that you really envy

7
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,070
their love life.

8
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,570
The posts you published afterward

9
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,390
were all about their daily lives

10
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,840
and your longing for love.

11
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,640
Until November 22nd,

12
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,310
your posts took on a new tone—

13
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,110
"With her lips still

14
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,430
smeared with uncleaned red lipstick,

15
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,150
-she casually uttered words..."
-"She casually uttered words

16
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,590
that could shatter

17
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,240
any artist's world."

18
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,240
Honey,

19
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,910
I think your writing

20
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,590
is especially good,

21
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,520
but to be honest,

22
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,960
I don't quite understand it.

23
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,910
I think most of the audience

24
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,870
is probably like me.

25
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,590
They don't quite understand it either.

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,490
Why don't

27
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,300
you make it a little clearer?

28
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,470
For example, like those stories

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,630
about everyday family life.

30
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,190
Recently, in my live stream room,

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,560
I've seen a lot of viewers discussing

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,030
a trending family drama.

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,120
It's one of those...

34
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,110
drawn-out, tedious family ethics dramas?

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,800
I could write that.

36
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,560
I could make a lot of money from it,

37
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,000
enough to

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,190
afford a better place than this.

39
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,280
But my works

40
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,240
have depth.

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,470
They're different.

42
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,000
Honey,

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,910
of course, I know

44
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,310
your writing has a lot of depth,

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,560
but I just hope you could write

46
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,870
in a way that's more easily understood.

47
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,800
Just like the kind we can

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,710
cuddle on the couch

49
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,960
and watch together.

50
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,870
My works...

51
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,870
are not for everyone.

52
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,360
I have my principles.

53
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,630
My works

54
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,230
are for those...

55
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,240
who truly...

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,280
understand me.

57
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,870
"I could see

58
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,150
his helplessness and pain."

59
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,710
Yes, yes, yes.

60
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,480
"He's sad about not finding someone who truly appreciates him

61
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,620
and bitter that his soulmate can't be found.

62
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,360
The person sharing his pillow

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,430
not only fails to

64
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,630
resonate with his soul

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,430
but also tramples on his art."

66
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,240
From that day on...

67
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,710
you realized they weren't

68
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,230
the perfect couple you had imagined.

69
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,150
Instead, you began to feel that Qin Qing

70
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,120
was unworthy of Jia Sanmeng.

71
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,380
In your subsequent posts,

72
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,900
some scorned Qin Qing,

73
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,280
and some defended Jia Sanmeng.

74
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,470
Until December 25th,

75
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,380
the content of your posts changed once more.

76
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,400
"I never imagined

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,360
that I would be

78
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,000
spending this Christmas with you."

79
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,890
[She has no idea what he truly wants in his heart. She doesn't deserve his soul.]

80
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,890
[A person like her, with no depth and no soul.]

81
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,480
Darlings,

82
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,970
now, I'm going to show you

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,800
a

84
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,290
black backless dress.

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,080
It's a... lace design.

86
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,070
Everyone can take a look

87
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,240
at the back here.

88
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,220
It's okay if you don't like this one.

89
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,460
There's also... also...

90
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,200
also another one.

91
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,740
There is also another

92
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,980
blue denim, tie-up

93
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,800
Y2K-style dress.

94
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,190
We've done a letter design

95
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,690
on the front,

96
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,920
very chic.

97
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,240
This is our...

98
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,030
No. 9 link.

99
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,240
You can get this dress...

100
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,409
for 99.8 yuan.

101
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,410
Okay, today we have another set

102
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,430
to show you...

103
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,920
this white one...

104
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,510
In the moment our eyes met,

105
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,000
I sensed our unspoken connection.

106
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,040
And I believe

107
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,440
you received my feelings as well.

108
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,120
From that very day on,

109
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,040
all the posts you updated afterward

110
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,680
were about your admiration for Jia Sanmeng.

111
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,630
Until February 16th of this year,

112
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,930
when your relationship

113
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,480
had a substantial change.

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,070
Your post reads like this:

115
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,310
-"The dim yellow light that belongs only to the night..."
-"The dim yellow light that belongs only to the night...

116
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,040
is a symbol of undefined romance."

117
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,800
"Your voice, mere inches

118
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
away from me,

119
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
is like the siren's low humming.

120
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,320
You said

121
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,360
I'm the muse who touched you,

122
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,750
and I said that you are the angel who rescued me.

123
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,680
I never thought

124
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,800
we would be so compatible.

125
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,130
You gave me the Morpho hecuba

126
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,750
that symbolizes Icarus.

127
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,010
From that moment on, we became one,

128
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,270
racing toward the sun of art together."

129
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,190
Ye Meng.

130
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,360
You've fallen in love with Jia Sanmeng.

131
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,950
You knew very well

132
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,920
that he was a married man,

133
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,510
yet you couldn't control yourself,

134
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,240
right?

135
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,830
Yet, standing between you two

136
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,070
was Qin Qing, an obstacle.

137
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,070
So later you

138
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,870
made another post.

139
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
"Among all this beauty,

140
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,600
only one flaw remains.

141
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,120
If only she weren't here."

142
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,710
So, you believed that by killing Qin Qing,

143
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,390
you and Jia Sanmeng

144
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,390
could officially be together,

145
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,310
right?

146
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,000
No.

147
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Whose account is this?

148
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,240
Mine.

149
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,190
Who wrote those posts?

150
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,750
I did.

151
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,480
So?

152
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,430
So what?

153
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,630
So, how do you explain this?

154
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,150
I won't deny any of this.

155
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,310
I did write all of this.

156
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,070
But none of it is real.

157
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,040
Elaborate on it.

158
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,290
I never claimed that it was nonfiction.

159
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,630
You're the one who claimed it was.

160
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,920
Then how do you explain

161
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,720
that the two characters in your posts

162
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,070
are highly similar to the two of them?

163
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,160
When people are writing,

164
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,390
they often find

165
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,600
familiar people around them as prototypes.

166
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,600
Those two

167
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,390
were just my reference characters.

168
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,120
As for your claims

169
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,510
of admiration, commitment, and murder—

170
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,270
those were just creative writing.

171
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,380
So all these daily-life scenarios and details

172
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,640
were made up by you?

173
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,270
Officer,

174
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,000
you don't understand artistic creation.

175
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,830
But I know

176
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,950
that it seems that you can't...

177
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,240
convict someone based solely on their

178
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,750
creative writing, right?

179
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,310
Jia Sanmeng,

180
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
how was your relationship with Qin Qing?

181
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,080
I've told you before.

182
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,020
We had a great relationship.

183
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,919
During the years you were married,

184
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,320
did you ever have any conflicts?

185
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,240
No.

186
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,440
Why are you suddenly asking this?

187
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,540
It's like this.

188
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,430
Based on our current investigation,

189
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,080
we can't rule out the possibility of foul play.

190
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,320
Foul play?

191
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,730
You... you mean...

192
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,670
someone killed Qing?

193
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,750
We're still investigating.

194
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,000
Are you familiar with Ye Meng?

195
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,550
Y-Ye Meng...

196
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,960
She's our roommate.

197
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,200
If our finances

198
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,960
weren't so tight,

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,120
we wouldn't be

200
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,960
sharing an apartment with her.

201
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,200
We barely spoke,

202
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,440
like strangers practically.

203
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,840
Hold on.

204
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,750
Why are you suddenly asking about Ye Meng?

205
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,000
We've questioned Ye Meng

206
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,600
and found some inconsistencies.

207
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,440
And this matter

208
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,480
is also related to you.

209
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,500
Take a look at this first.

210
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,630
These are some posts

211
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,320
that she published online.

212
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,240
Read them first.

213
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,810
[I see the shape of love.]

214
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,040
[She has no idea what he truly wants in his heart. She doesn't deserve his soul.]

215
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,040
[A person like her, with no depth and no soul.]

216
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,700
[Among all this beauty, only one flaw remains. If only she weren't here.]

217
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,200
Why did she write these things?

218
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,840
Are you saying what she wrote here is true?

219
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,120
True.

220
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,390
It is true.

221
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,810
Turn the pages.

222
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,090
Keep reading.

223
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,720
These later posts are also true?

224
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,000
They're all true.

225
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,030
No, what does she mean by this?

226
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,390
[I never imagined a scene like this.]

227
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,720
I remember this.

228
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,360
At that time, Ye Meng was at home

229
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,600
while Qing and I were having dinner.

230
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,520
And you know...

231
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,910
Qing and I

232
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
had different professions.

233
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,670
She had her dream

234
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,000
of becoming a... streamer.

235
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,360
And I...

236
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,750
I'm a mediocre writer,

237
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,360
but I-I have my principles.

238
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,160
Then, as a married couple,

239
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,630
we had some minor disagreements sometimes.

240
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,960
That's normal, right?

241
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,510
But I didn't expect Ye Meng...

242
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,600
what does this have to do with her?

243
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,150
And...

244
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,840
all this soulmate stuff.

245
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,750
She's...

246
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,840
Isn't she blowing things out of proportion?

247
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,810
Jia Sanmeng,

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,480
since you've admitted

249
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,170
that these things Ye Meng wrote

250
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,870
were what really happened between you and Qin Qing,

251
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,910
turn to page three.

252
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,270
She wrote that you and she got together,

253
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,810
[The pair of wings together is a picture of the sun gently rising.]

254
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,810
[The Morpho hecuba, also known as the Rising Sun Butterfly, 
is the national butterfly of Brazil.]

255
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,970
and you even gave her

256
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,960
a token of your love—

257
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,120
some kind of butterfly.

258
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,200
Is that true?

259
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,910
Of course not.

260
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,670
I-I just told you

261
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,240
that Qing and I had a stable relationship.

262
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,870
I wouldn't do

263
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,000
anything to betray her.

264
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,880
Why would I give her

265
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,480
some...

266
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,360
s-some butterfly?

267
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,750
Does she

268
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,150
have some mental issues?

269
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,440
Did she ever

270
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,080
act strangely before?

271
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,750
I've already told you.

272
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,270
We are like strangers to each other,

273
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,510
with hardly any interaction.

274
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,320
But what she wrote...

275
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,670
Could she have a delusion disorder,

276
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,510
imagining me as her boyfriend

277
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,090
and Qing as her imaginary enemy?

278
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,240
Just now, you mentioned "foul play..."

279
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,390
Are you referring to Ye Meng?

280
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,480
She killed Qing?

281
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,200
Captain Shen,

282
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,550
Huang Qi has sent a message

283
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,550
saying there are no suitable weapons

284
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,670
in Qin Qing's home.

285
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,750
They're now checking

286
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,720
garbage bins near the house.

287
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,690
Tell them to come back first.

288
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,200
Yes, sir.

289
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,270
Captain Shen,

290
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,060
based on Jia Sanmeng's reaction,

291
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,200
do you think what Ye Meng wrote

292
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,270
really might be just her creation?

293
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,540
Even if Ye Meng made all that up,

294
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,630
I've always felt that something about her emotions seems off.

295
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,510
Captain Shen, you mean

296
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,480
all the stories are fake,

297
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,510
but Ye Meng's

298
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,000
feelings for Jia Sanmeng are real?

299
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,860
Don't let Ye Meng go yet.

300
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,790
Let's investigate her further.

301
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,550
What about Jia Sanmeng?

302
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,450
Let him go,

303
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,030
but have someone keep an eye on him.

304
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,440
Go.

305
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,840
Yes, sir.

306
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,960
Shen Ye,

307
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,720
how's it going?

308
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,580
Chun.

309
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,000
We've talked to the family.

310
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,260
Their attitude remains very firm.

311
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,240
We can only continue

312
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,420
our investigation

313
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,140
without conducting an autopsy.

314
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,000
I did my best.

315
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,400
Hello.

316
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,870
Dad, what's wrong?

317
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,480
Answer when your dad calls.

318
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,320
I sent you several messages,

319
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,240
but you didn't reply.

320
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,360
Tonight at 6:30,

321
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,080
Jiangnan Restaurant.

322
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,010
Don't forget.

323
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,770
Do I really have to go?

324
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,640
Of course.

325
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,440
You're already in your thirties.

326
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,960
You should be more proactive about blind dates.

327
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,550
The key is that the young man's

328
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,450
and his family's conditions are very good.

329
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,590
His parents like to do charity work.

330
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,840
What good character they have.

331
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,980
Also,

332
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,840
he also doesn't mind

333
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,870
that you're a forensic doctor.

334
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,050
What more do you want?

335
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,210
Don't be late!

336
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,210
This is settled!

337
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,910
If you don't go,

338
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,360
I'll come to your workplace to get you.

339
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,400
Chun,

340
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,450
what's wrong?

341
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,460
What happened?

342
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,570
It's my mom.

343
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,240
She is making me go on another blind date.

344
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,840
Another blind date?

345
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,780
Keep your voice down.

346
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,240
Those people are so unreliable.

347
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,260
Can you not go?

348
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,480
You think I want to go?

349
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,070
So, you'd better think of a way

350
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,640
to help me push for the autopsy.

351
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,590
Alright, alright.

352
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,040
I'll think of something else for you.

353
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,360
No,

354
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,980
don't just stand there staring at me.

355
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,390
Alright, go, go.

356
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,830
Go, go, go.

357
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,230
This autopsy is really important.

358
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,240
I know!

359
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,100
Be careful!

360
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,790
Those people are particularly unreliable!

361
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,910
What are you looking at? Back to work.

362
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,320
I'm a person of integrity.

363
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,240
Miss,

364
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,150
the private room is over there.

365
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,480
Private room?

366
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,430
Come in.

367
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,860
Please come in.

368
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,750
Hello.

369
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,770
Hello, Jin Chun.

370
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,870
Nice to meet you. My name is Jiang He.

371
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,520
This is my mother.

372
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,200
She takes this blind date of ours

373
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,080
very seriously.

374
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,370
Please have a seat.

375
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,910
Okay.

376
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,970
How old are you?

377
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm 34.

378
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,840
That's two years older

379
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,000
than our Jiang He.

380
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,350
What's your height?

381
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,080
165 cm.

382
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,080
I meant barefoot height.

383
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,680
That is my barefoot height.

384
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,440
What's your blood type?

385
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:55,960
Mom,

386
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,270
we young people nowadays

387
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,680
prefer zodiac signs.

388
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,380
Jin Chun,

389
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,900
what is your zodiac sign?

390
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,670
Gemini.

391
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,589
Our Jiang He is a Scorpio.

392
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,310
Is that so?

393
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,970
Gemini and Scorpio

394
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,849
have very low compatibility.

395
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,829
Mom.

396
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,040
H-Horoscopes

397
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,660
a-are just for fun.

398
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,800
Let's order first.

399
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,240
L-Let's order first.

400
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,200
Waitress.

401
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,240
Yes, sir.

402
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,680
You go ahead.

403
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Auntie, Auntie, you order.

404
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,720
Auntie, what would you like to eat?

405
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,910
You should order.

406
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,950
Order whatever you like.

407
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,450
I heard from your mother

408
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,750
that you are a forensic doctor.

409
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,560
I wonder if forensic doctors

410
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,120
have any occupational quirks or problems.

411
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,170
You deal with so many corpses every day, after all.

412
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,580
Mom.

413
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,410
Speaking of

414
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,740
occupational habits...

415
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,450
there actually are some.

416
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,200
For example, I particularly like to eat...

417
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,850
Do you have balut?

418
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,280
Or... noodles with pork intestines and stinky tofu?

419
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,050
Fried silkworm pupae?

420
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,220
Fried scorpions?

421
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,920
Wait...

422
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,030
You're a girl,

423
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,550
and you eat that kind of stuff?

424
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,600
Yeah.

425
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,310
Because

426
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,450
after work,

427
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,750
I like to eat strong-flavored foods

428
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,400
to settle my stomach.

429
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,560
Not to your taste, I suppose?

430
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,530
Okay.

431
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,570
Waitress,

432
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,590
arrange it.

433
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,160
Okay.

434
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,110
All of these frequently appear

435
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,240
on your social media.

436
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,970
Like this sour fruit juice,

437
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,130
and you like spicy food.

438
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
You also like

439
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,400
to try some innovative dishes.

440
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,080
What you just ordered

441
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,450
was probably just to scare me off, right?

442
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,410
You looked me up?

443
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,030
No need to look you up.

444
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,160
Your phone number

445
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,680
is linked to many social media accounts.

446
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,310
This is the digital age.

447
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,590
If someone wants to learn

448
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,530
about a person,

449
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,620
it's not difficult.

450
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,240
That's very mindful of you.

451
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,480
If things work out between you

452
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,650
and our Jiang He,

453
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,680
then

454
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,070
do you have any career plans

455
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,240
for the future?

456
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:29,880
Career...

457
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:30,720
Auntie,

458
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,240
now that you mention work, I just remembered

459
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,410
that I forgot to reply to

460
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,950
a very important work message.

461
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,310
Please give me a moment. Sorry.

462
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,200
Don't ask me why.

463
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,550
Call me right now.

464
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,280
Career plans, right?

465
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,770
Well, regarding my job...

466
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,130

467

Sorry, a phone call.

471
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,830
It's work.

472
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,750
Hello?

473
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,680
What?

474
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,280
That serious?

475
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,100
Alright, I'll be right back.

476

Get everything ready.

Get the scalpel ready for me.

Bring the body in first.

479
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,570
Yes, I'll do the craniotomy when I get back.

480
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,240
Okay.

481
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,170
Okay, see you in a bit.

482
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,110
Auntie, I'm really sorry.

483
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
I won't be able to stay for the meal.

484
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,340
I-I suddenly...

485
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,170
There's a m-mission in the team.

486
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,620
And about my career...

487
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,560
I really can't plan it.

488
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,740
I have to go now.

489
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,160
The dishes look great. Thank you.

490
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,610
She just left like that?

491
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,900
Hello, Dad.

492
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,750
What's wrong?

493
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,650
I'm just checking in.

494
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,440
Didn't you have a blind date today?

495
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,510
How did it go?

496
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,750
Is Mom next to you?

497
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,480
No, go ahead.

498
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:07,950
Dad,

499
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,240
you have no idea

[Jin Dong; Jin Chun's father]

501
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,200
how bizarre today's date was.

502
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,960
After all, we were

503
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,340
meeting each other for the first time, right?

504
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,930
But he actually brought his mother along.

505
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:17,880
And the three of us

506
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,650
sat in a

507
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,490
private room that could fit ten people.

508
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,960
His mom sat right in the middle

509
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,220
like some kind of judge.

510
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,910
As soon as I sat down, she started asking me

511
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,200
all sorts of questions, a whole bunch of them.

512
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,110
Anyone watching

513
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,270
would think I was being interrogated.

514
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,550
And Jiang He just sat there, watching.

515
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,990
I mean, was I on a date with him

516
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,350
or with his mother?

517
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,500
Finally, when that part was over,

518
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,150
she started picking apart my job.

519
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,440
And this Jiang He

520
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,290
is also a very strange person.

521
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,240
It was our first meeting,

522
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,480
and he had already thoroughly

523
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,720
investigated me.

524
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,960
He dug through all my social media accounts

525
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,840
to find out...

526
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,070
Why aren't you coming in yet?

527
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,720
Who are you secretly calling?

528
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,370
No one.

529
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,140

it seems

00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,200
that Ye Meng is still the most suspicious.

553

573
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,820
I'll let you know.

574
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,480
Chun,

575
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,510
you're really going all out

576
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,660
to get that autopsy approved.

577
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,920
Look at your Chun.

578
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,160
Learn from her.

579
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,160
This window has a length

580
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,760
of 2,200 mm

581
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,730
and a height of 1,500 mm.

582
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,510
900 mm from the ground.

583
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,720
The three on this side are the same,

584
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,790
all measuring 900 mm by 1,100 mm.

585
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,980
And then this window opening is 1,100 mm.

586
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,770
Then, the length is 1,500 mm

587
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,720
and also 900 mm from the ground.

588
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,310
Print it.

589
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,990
Okay.

590
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,900
Pull up the statement again.

591
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,150
[I watch your live stream every day in the live stream room. I want to see you every day. 
I think you're pretty.]

592
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,130
[He used to be a gentleman, but now he seems so strange and scary.]

593
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,130
[His dirty clothes and socks are all over the floor. And his habits.]

594
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,130
[When I got home today, I saw him collapsed on the couch, all dirty. 
He wasn't like this before.]

595
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,810
[Can we meet up? There is a place I want to show you.]

596
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,810
[You don't really have confidence in this matter, do you? I'm also from Beixun.]

597
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,210
[Recording]

598
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,830
Hello, I'm Jin Chun.

599
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,070
You told me over the phone

600
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,460
that Jia Sanmeng had been abusing Qin Qing.

601
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,590
Is that true?

602
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,140
Officer.

603
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,940
Our Qing's body can't just

604
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,110
be left there like that.

605
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,720
I still hope

606
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,930
she finds her peace in the grave as soon as possible.

607
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,690
Auntie,

608
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,480
I can see

609
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,390
that you loved Qin Qing very much.

610
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,680
So, you wouldn't want the person

611
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,790
who hurt her to get away with it,

612
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,400
right?

613
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,350
Then hurry up and

614
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,690
catch that killer.

615
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,860
I told you last time you were here.

616
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,680
And now you suspect Jia.

617
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,550
Qin Qing

618
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,370
was suffering from domestic violence before her death.

619
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,100
Do you know about that?

620
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,160
Domestic violence?

621
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:38,980
You mean

622
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,750
Jia hit Qing?

623
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,450
That's impossible.

624
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,610
They loved each other so much.

625
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,830
Jia

626
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,510
treated Qing like a queen.

627
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,960
How could he ever hit her?

628
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,440
And Qing never told me anything about it.

629
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,680
Some things

630
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,920
just aren't easy to tell the people

631
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,000
closest to you.

632
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,720
That's simply impossible.

633
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,310
I went to see

634
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,440
one of Qin Qing's friends.

635
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,830
She said that Qin Qing did tell her

636
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,110
that Jia Sanmeng had abused her.

637
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,240
And, please look.

638
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,400
Look at this photo.

639
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,910
This is a screenshot I took from her livestream.

640
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Auntie.

641
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,880
Qin Qing has passed away.

642
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,110
She'll never have the chance

643
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,590
to tell the world

644
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,110
what she went through herself.

645
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,250
And the only thing

646
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,750
we, the living, can do

647
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,680
is to help her soul find peace.

648
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,880
Did Jia Sanmeng kill Qing?

649
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,740
We're not certain yet.

650
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,020
The investigation is still ongoing.

651
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,230
But please rest assured.

652
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,110
We won't wrongly accuse

653
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,270
any innocent person,

654
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,830
and we absolutely won't

655
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,990
let any guilty person go free.

656
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,110
Officer.

657
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I want to go see my daughter.

658
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,580
Auntie.

659
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,700
We have regulations here.

660
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,500
You can only stand here.

661
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,200
I hope you understand.

662
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,190
Qing!

663
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,400
Qing!

664
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,960
Auntie.

665
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,980
Qing!

666
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,400
Qing!

667
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,750
Why didn't you tell Mom

668
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,000
about everything you went through?

669
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,160
My daughter...

670
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,590
It was all Mom's fault.

671
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,090
I didn't protect you well.

672
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,640
Mom was wrong.

673
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,530
But Mom won't make the same mistake again!

674
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,920
I won't let him get away with this!

675
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,560
Officer...

676
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,730
Officer.

677
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,550
Please.

678
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,550
Please, please.

679
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,210
Don't worry.

680
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,000
You can count on us.

681
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,270
Alright, Chun.

682
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,510
Let's begin.

683
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,440
[Binxi Branch Bureau of the Beixun Municipal Public Security Bureau; 
Criminal Investigation Division]

684
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,310
Shen Ye.

685
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,160
How is it?

686
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,300
The autopsy results are out?

687
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,500
What do they say?

688
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,290
There's a major discovery.

689
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,410
Qin Qing's entire body

690
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,240
exhibits signs of blunt force trauma.

691
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,250
Blunt force trauma?

692
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,070
Based on the pigmentation

693
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,270
and scarring, we can determine

694
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,920
that these injuries occurred over an extended period.

695
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,700
There's bruising on her head

696
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,720
that occurred recently.

697
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,510
And her left hand,

698
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,590
at the ring finger joint,

699
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,630
has abrasions.

700
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,000
I think someone

701
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,470
likely tried to forcibly remove her ring.

702
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,480
Most of these injuries, both old and new,

703
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,510
are concentrated in

704
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,680
private areas of her body

705
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,260
that are not easily visible.

706
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,730
So I deduce

707
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,790
it was likely someone

708
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,320
very close to her.

709
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,570
There's a high probability

710
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,190
that Qin Qing was

711
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,160
subjected to domestic violence for a long time.

712
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,350
It seems that her mother wasn't

713
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,270
the only one who didn't want an autopsy.

714
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,590
Would these injuries have caused

715
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,510
fatal danger to Qin Qing?

716
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,200
No.

717
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,620
None of these injuries were fatal.

718
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,350
Well, Jia Sanmeng treated Qin Qing like this.

719
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,000
Why would she

720
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,680
still stay with him

721
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,400
for so many years?

722
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,960
Because on the surface,

723
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,480
no one could tell Jia Sanmeng had violent tendencies.

724
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,820
Take a look at this.

725
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,310
This is Qin Qing's

726
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,670
social media account.

727
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,860
Look at her posts.

728
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,290
[We'll start the livestream on time today.]

729
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,810
[Up early for my business trip, heading out with the sunrise.]

730
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,790
Enjoying the scenery with Jia Sanmeng.

731
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,360
On special occasions,

732
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,030
flowers, candles, and cake.

733
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,110
This shows that when Jia Sanmeng

734
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,510
wasn't abusing Qin Qing,

735
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,160
he acted like a perfect husband.

736
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,200
This kind of contrast

737
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,720
can induce victims

738
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,510
to develop a

739
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,160
psychological condition

740
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,070
similar to Stockholm syndrome.

741
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,880
What does that mean?

742
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,030
It's like...

743
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,960
"When he's not hitting me,

744
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:27,960
he's really good to me."

745
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,400
Violence is violence.

746
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,400
Now that the autopsy results

747
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,440
have already proven

748
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,440
that Qin Qing suffered physical abuse before her death,

749
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,960
considering her social relationships,

750
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,680
we suspect

751
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,720
that Jia Sanmeng had been abusing her.

752
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,510
Yet Ye Meng sees him...

753
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,310
as her perfect soulmate.

754
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,160
But in reality, the man standing in front of her

755
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,240
is a monster.

756
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,550
What about the motive for the murder?

757
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,680
I have a new discovery.

758
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,590
I met with one of Qin Qing's fans.

759
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,400
What did he say?

760
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,520
He said Qin Qing

761
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,070
had actually started to awaken.

762
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,570
She even burned a specimen.

763
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,680
It was a token of love

764
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,440
that Jia Sanmeng gave her.

765
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,310
So I'm wondering,

766
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,480
could Jia Sanmeng

767
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,960

768
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,550
Qin Qing wanted to leave him

769
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,400
and, in a fit of rage, decided to kill her?

770
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,750
That's very possible.

771
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,200

772
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,960

773
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,310
A butterfly specimen.

774
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,920

775
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,880

776
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,030
That wasn't her fantasy.

777
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:32,960

778
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,070

00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,750

781
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,070
are different

782
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,350
from the patterns

783
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,640

788
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,310
faint, and evenly distributed fire spread pattern.

789
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,960
Then, who is our current focus?

790

797
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,800

806
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,760
We found this in your room.

807
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,880
And this was posted by Qin Qing

808
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,090

an identical one in your hands!

813
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,280
Is this just a coincidence?

814
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,440
Couldn't it just be

815
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,850
that I thought this butterfly looked nice

816
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,000
and bought one for myself too?

817
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,180
Bought it? Where did you buy it?

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,320
But I think his courage

856
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,190
is something
