00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,000

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,070

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
the first three people

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,950
did appear nervous and afraid.

However, we still can't determine

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,870
whether they were telling the truth.

what she said is indeed the most truthful.

14
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,920
Yeah,

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,730

[Gao Yarui; Bully]

18
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,510
There are two possibilities now.

19
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,590
First,

20
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,870
among these three people,

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,840
one of them wanted to kill Gao Yarui.

22
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,680
She replaced all the props,

23
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,650
[Gao Yarui; Bully]

24
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,840
but by some twist of fate,

25
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,750
she ended up killing Yu Fan instead.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,950
Second,

27
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,030
all three of them

28
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,650
conspired to kill Gao Yarui.

29
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,840
They swapped the props together

30
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,760
but ended up killing Yu Fan.

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,270
If it's the first possibility,

32
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,590
the risk of exposure would be too high.

33
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,150

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,030

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,640
immediately rule out Yu Fan?

39
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,920
Because Yu Fan is already dead.

40
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,490
Do you think

41
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,400
she would have known about this plan

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,190
and still walked right into it?

43
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,000
This scenario is indeed unlikely.

the circumstances at the time of the incident

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,590

Yu Fan was aware.

She had a motive for murder...

and found the candle that couldn't be blown out,

73
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,220
so she could only stomp on it

how did the fire start?

was Yu Fan from the very beginning?

in that room,

also set a trap in the same room.

high-purity calcium hydroxide.

169
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:45,980
Calcium hydroxide

170
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,680
is what we commonly know as

slaked lime in everyday life.

172
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,970
When quicklime meets water,

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,080
it produces slaked lime

174
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,920
and releases a large amount

175
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,250
of heat in the process.

176
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,740
If there are sufficient combustible materials,

177
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,210
they can ignite rapidly.

Mao Mao, do an experiment.

179
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,720
So, you mean

180
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,330
that the real murder method was

181
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,090
using quicklime's reaction with water to generate heat?

182
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,090
To be precise,

183
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,710
it was the quicklime mixture.

184
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,900
Based on our experiment, we deduced

185
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,830
that quicklime mixed with magnesium powder

186
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,270
was the real ignition point.

187
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,230
I need to head back to the station.

My relationship with Yu Fan

346
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,970
wasn't particularly good,

347
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,690
but it wasn't too bad either.

348
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,980
Let me put it this way:

349
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,830
although we were roommates,

350
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,670
we didn't really have much interaction.

351
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,710

352
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,200
Before Gao Yarui

353
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,060
pulled Yu Fan to her side,

354
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,780
those two were the closest.

355
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,500
They always had plenty to talk about.

356
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,110
Elaborate on it.

357
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,520
Anyway, whenever Yu Fan was bullied,

358
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,840
Jin Yan always stood up for her.

359
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,210
Was there any conflict between them?

360
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,540
Probably.

361
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,600
But I really wasn't that close to them,

362
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,710
so I don't know much.

363
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,650
What about Cheng Sisi?

00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,230
How was her relationship with Yu Fan?

00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,910
their relationship wasn't good at all.

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,560
you should go and catch her in the act.

377
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,640
Just take your phone

378
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,440
and snap some pictures through that window crack.

379
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,810
Sir,

380
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,390
what I mean is,

381
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,960
if you could let me graduate...

382
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,550
What are you doing?

383
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,750
What are you doing?

384
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,850
How shameless!

385
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,540
Get out.

386
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,040
Get out of here!

387
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,150
I'm begging you.

388
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,450
Weren't you acting all high and mighty earlier?

389
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,940
Please don't release those photos, okay?

390
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,290
How boring.

391
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,860
Why are you acting so cowardly?

392
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,470
Where's Yu Fan?

393
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,830
Yu Fan?

394
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,230
Why are you hiding there?

395
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,580
Good job on taking these photos.

396
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,420
Let's go.

397
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,090
I'll take you to eat.

398
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,980
Who do you think Cheng Sisi hates more—

399
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,480
Gao Yarui or Yu Fan?

400
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,000
She probably hates them both quite a lot.

401
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,260
Why?

402
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,300
Wasn't Gao Yarui the one who started it all?

403
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,880
Gao Yarui is simply mean.

404
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,260
It's only right to hate her.

405
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,830
But someone like Yu Fan,

406
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,760
such an ordinary and cowardly person,

407
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,600
even she could

408
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,760
walk all over Cheng Sisi.

409
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,390
How could Cheng Sisi not hate Yu Fan?

410
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,600
Officer...

411
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,520
the person the killer wanted to murder wasn't Gao Yarui

412
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,300
but Yu Fan,

413
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,550
right?

414
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,430
What do you think?

415
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,550
Cheng Sisi had a motive for murder,

416
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,010
but I can't figure out

417
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,130
why she would skip over Gao Yarui

418
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,060
and go straight to killing Yu Fan.

419
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,510
I think Fang Ni is hiding something.

420
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,579
Next,

421
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,680
let's question Cheng Sisi.

422
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,329
Captain Shen.

423
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,800
Captain Shen.

424
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,260
Officers,

425
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,400
what else do you want to ask?

426
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,800
Don't be nervous.

427
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,080
We just want to have a chat with you

428
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,740
regarding the relationship

429
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,820
between you,

430
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,400
Fang Ni,

431
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,130
Jin Yan,

432
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,210
and Yu Fan.

433
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,430
Why are you now asking about...

434
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,470
our relationship with Yu Fan?

435
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,160
Because the victim is Yu Fan.

436
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,460
Wasn't she killed by mistake?

437
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,120
She wasn't killed by mistake.

438
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,420
The person the culprit really wanted to kill

439
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,510
was Yu Fan.

440
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,030
Why aren't you saying anything?

441
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,830
No.

442
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,760
Just feel that it's a bit sudden.

443
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,020
Why kill Yu Fan?

444
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,680
Are you asking me?

445
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,110
I'd like to know that too.

446
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,550
Tell me.

447
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,230
I didn't have much interaction with Yu Fan.

448
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,390
In the whole dorm, the ones close to her

449
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,350
were just two people.

450
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,810
At first, it was Jin Yan,

451
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,680
and later, it became Gao Yarui.

452
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,310
Tell us about the relationship between Jin Yan and Yu Fan.

453
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,940
Before Gao Yarui came to the dorm,

454
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,930
they were practically like conjoined twins.

455
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,080
Even though they weren't in the same major,

456
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,480
they still went to classes together.

457
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,310
What about Fang Ni?

458
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,880
How was her relationship with Yu Fan?

459
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,030
She had a grudge against Yu Fan.

460
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,560
Let's go outside.

461
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,530
I have something to tell you.

462
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,210
Just say it here.

463
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,280
What is it that they can't hear?

464
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,820
Didn't we agree on this before?

465
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,920
Why aren't you giving it to me now?

466
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,240
Oh, you're here for money.

467
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,600
It's not like they don't know.

468
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,810
You're going too far.

469
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,350
Why didn't you say that when you used to

470
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,550
ask me for money before?

471
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,730
I can do without the money,

472
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,630
but I won't participate in

473
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,680
your bullying anymore.

474
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,050
Are you seriously trying to set terms with me?

475
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,840
A street vendor's daughter

476
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
putting on airs like a princess.

477
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,600
If you keep making a fuss,

478
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,690
I'll make sure the whole school knows

479
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,640
about your little secret tomorrow.

480
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,850
She's not at the school gate anymore.

481
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,390
You have no evidence at all.

482
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,010
You're so confident, huh?

483
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,380
Yu Fan.

484
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,730
Hurry, hurry.

485
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,530
Evidence.

486
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,360
She wants evidence.

487
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,020
I went to buy pancakes last month

488
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,700
and had a chat with the auntie selling them.

489
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,570
She showed me her locket,

490
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,460
and inside was the photo she took with you.

491
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,560
Yu Fan.

492
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,830
You're really

493
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,840
getting better and better.

494
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,150
Still want to make a fuss?

495
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,160
What about you?

496
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,460
What about your relationship with Yu Fan?

497
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,430
Just like that.

498
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,550
But someone said

499
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,110
you and Yu Fan

500
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,330
had quite a grudge.

501
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,910
Why didn't you tell me about that?

502
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,260
Fang Ni said that, right?

503
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,860
She's just playing the victim!

504
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,070
Yes.

505
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,330
I didn't like Yu Fan,

506
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,230
but I wouldn't go so far as to kill her.

507
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,240
So you think

508
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,160
Fang Ni is the culprit?

509
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,500
If it weren't for Yu Fan,

510
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,410
Gao Yarui wouldn't have learned

511
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,950
about Fang Ni's background.

512
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,810
And Gao Yarui wouldn't have been able to threaten her.

513
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,960
For Fang Ni,

514
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,690
the worst person was Yu Fan.

515
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,620
So,

516
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,650
she wanted to kill Yu Fan even more.

517
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,230
What do you think?

518
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,890
Fang Ni's analysis of Cheng Sisi

519
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,610
also applies

520
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,850
to herself.

521
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,000
She also can't stand

522
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,350
someone as weak as Yu Fan

523
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,050
helping Gao Yarui bully her.

524
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,100
In comparison,

525
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,770
Cheng Sisi's thinking is more direct.

526
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,650
She asks

527
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,730
whatever comes to her mind.

528
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,170
But Fang Ni doesn't.

529
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,960
She realized more quickly

530
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,200
that the person the culprit really wanted to kill

531
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,050
should be Yu Fan.

532
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,410
But she didn't mention this beforehand;

533
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,050
instead, she directly covered up

534
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,520
her grudge with Yu Fan.

535
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,780
We'd like to know

536
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,550
about the relationship

537
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,330
between you,

538
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,160
Fang Ni,

539
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
Cheng Sis, and Yu Fan.

540
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,160
It was all my fault.

541
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,650
It was all my fault.

542
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,890
If only I had insisted a little more back then...

543
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,720
just a little more

544
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,760
and pulled Yu Fan

545
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,510
away from Gao Yarui.

546
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,440
Then

547
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,200
all these things that happened afterward

548
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,680
wouldn't have happened, right?

549
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,560
Yu Fan wouldn't have

550
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,320
died at all, right?

551
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,880
Why do you say that?

552
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,910
Yu Fan and I were childhood friends.

553
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,910
We knew each other since we were little.

554
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,330
Our families lived very close to each other.

555
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,830
Our parents knew each other.

556
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,130
From elementary school,

557
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,550
we went to school together,

558
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,550
came home together...

559
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,920
and sometimes even stayed at each other's homes.

560
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,860
She had such a good personality.

561
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,140
But she was just too nice

562
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,920
and too easy-going,

563
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,440
which made her an easy target for bullying.

564
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,280
But if anyone dared to bully her...

565
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,890
I would get back at them for her.

566
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,360
I don't have many friends.

567
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,190
Yu Fan was my only friend.

568
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,040
Then, somehow,

569
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,870
one day,

570
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,920
Gao Yarui set her sights on her...

571
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,140
demanding that she become her minion.

572
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,830
After that,

573
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,200
she changed completely.

574
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,720
I tried to talk sense into her so many times,

575
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,680
but she just wouldn't listen.

576
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:46,890
Yu Fan.

577
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,470
Can you stop being like this?

578
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,610
Look at what you've become now.

579
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,650
Gao Yarui was never

580
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,370
truly being nice to you.

581
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,240
Can't you see that?

582
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,080
Hanging out with her every day,

583
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,750
do you know what

584
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,800
others are saying about you?

585
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,690
Stop it.

586
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,470
Can't you just stay away from her?

587
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,270
Why?

588
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,640
Tell me why.

589
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,370
You have to make it clear

590
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,210
to me today!

591
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,000
Why?

592
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,110
Yu Fan!

593
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,860
Why is this so hard for you?

594
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,010
You've always been like this!

595
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,700
Can't you stand up for yourself for once?

596
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,270
Do you have to be such a coward?

597
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,680
Fine.

598
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,180
If you want to stay this way,

599
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,970
we won't be friends anymore.

600
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,790
Alright, alright,

601
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,680
I know.

602
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,850
Coming, coming.

603
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,790
My neck hurts from playing on my phone.

604
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,820
Give me a massage.

605
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,210
Have you eaten?

606
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,880
Are you out of energy?

607
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,130
How about you eat this?

608
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,080
Go fetch me a basin of water.

609
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,100
I want to soak my feet.

610
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,750
Was that the start

611
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,350
of your conflict with Yu Fan?

612
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,920
I was angry...

613
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,200
but we didn't have a conflict.

614
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,570
We just grew a bit distant.

615
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,090
So what do you think about

616
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,970
Fang Ni, Cheng Sisi,

617
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,440
and Yu Fan's relationship?

618
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,350
Is there something

619
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,530
you're uncomfortable talking about?

620
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,160
Yu Fan wasn't bad at heart,

621
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,660
really.

622
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,320
Many things

623
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,870
she did were forced by Gao Yarui.

624
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,640
And then she might have offended

625
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,090
Fang Ni and Cheng Sisi.

626
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,200
But it shouldn't have been

627
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,240
anything serious.

628
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,110
We've now confirmed

629
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,810
that the culprit's real target

630
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,880
was Yu Fan.

631
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,120
Wasn't Gao Yarui supposed to be the target?

632
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,350
How did it come to be Yu Fan now?

633
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,070
Is there a mistake?

634
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,230
Yes,

635
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,340
Yu Fan did wrong things,

636
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,920
but she didn't deserve to die!

637
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,300
If anyone deserved to die...

638
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,190
it should have been someone else.

639
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,170
What do you think about Jin Yan's words?

640
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,000
There's one thing I can be certain about.

641
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,730
Her feelings for Yu Fan

642
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,720
must be genuine.

643
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,400
Captain Shen,

644
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,150
Gao Yarui has been asking to see you.

645
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,400
Bring her in.

646
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,230
Okay.

647
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Officer, you're finally here!

648
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,510
Those three

649
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,440
have been throwing dirt on me!

650
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,790
I have something on them too!

651
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,750
Go ahead.

652
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,400
Those three petty people

653
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,750
wanted to kill me over something so trivial,

654
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,280
so they must have wanted to kill Yu Fan too.

655
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,720
Yu Fan told me about

656
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,880
Fang Ni's background.

657
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,850
The photos of Cheng Sisi

658
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,240
were also taken by Yu Fan for me.

659
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,110
Jin Yan.

660
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,880
As soon as she saw

661
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,830
Yu Fan with me,

662
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,860
she'd get angry.

663
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,430
I just wanted to piss her off.

664
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,300
What do you think about

665
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,230
Jin Yan and Yu Fan's relationship?

666
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,000
I think they were just playing

667
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,240
some childish game of sisterly love,

668
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,780
like kids playing house.

669
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,170
So, you're saying

670
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,410
their friendship was fake?

671
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,320
I just found it extremely childish

672
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,400
and unnecessary.

673
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,510
Why do you say that?

674
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,580
When I taught Jin Yan a lesson that time,

675
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,730
I didn't see Yu Fan step in either.

676
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,350
After that,

677
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,480
Yu Fan was there

678
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,170
pretending to repent and blame herself

679
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,990
and was out of sorts day after day.

680
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,880
Who was she putting on a show for?

681
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,420
For me?

682
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,130
Let me tell you, Officer,

683
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,840
if my best friend got bullied,

684
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,970
I would definitely fight back for her!

685
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,930
What kind of nonsense is that,

686
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,120
pretending to be sisters?

687
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,020
Forward a bit.

688
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,390
Checking the surveillance footage again?

689
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,240
Any new findings?

690
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,910
Chun has a theory.

691
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,230
Here, take a look at this.

692
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,620
The victim was on fire,

693
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,980
[Zone E]

694
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,390
yet she was still smiling calmly.

695
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
That eerie?

696
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,430
Normally, when a fire starts,

697
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,440
the smoke is very irritating,

698
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,020
and people instinctively shut their eyes.

699
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,360
But not only did she not close her eyes,

700
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,720
but she had them wide open.

701
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:16,720
I suspect...

702
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,320
that what she saw

703
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,660
wasn't fire.

704
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,510
We should investigate

705
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,170
the victim's mental state

706
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,470
during that period before her death.

707
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,760
There was indeed something wrong with

708
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,700
the victim's mental state.

709
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,640
When we were interrogating Gao Yarui just now,

710
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,570
she mentioned

711
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,310
that Yu Fan seemed absent-minded all day.

712
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,470
And during our previous visits to the school,

713
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,650
others also said she appeared mentally absent.

714
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,470
I always felt that recently, she seemed

715
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,790
even more lifeless than before.

716
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,520
How should I put it?

717
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,060
During that period,

718
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,490
I'm not sure if she wasn't sleeping well

719
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,480
or if something was bothering her.

720
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,160
Sometimes, even after class had ended,

721
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,000
she would still sit in her seat, lost in thought,

722
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,550
her eyes fixed straight ahead at nothing.

723
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,780
It was quite eerie.

724
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,270
Once, I reminded her,

725
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:55,800
but she seemed

726
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,860
as if she didn't hear me.

727
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,550
I had to repeat it several times

728
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,790
before she hazily

729
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,950
got up and walked out.

730
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:01,890
She left her computer

731
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,080
right on the desk.

732
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,710
I had to chase after her

733
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,720
to give her the computer.

734
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,840
She didn't even thank me.

735
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,160
This person was too strange.

736
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,380
I'm thinking...

737
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,680
could she have been under some kind of

738
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,720
psychological manipulation at the time of the crime?

739
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,470
Psychological manipulation?

740
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,670
That mysterious?

741
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,040
But that could explain

742
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,310
why the victim behaved

743
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,350
so bizarrely before she died.

744
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,340
Even if she was psychologically manipulated,

745
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,750
how would that have been done?

746
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,730
The victim made a very strange gesture

747
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,310
moments before death.

748
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,870
[Zone E]

749
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,890
[Zone E]

750
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,150
What's this?

751
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,660
It looks like a...

752
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,090
communication device.

753
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,760
So, the victim

754
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,020
was communicating with someone before she died.

755
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,790
The reason she exhibited

756
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,200
so many weird behaviors

757
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,450
was that she was

758
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,660
under psychological manipulation

759
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,450
by the person she was speaking with?

760
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,870
That makes sense.

761
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,980
Is that possible?

762
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,220
I've seen a similar case before

763
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,770
where someone who was psychologically manipulated

764
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,960
believed they were scalded by cold water.

765
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,700
Similarly,

766
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,590
it's not impossible for the victim to smile

767
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,050
while her whole body was on fire.

768
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,620
[Yu Fan] [Jin Yan] [Fang Ni]

769
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,590
The victim's mental state

770
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,240
at that time does fit.

771
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,590
There is indeed a possibility

772
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,790
that someone exploited the victim's vulnerable state.

773
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,840
Then, who could that person be?

774
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,790
Jin Yan.

775
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,850
Jin Yan?

776
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,000
[Yu Fan] [Jin Yan]

777
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,140
Why her?

778
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,640
If Yu Fan's

779
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,440
mental state at that time

780
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,000
was already so poor

781
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,120
that she was experiencing intense hallucinations,

782
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,070
then it wouldn't require

783
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,230
any sophisticated psychological techniques.

784
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:10,760
[Yu Fan] [Jin Yan]

785
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,220
As long as one

786
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,560
knew her inner weakness,

787
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,860
they could psychologically manipulate her

788
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,260
while she was in the fire.

789
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,040
In other words...

790
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,040
In other words,

791
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,620
the person who could manipulate her

792
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,280
must be the one who knew her best.

793
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:16,960
And

794
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,460
someone she trusted the most.

795
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,890
What was her motive for murder?

796
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,370
Let's go over everything

797
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,800
we have on Jin Yan again.

798
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,660
Oh, right.

799
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,620
I found a video earlier

800
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,030
of Gao Yarui bullying Jin Yan.

801
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,430
I'll pull it up for you to see.

802
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,410
Apologize to me!

803
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,280
I've long had enough of you!

804
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,120
Wait.

805
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:42,760
Let me rewind it.

806
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,760
I've long had enough of you!

807
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,370
This.

808
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,810
This pair of shoes...

809
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,610
These are the shoes that the victim wore on that day.

810
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,920
If Jin Yan knew

811
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,170
that Yu Fan didn't help when she could have,

812
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,920
then she would have

813
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,070
a reason to hate Yu Fan.

814
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,450
So now we need to think about

815
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,070
how to break through

816
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,420
Jin Yan's psychological defenses.

817
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,540
I have an idea.

818
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,950
Captain Shen, you wanted to see me?

819
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,330
Get Gao Yarui,

820
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,680
Fang Ni, Cheng Sisi, and Jin Yan

821
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,320
in here.

822
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:23,960
For the first three,

823
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,030
you can ask them anything.

824
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,680
When it's Jin Yan's turn,

825
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,430
come and get me.

826
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:26,950
[Interrogation Room]

827
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,070
Anything?

828
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,790
Go.

829
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:28,670
[Interrogation Room]

830
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,720
Yes.

831
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,270
Captain Shen.

832
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,320
It's like this.

833
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,440
We have a few more questions

834
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,600
we need to ask you.

835
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,950
Just answer "yes" or "no."

836
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,470
Are you a local?

837
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,630
Yes.

838
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,030
You're 22 years old?

839
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,790
Yes.

840
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,000
You're studying at Binjiang University,

841
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,880
senior year?

842
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,550
Yes.

843
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,580
Do you hate Gao Yarui?

844
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,240
Yes.

845
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,120
Do you want to find the real culprit?

846
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,100
Yes.

847
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,860
Do you have anything to do with Yu Fan's death?

848
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,510
No.

849
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,800
Did you know that Yu Fan was there

850
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,670
the day you were filmed?

851
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,860
Answer me.

852
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,790
She was there?

853
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,510
Really?

854
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,730
Was Yu Fan really there?

855
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,639
Stop pretending.

856
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,040
You knew it.

857
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,679
The rapid-fire questions were just a front.

858
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,110
None of your answers matter.

859
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,420
What matters is your reaction.

860
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,630
Your surprise lasted too long.

861
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,530
You knew that Yu Fan was there that day.

862
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,219

863
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,080
The video.

864
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,630
Take a good look.

865
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,780
Speak!

866
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,760
Who knows what you're like

867
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,940
behind closed doors?

868
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,290
This video

869
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,530
captured Yu Fan's shoes.

870
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,320
And this 3D reconstruction

871
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,230
proves that you could see

872
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,360
them.

873
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,140
Is there anything else you want to say?

874
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,400
So what if I knew

875
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,160
about this?

876
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,150
You killed Yu Fan

877
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,740
because of this, didn't you?

878
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,040
On what basis are you saying that?

879
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,250
Because you believed that she had betrayed you.

880
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,120
Because you believed

881
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,870
she was in league with Gao Yarui,

882
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,740
and they were bullying you together.

883
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,690
Am I right?

884
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,730
Do you know

885
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,140
why Yu Fan was mentally absent

886
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,850
every day before her death?

887
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,160
Do you know why you were able

888
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,570
to so easily

889
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,630
psychologically manipulate

890
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,820
Yu Fan?

891
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,350
It all started with that incident.

892
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,300
She felt guilty

893
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,470
and remorseful every day.

894
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,660
She desperately wanted to make it up to you.

895
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,320
So,

896
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,890
she used this LARP game

897
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,580
to try to get revenge on Gao Yarui.

898
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,170
She wanted to avenge you.

899
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,390
She told you about this plan.

900
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,820
And you?

901
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,490
What did you do?

902
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,680
[Sorrow]

903
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,170
I'm here! Nobody move!

904
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,280
Get in the room first!

905
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,900
[Sorrow]

906
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,940
Then you manipulated her

907
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,230
into pouring water onto that pile of

908
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,630
quicklime mixture.

909
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,000
When the mixture met water,

910
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,100
it reacted

911
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,670
and ignited the entire sealed room.

912
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,820
And that's how Yu Fan was burned to death.

913
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,430
Do you have any evidence?

914
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,600
As long as you did it,

915
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,430
there would be traces.

916
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,170
These are the clothes you wore

917
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,120
on the day you played the LARP game.

918
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,790
After our examination,

919
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,080
we found

920
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,890
powder from the quicklime mixture on them.

921
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,930
Is there anything else you want to say?

922
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,840
Also,

923
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,570
we don't need to check

924
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,910
your purchase records, right?

925
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,350
Jin Yan.

926
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,280
You said Yu Fan

927
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,820
was your only friend.

928
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,370
You all mocked her for having a weak personality.

929
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,580
But she was willing to

930
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,020
stand up to Gao Yarui for you.

931
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,000
And you?

932
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,740
What did you do?

933
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,160
I think you're

934
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,890
the weakest one here!

935
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,490
You took advantage of her guilt,

936
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,350
her remorse,

937
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,990
and her trust in you!

938
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,150
You killed

939
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,290
your best friend!

940
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,850
How could you do this to her?

941
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,100
It's not like that!

942
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,300
She was the one who wronged me!

943
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,820
How did she wrong you?

944
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,600
She betrayed me.

945
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,770
She betrayed me!

946
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,650
She betrayed me!

947
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,640
Fighting back, huh?

948
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,090
Avoiding me, huh?

949
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,170
Help me!

950
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,680
Don't touch me!

951
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,910
Of course, I recognized those shoes.

952
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,540
I gave them to her...

953
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,280
as a birthday present.

954
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,510
I know

955
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,820
she didn't dare to stand up to Gao Yarui.

956
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,820
But I never thought...

957
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,280
she wouldn't even have the courage

958
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,230
to go out and find someone to save me.

959
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,360
That coward.

960
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,390
Do you know?

961
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,960
That day, the bathroom

962
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,070
was wet and cold,

963
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,060
with a fishy, foul smell.

964
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,140
I just stared in that direction...

965
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,550
waiting and waiting.

966
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,490
I kept waiting.

967
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,630
In the end, she never came out.

968
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,600
She didn't do anything.

969
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,230
We were friends for so many years,

970
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,140
yet she did nothing!

971
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,920
She did nothing!

972
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,640
How much better could I have treated her?

973
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,180
I was so sincere to her.

974
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:26,760
Look at

975
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,880
how she repaid me!

976
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,420
So, you killed her.

977
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,280
It was me.

978
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,640
I took advantage of her guilt...

979
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,640
making her believe

980
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,130
we were back to the time when I was being bullied...

981
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,710
and making her pour water.

Desiccant Hazards.

985
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,950
Common food desiccants mainly contain calcium oxide.

986
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:38,870
If accidentally ingested,

987
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,420
it can easily cause esophageal burns or stomach ulcers.

988
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,580
Seek medical attention as soon as possible.

989
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:43,420
Calcium oxide

990
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,620
is an alkaline compound.

991
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:48,710
When exposed to water, it reacts violently, releasing heat and gas,

992
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,350
causing desiccant packets to expand

993
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,420
and generating a significant amount of pressure in the process.

994
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,260
When the pressure reaches a certain level,

995
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,030
it can lead to an explosion.
