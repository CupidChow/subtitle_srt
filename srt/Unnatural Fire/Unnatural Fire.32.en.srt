00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,430
that your welfare house's funds

381
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,720
seem to be a bit tight, is that right?

382
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,110
Yes.

383
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,410
The funding issue for the institution

384
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,830
has never been resolved.

385
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,350
I even approached your mother about it.

386
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,380
After hearing about it from my mother,

387
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,160
I discussed it with my family.

388
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,310
We can provide funding.

389
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,880
You've all decided?

390
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,640
Thank you.

391
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,680
This way, my children

392
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,640
will be able to stay.

393
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,480
Thank you, thank you.

394
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,440
Thank you, thank you.

395
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,250
I've also heard

396
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,180
that Chun has been quite busy lately.

397
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,620
And

398
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,790
she's not happy with her work.

399
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,070
The job of a forensic doctor

400
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,880
is, after all,

401
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,270
not particularly suitable for girls, is it?

402
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,530
Initially, she studied medicine,

403
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,480
but halfway through,

404
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,750
she changed it herself.

405
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,790
She switched to forensic medicine.

406
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,450
I've never been satisfied

407
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,720
with this job.

408
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,450
Since she's not happy doing it,

409
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,030
and you want her to change jobs,

410
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,450
I have an idea.

411
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,270
In our group,

412
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,590
there's a position in the hospital

413
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,140
that's quite suitable for Chun.

414
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,510
As long as she's willing,

415
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,000
she can come anytime.

416
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,720
Jiang He,

417
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,230
how can I

418
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,720
ever thank you enough for this?

419
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,920
It's nothing.

420
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,900
It's my pleasure.

421
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,410
Come, come, let's go to my office.

422
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:40,750
Alright.

423
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,240
Have a cup of tea.

424
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,790
Let's go.

425
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,240
Dean Zhang,

426
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,070
I'm really grateful to you.

427
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,480
Seeing Haoyu growing up so well here

428
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
at your place

429
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,740
puts my mind at ease.

430
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,510
This is all part of my job.

431
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,240
I should be the one thanking Mr. Han

432
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,920
for the financial support.

433
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,180
Please, don't mention it.

434
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,550
Xishan Lake Welfare House

435
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,510
perfectly meets

436
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,720
our funding criteria.

437
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,710
It just so happens that we can help Chun as well.

438
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,020
Let's call it a happy coincidence.

439
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,320
Please, you two, stay a moment.

440
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,240
I'll be going now.

441
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,160
Alright.

442
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,750
If later,

443
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,640
if I come to see Haoyu,

444
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
I'll contact you directly.

445
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,240
Okay.

446
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,310
No problem.

447
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,540
Goodbye.

448
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,310
Do you have any plans next?

449
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,480
Would you like to have a meal together?

450
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,240
Senior,

451
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,510
I'm a bit tired.

452
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,920
I'd like to go back and rest first.

453
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,760
That's fine.

454
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,960
Then you get some good rest.

455
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,350
Bye.

456
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,280
[Refuse] [Answer]

457
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,280
[Jiang He]

458
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Hello?

459
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,310
Why so formal?

460
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,890
Is there something you need?

461
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,830
Two things.

462
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,460
First,

463
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,350
regarding Dean Zeng's

464
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,310
funding issue.

465
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,890
I've already resolved it for her.

466
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,720
That's great.

467
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,350
Thank you on behalf of the children.

468
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,920
What's the other thing?

469
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
The other thing is,

470
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,680
I've heard that recently

471
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,000
you're not very happy with your job.

472
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,920
The Dean

473
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,470
also wants you to change jobs.

474
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,500
I mentioned that our company

475
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,030
has a position that would suit you well.

476
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,630
I hope you'll consider it.

477
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,030
The Dean is also pleased about it.

478
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
I'm sorry,

479
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,750
but I've never

480
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,790
thought about changing jobs.

481
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,240
You haven't even heard

482
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,590
what conditions I'm offering you.

483
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,480
Maybe it's something

484
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,640
you can't refuse.

485
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,340
No matter what the conditions are,

486
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,960
I don't want to change jobs.

487
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,510
I appreciate your kindness.

488
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,000
Chun,

489
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,540
you understand,

490
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,440
I don't just want your appreciation.

491
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,110
I hope you can accept.

492
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,570
If you do,

493
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,350
both matters will be resolved.

494
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,590
Sir,

495
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,750
let's go to Dongqiao welfare house.

496
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,070
Come on, kids.

497
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,600
Tongsheng, you're here.

498
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,680
I just saw Chun go upstairs.

499
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,690
You two didn't come together?

500
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,590
Chun is here?

501
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,160
Yes.

502
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,170
She just went upstairs.

503
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,790
Alright, I'll go check on her.

504
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,720
Okay, okay.

505
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,440
You kids have fun.

506
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,200
Goodbye, uncle.

507
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:55,720
[Accept the child with sincerity and feel the child with heart]

508
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,480
Chun, you're here.

509
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,160
Chun.

510
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,750
I heard Jiang He

511
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,680
helped you solve

512
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,030
the funding issue for the institute.

513
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,670
Did he tell you?

514
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,510
Besides agreeing to

515
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,920
accept his financial support,

516
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,270
what else did you promise him?

517
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,240
I didn't promise anything else...

518
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,730
Jiang He said

519
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,790
your work as a forensic doctor is very demanding.

520
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,750
The hospital now

521
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,950
happens to have an opportunity.

522
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,080
If you want to go,

523
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,310
you can go anytime.

524
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,610
I think this is a good thing.

525
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,160
Of course, we should thank him.

526
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Thank him?

527
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,600
Are you thanking him on my behalf?

528
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,160
Did you consult with me?

529
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,750
Did you consult with me?

530
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,970
Did you get my permission

531
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,440
before transferring Yu away?

532
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,850
This is not the same thing.

533
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,080
As to what I choose

534
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,000
and what I want to do,

535
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,860
what right do you have to control me?

536
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,810
How is this not the same thing?

537
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,280
If you can control me,

538
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,390
then I can control you.

539
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,960
Besides, I'm your mother.

540
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,430

except for matters at the institute,

543
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,210
when have you ever cared about me?

Let's talk about the college entrance exam.

548
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,800
I went around asking

549

which careers were good,

550
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,410
which careers had good job prospects.

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,270
How many times did I go to the medical school

00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,270
to gather information?

553
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,470
I suggested you study medicine.

554
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,380

I had forgotten until you mentioned it.

00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,700
Yes.

561
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,060
my mother still loved me.

562
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,480
My mother cared about me.

I was very happy.

But I never expected

565
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,230
later, I learned

566
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,920
you only did it because you saw

567
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,110
other children filling out their college applications.

568

My daughter is also taking the college entrance exam this year.

571
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,140
Should I show some concern for her?"

572
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,820
Throughout the entire process,

573
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,460
you never asked

574
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,930
what I actually like,

575
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,720
what kind of life

576
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,000
I want to live in the future,

577
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,480
or what career I want to pursue.

578
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,830
All you thought about was

579
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,010
how I could be convenient for you.

580
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,480
Even when you made me study medicine,

581
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,160
it was just so I could come back

582
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,590
and conveniently treat the children.

583
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,020
Yes, I admit it.

584
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,170
You're not wrong.

585
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,390
I chose a good profession for you,

586
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,810
which also benefits the children in the orphanage.

587
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,090
It's killing two birds with one stone.

588
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,310
Isn't that good?

589
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,180
And you?

590
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,330
You finally went to study medicine,

591
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,160
but halfway through,

592
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,560
you changed your major

593
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,000
to forensic medicine.

595

00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,480
Of course I accepted it.

598
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,510
Is that really an opportunity?

599
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,550

600

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,150
he called me to take credit?

but in his eyes,

605
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,560
this is nothing but a transaction.

624
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,810
I've been thinking,

00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,060

No, listen to me, Jin Chun.

Previously,

655
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,970
I heard from Jin Chun

656
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,510
that you're planning to raise funds.

657
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,630

please take a look at this.

664

These are some charitable organizations

665
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,150

668
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,320
They're all very interested.

669
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,890
They might

670
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,190
send someone here

671
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,190
to verify things.

672
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,850
If everything checks out,

673
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,920
the funds can be released quickly.

674
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,750
Do you have any conditions?

675
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,880
I don't have any conditions.

676
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,740
As you can see, I'm Jin Chun's friend,

677
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,280
and I'm also her senior from school.

678

00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,190
They all come from these charitable organizations.

684
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,000
How should I put it?

685
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,880
Because I'm acting as

686
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,690
a kind of intermediary,

687
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,270
the procedures and processes

688
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,230
might be handled more quickly.

689
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,350
Then, on behalf of the children, I thank you.

690
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,820
Please, don't mention it.

691
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,180
It's my honor.

692

694
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,900
I've discovered three things.

695
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,190
Here's the case.

696
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,450
According to Du Danning's colleagues,

697
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,970
she's been working on a case recently.

698
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,760
She's defending

699
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,110

700
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,880
a subsidiary of the Han Group.

701
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,510
Take a look at this first.

702
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,260
The case isn't that complicated.

703
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,190
[Name: Cheese Stick] [Test result] [Project approved]

704
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,260
The factory used to produce cheese sticks.

705
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,880
After a child ate them,

706
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,320
they had a severe allergic reaction.

707
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,970
Although they were rushed to the hospital,

708
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,320
it still resulted in

709
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,370
permanent damage.

710
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,540
The child's parents

711
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,850
sued the processing factory.

712
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,130
The second thing.

713
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,480
Do you remember Wei Kang?

714
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,530
The 2/16 case?

715
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,630
That's right.

716
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,970
Wei Kang's wife, Sun Ling, said

717
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,080
he was killed by Han Pei

718
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,110
when he was about to testify

719
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,870
for his patient.

720
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,400
That's what she was referring to.

721
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,120
After this incident,

722
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,360
the child's parents didn't give up.

723
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,630
They found a new legal team

724
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,590
and filed a lawsuit.

725
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,250
As for the Han Group,

726
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,440
the defense lawyer they hired

727
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,830
was Du Danning.

728
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,580
But now there's a problem.

729
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,000
Since the factory

730
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,400
no longer produces cheese sticks,

731
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,340
and they can't be found on the market,

732
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,360
it means neither side has evidence.

733
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,110
However, just two days before

734
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,630
submitting evidence to the prosecutor's office,

735
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,110
Du Danning found

736
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,690
a crucial inspection report.

737
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,290
She even spent a large sum of money

738
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
to purchase it.

739
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,550
This report proves

740
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:52,840
that the batch of cheese sticks

741
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,150
was completely fine at the time.

742
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,100

747

were not problematic,

748
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,290
why would Han Pei kill Wei Kang?

749
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,550
This is the third point I wanted to make.

750

After re-examination,

753
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,210
it was found to be fake.

754

According to the prosecutor's office,

755
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,530
the forgery was not sophisticated.

756
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,370

757
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,000

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
when obtaining such an important

760
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,280
report,

761
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,420
it should have been carefully verified.

762
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:35,880
But Du Danning

763
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,960
was too eager for quick success.

764
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,590
So,

765
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,760
she knew she had made

766
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,880
a basic mistake.

767
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,650
If it were to go to court...

768
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,070
It would undoubtedly be a lost case.

769
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,560
Her career is over too.

770
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,230
She kept telling me before

771
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,030
if she won this case,

772
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,070
she would be promoted to senior partner.

773
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,800
When we were having dinner,

774
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,180
I noticed it.

775
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,930
Something was off about her.

776
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,480
But I didn't ask her any further.

777
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,100
If I had tried to persuade her then,

778
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,880
she might not have

779
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,960
gone through all this.

780
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,110
If at that time

781
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,480
I had asked her one more question,

782
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,910
I might have been able to stop her.

783
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,500
Captain Shen,

784
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:58,840
Tang Feng is here.

785
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,910
He says he wants to see Chun.

786
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,190
What does he want with Chun?

787
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,150
He didn't say anything else,

788
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,110
just that he wants to see Chun.

789
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,340
Take him to the conference room.

790
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,400
Okay.

791
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,180
I'll go.

792
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,080
Let me go with you.

793
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,150
I want to go alone.

794
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,040
Chun,

795
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,240
if you need anything,

796
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,400
just call me.

797
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,670
I'm always here.

798
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,300
We met in college.

799
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
She was the brightest star in the law department.

800
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,550
No matter what she did,

801
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,990
she always excelled.

802
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,880
Everyone used to say

803
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,120
that as long as Du Danning

804
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,070
was in a competition or exam,

805
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,470
everyone else

806
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,990
could only compete for second place.

807
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,370
After we graduated and started working,

808
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,470
she was still as ambitious as ever.

809
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,000
But work

810
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,150
is different from studying.

811
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,230
You can't get everything

812
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,370
just by working hard.

813
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,110
I watched her

814
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,740
get busier and busier,

815
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,200
more and more exhausted.

816
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,760
But in the end,

817
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,430
she was still sent to Beixun.

818
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,000
Although she said

819
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,160
coming to Beixun

820
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,630
was her best chance

821
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,400
to become a partner,

822
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,520
the truth is,

823
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,110
being transferred away from headquarters

824
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,590
was a huge blow to her.

825
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,770
Her emotions

826
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,280
and state of mind

827
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,380
were on the verge of collapse.

828
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,060
She was too desperate to prove herself.

829
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,830
She told me a bit about it,

830
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,450
but I really had no idea

831
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,150
her situation

832
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,100
was so difficult.

833
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,360
She wouldn't tell you.

834
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,360
That day, she suddenly

835
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,740
sent me a message

836
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,920
telling me to be careful when I got home.

837
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,980
I knew something was wrong right away,

838
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,330
but by the time I rushed back,

839
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,610
it was already too late.

840
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,740
I saw her

841
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,590
shut herself in

842
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,880
that closed-off home.

843
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,390
Actually,

844
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,670
all those doubts you mentioned,

845
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,510
I know about them all.

846
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,970
But what difference does it make?

847
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,390

850
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,120
Always use electrical appliances, wiring, and outlets

851
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,360
that meet quality standards,

852
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,970
ensuring not to overload circuits.

After using household appliances,

854
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,200
remember to unplug them or turn off the power.

855
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,920
It's advisable to use dedicated flame-retardant sockets,

856
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,600
and never connect high-power appliances to the same power strip.

857
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,570
Regularly inspect electrical wiring and appliances

858
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,570
to prevent hazards from aging, short circuits, or leakage,

859
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,600
with prompt replacement or repair when needed.

860
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,570
Never substitute fuses with other metal wires

861
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,120
or create makeshift wiring extensions.
