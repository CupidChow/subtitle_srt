He Xi, you are here.

Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

He Xi is staying at our place tonight.

Is there anything delicious for dinner?

18
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,070
Of course.

19
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,159

You're becoming quite the little man now.

43
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,140
You need to learn to take care of yourself.

44
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,760
Don't make everyone worry about you

45
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,680
or be concerned for you.

46
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,000

You're all grown up now,

60
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,510
but still the same as when you were little,

61
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,040
hiding here whenever something happens.

62
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,070
Why are you here?

63
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,070
Just came to see you.

64
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,320
Do you remember

65
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,560
when we first met

66
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,680
in this courtyard?

67
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,000
My mom brought

68
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,240
a group of children then.

69
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,950
Everyone was like them,

70
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,070
laughing foolishly.

71
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,680
Except you. You didn't speak,

72
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,800
very quiet.

73
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,430
The most special child.

74
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,240
I was thinking at the time,

75
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,270
with your personality,

76
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,159
I definitely wouldn't

77
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,190
become good friends with you.

78
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,800
Until my mom threw you a birthday party.

79
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,070
That day was made very mysterious.

80
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,430
Everything was prepared.

81
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,750
But you,

82
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,720
you took off your party hat,

83
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,560
shouted,

84
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,390
"I don't want to celebrate my birthday!"

85
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,310
and ran away.

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,750
The other children

87
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,950
were all busy eating cake.

88
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,360
My mom told me to chase after you,

89
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
so I followed you out.

90
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,870
Then right in front of me,

91
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,950
you fell down.

92
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,270
You didn't seem to feel any pain,

93
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,430
got up and kept running.

94
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,950
What happened after that?

95
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,600
Do you remember?

96
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,120
After that,

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,920
we went to the infirmary.

98
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,270
That's right.

99
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,750
After we got to the infirmary,

100
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,750
it was the funniest scene

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,480
I've ever seen in my life.

102
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,800
You were such a tiny little kid,

103
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,270
curled up in the infirmary,

104
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,080
bandaging your own wounds.

105
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,630
As I watched you then,

106
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,080
I thought to myself,

107
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,360
there are actually some things

108
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,080
I should learn from you,

109
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,960
my little brother.

110
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,150
But later,

111
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,200
you were the one who bandaged me up.

112
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,000
But at that time, you gave me

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,600
a piece of candy.

114
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,510
If it wasn't for that candy,

115
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,510
I wouldn't have become

116
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,440
your good friend.

117
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,630
But I really have to thank you.

118
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,910
If it wasn't for you,

119
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,630
I probably wouldn't have been able

120
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,550
to stay in this courtyard

121
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,200
for so long.

125
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,630

126
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,840
and what you

127
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,790
want to say.

128
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,960

Okay.

134
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,240
Then when you find out the truth,

135
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,510
you must let yourself go.

136
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,630

Yes, I came back to visit.

145
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,270
You should have come back long ago.

146

You're here too.

147
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,670

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,630
I'll have them prepare

151
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,750
your favorite dishes.

152
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,060
I have to leave soon, I have something to do.

153
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,880
Leaving so soon?

154
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,840
Then you must come back often.

155
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,080
Let me know before you come back.

156
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:39,960
Alright.

157
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,270
I'll let you know in advance next time.

158
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,460
Look at you.

159
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,430
Tongsheng doesn't come, and you don't come either.

160
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,120
Now the children

161
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,910
don't even recognize you anymore.

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,730
They even called you strangers.

163
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,710
What about you?

164
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,360
Are you not staying for dinner either?

165
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,200
Yes,

166
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,960
I'll do as you say.

167
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,030
Do as I say?

168
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,000
Then when I ask you to come back,

169
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,910
why don't you come back?

170
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,080
Now you're listening to me again.

171
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,030
When did you...

172
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,960
Coming.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,850
We'll leave you to it.

174
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,310
Then I won't see you off.

175
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,670
Make sure to come back often.

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,630
Come frequently.

177
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,030
Okay.

Goodbye, goodbye.

Goodbye.

180
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,240
Let me give you a ride.

181
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,870
You ride this bike pretty well.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,530
Haven't you gotten used to it after all this time?

183
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,420
Why do you want to live here?

184
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
It's so far from the Fire Investigation Department.

185
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,480
The agent is waiting for me.

186
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,520
Be careful on your way back.

187
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,670
Alright, go quickly.

188

191

are very good.

192

383
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,590
Alright.

384
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,680
Thank you for your cooperation.

385
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,720
Let's go.

386
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,590
Sorry for the disturbance.

387
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,480
Idol.

388
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,110
Is this how you usually

389
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,030
conduct your inquiries?

390
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,000
Isn't this a bit too much walking?

391
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,310
Does your foot hurt?

392
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,720
Do you need me to help you?

393
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,210
I'm not that delicate.

394
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,400
It's terrible.

395
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,790
You're injured but still walking faster than me.

396
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,510
Look at those people over there.

397
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,680
Look at those people over there.

398
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,870
They're standing there watching.

399
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,930
Ma'am.

400
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,510
I'm from the Fire Investigation Department.

401
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,310
This young man is so handsome.

402
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,960
How old are you?

403
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,880
Do you have a girlfriend?

404
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,240
Well...

405
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:56,640
How old are you?

406
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,120
I'm here to ask about the fire situation.

407
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,920
That girl in your family

408
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,880
would be perfect for him.

409
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,590
We're on official duty.

410
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,610
We're in the middle of an inquiry.

411
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,400
I'll go ask someone else.

412
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,230
I'll go ask someone else.

413
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,720
Ma'am, ma'am.

414
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,510
This young man is so handsome too.

415
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,440
Does he have a girlfriend?

416
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,480
Listen to me, listen to me.

417
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,820
Let me tell you something.

418
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,680
The two of them plus the two of us,

419
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,500
all four of us are single.

420
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,110
That's great.

421
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,790
Four?

422
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,680
Waiting to be seen, are we?

423
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,070
We have

424
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,240
several girls here.

425
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,030
We can introduce them all to you.

426
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,030
Well, Ma'am, it's like this.

427
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,270
We'll

428
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,590
leave you a phone number.

429
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:25,920
Okay.

430
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,240
And then

431
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,070
I'd like to ask you a few questions, if that's alright.

432
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,800
Is that okay with you?

433
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,640
Yes, yes, yes.

434
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,480
Sure, sure, sure.

435
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,070
Do you all

436
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,880
live here?

437
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,550
Yes, we do.

438
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,160
I live right downstairs.

439
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,000
So, at that time,

440
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,920
when the explosion happened,

441
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,510
what was it like?

442
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,740
There was a loud boom!

443
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,930
I thought

444
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,070
someone was setting off firecrackers in the middle of the night.

445
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,870
What about the family involved in the incident?

446
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,640
Do you know anything about them?

447
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,180
That family?

448
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,440
They'd argue from morning

449
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,550
till late at night.

450
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,110
Every morning,

451
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,000
they'd start arguing at four or five o'clock.

452
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,240
They'd get up even earlier

453
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
than me, an old lady.

454
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,880
What were they arguing about?

455
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,300
Getting in the car, getting out of the car,

456
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,640
and something about a countdown.

457
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,830
Three, two, one.

458
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,590
What's going on?

459
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,140
Anyway, I couldn't understand it.

460
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,350
Well, then,

461
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,590
did you have any interactions with them?

462
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,180
You've asked the right person.

463
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,160
That family,

464
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,240
when that girl first

465
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,440
moved in,

466
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,110
I thought she

467
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,270
was very pretty.

468
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,390
I thought,

469
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,160
"She'd be easy to set up."

470
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,510
So I took the initiative

471
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,750
to chat with her.

472
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,030
But it turned out

473
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,200
there was no chance.

474
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,960
She was already married.

475
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,680
Did they live together

476
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,510
with someone else?

477
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,010
There was someone called

478
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,030
Ye Meng.

479
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,790
But that girl,

480
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,930
she doesn't like to talk to people.

481
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,030
She doesn't like to talk to people,

482
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,070
so I don't bother with her either.

483
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,880
How was the relationship between this Ye Meng

484
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,790
and the married couple?

485
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,070
What happens behind closed doors

486
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,070
is not for us to know.

487
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,310
Besides, I'm not a busybody.

488
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,750
But think about it,

489
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,540
living together in a shared apartment,

490
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,350
wouldn't there be conflicts after a while?

491
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,350
Don't you think so?

492
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,160
Yes, yes, yes.

493
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,830
Okay.

494
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,960
We understand.

495
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,760
This is our phone number.

496
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,480
Please keep it safe.

497
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,240
Alright, alright.

498
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,270
Feel free to call us anytime if anything comes up.

499
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,790
Okay.

500
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,270
Alright, alright.

501
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,030
Quick, take a look at this photo.

502
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,640
No, no, I don't want to see it.

503
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,000
Another time.

504
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,590
About finding a partner.

505
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,640
No, no, not now. Maybe another time.

506
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,650
I'll call, I'll call.

507
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,110
Okay, okay.

508
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,030
We're leaving, we're leaving.

509
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,160
Look at these young men.

510
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,000
They're all so handsome.

511
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,450
[110 119]

512
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,070
These two guys.

513
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,550
Captain Shen, you're still the best at this.

514
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,400
Let me tell you.

515
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,110
It's all about experience.

516
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,360
Why is there a dog?

517
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,680
It's so noisy in the middle of the night.

518
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,880
Mao.

519
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,760
Don't rush.

520
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,140
Mao.

521
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,380
Don't be in a hurry.

522
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,400
Let's go for a walk outside.

523
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,640
Such a good boy.

524
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,920
The dog is too big.

525
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,350
It's too sudden.

526
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,400
Captain Shen is afraid of dogs.

527
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,520
Captain Shen gave me a fright.

528
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,820
Chun,

529
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,990
I'm almost done here.

530
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,480
Has the cause of death been determined?

531
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,680
Based on preliminary judgment,

532
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,700
the surface of the skin is light and has a 2-degree burn.

533
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,320
There's dust in his inner eyelid and throat.

534
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,510
There's secretion and dust

535
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,090
which blocked the top of the respiratory tract.

536
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,400
All signs match

537
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,400
the possibility that she was trapped in the fire

538
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,310
and died

539
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,440
of suffocation.

540
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,400
Of course,

541
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,440
we'll need to run further tests

542
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,870
on carboxyhemoglobin

543
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,050
and check for alcohol in the blood,

544
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,620
hallucinogenic,

545
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,970
or anesthetic substances.

546
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,440
Someone has seen her

547
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,270
live streaming video before she died.

548
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,270
It seemed quite normal.

549
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,480
What about the family? They haven't arrived?

550
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,720
I haven't seen them.

551
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,870
Captain Shen.

552
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,500
The husband of the deceased,

553
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,160
Jia Sanmeng.

554
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,720
Hello.

555
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,640
Let's confirm the identity of the deceased first.

556
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,310
Understood. You can go ahead with your work.

557
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,560
Mr. Jia, my condolences.

558
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,040
This is a routine inquiry.

559
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,190
Would you be able to cooperate?

560
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,000
Yes, I can.

561
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,640
Was Qin Qing

562
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,000
always working as a live streamer?

563
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,160
Yes, she was

564
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,550
a full-time

565
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,960
product promoter.

566
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,750
Who did she usually

567
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,590
interact with the most?

568
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,350
Me.

569
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,830
Apart from livestreaming,

570
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,240
she doesn't go out much.

The presence of primary beads

00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,400
until the day of the incident,

762
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,550
did any outsiders enter their home?

763
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,510
No.

764
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,150
Hey, Huang Qi,

765
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,670
go back to the crime scene and check

766
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,670
if there's any evidence we missed,

767
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,190
such as

768
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,190
scissors, nail clippers, or similar items.

769
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,520
Captain Shen,

770
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,000
there's something off about this case.

771
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,110
Someone tampered with the e-bike.

772
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,150
The main suspects now

773
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,550
are Jia Sanmeng and Ye Meng.

774
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,280
I'll go find them now.

775
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:31,920
Come back.

776
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,310
Send someone else.

777
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,630
You come with me first to investigate

778
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,770
their social connections.

779
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,659
Understood.

780
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,880
Alright, I'll head back first then.

781
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:38,760
Let's go together.

782
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,760
Are you going to see

783
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,800
Qin Qing's mother?

784
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,150
I want to go with you.

785
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,670
Chun,

786
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,070
I understand how you feel,

787
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,480
but the victim's family

788
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,590
is very fragile right now.

789
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,110
I'll try my best to help you.

790
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,510
Niu, take the evidence to the forensics department.

791
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,110
Okay.

792
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,480
We're leaving.

793
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,070
We're just

794
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,710
an ordinary family.

795
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,440
Qing's father was ill

796
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,400
and passed away years ago.

797
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,400
As for Qing, she didn't like studying,

798
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,280
so after vocational school, she worked various jobs.

799
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,230
She met Jia

800
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,110
while working.

801
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,030
Jia is an educated person,

802
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,630
with a high level of education.

803
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,190
He's also good-looking.

804
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,630
When my Qing married Jia,

805
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,920
all our relatives

806
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,360
were incredibly envious.

807
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,550
After they got married,

808
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,480
did they ever argue?

809
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,710
No,

810
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,670
I've never heard of it.

811
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,320
They've always been good together.

812
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,280
After what happened to Qin Qing,

813
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,070
has Jia Sanmeng come to see you?

814
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:43,840
Yes,

815
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,800
he's even more upset than I am.

816
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,000
He brought me home yesterday,

817
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,150
and I could see he was on the verge of tears.

818
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,150
How could this happen to our family?

819
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,760
When will I

820
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,150
be able to lay my Qing to rest?

821
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,630
Leaving her here

822
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,960
keeps my heart in suspense.

823
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,510
Auntie,

824
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,360
please don't be upset.

825
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,710
There's been a new development

826
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,800
in the case.

827
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,840
We can't rule out the possibility of human-made.

828
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:15,920
Human-made?

829
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,590
Are you saying someone killed Qing?

830
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
We're still investigating.

831
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,400
Wait a minute.

832
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,110
All those questions you were asking earlier...

833
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,190
Are you suspecting Jia?

834
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,840
We're just gathering information.

835
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,000
Oh, Auntie,

836
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,190
about the autopsy...

837
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,480
No need to discuss that.

838
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,510
I don't consent to an autopsy.

839
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,670
You can't touch Qing.

840
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,880
You should leave now.

841
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,800
Go catch the killer.

842
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,230
Don't waste time here.

843
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,920
First you suspect Jia,

844
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,760
and next thing I know,

845
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,000
you'll be suspecting me, won't you?

846
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:43,840
Auntie, please calm down.

847
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,960
Enough, enough, stop talking.

848
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,670
Just go.

849
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,880
Go on, leave.

850
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,230
We're sorry for the disturbance.

851
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:17,960
Our captain

852
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,230
just wants to gather some basic information.

853
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,150
It won't take long.

854
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:20,510
Alright.

855
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:20,920
Over here.

856
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,000
Hello.

857
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:22,550
Hello.

858
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,520
You're Ye Meng's colleague, right?

859
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,150
Yes.

860
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,800
I have a few questions

861
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,320
I'd like to ask you.

862
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,550
Has something happened to Ye Meng?

863
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,150
It's nothing, don't worry.

864
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,360
We're just gathering some information.

865
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,760
What kind of person

866
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,470
is Ye Meng usually?

867
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:36,000
She has a bit of an odd personality.

868
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,760
She doesn't get along well with others.

869
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,760
And every other day,

870
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,000
she has conflicts with customers.

871
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,920
Luckily, the manager doesn't know about this.

872
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,030
If the manager knew,

873
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,000
she probably would have been fired long ago.

874
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:45,710
What's wrong?

875
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,070
Does she look down on this job?

876
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,400
Officer,

877
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,670
you don't know her.

878
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,280
If you had to

879
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,230
work with her,

880
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,280
you wouldn't be able to stand it either.

881
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,020
She's always talking about

882
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,590
living a mediocre life

883
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,470
that drags down her proud soul.

884
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,400
She doesn't work properly every day.

885
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,070
She just says

886
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,590
she wants something,

887
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,360
love or whatever, I don't understand.

888
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,960
A few times when I was on night shift,

889
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,110
my boyfriend came to pick me up.

890
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,510
She happened to see it.

891
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,760
Ye Meng then said

892
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,110
it was shallow love.

893
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,150
It made me so angry.

894
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,840
so I asked her,

895
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,070
"What do you mean by shallow love?"

896
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,070
Then she started again

897
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,440
saying some nonsense about

898
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,150
flying towards the sun,

899
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,000
even if wings melt,

900
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,920
drowning.

901
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,510
I can't remember clearly anymore.

902
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,400
But last year,

903
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,480
she did have a boyfriend.

904
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,960
They broke up soon after.

905
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,880
Boyfriend?

906
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,230
So you're Ye Meng's ex-boyfriend?

907
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,550
Ye Meng?

908
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,110
You mean that

909
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,590
convenience store cashier, right?

910
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,030
That's right.

911
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:41,840
Officer,

912
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,710
let me tell you,

913
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,550
I'm really not close to her,

914
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,230
and I'm definitely not her ex-boyfriend.

915
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,920
It's just that their convenience store

916
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,840
is near our school gate.

917
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,920
I used to go there often.

918
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,230
And I barely

919
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,360
talked to her a few times.

920
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,070
Are you looking for me because of her?

921
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,030
Then why did her colleague say

922
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,150
you were her ex-boyfriend?

923
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,760
It's like this.

924
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,030
I'm the president of

925
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,070
our school's literature club.

926
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,840
And one time,

927
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,760
our club was going to participate in

928
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
a poetry recitation competition.

929
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,710
Our dorm was practicing all night.

930
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:06,920
That day,

931
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,840
I went to their convenience store

932
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,920
and added her on WeChat,

933
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,030
just to make it easier

934
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,150
for future deliveries, like food or water.

935
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,840
That's why I added her.

936
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,840
But who knew that after that,

937
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,840
she just...

938
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,190
How should I put it?

939
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,230
Let me show you.

940
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:21,760
Yes, this one.

941
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,000
This is the Bulao Pavilion platform.

942
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,080
[Even the falling leaves follow the wind]

943
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,440
We often post some

944
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,840
poems and essays on it.

945
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,840
Yes, this is Ye Meng's account.

946
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,110
She posted this to me on it.

947
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,670
[Meeting in Fate] 
[Life is like a poem. Time Is Like A Song.]

948
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:31,880
Look.

949
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,070

wouldn't take that as a confession, right?

quite uncomfortable about it at the time.

she just lowered her head

I thought, forget it,

I won't get involved with her anymore.
