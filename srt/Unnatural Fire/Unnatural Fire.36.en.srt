00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,780
just give me a call.

193
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,470
Tell me,

194
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,260
what is this?

195
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,520
How childish.

196
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,140
Delete it.

197
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,320
Why keep it?

198
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,380
Did you

199
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,190
have a car accident recently and damage your brain?

200
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,860
You've become a completely different person.

201
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,370
When I come back,

202
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,720
let's go to the forest park

203
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,440
and eat at that popular restaurant, okay?

204
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,180
So when are you coming back?

205
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,350
Can you please answer the phone?

206
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,210
A friend said you had a car accident.

207
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,670
How are you really doing now?

208
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,630
Can you please reply to my message?

209
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,510
I'm begging you.

210
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,580
I'm really worried about you now.

211
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,320
No need.

212
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,360
I'm fine.

213
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,550
What do you mean by 'I'm fine'?

214
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,690
Are you really okay or not?

215
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,790
Can you just let me know, please?

216
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,900
I've fallen for someone else.

217
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,590
Let's break up.

218
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,250
Wait.

219

220
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,950
Is this really you sending these messages?

221
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,440
You...

222
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,960
Can you call me if there's anything?

223
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,870
Let's talk this through clearly.

224
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,870
Hey, say something.

225
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,480
We're both respectable people.

226
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,200
Don't make this ugly.

227
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,320
You're not the type without self-respect.

228
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,360
No, just a few days ago

229
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,430
weren't we still fine?

230
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,330
We had agreed

231
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,960
to go eat at that popular restaurant, didn't we?

232
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,710
You were completely fine!

233
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,700
I don't have feelings for you anymore.

234
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,600
I've fallen for someone else.

235
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,000
What?

236
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,070
What else do you want me to say?

237
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,870
You've fallen for someone else?

238
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,140
Who have you fallen for?

239
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,250
Who it is isn't your business, is it?

240
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,950
Han Jun, you bastard!

241
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,610
You should accept

242
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,000
heaven's judgment upon you!

243
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,660
No one can judge me,

244

Han Jun.

248
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,270
I can't believe you're really such a scumbag.

249
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,090
I'm going to let everyone in the world

250
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,630
know

251
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,670
what kind of person you are.

252
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,840
I'm going to tell the everyone

253

in Han Group

254
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,820
that you, Han Jun, are a scumbag.

255
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,100
Go to hell!

[I'm going back to look for him. Wait for me. I'll tell you everything.]

258
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,790
Xiangqin,

259
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,630
the showerhead

260
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,620
in my guest bathroom is broken.

261
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,020
Can I use your bathroom?

262
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,990
Thanks.

263
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,890
I went to the test center

264
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,520
where Du Danning got that gave false reports.

265
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,160
I found that it

266
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,880
was sponsored by Han Group.

267

[Du Danning's Fake Report]

268
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,560
And the staff who received me

269
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,620
lied to me.

270
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,130
So I suspect this case

271
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,120
is related to Han Jun.

272
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,240
Also, do you remember

273
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,790
when we met Han Jun at the hospital,

274
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,380
he mentioned why he came back?

275
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,780
He said he came back this time

276
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,930
to move his mother's ashes.

277
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:58,010
[Du Danning's Fake Report]

278
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,800
I've checked with the cemetery

279
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,550
and the police station.

280
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,270
He hasn't filed any paperwork.

281
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,480
But tomorrow,

282
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,200
he's leaving the country.

283
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,450
Look at this.

284
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,490
What's this?

285
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,570
Chun sent it.

Her name is Lian Xiangqin.

294
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,880
Do you know who her ex-boyfriend is?

295
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,950
It's Han Jun.

298
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,830
Han Jun was acting very strange recently.

He wanted to break up with her after returning to China,

and his whole personality became

302
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,950
completely different from before.

303
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,020
After they had a big fight,

304
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,920
Han Jun even said something like,

305
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,300
no one can judge him

this is not something Senior Han Jun

309
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,220
would ever say.

What's wrong?

322
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,710
Shen Yi said this before.

323
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,160
Shen Yi also said this?

324
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,720

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,550

saying the same thing,

327
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,720
could it be a coincidence?

328
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,420
If it's not a coincidence,

329
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,950
these two people know each other.

330
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,210
That makes sense.

331
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,170
This sentence from Shen Yi

332
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,120
must have been heard from someone else.

333
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,150
Why do you say that?

334
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,670
Because before he said this,

335
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,010
he said something else.

336
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,340
He said,

337
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,670
"So that's what he meant

338
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,920
when he said that."

339
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,080
Then this "he"

340
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,240
refers to...

341
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,790
Han Pei.

342
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,410
Han Pei had always been

343
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,630
under Shen Yi's control,

344
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,070
so Shen Yi threatened him

345
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,200
to say such things.

346
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,470
It's possible.

347
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,660
Shen Yi committed suicide by jumping off a building.

348
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,480
But Han Pei was set up.

349
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,420
He died in a car accident.

350
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,680
What if Han Pei

351
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,920
killed himself?

352
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,860
So you mean

353
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,420
Han Pei didn't die?

354
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,030
He used a car accident

355
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,420
to have his younger brother die in his place.

356
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,000
To cover it all up,

357
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,040
he assumed Han Jun's identity

358
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,640
and lived on.

359
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,410
That is also why

360
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,000
we couldn't do anything

361
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,360
about him before.

362
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,880
Then it all makes sense now.

363
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,700
Wait.

What?

368
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,620
If what you're saying is true,

369
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,470
and Han Jun is indeed Han Pei,

370
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,910
then she's in great danger now.

371
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,560
I'll give her a call.

372
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,770

Something's not right about this.

374
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,040
What Han Pei fears most right now

375
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,800
is having his identity as Han Jun

376
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,700
exposed.

377
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,560
If this girl

378
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,450
meets with him,

379
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,960
she'll be in danger.

Her phone is already unreachable.

382
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,070
What should we do?

383
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,120
I'll contact Chief Wu.

384
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,140
Chun,

385
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,240
if Han Pei contacts you,

386
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,170
you must be careful.

387
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,640
Don't let him notice anything unusual.

388
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,420
His flight is tomorrow afternoon.

389
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,770
I'll definitely find a way to stop him.

390
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,280
Okay.

391
00:20:59,310 --> 00:20:59,950
I understand.

392
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,320
You all be safe too.

393
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,910
Han Pei.

394
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,700
[Han Jun]

395
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:17,680
[23 hours and 52 minutes until Han Jun leaves Korea]

396
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,450
Still not talking, huh?

397
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,890
You think I don't dare

398
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,750
to kill you?

399
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,080
If you kill me,

400
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,700
the evidence proving your identity

401
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,270
will appear.

402
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,290
Making up stories

403
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,270
to scare me?

404
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,100
What?

405
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,610
Is that fun?

406
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,080
Wait, wait.

407
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,950
Wait.

408
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,000
I gave the thing to someone else.

409
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,340
Who?

410
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,540
Can I

411
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,170
have some water?

412
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,890
I'm thirsty.

413
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,710
Speak.

414
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,360
Who did you give it to?

415
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,660
We have all the time in the world.

416
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,060
Think carefully.

417
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,330
I'm begging you.

418
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,480
I'm begging you.

419
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,310
Can you let me go?

420
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:38,830
You, you...

421
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,310
Let me go abroad!

422
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,520
Let me go abroad.

423
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,990
I won't tell anyone.

424
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,620
Never.

425
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,890
No one else

426
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,790
would know your identity.

427
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:46,310
Really.

428
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,160
I beg you.

429
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,190
I really...

430
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,840
Li,

431
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,300
come take a look at this.

432
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,860
Bai Zhi,

433
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,830
come here.

434
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,160
Let them know.

435
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,930
Keep an eye on this.

436
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,720
Go ahead.

437
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,740
Wang Xi,

438
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,170
so your previous plan to kill

439
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,090
Han Pei,

440
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,170
did you tell anyone else about it?

441
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,950
Why would I tell anyone else?

442
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,760
Changing tires

443
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,000
is all part of routine operations.

444
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,270
I had no reason to tell anyone else.

445
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,780
Besides, this is my personal matter.

446
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,890
I don't want to implicate others either.

447
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,490
Officer,

448
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,720
you see, this is

449
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,030
a done deal now.

450
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,360
It's been so long.

451
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,640
I have no reason to lie to you.

452
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,330
I've said everything I needed to say.

453
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,140
Really.

454
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,140
Wang Xi indeed had no motive

455
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,110
to conspire with Han Pei.

456
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,700
He must have been used.

457
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,630
Although Wang Xi didn't say it,

458
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,280
is there a possibility

459
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,950
that Han Pei knew about Wang Xi's plan

460
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,180
and then took advantage of it

461
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,350
to kill Han Jun?

462
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,030
If Wang Xi was unaware,

463
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
he can't be a witness.

464
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,180
Then how can we expose his identity?

465
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,450
Is there any other way?

466
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,920
How much time do we have left?

467
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Less than 19 hours.

468
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,440
Chief Wu,

469
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:09,960
Chief Wu,

470
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,440
Lian Xiangqin has returned to China.

471
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,680
But she went missing.

472
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,480
We're still one step behind.

473
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,780
Han Pei has made his move on her.

474
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,660
Intensify the efforts

475
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,560
to find Lian Xiangqin.

476
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,350
You must find her.

477
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,310
Yes, sir.

478
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,210
From now on,

479
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,450
keep a close eye on Han Pei.

480
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,070
Yes, sir.

481
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:32,770
Chief Wu,

482
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,430
there's only one option left.

483
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,110
Let's hear it.

484
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,260
[Han Group]

485
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,690
Hello?

486
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,280
Hello,

487
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,530
I'm calling from the Beixun Housing Management Bureau.

488
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,170
Is this Mr. Han Jun?

489
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,130
Yes, it's me.

490
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,420
It's like this,

491
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,790
the property you sold last week

492
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,830
on Nanshan Road,

493
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,440
there's a procedure

494
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,700
that needs to be completed at our office.

495
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,310
What's the matter?

496
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,320
Any problem?

497
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,610
It's a document

498
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,270
where there's an issue with the signature.

499
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,950
We need you to come in person to re-sign it,

500
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,080
otherwise the transfer might not go through.

501
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,310
Okay, okay.

502
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:18,790
Alright.

503
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,860
I'll come over in a bit.

504
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,320
Okay.

505
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,380
Good, please come as soon as possible.

506
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,670
Okay, okay. Goodbye.

507
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,500
This is a surprise inspection.

508
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,940
You must cooperate fully.

509
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,650
Of course.

510
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,240
Our group

511
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,200
regularly conducts fire safety training,

512
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,050
which is quite thorough.

513
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,040
Alright.

514
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,850
Then let's first go to

515
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,830
Mr. Han's place for a look.

516
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,310
Okay.

517
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,510
I'll take you to Mr. Han's office.

518
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,810
Doesn't he live here?

519
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:42,570
Yes,

520
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,480
there's an inner and outer room.

521
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,590
Then let's check both.

522
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,620
I'll give Mr. Han a call.

523
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,050
Do you understand what a surprise inspection means?

524
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,200
Don't contact anyone.

525
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,750
Understood, Adviser Xu.

526
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,700
This way, please.

527
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,720
This is Mr. Han's

528
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,680
office.

529
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,250
Alright.

530
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,460
Please take them

531
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,690
to see other rooms.

532
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,370
Certainly.

533
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,110
Please follow me, both of you.

534
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,250
[Han Jun]

535
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,910
[Refuse] [Answer]

536
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,910
[Han Jun]

537
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,650
Hey, Senior.

538
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,430
What's up?

539
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,750
Chun,

540
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,960
that place you're renting now,

541
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,480
how is it?

542
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,440
Are you satisfied?

543
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,460
It's pretty good.

544
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,700
My roommate

545
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,300
is a Chinese girl.

546
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,810
The environment is quite nice too.

547
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,430
That's good.

548
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,300
How's everything? Going smoothly?

549
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,480
Well,

550
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,720
she has a lot of rules.

551
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,980
What do you mean?

552
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,730
It's just that at home,

553
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,310
there are quite a few restrictions.

554
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,820
For example,

555
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,580
the shoes in her shoe cabinet

556
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,110
all have their own specific arrangement.

557
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,050
And then,

558
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,310
she loves growing plants.

559
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,400
Every day, I have to

560
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,930
water her plants.

561
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,040
Sometimes I even have to cook for her.

562
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,800
Oh, and

563
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,340
every morning when I wake up,

564
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,080
I can't set an alarm

565
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,960
because she can't stand

566
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,070
the sound of alarms.

567
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,510
So every morning when I get up,

568
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,160
I have to be very quiet.

569
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,680
She's basically treating you like a maid.

570
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,660
It's fine.

571
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,500
You know, when in Rome...

572
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,760
Look, I'm not criticizing you,

573
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,030
but I offered to let you stay

00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,590
at my place,

575
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,870

577
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,720

Did you know about the fire inspection?

Didn't you know to tidy up

What are you good for?

625
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Han. It's my fault.

626
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,550
Who sprayed in this room?

627
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,910
Was it you who sprayed?

628
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,970
Can't you open your eyes and see

629
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,830
if there's a fire before you spray?

630
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,750
Spraying so much,

631
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,390
as if this stuff is free!

632
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,410
I'm sorry,

633
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,030
the sprinkler detected high temperature and went off.

634
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,830
I thought there was a fire.

635
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,100
So I rushed in.

636
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,000
Mr. Han,

637
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,910
you don't need to be hard on him.

638
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,490
For this test,

00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,400
I personally

00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,030
am willing to take full responsibility.

643
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,480
Alright.

Han Pei needs to reapply for his passport.

645
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,590
It will take at least a few days.

646

he definitely won't be able to leave the country.

649
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,980
However, this is only temporary.

[The microphone is on] [The speaker is on] [The camera is not on]

We are currently monitoring Han Pei,

but his daily activities

657
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,480
are completely normal.

658
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,110
We must not let Han Pei leave the country.

659
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,110
We must ensure that he remains in the country

660
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,140
and is brought to justice.

[The microphone is on] [The speaker is on] [The camera is not on]

00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,300
We will find Lian Xiangqin as soon as possible.

667
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,630
I know Han Pei very well.

668
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,030
Given his usual methods,

669
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,840
he may

670
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,100
set fires to kill people again this time.

671
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,150
Therefore, I request

672
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,550
to join the joint investigation.

673
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,570

I hope our joint investigation

677
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,320
can rescue the hostages as soon as possible.

678
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,350
Yes.

[Stay Loyal to the Party, Serve the People, Be Impartial in Law Enforcement, and Be Well-disciplined]

682
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,120
I've been watching all night.

683
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,120
I found this car.

[Northwest corner]

685
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,500
This car has fake plates.

686
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,560
I can't trace the owner,

687
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,400
and it was

688
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,360
around the time Lian Xiangqin disappeared

689
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,440
that it entered Beichi Park.

690
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,440
I suspect Han Pei used this car

691
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,270
[Northwest corner]

692
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,310
to take Lian Xiangqin away.

693
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,940
He's probably holding her somewhere.

694
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:57,610
[Stay Loyal to the Party, Serve the People, Be Impartial in Law Enforcement, and Be Well-disciplined]

695
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,030
What have you found out on your end?

696
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,450
I've roughly deduced

697
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,030
his method for trying to kill

698
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,390
Lian Xiangqin.

699
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,370
What do you mean?

700
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,230
The reason he bought dry ice

701
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,530
is because if a large amount of dry ice

702
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,160
is stored in a place

703
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,490
with poor ventilation,

704
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,030
it can cause people to

705
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,360
inhale too much carbon dioxide

706
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,120
and die from suffocation.

707
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,310
But our people who were tailing him

708
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,250
were discovered.

709
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,120
He had to abort this plan.

710
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,660
So now it's very troublesome.

711
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,050
Now that he's on alert,

712
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,110
he's unlikely to return to

713
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,550
where he's holding Lian Xiangqin.

Because even if he doesn't go back,

716
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,360
the hostage will eventually

You're so busy right after coming back.

760
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,850
I'll call my classmate

761
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,350
to ask for leave on my behalf.

762
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,130
Come, have a cup of coffee.

763
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,020
Why are you here?

764
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,120
You're asking me?

765
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,480
If Auntie hadn't told me

766
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,150
that you were back,

767
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,250
I wouldn't have known.

768
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,400
My mom, really.

769
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,720
She's the one who urged me to come back.

770
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,510
She doesn't come to pick me up herself,

771
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,760
and she made you come to pick me up instead.

772
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,260
Shouldn't I have come?

773
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,350
You don't need to be so formal with me.

774
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,110
Thank you, Senior.

775
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,560

778

We must ensure

779
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,910
her safety and that of the hostages.

doing so well,

788
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,790
why did you suddenly come back?

789
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,980
There's something going on with my mom.

790
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,200

If there's any problem,

793
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,170
just let me know.

794
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,070
Don't be polite with me.

795
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,810
Don't worry, I won't be polite.

796
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,680
It's almost noon now.

797
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,110
Why don't we

798
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,280
have lunch together?

799
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,230
Sure, Senior.

800
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,390
Let me treat you.

801
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,400
No need for you to treat me.

802
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,590
I've found a

803
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,830
really great restaurant.

804
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,860
I'll take you there.

805

Please let me treat you today.

Don't be so polite with me.

809

Get in the car.

810
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,630
Next time, I'll let you treat me.

How is it?

824
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,700
Did you book the entire place?

It's so empty, not a single person here.

826
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,290
Excuse me,

827
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,220
do you have any window seats?

828
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,450
I'd like to sit by the window.

829
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,510
No need, it's fine.

830
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,480
Let's just sit here.

831
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,060

We wanted to follow them in,

852

but the waiter said it's been booked for a private event.

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,030
They won't let us in.

854
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,400
Give me the address. I'll be there right away.

00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:47,980
Oh, right.

It's nothing major.

865
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,140
It's just some issues in the welfare house, that's all.

866
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
It was indeed difficult

867
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,000
to explain between me and my mom over the phone.

868
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,050
It was too troublesome.

869
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,880
I thought I might as well fly back.

870
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,250
just to solve it for her directly.

871
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,870
You're really something.

872
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,650
Coming from so far away.

873
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,030
You could have just called me.

874
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,850
just let me know.

875
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,440
I would have found a way to help.

876
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,010
To be honest,

877
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,410
actually,

878
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,860

But once I left,

881
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,910
I really did miss them a bit.

882
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,890
It's a good chance

883
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,800
to come back and see them.

884
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,340
Were you being bullied?

885
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,070
You mentioned on the phone before

886
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,800
that your roommate was very troublesome.

887
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,110
Hard to get along with.

888
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,510

889
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,660
Not really.

890
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,840
Of course.

891
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,930
living with someone is certainly not as good as

892

the fact that she's letting me stay with her

895
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,730
is actually quite nice.

896
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,300
Plus, she's been very kind to me

897
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,300
and takes good care of me.

898
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,040
That's good then.

899
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,920
You are

900
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,400
too nice.

901
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,180
I'm really worried you might be taken advantage of.

902
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,510
It's not that bad.

903
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,510

pretend to be a delivery guy

907
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:14,800
and give me a call.

908
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,100
Just say the following words.

909
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,550
Hello,

910
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,630
Hello, the package you sent earlier

911
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,130
was scheduled to be delivered this afternoon,

912

but we can't reach

00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,190
the recipient now.

914
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:32,710
Do you want to

915
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,950
reschedule the delivery?

916
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,310
No need to change the time.

917
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,480
You can just

918
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,010
leave the package at her doorstep.

919
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,080
Alright,

920
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,510
I'll leave it at her door then.

921
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,490
But could you please

922
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,400
contact her?

923
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,130
I'm worried it might get lost if left for too long.

924
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,890
Sure,

925
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,050
I'll send her

926
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,030
a message right away.

927
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,800
Okay, thank you.

Thank you.

929
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
This is good.

930
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,680
You can try it in a bit.

931
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,330
Okay.

932
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,530
I... I'll send a message, okay?

933
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,280
Go ahead.

has arrived.

937

It's been left at your doorstep.

938
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,090
They tried calling you but you didn't answer.

939
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,250
Please pay attention to it.

940
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,300
Is this your roommate?

941
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,500
Well, she's abroad herself.

942
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,880

943
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,110
to send things back home?

00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,320
I didn't even know

946
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,800
when she came back.

947
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,300
Then she sent a message

948
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,820
asking me to send her a package.

949
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,000
How much stuff is there

950
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,330
that needs to be mailed?

951
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,480
Can't you just bring it back for her

952
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,400
when you come?

953
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,510
The things she wants to send

954
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,820
are indeed too much.

955
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,180
I don't want to check them in.

956
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,390
They're all daily necessities,

957
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,400
like

958
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,060

cups,

960
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,250
towels,

961
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,950
slippers.

962
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,620
Moreover,

963
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,950
it seems not all of them are hers.

964
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,980
Some might belong to others.

[Fire Safety Knowledge Session of Unnatural Fire]

967
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,150
How to save yourself in fire?

968
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,360
Do you know what to do

969
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,320
in case of a fire?

970
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,760
If the fire is small

971
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,080
and there is no heavy smoke,

972
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,750
quickly cover your nose and mouth with a wet towel,

973
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,870
stay low,

974
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,160
and follow the evacuation signs

975
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,190
along the wall

976
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,840
to the nearest emergency exit.

977
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,520
However, if the fire is intense

978
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,360
and the escape route is filled with thick smoke,

979
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,750
do not attempt to flee.

980
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,550
Instead, retreat to a room,

981
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:11,640
close the door,

982
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,790
and seal any gaps with wet cloth to block smoke.

983
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,000
Pour water on the door

984
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,510
to prevent flames from entering.

985
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,320
Then,

986
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,110
signal for help by waving a flashlight

987
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,320
or bright-colored clothing near a window,

988
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,880
or by knocking on objects to attract attention.

989
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,960
Never try to

990
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,110
rush out blindly—wait for rescue.
