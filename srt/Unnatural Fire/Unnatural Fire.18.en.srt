00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,200
Has she replied?

4
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,300
I'm urging her.

5
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,479
She hasn't replied.

6
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,920
The tea has gone cold.

7
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,790
I'll ask the waiter to bring us some hot tea.

8
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,600
Sit down.

9
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,250
Urge her.

Dean Zeng.

13
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,350
I was sick some time ago.

14
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,310
Really?

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,400
What illness did you have?

16
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,470
Was it serious?

17
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,079
It was nothing serious.

18
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,079
I've recovered.

19
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,320
[What's wrong with you? You still haven't finished work?]

20
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,040
I'm just worried

21
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,210
whether my memory

22
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,370
would be affected

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,520
by any sequela.

24
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,260
If I remember correctly,

25
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,840
in the beginning,

26
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,420
you were the one who first mentioned

27
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,470
that other people's children all got married,

28
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,800
and that your Jin Chun

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,020
should also get married.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,280
But nothing has come of it.

31
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,870
Then I thought

32
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,710
my Jiang He

33
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,750
is of a suitable age too.

34
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,750
So I arranged for them

35
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,070
to meet and see how it goes.

36
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,240
Although the first meeting

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
wasn't perfect,

38
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,079
Dean Zeng, you were

39
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,360
very sincere.

40
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,680
You even took the initiative

41
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,840
to arrange this meeting

42
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,720
to clear up previous misunderstandings.

43
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,470
Jiang He

44
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,040
is not the type

45
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,120
who would hastily

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,390
judge others.

47
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,000
That's why I agreed.

48
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,890
Yes.

49
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,329
You're right.

50
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,940
Looks like

51
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,840
my memory is still sharp.

52
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,310
Dean Zeng,

53
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,550
I agreed to let them

54
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,170
get to know each other better

55
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,710
because I respect you.

56
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,350
Look at Jiang He.

57
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,200
He is handsome,

58
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,000
has a great personality,

59
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,740
and is highly educated.

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,310
You're also aware

61
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,600
of our family background.

62
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,400
Right?

63
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,600
You and I are both a mother.

64
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,010
Dean Zeng,

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,120
I'm sure you

66
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,590
understand how I feel, right?

67
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,750
Of course.

68
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,720
Jiang He is clearly a good man.

69
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,350
He looks quite handsome.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,800
Yes.

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,390
So I'm thinking,

72
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,079
someone who can teach

73
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,320
so many children well

74
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,480
wouldn't raise her own child

75
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,620
to be impolite, right?

76
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,640
Don't you think so?

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,190
I... I'd better go

78
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,110
get some hot tea.

79
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,140
Call Jin Chun.

80
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,800
Okay.

81
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,600
Is there anything

82
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,060
that we can't hear?

83
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,570
No.

84
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:40,370
Dean Zeng.

85
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,190
We are quite open-minded.

86
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,120
We've never insisted on a marriage

87
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,400
that's strictly equal in social status.

88
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,280
But with all due respect,

89
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,090
does your Jin Chun

90
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,040
have her

91
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,630
own idea about this?

92
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,870
No.

93
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,330
What idea could she possibly have?

94
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,270
Mom,

95
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,070
Jin Chun is a forensic doctor.

96
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,040
It's understandable.

97
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,350
Her job

98
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,900
is busy and tiring.

99
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,190
She definitely is not doing this on purpose.

100
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,240
Shut your mouth.

101
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,870
Nothing has even happened,

102
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,360
yet you're already taking her side.

103
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,190
Sorry.

104
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,390
The phone you dialed

105
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,640
is not answered for the moment.

106
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,390
Please try again later.

107
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,850
What's going on?

108
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,060
No one's answering.

109
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,260
Maybe she's busy.

110
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,560
Looks like we can't have a meal

111
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,530
together today.

112
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:46,110
Don't say that.

113
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,250
Let's eat first.

114
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,850
Go ask the waiter to bring the hot dishes.

115
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,720
Yes. Okay.

116
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,500
Forget it.

117
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,820
I'm full from drinking tea.

118
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,210
You guys eat.

119
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,490
My stomach doesn't feel well.

120
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,380
That wouldn't be appropriate.

121
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,750
Mom.

122
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,560
Let's wait a bit longer.

123
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,590
Once Jin Chun finishes her work,

124
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,960
she'll definitely come.

125
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,360
Look,

126
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,960

Sorry.

130
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,880
You go ahead and eat.

131
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,890
I'll go foot the bill.

132
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,320
No need, really!

133
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,000
We'll pay.

138
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,250

I can't come.

142
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,250
Well... she...

143
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,370
I'm going to find her and settle this!

Why don't we stay?

146

Forget it.

147
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,240

Go back and rest.

156

It's fine. I'm not eating.

Okay.

I have a ton of things to handle at the welfare house,

195
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,670
but I still put them aside

196
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,100
to accompany her to meet Jiang He's mother yesterday.

197
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,100
But look at her.

198
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,390
She just decided not to show up.

199
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,770
It's a good thing she didn't go.

200
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,990
Think about it.

201
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,420
You saw how Jiang He's mother behaved yesterday.

202
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,330
Can you rest assured

203
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,550
if she marries into their family?

204
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,780
That's a different matter.

205
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,080
Jin Chun agreed to the meeting but didn't show up.

206
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,150
That's on us.

207
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,700
Indeed, his mother had a bad attitude,

208
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,410
but she's one of the important donors

209
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,870
of the welfare house.

210
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,790
No matter what,

211
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,790
I had to maintain basic courtesy.

212
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,910
I couldn't just fall out with her, right?

213
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,450
Dad.

214
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,260
You're back.

215
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,390
Why are you here?

216
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,240
You don't know why

217
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,170
we're here?

218
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,720
If you're here to talk about

219
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,740
the blind date,

220
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,960
can you please go back?

221
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,230
Dad, I'm really tired today.

222
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,840
Chun,

223
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,030
we just came to check on you.

224
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,600
We'll go in and sit for a while.

225
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,020
We'll leave soon.

226
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,010
Sit for a while?

227
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,770
Why didn't you show up yesterday?

228
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,900
Give us an explanation.

229
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,790
I'm talking to you!

230
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,190
Let me get changed first.

231
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,670
Did you see that?

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,850
No wonder she said she's impolite.

233
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,990
She even treats her own parents like this.

234
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,980
She's been working all day.

235
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,840
She's tired.

236
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,580
Who isn't tired?

237
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,350
Come here.

238
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,540
No.

239
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,760
I'll just stand here and wait.

240
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,790
Take my bag away.

241
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,680
You haven't answered me yet.

242
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,280
You know

243
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,390
my job.

244
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,330
There indeed was an urgent task in the division.

245
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,340
I couldn't leave.

246
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,950
I already sent Dad a message.

247
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,980
Yes.

248
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,450
She did.

249
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,670
It was a special situation.

250
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,100
Alright then.

251
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,440
I'll give you the phone number

252
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,120
of Jiang He's mother.

253
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,450
Call Jiang He's mother right now

254
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,650
and explain everything clearly.

255
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,750
Why should I explain?

256
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,070
I'm not gonna explain.

257
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,770
Why won't you explain?

258
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,270
You just didn't show up,

259
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,580
leaving your dad and me there.

260
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,840
Do you know how terrible

261
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,870
her attitude was?

262
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,480
We couldn't leave, and it was like

263
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,040
sitting on pins and needles.

264
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,240
You embarrassed us

265
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,350
completely.

266
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,200
Their family

267
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,880
has issues to begin with.

268
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,600
You saw that for yourself this time,

269
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,360
right?

270
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,550
I didn't like them

271
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,880
when I met them last time.

272
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,130
But you didn't tell me that.

273
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,880
Chun told me.

274
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,350
You saw it too yesterday.

275
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,960
They indeed have issues.

276
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,420
She told you,

277
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,810
but you didn't tell me either.

278
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,400
You two always keep

279
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,200
secrets from me.

280
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,260
How was I supposed to know?

281
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,330
If I had known,

282
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,690
I wouldn't have arranged the meeting yesterday,

283
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,420
and I wouldn't have put myself through that.

284
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,690
Don't blame my dad!

285
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,550
You shouldn't

286
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,720
have meddled in this matter.

287
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,840
From now on, stay out

288
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,750
of my business.

289
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,040
Jin Chun!

290
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,540
Did you really mean that?

291
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,740
From now on,

292
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,950
I won't interfere in anything!

293
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,700
But today, you have to

294
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,970
call her.

295
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,240
Apologize to her.

296
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,310
I'm not going to apologize!

297
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,970
You have to apologize.

298
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,550
Now, this is not just

299
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,700
about you.

300
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,850
Yesterday, she said

301
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,220
if I can't teach you well,

302
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,000
I can't teach

303
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,270
the children in the welfare house well.

304
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,260
This is about

305
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,810
the image and reputation of the welfare house!

306
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,910
You have to apologize.

307
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,720
Mom,

308
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,420
can you not step on my carpet

309
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,740
with your shoes?

310
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,170
I'm talking to you about apologizing.

311
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,470
Don't change the topic.

312
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,430
I'm not going to apologize.

313
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,620
Apologize!

314
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,990
Alright, alright.

315
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,920
Here.

316
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,930
Have... Have some fruits.

317
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,100
Cool off a bit.

318
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,080
We're family. Don't be like this.

319
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,670
You won't apologize, right?

320
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,750
Then I won't leave today.

321
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,860
If you won't leave, I'll leave!

322
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,070
Chun! Chun...

323
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,340
Ignore her.

324
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,990
This is her house.

325
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,070
I don't believe she won't come back.

326
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,270
I'll just sit here and wait for her.

327
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,630
Didn't we reach an agreement?

328
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,740
[Total: Lightning strikes on receptor lightning rod: 40,235 times; Lightning strikes on receptor electrical panel: 0 times]

329
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,210
[Jin Chun]

330
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,950
[Total: Lightning strikes on receptor lightning rod: 40,502 times; Lightning strikes on receptor electrical panel: 0 times]

331
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,050
Well, Adviser Xu.

332
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,020
Why don't you take a rest?

333
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,470
Let's go grab something to eat or something.

334
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,360
It's alright.

335
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,200
You go back first.

336
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,540
Then I'm leaving.

337
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,670
You should also go home and rest early,

338
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,120
Adviser Xu.

339
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,260
[Refuse] [Answer]

340
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,260
[Jin Chun]

341
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,220
Hello, Chun.

342
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,460
Tongsheng, what are you busy with?

343
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,770
I sent you messages, but you didn't reply.

344
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,330
Sorry.

345
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,870
I've been doing experiments.

346
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,930
Am I disturbing you?

347
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,590
No.

348
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,660
I'm almost done.

349
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,750
Then come to

350
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,170
the Central Mall at 8 p.m.

351
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,500
Let's have dinner together.

352
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,320
Did...

353
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,960
something happen?

354
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,760
Today...

355
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,600
I ran into some things.

356
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,500
I'm very upset.

357
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,120
I want to talk to you.

358
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,430
Sure, no problem.

359
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,930
[Jin Chun]

360
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,880
Hello, Senior.

361
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,190
Chun.

362
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,450
Where are you now?

363
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,350
I'm sorry, I forgot

364
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,860
I should practice boxing with you today.

365
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,380
It's okay.

366
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,130
You can still make it if you come now.

367
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,070
I can wait for you.

368
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,420
I'm sorry, Senior.

369
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,400
I've made other plans today.

370
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,750
I'll practice boxing with you another day.

371
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,400
Okay?

372
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,579
Okay, no problem.

373
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,550
Let's do it another day.

374
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,550
You go ahead with your plans.

375
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,640
Okay.

376
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,030
Come on, again.

377
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:28,640
Come on.

378
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,000
It's raining so heavily.

379
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,940
Adviser Xu.

380
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,440
I have no idea

381
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,270
how it suddenly started

Yes.

417
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,820

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,890
when I'm discharged, I'll...

572
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,410
I'll pack all these things

573
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,870
and put them all in my bag.

574
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,360
I'll carry the lunchbox and take

575
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
the tissues with me too.

576
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:10,700
Well...

577
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,200
I can manage. Don't worry.

578
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,620
If I can't...

579
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,080
Ma, you...

580
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,350
you'll also be discharged tomorrow, right?

581
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:16,930
Yes.

582
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,100
Let's leave together.

583
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,900
Okay.

584
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,200
Let him handle important things.

585
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,960
As for these trivial things,

586
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,940
we'll take care of them ourselves.

587
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,380
Yeah. We'll handle them ourselves.

588
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,400
It's fine.

589
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,770
My son will visit me tomorrow.

590
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,540
I'll have him drive

591
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,620
both of you home,

592
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,790
one by one.

593
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,660
Alright, Uncle.

594
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,110
Well... no need for that.

595
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,680
Don't get excited.

596
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,660
Or your blood pressure might act up again.

597
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,920
Well...

598
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:36,960
I...

599
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,100
I'm not going tomorrow night.

600
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,080
I... I'll stay and help you get discharged.

601
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,130
No need.

602
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,960
Eat the banana.

603
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,850
N-No need.

604
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,440
I'm going to call the division.

605
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:54,510
[Observing Room]

606
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,620
Don't.

607
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,200
It's okay, it's okay.

608
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,840
Don't worry about it.

609
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,190
Don't let it affect your work!

610
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,070
It won't!

611
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,670
Move. Move.

612
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,490
Danggui!

613
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,240
Where's your Captain Shen?

614
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,880
Adviser Xu!

615
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,510
What?

616
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,260
Where's Captain Shen?

617
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,000
Adviser Xu!

618
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,550
Who?

619
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,290
I finally found you.

620
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,640
Let's go.

621
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,470
Adviser Xu!

622
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,350
Hasn't the truth already

623
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,330
come to light?

624
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,520
Why are you making such a big fuss

625
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,220
about this?

626
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,100
When will

627
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,920
the Fire Investigation Department

628
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,590
close this case?

629
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,370
Adviser Xu,

630
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,310
haven't I already

631
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,350
proved it to you?

632
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,880
It was just an accident.

633
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,000
It was also an extremely rare

634
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,680
natural phenomenon.

635
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,650
Humans can't defy fate.

636
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,490
Are you done talking?

637
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,230
Adviser Xu,

638
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,300
are you sure about this?

639
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,550
You're making such a big fuss.

640
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,640
If this leads to nothing,

641
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,400
I'll report it

642
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,400
to your superiors.

643
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm busy.

644
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,690
Well, here's my advice.

645
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,060
Just close the case as a natural disaster.

646
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,150
It's good for everyone.

647
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,120
What exactly is he trying to do?

648
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,720
Since we can't stop him,

649
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,400
we'll just have to deal with whatever comes our way.

650
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,670
Wu,

651
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,040
be honest with me.

652
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,920
Do you have

653
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,370
any confidence in solving this?

654
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,220
Remove your hand.

655
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,720
I told him it was a natural disaster.

656
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,810
That's not wrong.

657
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,920
Logically speaking,

658
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,640
he should be out of options.

659
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,470
Let's go.

660
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,900
Adviser Xu!

661
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,570
What are we waiting for?

662
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,530
Why haven't you started yet?

663
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,440
Yeah, what are we waiting for?

664
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,110
Why isn't there any thunder yet?

665
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,120
Is the weather forecast wrong again?

666
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,540
Don't you trust your idol?

667
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,090
No matter how great my idol is,

668
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,760
he's not the God of Thunder or Lightning.

669
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,080
What are you doing here?

670
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,000
What's going on?

671
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,030
Quiet!

672
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,320
Quiet!

673
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,020
Stand properly!

674
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,350
Adviser Xu!

675
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,130
How much longer do we have to wait?

676
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,570
Give us a clear answer!

677
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,730
We can't just keep waiting like this.

678
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,920
If we wait any longer, it'll be dawn!

679
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,290
Yes, Adviser Xu!

680
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,480
Not everyone has time

681
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,550
to spend

682
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,030
on experiments like you!

683
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,940
We all have families

684
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,690
to support!

685
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,240
Adviser Xu!

686
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,740
You still won't close the case!

687
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,830
This has seriously affected

688
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,740
our factory workers' livelihoods!

689
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,720
Now we have to

690
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,630
find temporary jobs just to get by!

691
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,500
You need to resolve this!

692
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,370
Crazy.

693
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,090
This is so crazy.

694
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,130
What do you mean?

695
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,440
I'm asking you!

696
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,330
Wu Yu,

697
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,420
where are you going?

698
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,880
I don't have time

699
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,810
to waste here with you.

700
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,740
I have a high-speed train to catch.

701
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,720
A high-speed train to catch?

702
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,210
To prevent interference with the experiment,

703
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,080
no one is allowed to enter

704
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,150
or leave the factory freely.

705
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,490
You have to wait

706
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,250
until this

707
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,960
is over.

708
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,910
Hey, it's thundering!

709
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,720
But nothing's happening, right?

710
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,540
What exactly is he trying to do?

711
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,090
Adviser Xu!

712
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,090
Look!

713
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,640
It's been so long!

714
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,360
And still,

715
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,700
nothing has happened, right?

716
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,230
What exactly are you trying

717
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,310
to prove to us?

718
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,470
What do you want to show us?

719
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,920
You can't just leave us

720
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,840
standing here in confusion

721
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,170
and waiting for nothing!

722
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,120
I don't care what trick you're playing!

723
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
This experiment

724
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,790
can't prove anything!

725
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,570
Adviser Xu,

726
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,830
if we increase the load any further,

727
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,090
this machine might not

728
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,240
hold up much longer.

729
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,650
How much longer can it hold up?

730
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,060
A few minutes at most.

731
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,840
Judging by the lightning frequency,

732
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,560
we can only wait for at most one more thunderbolt.

733
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,200
If so,

734
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,920
we only have one chance left.

735
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,190
Wow, what's happening?

736
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,440
What's going on? What happened?

737
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,110
-It got struck!
-It got struck!

738
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:41,770
Idol,

739
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,199
you're truly a legend!

740
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,710
You're so knowledgeable!

741
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,139
Did you see that?

742
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,400
What have you got

743
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,469
to show me?

744
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,420
My idol

745
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,170
can command wind and rain, and summon lightning and thunder.

746
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,650
You troublemakers, you think

747
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,530
you can escape?

748
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,230
Cat got your tongue, huh?

749
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:57,950
Look at it!

750
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,710
Why aren't you saying anything now?

751
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,070
Speak!

752
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,180
You all...

753
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,870
Alright.

754
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:17,840
Adviser Xu,

755
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,370
what exactly happened here?

756
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,670
Explain to us.

757
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,280
Yes.

758
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,690
The experiment I conducted today

759
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,570
was to prove to everyone

760
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:27,690
that the fire was not

761
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,860
a natural disaster.

It was man-made.

already proved to us

765
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,680
the fire was caused

766
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,180
by lightning striking the electrical panel,

767
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,840
leading to a short circuit,

768
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,480
which then sparked flames.

769
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,790
I acknowledge this fact.

770
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,410
But I don't believe

771
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,610
lightning would ignore

772
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,960
the nearby lightning rod without a reason

773
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,410
and strike such a small electrical panel instead.

774
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,210
The path of lightning

775
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,890
is influenced by various factors,

776
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,730
including

777
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,110
terrain and environment.

778
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,850
That's why we conducted an experiment

779
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,600
on-site today.

780
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:56,940
Just now, we used

781
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,550
the high-power generator outside

782
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,780
to create an extremely strong

783
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,200
magnetic field in this area,

784
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,830
reducing the environmental resistance

785
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,010
and thereby

786
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,360
altering the path of the lightning.

787
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,720
This proves

788
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,800
where lightning strikes

789
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,280
is affected by various special factors.

790
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,190
On the night of the restaurant fire,

791
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,320
lightning didn't hit

792
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,280
the nearby lightning rod.

793
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,830
Instead, it struck the electrical panel

794
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,260
because the factory

795
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,230

796
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,800

Well, what else do you want?

809
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,630
I've discovered that while your factory's

average power consumption appears normal,

811
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,780
