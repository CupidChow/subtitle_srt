[Unnatural Fire]

00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,780
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,680
I knew you'd be here.

4
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,920
Mom.

5
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,950
Tianyou keeps asking for you at home.

6
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,280
He wants his grandma.

7
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,150
But you...

8
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,650
You're even drinking, Mom?

9
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,370
Don't you know your health condition?

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,630
How could you drink alcohol?

11
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,320
Chengcai,

12
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,070
don't talk to your mother like that.

13
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,910
How I talk to my mother

14
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,190
is our family matter.

15
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,280
You're an outsider.

16
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,080
What right do you have

17
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,120
to meddle in our affairs?

18
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,680
Mom,

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,079
don't tell me you'd rather

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,000
choose this old man

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,590
over your own grandson.

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,190
I wouldn't do that.

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,370
How... How could I possibly

24
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,240
abandon you?

25
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,790
Then go home with me now.

26
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,800
Well,

27
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,430
Tianyou is waiting for you at home.

28
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,620
But look at you.

29
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,120
You have food,

30
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,579
alcohol, and even a cake.

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,530
Chengcai,

32
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,630
don't we even have the right

33
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,400
to eat a cake?

34
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,240
Shut up.

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
I don't want to hear you talk right now.

36
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,430
Alright, alright.

37
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,710
Alright, alright.

38
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,800
Alright.

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Mom,

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,630
why are you still defending him?

41
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,240
He's not in good health.

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,310
Talk properly. No more arguing.

43
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,840
Okay?

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,190
He's not in good health?

45
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,470
So you don't care about

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,630
Tianyou's health anymore, do you?

47
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,030
How about this, Mom?

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,960
Give me a clear answer today.

49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,310
Do you choose this old man

50
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,360
or your grandson?

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,080
Chengcai,

52
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,680
I'm begging you.

53
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,520
Don't make it hard for your mother.

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,650
I'm making it hard for her?

55
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,870
Did I ask her to drink?

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,080
Who asked her to drink?

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,630
Son.

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,810
Son. Son.

59
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,030
It's late.

60
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,560
Mom, I didn't...

61
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:18,470
I didn't mean that.

62
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,470
You still need to work tomorrow.

63
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,050
Mom.

64
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,520
You go back first.

65
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,590
Why do you want to stay here?

66
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,310
Well, go back!

67
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,480
You have to go back with me today.

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,530
You can't stay here!

69
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,280
I can't go back!

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,710
No!

71
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,680
You have to go back with me today!

72
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,030
I really... I can't go back!

73
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:40,930
Mom,

74
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,560
I'm going to ask you one last time.

75
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,680
Are you going back with me or not?

76
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,079
I'm not going back with you.

77
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,560
Fine.

78
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
Fine, Mom.

79
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,110
Then you stay here with him.

80
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,010
Take care of him every day.

81
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,090
Just take care of him!

82
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,560
Be his nurse

83
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,380
and change his diapers!

84
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,700
Give him all your pension too!

85
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,950
From today on,

86
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,310
Tianyou and I

87
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,900
will have nothing to do with you.

88
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,680
You'll be a member of the Ying family,

89
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,190
alive or dead!

90
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,159
Okay?

91
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,950
Ying Youchang,

92
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,490
you're really something!

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,000
You asked my mom to take care of you here,

94
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,190
you old man!

95
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,510
You've lived this long

96
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,600
and wasted it all!

97
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,360
At that time, you didn't expect

98
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,560
that it would be the last time

99
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,390
you saw your mother.

100
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,260
And it was

101
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,630
anything but pleasant.

102
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,390
What does any of that

103
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,360
have to do

104
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,950
with the cause of my mother's death?

105
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,120
Based on the traces at the scene,

106
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,720
after you left...

107
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
Yulan,

108
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,590
is this worth it?

109
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,450
Do it.

110
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,450
I can't do it.

111
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,970
You're a coward.

112
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,600
Yes.

113
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,190
I am a coward.

114
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,600
I really can't do it.

115
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,530
Don't make me look down on you

116
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,120
in my final moments.

117
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,670
Then look down on me all you want.

118
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,390
You've changed your mind?

119
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,590
You promised me before.

120
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,940
You promised me before!

121
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,310
Yulan,

122
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,490
please don't force me, okay?

123
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,360
How can I do

124
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,950
such a cruel thing?

125
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,830
I can't do it.

126
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,190
I really can't do it!

127
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,970
I can't do it.

128
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,460
Ying Youchang!

129
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,340
After all these years,

130
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,750
why are you still like this?

131
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,390
At crucial moments,

132
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,000
you can't make the right decision!

133
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,820
Ying,

134
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,990
this is for my own good.

135
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,159
For my own good.

136
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,510
I... I'm sorry.

137
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,720
You've suffered.

138
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,750
Yulan.

139
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,340
Yulan!

140
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,750
Yulan.

141
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,370
Yulan.

142
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,250
I'm the one who's sorry.

143
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,180
Yulan,

144
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,070
I know you always felt

145
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,300
guilty towards Chengcai.

146
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,860
You thought he's pitiful.

147
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,550
In the end, you sacrificed yourself

148
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,320
without hesitating.

149
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,220
I regret it.

150
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,060
If I could do something,

151
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,300
it wouldn't have

152
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,950
ended up this way.

153
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,510
Now that you're gone,

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,080
all I can do

155
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,460
is to die with you.

156
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,120
If there's a next life,

157
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,440
I wish I could meet you earlier.

158
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,670
And I'd take good care of you.

159
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,840
That is why your mother,

160
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,480
who was always frugal

161
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
and strict about sugar intake,

162
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,380
suddenly indulged in

163
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,790
cake and wine that night.

164
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,790
That is also why

165
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,130
a couple who loved each other so deeply

166
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,270
ended up dying at each other's hands.

167
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,320
The knife went all the way in.

168
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,270
Zhang Yulan wanted Ying Youchang

169
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,360
to kill her,

170
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,030
so that her insurance payout

171
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,030
could go to you.

172
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,950
And as a disabled person,

173
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,490
Ying Youchang could

174
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,760
be taken care of in prison.

175
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,550
But he chose a different way.

176
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,530
The knife embedded

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,150
in her body was not proof

178
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,080
of their hatred.

179
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,600
On the contrary,

180
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,780
it was proof of their love.

181
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,790
Impossible.

182
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,040
I'm telling you, it's impossible!

183
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,310
My mom would never commit suicide!

184
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,750
This is all your imagination,

185
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,190
understand?

186
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,360
Take a look.

187
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,320
The antemortem injuries

188
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,260
on Ying Youchang's body

189
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,670
reflect his last words.

190
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,850
This bruise

191
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,280
was caused by a blunt impact.

192
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,970
The impact surface matches an object

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,120
with an oval shape,

380
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,830
I was just kidding.

381
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,310
As long as you're always with me,

382
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,710
♫Regret burns like a fire within♫

383
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,510
I'll be very happy.

384
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,820
♫Rivers of sorrow flow deep♫

385
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,550
♫Are you sleeping?♫

386
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,960
♫Forget all the love and hate♫

387
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,400
♫Are you sleeping?♫

388
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,920
♫Brother John♫

389
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,920
♫Brother John♫

390
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,030
Are you hungry? What do you want for dinner?

391
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,540
♫But I remember♫

392
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,790
I want to eat...

393
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,410
Steamed Pork Ribs with Black Bean Sauce.

394
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,350
Okay, I'll cook for you.

395
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,690
When I got home and saw the raging fire,

396
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,830
I should have realized it immediately.

397
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,350
But I kept making mistakes.

398
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,240
Hao Chengcai,

399
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,750
did you suddenly grow a conscience?

400
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,640
Do you know

401
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,590
Zhao even went to...

402
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,550
Enough. Wait a minute.

403
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,890
Tianyou, come.

404
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,160
Sit here for a while.

405
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,650
I need to talk to your mom.

406
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,420
I'll be right back.

407
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,960
Don't talk about it in front of our son.

408
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,940
Let's go over there.

409
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,240
[Police]

410
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,200
What was that about just now?

411
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,480
Mom left that money,

412
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,770
and you just refused it like that.

413
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,920
Have you even thought

414
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,820
about our family's situation?

415
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,510
How am I supposed

416
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,590
to continue to live like this?

417
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,480
I can't live like this anymore, either.

418
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,790
What?

419
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,270
What do you mean?

420
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,310
Nothing.

421
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,440
I want to

422
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,330
sell...

423
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,550
our house and car.

424
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,850
Whatever we can get for them.

425
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,960
We'll pay back what we owe Zhao first.

426
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,760
I will

427
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,210
figure out the rest.

428
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,380
Anyway,

429
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,030
I can't live

430
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,540
another day like before.

431
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,540
Now you've realized it's unbearable?

432
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,200
Where were you earlier?

433
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,030
You think

434
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,540
I chose this life alone?

435
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,270
Now

436
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,750
I'm the bad guy, is that it?

437
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,720
No.

438
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,030
That's... That's not what I meant,

439
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:07,620
Yingying.

440
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,440
Anyway,

441
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,960
I've made up my mind.

442
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,030
From now on,

443
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,880
you can choose

444
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,590
whatever life you want.

445
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,920
Fine.

446
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,720
Let's get a divorce.

447
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,640
Tianyou, let's go home!

448
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,590
Mom!

449
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,160
Dad,

450
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,510
what's wrong with Mom?

451
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,160
Come on!

452
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,750
[Police]

453
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,070
It's okay.

454
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,420
Let's go home.

455
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,070
Mom,

456
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,490
I never realized how wrong I had been

457
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,760
all these years

458
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,670
until

459
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,550
you're gone.

460
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,240
If I hadn't kept demanding

461
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,560
or chased after vanity,

462
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:34,080
[Police]

463
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,410
we could have had a happy life.

464
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,680
Mom,

465
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,200
please rest assured.

466
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,780
I will give you and Uncle Ying a proper funeral.

467
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,830
I'll raise Tianyou well.

468
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,590
I won't chase after empty things anymore.

469
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,210
Mom,

470
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,420
I was wrong.

471
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,350
I

472
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,680
miss you.

473
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,620
This case has finally been solved.

474
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,000
Let's have a meal together

475
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,680
to unwind, okay?

476
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,320
I'm not going.

477
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,920
You guys go.

478
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,550
I want to get some sleep.

479
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,040
Come on, join us.

480
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,250
I'm really not going.

481
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,440
Enjoy your meal.

482
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,070
See you tomorrow.

483
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,070
Take a good rest.

484
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,750
Be careful.

485
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,110
I didn't plan anything fancy.

486
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,590
How about going to my place?

487
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,690
Come on.

488
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,760
I'll show you what I've got.

489
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,720
[Wang Peng grew up in a single-parent family. His mother was a hardworking waitress.]

490
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,750
Zhang Yulan,

491
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,110
female,

492
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,300
retired.

493
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,520
She was like a candle,

494
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,160
burning herself out

495
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,880
to give light to others.

496
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,440
If, as the myths say,

497
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,310
people really have a next life,

498
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,480
I hope

499
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,350
she could live for herself,

500
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,960
do what she wants to do,

501
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,200
and go where she wants to go.

502
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,310
I hope she could no longer place

503
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,590
all the value of her life on others.

504
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,200
When Hao Chengcai

505
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,580
saw the little tiger on Hao Tianyou's coat,

506
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,270
and when he finally

507
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,530
took out the suicide note in the end,

508
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,510
I believe

509
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,920
he understood Zhang Yulan's sacrifices for him.

510
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,170
He should also realize

511
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,260
what the so-called exquisite life he pursued

512
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,910
has brought to his family, which should

513
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,810
have been a happy one.

514
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,560
I hope their family of three

515
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,850
can understand

516
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,810
how they should live from now on.

517
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,180
I hope Tianyou

518
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,350
can grow up healthily

519
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,680
in a complete

520
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,510
and happy family.

521
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,200
Yingying,

522
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,440
come home.

523
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,260
I'll go with you tomorrow

524
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,080
to visit Mom and Uncle Ying.

525
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,910
Please come in.

526
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:22,980
An old house?

527
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,590
My dad and I have lived here

528
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,290
since I was little.

529
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,020
He's quite nostalgic.

530
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,960
I bought him a new house,

531
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,940
but he wouldn't live there.

532
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,400
He said he feels more comfortable here.

533
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,140
Come on, come in and take a look.

534
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,000
Take a look.

535
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,790
How is it?

536
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,220
Not bad, right?

537
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,610
Feel free to look around.

538
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
I'll go prepare some food for you.

539
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,200
Okay.

540
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,480
Do you need my help?

541
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,430
No.

542
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,200
Listen, my dad put all the tasty food

543
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
in the fridge.

544
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,650
I'll just heat it up for you.

545
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,590
Ye,

546
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,010
how many times have I told you?

547
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:17,960
You should always

548
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,990
remember to close the security door.

549
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,830
Otherwise...

550
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,720
Dad,

551
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,550
you're back.

552
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,020
Don't you need to give a lesson tonight?

553
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,290
It's been rescheduled.

554
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,290
This is...

555
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:34,970
Come on.

556
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,580
Let me introduce you to each other.

557
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,130
Didn't I tell you

558
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,770
I have a new colleague?

559
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,870
He's from the Fire Investigation Department.

560
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,870
Adviser Xu. Xu Tongsheng.

561
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,920
This is my dad, a teacher.

562
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,830
He teaches chemistry.

563
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,970
Maybe you two

564
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,250
can chat about your specialties.

565
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,160
Come on.

566
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,880
Xu?

567
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,270
Ye often talked to me about you.

568
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,240
You're handsome.

569
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,600
Sir, hello.

570
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,190
Don't call me Sir.

571
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,200
I just teach a bunch of kids.

572
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,720
Call him Uncle.

573
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,750
Uncle Shen.

574
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,000
Uncle.

575
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,870
We haven't eaten yet. We're hungry.

576
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,680
You should have told me earlier

577
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,960
you'd bring a friend home,

578
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,160
so that I could buy something tasty.

579
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,680
No need to buy anything.

580
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,830
We still have some in the fridge, right?

581
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,230
Go.

582
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,520
Go cook more dishes for us. Go.

583
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,400
I can't believe you.

584
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:18,880
Go.

585
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,800
Xu, is there anything you don't eat?

586
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,970
No, anything is fine.

587
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,670
Then I'll cook as I see fit.

588
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,030
Hurry up.

589
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,400
Okay.

590
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,030
I'll go with you.

591
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,090
Oh, come on.

592
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,320
Stay out of the kitchen.

593
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,870
Go entertain your friend.

594
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:32,960
Have you looked around?

595
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,210
This is my room.

596
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,720
See?

597
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,370
I already looked at it.

598
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,340
It's a bit messy.

599
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,440
Come here. Come here.

600
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,510
I drew these paintings. Here.

601
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,830
There are all kinds of styles.

602
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,200
This one is realistic.

603
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,120
There's a terrace upstairs.

604
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,620
My dad grows a lot of flowers there.

605
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,760
They are upstairs.

606
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,440
This was drawn when my dad

607
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,490
took me out for sketching.

608
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,270
Listen,

609
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,750
a lot of paintings didn't get hung up.

610
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,350
A bunch of my paintings have won awards.

611
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,480
You drew all these paintings

612
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,720
when you were little?

613
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,160
Of course.

614
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,000
What, you don't believe me?

615
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,750
Wait a moment.

616
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,060
Xu,

617
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,610
there's not much left in the fridge.

618
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,920
We'll eat whatever we have.

619
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:28,960
Anything is fine.

620
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,880
Here, Xu.

621
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,310
Take a look.

622
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,510
Have a look.

623
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,440
See?

624
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,280
Miracle moments of little artists.

625
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,340
Painting a beautiful future.

626
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,350
Shen Ye's award is the recognition

627
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,780
of young artists from Beixun City.

628
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,960
Man, when I was little,

629
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,140
I was already a young artist.

630
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,590
See? This painting. That one.

631
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,270
See?

632
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,030
Alright, stop boasting, Ye.

633
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,550
Come here.

634
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
Help me put on the apron.

635
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,180
Enjoy the paintings.

636
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,140
[The dream of art, painting the voice of the heart]

637
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,860
I wasn't boasting.

638
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,680
W-Why didn't you tell him what happened

639
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,150
when you got the fifth place?

640
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,920
[Drawing for hope and a beautiful world together]

641
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,100
You cried so hard, and your eyes were like peaches.

642
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,260
[With a deep passion for painting from an early age, he has displayed a remarkable creative talent far beyond his years.]

643
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,260
[Shen Ye, only seven years old, is a rising artistic star in Beixun City.]

644
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,400
Xu, listen.

645
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
Once, Ye

646
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,880
got the fifth place.

647
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,310
He rolled on the ground after he came back.

648
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,720
I got many first prizes.

649
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,910
Xu.

650
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,930
I only made a few home-style dishes.

651
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,480
I don't know

652
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,350
if they suit your taste.

653
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,440
It's already a feast.

654
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,720
Dad, can we eat now? I'm hungry.

655
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,250
Go ahead, eat.

656
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,000
Come on, let's eat.

657
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:30,590
Xu, try some.

658
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,440
Serve him some food.

659
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,270
Here.

660
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,960
Wait, why are you eating...

661
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,240
eating rice again?

662
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,020
And there's so much of it.

663
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,750
Have you forgotten about your blood sugar?

664
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,160
Indeed,

665
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,830
it's been high again lately.

666
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,030
At times like this,

667
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,820
it... it makes me want to eat staple food more.

668
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,490
How does it taste? Not bad, right?

669
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,610
Not bad.

670
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,040
My mouth...

671
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,320
What's wrong?

672
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,680
It's ulcerated.

673
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,110
You haven't been drinking enough water, have you?

674
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,830
I talked a lot

675
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,430
at work recently.

676
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,680
I didn't have time to drink water.

677
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,440
That's just your excuse.

678
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,920
Drinking water

679
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,100
won't delay anything.

680
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,200
You've never developed

681
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,420
the good habit of drinking water.

682
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,960
Let me do it.

683
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,550
It's fine.

684
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,400
Give it to me.

685
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,020
Two meatballs, okay?

686
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:21,950
Okay.

687
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,100
Some wax gourd too.

688
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,940
Here, Xu.

689
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,480
I'll do it myself.

690
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,030
Really?

691
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:27,880
Help yourself.

692
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,830
Eat more vegetables.

693
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,720
Here.

694
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:32,920
Alright.

695
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,250
Not bad.

696
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,590
Alright.

697
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,780
I think we still have the...

698
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,160
the propolis patches for mouth ulcers at home.

699
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:46,970
Later, after we finish eating,

700
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,480
go find one for me.

701
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,030
Yeah, I'll find you one.

702
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,960
There should be some.

703
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,900
Tongsheng,

704
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,350
this is the only thing left

705
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,750
after your house burnt down.

706
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:19,960
Keep it as a keepsake.

707
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,330
Dad.

708
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,960
Dad.

709
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,400
Come on. Let's go home.

710
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,190
Didn't I tell you

711
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,360
I'll call your parents

712
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,800
if you score below 70 again?

713
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,500
Madam, call them now.

714
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,330
I'll give you the phone numbers

715
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,280
of my parents.

716
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,180
Here, Madam, please call them now.

717
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,190
It's time to contact

718
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,000
your parents.

719
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,590
If this continues, you...

720
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,150
Sorry. The phone you dialed

721
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,800
is not answered for the moment.

722
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,560
Madam, why don't you... try again?

723
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,510
You go back first.

724
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,180
Please enjoy the next performance:

725

Performers:

Xu Heng and He Xi

728
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,100
from Class 2, Grade 6.

729
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,630
I'm sorry.

730
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,700
It's our fault.

731
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,050
He Xi called us today.

732
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:33,090
[2005 Graduation Arts Performance of Shaohua Street Primary School]

733
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,880
He said no matter what, we must

734
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,090
come to watch your performance.

735
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,510
In the past,

736
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,150
we were always too busy.

737
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,140
We always thought about making sure you were fed and clothed,

738
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,130
but we ignored your feelings

739
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,630
and made you lonely

740
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,760
for so long.

741
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,720
Sorry.

742
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,920
Your dad and I have talked it over.

743
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,210
No matter how busy we are in the future,

744
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,400
either of us will stay at home

745
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,800
to wait for you and keep you company.

746
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,480
Okay?

747
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,570
Really?

748
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,620
Of course.

749
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,390
What's in your hand?

750
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,620
Evidence from the last case.

751
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,290
I remember I told you evidence needs

752
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,510
to be organized, right?

753
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,880
I know. I already organized it.

754
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,960
I organized it the way you told me.

755
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,140
You did?

756
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,150
Come here.

757
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,550
Bring it here.

758
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,920
