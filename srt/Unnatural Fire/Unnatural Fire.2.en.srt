00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,780
Now Director Zhao won't even let you investigate.

195
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,630
Tell me.

196
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,330
Is Han Pei related to

197
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
that case from back then?

198
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,840
I'll tell you the details later.

199
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,480
Has the deceased's identity been confirmed?

200
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,480
Chun.

201
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,340
Why are you here?

202
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,090
You two know each other?

203
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,530
Then I won't bother with introductions.

204
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,370
No need.

205
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,320
We've had

206
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,240
conversations at crime scenes—

207
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,630
sometimes friendly, sometimes not.

208
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,030
Come on.

209
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,610
Try this.

210
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,270
Stinky tofu and fat intestine noodles.

211
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,170
The smell is strong.

212
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,150
Captain Shen,

213
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,380
has the deceased's identity been confirmed?

214
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,660
Adviser Xu,

215
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,330
have you confirmed there was human intervention?

216
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,210
Through simulation systems,

217
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,210
I reconstructed the dispersal location,

218
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,660
method, and angle

219
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,360
of the combustion improver.

220
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,370
After comparing these simulations

221
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,000
with the actual fire spread trace

222
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,420
and residue distribution inside the accident vehicle,

223
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,030
I found the most reliable result is

224
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,150
someone

225
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,440
in the rear driver-side seat

226
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,800
used the central armrest

227
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,360
to shatter

228
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,560
a container filled with combustion improver.

229
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,970
This caused massive splattering of the combustion improver

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,720
throughout the cabin.

231
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,070
So,

232
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,460
a third person was present in the vehicle.

233
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,270
And that person was in the back seat when committing the crime.

234
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,070
Now that's a proper report.

235
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,590
To be honest,

236
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,190
I've also made a new discovery.

237
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,750
Was there a woman in the car?

238
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,590
Yes.

239
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,440
A woman?

240
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,660
Chun,

241
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,170
Mao Mao sent fingerprints here.

242
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,430
Is the comparison report ready?

243
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,250
What fingerprints?

244
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,000
We found fingerprints on a lighter

245
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,120
under the carpet of the back seat.

246
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,250
I've compared them.

247
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,910
They don't match the fingerprints

248
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,970
of Han Pei or Han Jun.

249
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,230
No matches in the database either.

250
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,510
Then they must belong

251
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,540
to the woman in the back seat.

252
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,790
I'll investigate her.

253

the Fire Investigation Department find you?

You just called him Tongsheng?

261
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,150
You called her...

267

Some of them were from the car windows.

313

314
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,450
some fragments might be from

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,480
She told me about the 2/16 case.

387
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,240
She told me

388
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,480
on the day of the crime,

389
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,300
Chen Guang, under Han Pei's instructions,

390
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,680
disguised himself as a property staff member

391
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,440
and snuck into

392
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,400
Wei Kang's house.

393
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,400
He deliberately replaced a section

394
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,720
of the water heater's wiring.

395
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,240
And on his way out,

396
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,110
he pretended to

397
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,400
accidentally spill motor oil

398
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,190
in the box onto the victim,

399
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,860
luring the victim to take a shower when he got home.

400
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,160
In the end, Wei Kang was burned to death in his own house.

401
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,130
This case was nearly ruled as an accidental fire

402
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,790
caused by a short-circuited water heater.

403
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,200
So...

404
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,200
So,

405
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,510
this case's

406
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,710
modus operandi

407
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,180
is exactly the same as what happened to my family.

408
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,750
You think the killer is the same person?

409
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,550
The police

410
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,590
were going to catch Han Pei.

411
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,160
But they suddenly told me

412
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,270
Han Pei is dead.

413
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,240
So...

414
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,270
I...

415
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,200
Can you un-understand?

416
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,760
Of course I understand you.

417
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,550
But just like Director Zhao,

418
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,980
I don't want to see you sad.

419
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,920
But there is no point

420
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,550
in trying to stop you.

421
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,920
You won't listen.

422
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,310
He told you to stop investigating,

423
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,680
but you're still investigating.

424
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,790
So,

425
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,680
I thought about it.

426
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,440
Since I can't stop you,

427
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,240
I might as well join you.

428
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
Let me help you.

429
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,920
He's sleeping so soundly.

430
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,750
Maybe he's too tired.

431
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,030
But

432
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,830
there is a condition if I help you.

433
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,800
Han Pei is dead.

434
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,390
Once this case is closed,

435
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
you have to move forward.

436
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,830
Okay?

437
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,680
I haven't figured out

438
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,790
what kind of container this is.

439
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,480
It looks like

440
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,720
an ordinary glass container.

441
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,270
We won't know until we piece it together.

Mr. Shen,

580
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,160

I'm from the Criminal Investigation Division.

583

You know Han Pei, right?

584
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,150
Come with us.

585
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,540
Get her in the car.

586
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,700
Watch the stairs.

Adviser Xu,

588
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,450
my car is here. Let me give you two a ride.

589
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:12,840
No need.

See you.

594
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,460
Captain Shen,

595
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,580
you and Adviser Xu

596
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,600
are quite in sync.

597
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,710
You both sniffed out this place.

598
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,830
He's cut out for handling cases.

599
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,370
By the way, Danggui,

600
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,880
remember to send the accident vehicle

601
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,830
to Adviser Xu tomorrow.

602
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,680
Okay.

603
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,270
Let's go back.

604
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,830
Okay.

The accident vehicle.

609
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,070
Captain Shen asked Li Danggui

610
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,830
to send the car here.

611
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,180

613
00:29:59,480 --> 00:29:59,920

Let's go.

616
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,240
The current investigation findings

617
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,000
are as follows:

618
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,400
fingerprints were found on the lighter

619
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,270
at the scene.

620
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,110
Through comparison,

621
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
they don't belong to Han Pei

622
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,110
or Han Jun.

623
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,830

a woman

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,220
got in the car before the incident.

627
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,620
This woman is being interrogated

628
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,350
by the Criminal Investigation Division.

629
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,070
As for

630
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,140
the combustion improver found in the car,

631
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,270
we've confirmed

632
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,720
it's from the house special

633
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,270

We've got the wine.

636
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,880
We just need to

637
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,890
conduct a fire simulation experiment.

638
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,030
Then we can basically reconstruct

639
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,200
the conditions of the fire at the time of the incident.

640
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,460
That's all?

641
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,570
That's all they asked you to say?

642
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,480
They didn't ask me to say anything else.

Fine.

648
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,960
let him investigate thoroughly.

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,000

654
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,440
Nothing special.

As for Han Jun...

I don't even know him.

659
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,750
According to our investigation,

660
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,240
first,

661
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,720
the transaction records show

I really don't know Han Jun.

669
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,110
Indeed, Han Pei

670
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,350
came to our bar a few times.

671
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,720
But we were not close.

672
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,510
Tell me about you being in his car.

673
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,370
After you got in the car,

674
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,480
did you see both Han Pei

675
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,110
and Han Jun?

676
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:08,790
Yes.

677
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,440
I saw two men

678
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,400
looking exactly the same.

679
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,660
That was when I knew Han Pei

680
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,510
had a twin brother.

681
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,630
Who was the driver?

Han Pei.

683
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,600
What makes you so sure?

684
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,640
The ways they talked

685
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,640
were

686
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,590
totally different.

687
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,480
The other man

688
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,640
looked gentle.

689
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,110
It's easy to distinguish him from Han Pei.

690
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,830
Why did you go to Han Pei?

691
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,790
To deliver wine.

00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
To deliver wine?

693
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,680
Did Han Pei ask you to deliver it?

694
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,400
He ordered the wine in the bar.

695
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,000
He asked me

696
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,160
to deliver it to him on that day.

697
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,830
How did he contact you?

698
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,310
We agreed on the time in the bar.

699
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,030
How?

Well...

704
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,200
the location was

705
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,310
the one in the video.

706
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:11,920

707
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,350
do you think I'll believe you?

708
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,680
You could have just delivered the wine

709
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,790
to Han Pei's office or home.

710
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,240
Why did you have to deliver it somewhere so far away?

711
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,350
Also,

712
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,640

went to visit their parents' graves.

715
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,590
He called you there

716
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,480
just to get a bottle of wine?

717
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,750
Who would believe that?

718
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,440
I went to him.

719
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,880
I couldn't find him in his company.

720
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,480
After I arrived at his house,

721
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,160
the security guards wouldn't let me in.

722
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,920
Someone in the bar told me

723
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,200
he went to his father's grave.

724

730
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,440

Was the man who died on the driver seat?

Why are you asking this?

737
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,710
Is the one who died Han Pei?

Is it him?

00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,640
Mr. Han,

771
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,100
this is the house special you ordered.

772
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,360
Chen Xue.

773
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,080
The wine made by you

774
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,590
is very good.

775
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,800
It's so good that

776
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,550
it reminds me of someone.

777
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,800
You must be drunk.

778
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,280
Let me get you a cup of hot water.

779
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,360
Mr. Han.

780
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,030
Come. Come here.

781
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,670
Mr. Han.

782
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,710
Come here!

783
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,800
Help!

784
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,590
Mr. Han, you are drunk!

785
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,440
Help!

786
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,400
Why didn't you call the police?

787
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,920
My mind was totally a blank.

788
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,440
I didn't know how I got home.

789
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,880
The first thing I got home

790
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,960
was to take a shower.

791
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,550
I washed my body

792
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,110
again and again.

793
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,670
When I wanted to call the police,

794
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,960
it was too late.

795
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,030
No one would believe me.

796
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,190
My boyfriend noticed something was wrong with me.

797
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,510
At first, he asked me nicely

798
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,230
and said no matter what happened,

799
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,590
he would be on my side.

800
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,800
But after I told him,

801
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,630
he packed his things

802
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,320
and moved out.

803
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,590
He even slapped me before he left.

804
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,630
He said he felt

805
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,030
someone like me is indecent long ago.

806
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,840
I asked the manager.

807
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,590
I wanted him to testify for me.

808
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,760
But he said

809
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,800
he didn't see me

810
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,800
enter the private room.

811
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,360
He said the bar's camera was broken,

812
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,000
and all my colleagues were busy that day.

813
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,400
He even said...

814
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,400
He said...

815
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,960
He said Han Pei was a blessing for me.

816
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,230
He told me to be tactful.

817
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
The female colleagues around me

818
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
also advised me

819
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,590
to put up with it and let it go.

820
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,400
They said a girl's reputation

821
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,760
is different from other things.

822
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,190
If I called the police,

823
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,800
someone would know one day.

824
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,800
They would judge me.

825
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,550
Besides,

826
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,550
I work in a bar.

827
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,800
All jobs that comply with the law

828
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,840
are equal in dignity.

829
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,510
That's easy for you to say.

830
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,030
In their eyes,

831
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,670
they saw a girl walk into

832
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,670
a private room with a bottle of wine.

833
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,070
Then Han Pei came out like that.

834
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,590
He generously credited

835
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,070
200,000 yuan in sales to her account.

836
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,070
Who would believe

837
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,920
it was not

838
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,710
a consensual transaction?

839
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,440
That's why I went to Han Pei.

840
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,230
I wanted him

841
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,840
to go to the police station with me.

842
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,510
I wanted to force him to turn himself in

843
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,110
so that the police could file a case and investigate.

844
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,320
Even if

845
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,480
nothing would come of it in the end,

846
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,110
I wanted him to know

849
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,400
If he refused,

850
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,360
I'd just...

851
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,150
I'd just kill him.

00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,960
Who should I ask for my innocence?

854
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:01,710

00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,480
Enough!

00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:10,440

861
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,970

866
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,840
Are you crazy?

867
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,550
Don't do this!

00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,150

Han Pei, stop the car!

870
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,030
I neglected the fact

871
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,840
that there was another person in the car.

872
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,400

I secretly ignited the lighter.

00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,360
Get off!

00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,150
Get off!

878
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,960
And I threw it on the back seat.

888
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,710
that he really was burned to death.

889
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,110
He deserved to die.

890
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,510
He deserved to die.

891
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,800
He deserved to die.

892
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,150

00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,320
