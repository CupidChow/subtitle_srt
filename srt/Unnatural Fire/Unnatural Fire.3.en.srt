00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,710
Adviser Xu, what is this?

5
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,800
Let's see if the lighter

6
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,560
can ignite the items

7
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,910
sprinkled with the combustion improvers on the scene.

8
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,000
Can't it ignite them like this?

9
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,750
That mat on the scene

10
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,370
was burned like that.

11
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
That mat is made of anti-flaming material.

12
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,910
Only a big fire

13
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,120
could burn it down like that.

14
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,000
A lighter with a low heat value

15
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,190
may not be capable of igniting it.

16
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,960
Replace it with another one.

17
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,170
This doesn't seem to work either, Adviser Xu.

18
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,630
Replace it with another one again.

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,690
Idol.

20
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,360
Li Danggui said Chen Xue confessed that

21
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,430
she had used a lighter

22
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,310
to ignite the car.

23
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,910
Really? Then how do you explain this?

24
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,079
Chun.

25
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,829
This is a newly discovered stinky tofu shop.

26
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,660
Taste it now.

27
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,079
Why are you so attentive to me for no reason?

28
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,710
What do you mean by that?

29
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,040
Firstly, our relationship is good.

30
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,890
Secondly,

31
00:03:59,079 --> 00:03:59,800
we've finished interrogating

32
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,660
Chen Xue.

33
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,240
But the result

34
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,270
isn't what I've hoped for.

35
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,470
The impact of a single evil thought

36
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,020
goes far beyond this.

37
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,600
But what we can do

38
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,000
is to restore the truth

39
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,910
as much as possible.

40
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,510
Taste it now.

41
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,510
You're both here.

42
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,540
Chen Xue is not the murderer.

43
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,830
What did you say?

44
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,040
I did an experiment.

45
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,160
With the same temperature,

46
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,750
humidity and other environmental conditions

47
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,870
as those on the day of the accident,

48
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,630
I sprinkled the same type of alcohol

49
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,510
on the same cushion

50
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,290
and carpet

51
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,440
from Han Pei's car.

52
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,240
But the lighter couldn't ignite them.

53
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,010
So the lighter wasn't the source of the fire.

54
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,020
Chen Xue thought she was the murderer herself.

55
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,250
But that's impossible.

56
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,360
Chen Xue is not the murderer?

57
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,720
That's right.

58
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,490
What was the cause of the explosion

59
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,290
and the fire?

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,920
The temperature of an ignited lighter

61
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,600
is between 200 to 500 degrees.

62
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,909
I used an alcohol lamp

63
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,880
and an alcohol spray gun

64
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,320
to ignite the items on the scene

65
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,800
under the same condition simultaneously.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,450
Only the alcohol spray gun could ignite them.

67
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,050
So the temperature of the fire source

68
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,920
was at least 800 degrees.

69
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,390
So you mean

70
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,950
something with a temperature of over 800 degrees

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,010
ignited the scene?

72
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,900
Yes.

73
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,650
What is it?

74
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,400
I'm not sure yet.

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,910
Chun.

76
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,440
I noticed a detail

77
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,430
on the autopsy report.

78
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,320
There are some red spots on the left part

79
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,390
of the corpse's neck.

80
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,340
What casued those spots?

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,800
About the corpse, this is the only

82
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,420
part that can't be explained properly.

83
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,350
Some red spots were found on

84
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,890
the wrinkles of the victim's neck indeed.

85
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,640
But ordinary fire

86
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,680
wouldn't cause

87
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,000
such spotted wounds.

88
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,140
According to the positions and depths of the wounds

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,070
as well as the internal tissue tests,

90
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,430
these wounds

91
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,950
were not the causes of the victim's death.

92
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,810
Can you tell me

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,190
the exact time when these wounds appeared?

94
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,000
I can only say that

95
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,120
there are vital reactions

96
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,170
on these wounds.

97
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,180
This means these wounds

98
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,310
had all been formed before the victim died.

99
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
As for the exact time,

100
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm not sure about it, either.

101
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,740
Alright.

102
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,630
Then I'll go back

103
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,560
to continue the experiment.

That means

111
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,190
thanks to the Fire Investigation Department,

112
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,510
we have to start over.

113
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,870
Chief Wu, don't worry. I...

114
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,360
I didn't want to

115
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,480
put too much pressure on you.

116
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,310
But as you know,

117
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,560
this case is very special.

118
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,830
Many people are watching.

119
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,360
I understand.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,600
I never doubt your ability.

121
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,480
But you have to have your own opinions.

122
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
You can't listen to everyone indiscriminately.

Alright.

124
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,310

Let's start the experiment.

135
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,429
Replace it with another one.

137

and for 25 seconds,

138
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,670
compared with the actual accident vehicle

139
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,510
on the scene,

140
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,730
the fire spread traces within 20 seconds were shallow,

141
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,360
and after it was burnt for 25 seconds,

142
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,390
the mat was almost burned down.

143
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,670
At that time, Han Pei's car speed was probably

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,270
about 120 km/h.

145
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,000

Idol.

157
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,870
I still don't understand.

158
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,960
Why should we go to

159
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,120
the place where the fire first started?

160
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,750
Captain Shen.

161
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,170
Why are we going to the hospital now?

162
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,270
Now there's an explanation for the combustion improver

163
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,100
and the lighter

164
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,930
in the car.

165
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,990
We haven't confirmed the identity

166
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,320
of the person lying in hospital now.

167
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,320
Our focus

168
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,740
is still to find the source of the fire.

169
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,350
Our focus

170
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,670
is to see the fish take the bait.

171
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,630
This fire source probably came from

172
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,330
outside the car.

173
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,480
Then the small red spots

174
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,520
on the neck of the corpse

175
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,510
might have been caused by

176
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,390
an external fire source

177
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,320
that was hard to detect.

178
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,490
And this fire source's

179
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,480
heat value is extremely high.

180
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,510
If it was done by someone,

181
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,360
the murderer's target

182
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,490
was probably Han Pei.

183
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,000
Because we declared to the public that

184
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,620
one of the two brothers died, and the other got injured.

185
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,910
The murderer must be very concerned about

186
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,050
the condition of the survivor.

187
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,880
If Han Pei had been the survivor,

188
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,370
the murderer might take action again.

189
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,960
If Han Jun had been the survivor,

190
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,930
he would be in a very dangerous situation, too.

191
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,270

something with a temperature of over 800 degrees

ignited the scene?

280
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,550
Tell me. Why did run away?

281

we mentioned the tires?

No.

288
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,870
Look. The car was fine

289
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,790
when it left from my place.

290
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,070

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,390
those tires.

293
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,200
Here's the situation of the investigation

294
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,580
about the car burning case this time.

295
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,600
We first checked the accident vehicle's

296
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,670
motor system,

297
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,390
fuel tank and mechanical system

298
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,390
thoroughly and conducted an overall analysis.

299
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,510
But we didn't find

300
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,500
any traces of human destruction.

00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,780
[Picture 1: Combustion Improver] [Picture 2: Combustion Improver] [Picture 3: Lighter] [Picture 4: Lighter]

302
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,840
When we went back to the scene for a survey,

303
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,069
we found that

304
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,030
there were combustion improvers

305
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,069
and a lighter which was a fire source.

306
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,760
After experiments, it proved that

307
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,569
the lighter couldn't ignite the car.

308
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,910
So we speculated that

309
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,230
the real fire source

310
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,880
should be something with an extremely high heat value.

311
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,770
In addition, after the forensic doctor's autopsy,

312
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,920
there had been no explanation

313
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,550
for the spark marks on the victim's neck.

314
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,790
[Picture 1: Autopsy] [Picture 2: Autopsy]

315
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,790
Then we speculated that

316
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,790
the fire source might have come from outside the car.

317
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:24,790
So,

318
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,160
through the fire spread traces of

319
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,880
of the burning carpet,

320
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,589
I managed to infer

321
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,090
the actual ignition time.

322
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,340
When we once again went back to the location

323
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:31,960
where the accident vehicle had caught fire

324
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,090
and investigated the case,

325
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,450
we found

327
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,710
some rubber particles.

328
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,950
Our test showed that

329
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,030
those rubber particles

330
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,580
were from the front wheel

331
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,980
on the side of the driver's cab of the accident vehicle.

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,380
[Picture 2: Rubber Particles]

333
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:43,960
Wang Xi.

334
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,640
As a repairman,

335
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,200
you're familiar with tires, right?

336
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,030
The front and back wheels of a car

337
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,920
are usually of the same model.

338
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,920
Therefore, many people

339
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,550
wouldn't care too much about them

340
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,400
while installing them.

341
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,510
Sometimes,

342
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,000
to ensure the consistency of the abrasion degree,

343
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,400
you might switch the front and back wheels deliberately,

344
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,750
Am I wrong about that?

345
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,790
No, you're not wrong.

346
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,830
But Han Pei's car was an exception.

347
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,440
There were obvious differences between

348
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,310
the front and back wheels of his car.

349
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,440
Once they were switched,

350
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,720
due to the mismatching situation,

351
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,240
they would have intense friction with the hubs.

352
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,030
You know that too, right?

353
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,720
The metal fragments

354
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,200
that have been caused during the friction

355
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,830
correspond with the conditions of a fire source.

356
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,480
Meanwhile, that's also a perfect explanation

357
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,350
for the spark marks on the victim's neck.

358
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,070
So,

359
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,400
we've thoroughly figured out

360
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,270
the truth of this case.

361
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,960
Han Pei went to the repair factory to get the car that day.

362
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,480
I think he checked the car on the spot.

363
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,150
But he was not a professional after all.

364
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,590
It was also hard for him to notice that

365
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,270
the tires were installed reversely.

366
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,790
Take care, Mr. Han.

367
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,640
Take care.

368
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,880
So he left

369
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,640
without noticing it.

370
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,880
On the day of the accident,

371
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,960
Han Pei and Han Jun

372
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,070
went to pay tribute to Han Kun.

373
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,480
At first,

374
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,070
Han Pei drove the car in the city.

375
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,310
The car speed wasn't very fast,

376
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,270
and he didn't drive very far.

377
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,510
The tire friction

378
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,550
was not too serious.

379
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,110
So it didn't arouse

380
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,030
anyone's attention.

381
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,310
Later, Han Pei drove the car to the suburbs.

382
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,590
The car speed became faster.

383
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,310
The tire friction

384
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,110
started to cause metal fragments and sparks.

385
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,830
They kept splashing

386
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,680
in all directions.

387
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,400
Some flew into the car through the windows.

388
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,240
Some went onto the neck of Han Pei, who was sitting

389
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,000
on the driver's seat.

390
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,030
Some fell onto

391
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,160
other parts of the car.

392
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,160
At this time, the friction of the tires

393
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,720
was big enough to make the car out of control

394
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,000
and ignite the car.

395
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,550
So the main causes

396
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,440
of this case

397
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,880
are the tires that you installed reversely.

398
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,550
You were quite smart.

399
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,200
But because of these tires,

400
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,070
we also found

401
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,160
the real cause of the fire.

402
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,310
Well...

403
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,550
Even if the tires had been installed reversely,

404
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,510
I might have

405
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,550
done it carelessly.

406
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,550
Carelessly?

407
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,790
Don't you know

408
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,960
how many experiments you've done?

409
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,350
[Picture 1: Abandoned Tires] [Picture 2: Abandoned Tires] [Picture 3: Abandoned Tires]

410
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,400
These tire surfaces

411
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,750
are consistent with the abrasion marks

412
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,160
I got in the lab.

413
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,590
They can prove that

414
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,640
Wang Xi conducted

415
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,030
a test to commit arson.

416
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,720
Do you have anything else to say?

417
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,270
All that you said was just a coincidence.

418
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,640
I'm just an petty employee.

419
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,550
Why would I

420
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,720
kill Han Pei, who was

421
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,270
such a big boss?

422
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,480
Yesterday afternoon,

423
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,070
you went to

424
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,960
No.1 People's Hospital, didn't you?

425
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,480
Why did you go there?

426
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,550
I... I went there to visit a friend.

427
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,030
Whom did you visit?

428
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,590
Tell me!

429
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,960
Just tell me!

430
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,030
Do you need me to go with you?

431
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,310
I went to the hospital just to visit...

432
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,030
To visit someone who was

433
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,960
almost killed by you.

434
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:21,750
Right?

435
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,790
We declared to the public that

436
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,640
one of the two brothers died, and the other got injured.

437
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,830
But we didn't say

438
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,310
which of them was dead or injured exactly.

439
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,880
You just wanted to find out

440
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,750
who was the person you had

441
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,270
taken great pains to kill.

442
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,350
Right?

443
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,350
Well, you've been talking for a long time.

444
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,680
You're just trying to trick me into confessing it.

445
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,160
I...

446
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,160
I told you

447
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,590
I had no reason to kill Han Pei.

448
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,440
You failed to see your mother for the last time.

449
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,790
Does that count?

450
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,680
Is that a reason?

451
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,030
This is your boss's statement.

452
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,000
You were the exclusive maintainer

453
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,350
for Han Pei's car.

454
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,310
Han Pei had a bad temper.

455
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,400
He once went to see you

456
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,680
and smashed your mobile phone.

457
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,400
But coincidentally,

458
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,550
on the day when your mobile phone was smashed,

459
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,030
your mother was being rescued in the hospital.

461
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,480
kept calling you.

died despite our rescue efforts.

Before your mother passed away,

503

she even wanted to see you for the last time.

504
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,290
Unfortunately,

kill Han Pei?

513
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,160
I knew he had the habit of driving fast.

514
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,510

516

I just wanted him to suffer a bit.

518
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,440
I thought since the car had been burnt like that,

519
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
it wouldn't leave any evidence.

00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,480
for today's meeting?

569
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,870
Well...

570
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,710
Since all the leaders are here,

571
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,330
I have a suggestion.

572
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,860
Go ahead.

573
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,790
I suggest that

574
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,400
the Fire Investigation Department and the Criminal Investigation Division

575
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,920
should jointly establish

576
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
a quick response system

577
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,160
for major fire cases.

578
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,510
It means that in the future,

579
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,440
if we encounter

580
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,310
any investigation work

581
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,260
related to fire,

582
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,810
our Fire Investigation Department will fully cooperate.

583
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,320
I, Shen Ye,

584
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,470
and Jin Chun

585
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,400
will jointly establish an investigation team

586
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,590
and work together.

587
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,080
This is good.

588
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,830
I'm afraid

589
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,590
this requires

590
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,650
approval from the superiors of both units.

591
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,230
It can't be formed so easily as you wish.

592
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,050
That's right.

593
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,070
We still need to ponder on this.

594
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,590
What's more, the key is

595
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,590
whether there have been any precedents before.

596
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,590
There are precedents.

597
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,070
I've looked into it.

598
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,270
I think it's okay.

599
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,070
Deputy Marshal Peng.

600
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,680
Look. Xu and

601
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,960
our team

602
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,790
can work together so closely now.

603
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,110
I think we might as well

604
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,680
establish a joint team.

605
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,550
In this way,

606
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,880
it can largely improve

607
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,830
our work efficiency.

608
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,110
As for the procedure,

609
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,000
we'll handle it.

610
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,790
I also think that this is a good thing.

611
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,110
I agree.

612
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:19,750
Okay.

613
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,750
How about this?

614
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,720
It's settled

615
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,830
like this for now.

616
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,440
After we go back,

617
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,830
Deputy Marshal Peng and I

618
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
will report it to

619
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,750
the higher-ups.

620
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,790
Alright.

621
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,110
That's all for our

622
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,920
meeting today.

623
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,750
Dismiss.

624
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,400
Adviser Xu.

625
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,510
The Fire Investigation Department, the Criminal Investigation Division and forensic doctors work together.

626
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,790
It's a good idea.

627
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:03,830
Uncle Shen.

628
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,310
Hello, Uncle Shen.

629
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,270
Hello.

630
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,270
So you're going out to work?

631
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,770
We're going to the local police station.

632
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,440
[Shen Yi, Shen Ye's father]

633
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,960
Okay. Just go.

634
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,720
Uncle Shen, you're here.

635
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,110
-Hello, Uncle Shen.
-Hello, Uncle Shen.

636
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:12,960
Have you had lunch?

637
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,680
-Yes.
-Yes.

638
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,400
So you both have had lunch?

639
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,300
Hello, Uncle Shen!

640
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,110
Hello.

641
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,880
Uncle Shen.

642
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

643
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,550
That's right.

644
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,030
Gosh.

645
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,510
Have you had lunch?

646
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,240
Go upstairs to eat something.

647
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:22,720
No.

648
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,150
I just want to discuss something with Ye.

649
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,570
Alright. Captain Shen will come down soon.

650
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,420
Okay.

651
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,070
Goodbye, Uncle Shen.

652
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,680
Get back to work.

653
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,220
Okay.

654
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,570
Dad!

655
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,630
Stop running!

656
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,510
Well...

657
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,910
Why don't you go inside?

658
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,620
I'm just here to deliver lunch to you.

659
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,160
If I go inside, it might affect your work.

660
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,670
Where's the food?

661
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,160
The food...

662
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,610
Well...

663
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,240
Well, why did you put it there?

664
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,790
This...

665
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,200
Uncle Shen.

666
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:47,850
You're here.

667
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,270
I'm here.

668
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:48,880
Go upstairs and have a seat.

669
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,920
No, we'll just chat for a while.

670
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,880
We'll just chat for a while.

671
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,440
Get back to work.

672
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,500
Just get back to work.

673
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,630
I'm afraid it might affect your work.

674
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,480
Well, next time,

675
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,970
just put it in the janitor's room.

676
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,120
The janitor's room?

677
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,540
What if you forget to take it?

678
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,320
Besides,

679
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,480
we have a canteen here, don't we?

680
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,880
Can the food in your canteen

681
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,660
suit your taste better than my cooking?

682
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,310
Look at you.

683
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,560
I've noticed that you've become thinner recently.

684
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,640
If you don't eat something good,

685
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,480
how can you stay healthy?

686
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,440
Alright. I got it.

687
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,930
Come on. Just go back.

688
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,830
I'm leaving.

689
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,600
Alright.

690
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,680
You don't need to wash the utensil.

691
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,350
Bring it over after you eat the food.

692
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:16,950
Okay.

693
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,040
Send me a message when you get home.

694
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,480
Okay.

695
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,350
There's soup. Hold it steadily.

696
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,240
Okay. I got it.

697
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,110
Hello, Uncle Shen.

698
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,040
Hello, hello.

699
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,310
Hello.

700
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,000
When you finish, print it.

701
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,850
[Stay Loyal to the Party, Serve the People, Be Impartial in Law Enforcement, and Be Well-disciplined]

702
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,370
Let me take a look at yours.

703
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,650
Okay.

704
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:32,590
Is it okay, Captain Shen?

705
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,160
Yes. Go ahead.

706
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,510
How about this?

707
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,550
Make another version.

708
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,990
Use bigger fonts

709
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,900
so that Marshal Gu can read it easily.

710
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,720
Bigger fonts?

711
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,430
Bigger fonts.

712
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,080
Mentor.

713
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:46,830
Now?

714
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,890
Alright. Okay.

715
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,820
I'll be right there.

716
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,070
Send it to me when it's done.

717
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,680
Okay.

718
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,890
Adviser Xu, you're here.

719
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:00,840
Where is my mentor?

720
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,470
Who is your mentor?

721
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,220
You've seen him before. Marshal Gu.

722
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,220
I think he'll be here soon.

723
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,090
This is for you.

724
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,250
This is good.

725
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,640
We can close the case this time.

726
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,220
Marshal Gu.

727
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,640
Mentor.

728
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,020
Both of you are here.

729
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,980
Look. Look.

730
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,510
Mind your appearance and manner as a policeman.

731
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,270
Mentor, what's the matter?

732
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,160
Why did you come all the way here?

733
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,470
What's the matter?

734
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,070
It's something good.

735
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,240
Come on. Have a seat.

736
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,200
Adviser Xu.

737
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,320
The quick response system

738
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,000
for major fire cases

739
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,500
which you've mentioned...

740
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,300
QR...

741
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,750
QRSCAN.

742
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,990
It has been approved.

743
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,000
So soon?

744
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,590
I photocopied

745
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,600
this official document.

746
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,920
There are many details inside

747
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,640
which you need to pay attention to.

748
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,510
You two have to learn them carefully.

749
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,880
Let's discuss this privately.

750
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,510
After the joint investigation team

751
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,350
is established,

752
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,720
we'll be a family.

753
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,070
You two have to collaborate well.

754
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,830
After all, you're from two different units.

755
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,720
Some work needs to

756
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,670
be handled properly

757
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,270
so that others won't gossip about you.

758
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,220
Don't worry, Mentor.

759
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,240
I'll guide him.

760
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,480
You even want to guide him?

761
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,270
You must be dreaming.

762
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,480
I think you need guidance from others.

763
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,160
Xu.

764
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,790
This guy

765
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,270
seems unreliable.

766
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,240
But he can handle

767
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,830
his work well.

768
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,070
I hope that you two

769
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,510
can get along well with each other.

770
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:37,920
Don't worry.

771
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,000
Our minds

772
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,590
are kind of in sync.

773
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,200
What do you mean by "kind of?"

774
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,200
Our minds are in sync.

775
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,790
Alright. It's good that your minds are in sync.

776
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,880
Anyway,

777
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,550
I won't talk too much about the major principles.

778
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,830
Come to me if you need anything.

779
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,000
I'll strongly support you.

780
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,830
Okay, Mentor.

781
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,880
Thank you, Marshal Gu.

782
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,880
Alright.

783
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,550
I have a meeting to attend.

784
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,830
You two

785
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,790
have to study

786
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,590
the document carefully.

787
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,270
Okay.

788
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,160
Mentor, take care.

789
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,680
Okay.

790
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,310
Take care, Marshal Gu.

791
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:06,880
Bye.

792
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,830
I didn't expect

793
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,230
Marshal Gu to be your mentor.

794
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,830
Now you understand the saying,

795
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,310
"A great mentor tends to have accomplished disciples." Huh?

796
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,750
Come on. Let's go to my place.

797
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,310
Huang Qi, photocopy this.

798
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,000
Okay.

799
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,110
Come on, everyone.

800
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,070
Put aside your work for now.

801
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,310
I have two things to say.

802
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,640
Firstly,

803
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,790
it's a good thing that the case is closed.

804
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:34,960
Secondly,

805
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,350
the joint investigation team formed by us

806
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
and the Fire Investigation Department

807
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,110
is officially established today.

808
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,030
There are two happy events at the same time.

809
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,110
-Good!
-Good!

810
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:42,790
Also,

811
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,790
let me introduce him to you all.

812
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,830
This is the adviser of the Fire Investigation Department

813
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,480
of the Rescue Brigade of Beixun Fire Bureau,

814
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,200
Xu Tongsheng.

815
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,440
We'll be a family from now on.

816
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:49,960
Welcome.

817
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,670
Hello, Adviser Xu.

818
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,110
I look forward to working with you.

819
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,070
Let's collaborate

820
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,160
to finish our work properly.

821
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,550
I've booked a restaurant.

822
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,640
Let's have a meal together.

823
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,880
This guy is quite proactive.

824
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,310
Alright. You'll take your men

825
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,310
and I'll take my men.

826
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,510
Whose treat is it?

827
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,680
It's my treat.

828
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,310
With this joint team,

829
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,200
you're quite different now.

830
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,680
Let me tell you.

831
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,000
Get off work and get changed.

832
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,550
Let's have dinner.

833
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,920
Ask Chun and Pai to join us.

834
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,070
No problem.

835
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,790
Let's go, Adviser Xu.

836
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,550
Thank you for your hard work today.

837
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,830
Eat as much as you want today.

838
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,640
Make yourselves at home.

839
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,110
Here are the kebabs.

840
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,200
Coming.

841
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,310
Here is the main course.

842
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,350
Come on. Share it over here.

843
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,630
Huang Qi.

844
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,720
Show your skill of eating 100 mutton kebabs

845
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,920
and 20 pig kidneys

846
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,790
to the fellows from

847
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,480
the Fire Investigation Department.

848
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,200
Let's start ordering food.

849
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,130
Stop eating.

850
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,110
Go check those kebabs.

851
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,790
I'll go, Captain Shen.

852
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,550
Sit.

853
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,030
Have a good chat with Adviser Xu.

854
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,550
Okay.

855
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,080
Danggui.

856
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,480
Chun told me that

857
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,750
you guys had been working on

858
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,920
Han Group's case for a long time.

859
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
So you guys must know

860
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,510
Han Pei very well, right?

861
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,270
We've met him a few times before.

862
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,070
But this group...

863
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,350
Han Group

864
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,880
has been in Beixun for many years.

865
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,750
It's a very large corporation.

866
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,110
Han Pei

867
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,960
was kind of a celebrity.

868
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,360
He was usually quite arrogant.

869
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,030
What's the relationship between Han Pei

870
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,070
and Chen Guang, the guy who was shot dead?

871
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,880
They used to be childhood friends.

872
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,670
Chen Guang once helped him

873
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,400
manage a security company.

874
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,270
I have another question.

875
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,880
Han Kun

876
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,760
was such a big boss.

877
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,230
I think he enjoyed good medical services.

878
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Why did he pass away so suddenly?

879
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,110
What was the reason?

880
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,150
Come on. Here are the kebabs.

881
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,360
Hurry up! Come on! Here!

882
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,280
This boss...

883
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,480
What do you mean, Adviser Xu?

884
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,710
You've invited us out for dinner

885
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,840
to ask about information?

886
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:42,920
No.

887
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
I want to know more about the case.

888
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,800
Alright, alright.

889
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,980
Let's not talk about work today.

890
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,110
Guys, raise your glasses.

891
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,440
Today,

892
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,960
our quick response team is established.

893
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,440
We'll be a family from now on.

894
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,480
Let's celebrate for it.

895
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,400
Come on. Let's drink a toast to this big family.

896
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,150
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

897
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,000
Listen to me.

898
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,480
Let's enjoy our dinner today

899
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,440
and not talk about the case.

900
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,110
Alright. Cheers.

901
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,230
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

902
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,360
Han Pei is already dead.

903
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,480
How do you know it was Han Pei who died,

904
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,670
instead of Han Jun?

905
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,230
Come on. Sit down, guys.

906
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,850
Mao Mao.

907
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,190
Can't you stop talking while eating?

908
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,090
Adviser Xu.

909
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,100
To be honest,

910
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,920
actually, at first,

911
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,880
we also thought that

912
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,760
this matter was quite fishy.

913
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,830
But according to the surveillance video

914
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
from the underground garage in Han Pei's house,

915
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,520
as well as Chen Xue's testimony,

916
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Han Pei was indeed the one

917
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,000
who died on the driver's seat.

918
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,400
What's more, Wang Xi's target

919
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,190
was Han Pei, too.

920
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,760
What if Chen Xue and Wang Xi lied?

921
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,890
What if they were accomplices?

922
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
You seem to only care about

923
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,800
who actually died.

924
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,670
Although this case is closed,

925
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,630
I think there's still a problem.

926
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,840
According to what you said,

927
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,400
the person lying

928
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,320
in hospital now

929
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,280
might be Han Pei, too?

930
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,590
That's possible.

931
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,480
But it's also possible that

932
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,280
the one lying in hospital now

933
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,440
is Han Jun.

934
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,190
Right?

935
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,330
Captain Shen.

936
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,510
The Exit-Entry Administration Bureau

937
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,360
replied to my message.

938
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,880
They said when Han Jun came back to China,

939
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,480
he entered

940
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,800
from a very remote land border port.

941
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,400
He didn't leave any

942
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,150
fingerprint information.

943
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,090
[When Han Jun came back to China, he entered from a very remote land border port. He didn't leave any fingerprint information.]

944
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,590
Shen Ye.

945
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,790
This case is not over yet.

946
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,960
We have to keep investigating it.

947
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,670
There must be something wrong.

948
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,910
[Han Jun is awake.]

949
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,510
Han Jun is awake.

950
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,060
Let's go take a look.

951
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,590
I'll go with you guys.

952
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,850
I'm acquainted with both Han Pei and Han Jun.

953
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,600
Danggui.

954
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,350
Take care of everyone.

955
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,280
Huang Qi, let's drive the car there.

956
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,190
Enjoy your meal.

957
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,080
Ma'am, so you won't go on eating?

958
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,480
Take my silkworm pupae with you.

959
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,150
It's alright. Let's continue to eat. Come on.

960
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,760
I jumped off the car instinctively.

961
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,320
I don't remember what happened

962
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,550
after that.

963
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,420
Oh, by the way,

964
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,760
how is Han Pei?

965
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,080
Han Pei was sitting on the driver’s seat

966
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,190
and couldn't escape in time.

967
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,400
Unfortunately, he passed away.

968
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,330
He's your elder brother.

969
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,590
Aren't you sad?

970
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,630
When I was 18, I left home

971
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,800
and settled in Americas.

972
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,960
The situation of this family

973
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,150
has nothing to do with me.

974
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,340
You haven't been back to China for 18 years.

975
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,590
Why did you come back this time?

976
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,110
Han Pei asked me to come back.

977
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,120
He asked me to come back

978
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,320
and attend Han Kun's funeral.

979
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,280
But my purpose

980
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,400
was to

981
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,670
move my mom's ashes to another place.

982
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,930
I've noticed that when you came back this time,

983
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,760
you entered from a land border port.

984
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,280
Why didn't you choose a direct flight?

985
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,480
Han Pei arranged it for me.

986
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,550
He said there were no tickets for direct flights.

987
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,400
I was also in a hurry

988
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,000
to come back before my mom's death anniversary.

989
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,030
That was why I entered from that port.

990
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,280
Senior Han Jun.

991
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,070
Do you remember me?

992
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:42,960
Jin Chun.

993
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,110
Actually, I recognized you

994
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,840
as soon as you

995
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,710
came in just now.

996
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,030
I was afraid you might not remember me,

997
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,710
so I didn't dare to say hello to you.

998
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,840
Why are you

999
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,960
with these

1000
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,550
police officers?

1001
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,150
They are all my colleagues.

1002
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,000
I'm a forensic doctor now.

1003
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,030
I heard that you got hurt,

1004
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,550
so I asked them

1005
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,400
to bring me here to see you.

1006
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,480
It's surprising that you still remember me.

1007
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,030
Of course I remember you.

1008
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,320
Back then,

1009
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,400
we even hosted

1010
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,550
the graduation ceremony together.

1011
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,760
I was in Grade 10 and you were in Grade 12.

1012
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,510
Do you still remember that?

1013
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,920
Yes, I do.

1014
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,880
That was my last time attending

1015
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:26,840
our school's activity

1016
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,150
before I went abroad.

1017
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,430
At that time,

1018
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,160
we always rehearsed

1019
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,280
in the same classroom.

1020
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,760
And our rehearsal would last for a whole afternoon.

1021
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,710
I still remember that back then,

1022
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
there was a classmate's name

1023
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,920
which I always couldn't pronounce correctly.

1024
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,670
Her name was Du Danning.

1025
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,710
I always called her Du Danling.

1026
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,550
Yeah.

1027
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,630
At that time,

1028
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,760
I even taught you a way

1029
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,440
to overcome it.

1030
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,150
That's right.

1031
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,550
You taught me a tongue twister.

1032
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,150
It's "a vine on a high mountain."

1033
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,800
It was quite effective.

1034
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,400
I remember that

1035
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,440
you were very fluent in it.

1036
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,030
I even asked whether you were a professional in this field.

1037
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,800
I didn't expect that

1038
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,510
you would remember it so clearly.

1039
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,390
Yes.

1040
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,280
Now that I'm talking with you, I remember everything.

1041
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,880
I remember that

1042
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,440
you did very well in biology.

1043
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,880
You once didn't get a full mark

1044
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,000
in the final exam.

1045
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,280
You were upset for so long that day.

1046
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,480
Now that you're a forensic doctor,

1047
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,440
you can exert

Emergency hammer is also called safety hammer.

1133
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,010
They're usually found

1134
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:33,010
by the windows of buses and subways.

1135
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:35,640
How do we use a safety hammer correctly when we're trapped

1136
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,930
in a vehicle in an emergency?

1137
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,200
Pick up the hammer.

1138
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,090
Hammer the four corners of a toughened glass.

1139
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,610
Don't hammer the middle part.

1140
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,250
The middle part is the firmest area,

1141
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,770
and it's not easy to break it and escape through the window.

1142
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,090
If the glass doesn't fall immediately after it's broken,

1143
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:49,770
we can kick it open with our feet.

1144
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,770
After the glass falls, jump out of the vehicle in an orderly manner

1145
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,090
and go to a safe place.

1146
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,260
