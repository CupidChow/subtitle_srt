1
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,400
Remove it.

2
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,680
It's empty.

3
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,680
How come it's empty?

4
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,240
Chun, what are you doing?

5
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,190
What are you thinking about?

6
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,750
If it was lost later,

7
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,310
that means

8
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,240
nothing went wrong

9
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,190
before the burial.

10
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,240
Where could it have gone?

11
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,120
What are you...

12
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,079
talking about, Chun?

13
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,030
Pai,

14
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,960
let me ask you a question.

15
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,120
If we lost a body

16
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,750
from our mortuary,

17
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,750
where do you think it would end up?

18
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,680
Impossible.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,079
Our management is too strict for that.

20
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,240
I mean if.

21
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,030
Well,

22
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,870
if it's missing from somewhere,

23
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,520
naturally, it'll show up somewhere else.

24
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,560
And if it shows up somewhere else,

25
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
it must be missing from where it should be.

26
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,680
You've done well.

27
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,360
Let's go.

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,560
Chun, wait for me.

29
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,190
Here's what you asked for,

30
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,120
the cremation records

31
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,310
for August 2003.

32
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,430
Thank you.

33
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,120
Thanks.

34
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,750
You're welcome.

35
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,910
Deputy Marshal Gu?

36
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,120
We opened the grave,

37
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,190
but didn't find

38
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
He Runian's remains.

39
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,030
Let's set aside possibilities like dismemberment,

40
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,310
body dumping, or burial for now.

41
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,520
I guess

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,910
He Runian's body

43
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,310
was sent to the funeral home

44
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,190
to be cremated

45
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,240
as an unidentified corpse.

46
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,430
And I've already checked

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,630
the funeral home's records.

48
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,560
Within a month after He Runian's death,

49
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,560
the police sent three unidentified bodies

50
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,750
to the funeral home

51
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,630
for cremation.

52
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,590
The first two

53
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,000
were both sent

54
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,030
by the same officer,

55
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,150
who was in charge

56
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,520
of handling such matters

57
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,560
at that time.

58
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,030
The last one,

59
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,840
however, was sent there

60
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,150
by Gu Nuo, Deputy Marshal.

61
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,280
I know.

62
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,430
Jin Chun.

63
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,040
This matter ends here

64
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,120
for you.

65
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,680
Chief Wu, this...

66
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,830
I know what you want to say,

67
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,190
but this matter

68
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,430
must be kept absolutely confidential.

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,630
Stay out of it

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,480
from now on.

71
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,950
Remember what I said.

72
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,270
You must not tell Xu Tongsheng.

73
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,870
But this matter...

74
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,600
That's an order.

75
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,310
Yes,

76
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,159
Chief Wu.

77
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,720
Han Jun has been handling

78
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,950
the assets of Han Group.

79
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,070
They're currently selling the Ducheng Processing Factory.

80
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,240
Among the four companies interested in buying it,

81
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,390
three are fine.

82
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,470
But one of them, upon investigation, is linked to Gao Weiyuan.

83
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,430
Come on, time to eat.

84
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,870
Dad.

85
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,190
I haven't seen you

86
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,830
playing Go with the uncles downstairs

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,560
lately.

88
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,870
You used to play all the time.

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,120
I've lost interest.

90
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,720
I might as well

91
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
spend that time coming up

92
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,120
with new dishes for you.

93
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,560
Here.

94
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,190
Try these newly marinated

95
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,680
chicken feet.

96
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,040
See if they're good.

97
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,120
Give me a hand.

98
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,360
He Runian's grave is empty.

99
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,750
Jin Chun looked into it.

100
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,800
It's highly likely that Gu Nuo

101
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,190
had the body cremated

102
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,160
as an unidentified corpse.

103
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,310
Dad.

104
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,000
There's no soup.

105
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,560
I planned to make

106
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,630
mushroom and pork rib soup,

107
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,000
but I couldn't find good ribs.

108
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,120
Tomorrow.

109
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll make it for you tomorrow.

110
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,070
You should try this too. It's delicious.

111
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,950
Okay.

112
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,040
Not bad, huh?

113
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,270
I used brown sugar.

114
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,120
Otherwise, it wouldn't have got the color.

115
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Next time, add more chili.

116
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,920
It's not spicy enough.

117
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Add more chili next time.

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,070
You want more?

119
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,720
Yes, more.

120
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,750
Add a lot more.

121
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,480
I already put some. Still not enough?

122
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,950
Okay.

123
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll add more next time.

124
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,160
I was worried you might get heaty.

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,120
Chief Chang,

126
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,310
this is the full account of the case.

127
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,159
One month

128
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,560
after He Runian's body,

129
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,750
his body was cremated.

130
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,070
If that's really the case,

131
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,270
20 years ago,

132
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,390
they were already covering for each other

133
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,430
on something like this.

134
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,630
That speaks volumes

135
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,750
about their relationship.

136
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,070
The two of them must have known each other

137
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,480
since their youth,

138
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,680
or even childhood.

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,950
Look into their past generations

140
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,000
and childhood connections.

141
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
We must figure out

142
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,830
their relationship.

143
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,680
-Yes.
-Yes.

144
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:00,870
Come on.

145
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,480
Chun.

146
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,600
Why didn't you call me?

147
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,000
Take a break first.

148
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,670
I saw you were practicing boxing,

149
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,480
so I didn't want to interrupt.

150
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,440
You must have been waiting long.

151
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,030
No.

152
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,910
I just arrived.

153
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,240
But Senior,

154
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,320
you're really good.

155
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,790
You should go easy on me later.

156
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,750
Are you kidding me?

157
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,840
You should be the one going easy on me.

158
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,630
Why don't you go get changed first?

159
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,670
I'll wait for you here.

160
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,200
Okay.

161
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,270
I'm going to get changed.

162
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay.

163
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,630
Stand shoulder-width apart.

164
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,000
Right.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,630
Then shift your weight

166
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,840
to the center of both feet.

167
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,510
Right.

168
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,120
Then, your rear hand—

169
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,510
place it like this. Right.

170
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,670
Keep this part protected. Good.

171
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,440
Forward. Forward.

172
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,390
Rear punch.

173
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,120
Rear punch.

174
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,510
When you throw the rear punch...

175
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,120
Come on, again!

176
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,960
Kick, come on!

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,630
Boxing is really stress-relieving.

178
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,240
I should have started earlier.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Yeah.

180
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,150
I noticed

181
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,320
every punch you threw

182
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,030
had so much force.

183
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,320
The target was right there.

184
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,000
All I needed to do was

185
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,080
hitting it with all my strength.

186
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,120
Unlike some things,

187
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,080
where I don't even know where to put my effort.

188
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,510
What's wrong?

189
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,750
Is it something

190
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,440
unpleasant at work?

191
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,960
Not really.

192
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,270
It's nothing.

193
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Well, if it's work,

194
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,120
just get it done.

195
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,550
Don't overthink it.

196
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,510
You're right, Senior.

197
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,670
Actually, there's something

198
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,390
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.

199
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,270
But I never knew

200
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,480
how to say it.

201
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,270
Don't blame me for being too straightforward.

202
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,030
I really don't think being a forensic doctor

203
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,480
suits you.

204
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,320
When I woke up

205
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,510
in the hospital

206
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,120
and saw you,

207
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,670
I felt

208
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,630
you were

209
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,840
so...

210
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,510
so... so...

211
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,150
so different from before.

212
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,960
I remember you

213
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
were full of energy,

214
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,630
thoughtful,

215
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,120
someone who could bring

216
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,030
vitality and happiness

217
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,670
to the people around you,

218
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,390
a sunny

219
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,750
woman.

220
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,840
I thought you would choose a career

221
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,910
where you interact with people,

222
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,750
or something like that.

223
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,750
I never expected

224
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,790
you'd choose

225
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,440
to become a forensic doctor.

226
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,120
Senior, I've never

227
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,750
really thought

228
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,720
about what you just said.

229
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,270
Being a forensic doctor

230
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,600
is very meaningful.

231
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,030
It's about

232
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,790
speaking for the dead.

233
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,840
I don't just want to know

234
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,000
what happened to them

235
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,080
in their final moments.

236
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,550
I also want to know everything

237
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,870
that happened before their death.

238
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,840
I see.

239
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,320
You are

240
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,030
just too empathetic,

241
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,480
and you have a strong sense of responsibility.

242
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,840
Actually, you really don't have to

243
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,670
put so much pressure on yourself.

244
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,200
It's alright.

245
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,000
My job is fine.

246
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,240
Yeah, your job is fine.

247
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,150
The biggest problem now is

248
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,670
you have no outlet

249
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,840
for all the heavy emotions

250
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,600
weighing you down.

251
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,750
Isn't that right?

252
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,550
You need to learn to love yourself.

253
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,910
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,270
I might have said too much.

255
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,910
Since you're here,

256
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,720
put aside all the unpleasant things

257
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,960
for now.

258
00:13:59,270 --> 00:13:59,870
Let's practice a bit more.

259
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,080
Okay.

260
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,150
Let's go.

261
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,360
Back in school,

262
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,320
from what I observed of you,

263
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,200
I really thought

264
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,550
you would become a teacher.

265
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,440
What made you think so?

266
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,960
Because I felt you

267
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,840
were suitable for dealing with people.

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,630
You're kind,

269
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
and always considerate of others.

270
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,910
Anyway, in short,

271
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,080
you give people

272
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,000
this kind of feeling.

273
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,870
You know what? It's like

274
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,440
your world is filled with

275
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,440
goodness.

276
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,630
Really.

277
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,080
Senior,

278
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,720
you think too highly of me.

279
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,120
No, I mean it.

280
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,910
I truly envy you

281
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,030
for that feeling.

282
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,750
Unlike me,

283
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,870
growing up in this kind of family.

284
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,200
Really.

285
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Forget it.

286
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,510
Every family has a skeleton in the closet.

287
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,790
Every family

288
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,910
has its happy moments

289
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,200
and its tough times.

290
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,440
That's true.

291
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,960
But I think you must have grown up

292
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,840
in a good environment.

293
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,480
I grew up

294
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,360
in a welfare house.

295
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,080
Because my mother is

296
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,320
the dean of the welfare house.

297
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,080
It was a really loving place.

298
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,150
Because my mother needed to

299
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,320
take care of many children.

300
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,510
And I was one of them.

301
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,200
We all grew up together.

302
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,390
So,

303
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,870
I've always felt

304
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,200
my mother is

305
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,390
a very kind

306
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,030
and great person.

307
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,240
If that's the case,

308
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,240
when you were little,

309
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,510
your mother didn't have

310
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,440
much time for you.

311
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,840
She was too busy.

312
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,550
So your dad must have been the one

313
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,510
handling your daily life

314
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,480
and studies, right?

315
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,320
Senior,

316
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,600
you're spot on.

317
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,600
How did you know?

318
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,600
Basically, it was always my dad who accompanied me.

319
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,550
There was a funny joke

320
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
when I was little.

321
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,790
Back in school,

322
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,720
all my classmates

323
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,270
thought I only had a father

324
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,200
and no mother.

325
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,720
Because they had never seen her.

326
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,240
It was always my dad

327
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,390
attending parent-teacher meetings

328
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,000
and handling everything for me.

329
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,030
So they all thought

330
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,870
I didn't have a mother.

331
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,910
It was really hilarious.

332
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,750
I really didn't expect that.

333
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,000
But I couldn't tell at all.

334
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
You always leave

335
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,080
a very healthy

336
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,630
and sunny impression.

337
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,150
No wonder back in school,

338
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,600
I felt like everyone

339
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,840
liked you very much.

340
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,030
No.

341
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,960
Who told you that?

342
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,510
Do I need someone to tell me that?

343
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,270
My car is over there.

344
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,080
I'm leaving.

345
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,320
Let's leave it here for today.

346
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,080
-I'm going back.
-Okay.

347
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,630
Okay.

348
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,630
Be careful.

349
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,550
Bye bye.

350
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,120
Bye bye.

351
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,790
Hello, Danning.

352
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,480
What's up?

353
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,510
Hello, Chun.

354
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,150
I'm sorry.

355
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,080
I don't think I can have a meal with you tomorrow.

356
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,910
I recently took on a very important case.

357
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,270
It's a bit tricky.

358
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,720
No problem.

359
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,750
Focus on your work.

360
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,600
Work is important.

361
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,840
This one is on me.

362
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,600
Once I wrap up this case,

363
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,600
I'll treat you to a feast.

364
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,480
Okay.

365
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,750
I'll wait for your good news.

366
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,680
Okay.

367
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,720
Chun, you're back.

368
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,480
Good morning, Mr. Hu.

369
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,400
Come in.

370
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,590
You're here.

371
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,680
Have a seat.

372
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,110
There's water over there. Help yourself.

373
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,400
It's fine. Don't mind me.

374
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,790
What's up?

375
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,070
You're still

376
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,200
reading books about autism?

377
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,160
The books

378
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,070
are full of terminology.

379
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,200
It's quite difficult to understand them.

380
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,920
So I'm reading slowly.

381
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,070
It's hard to understand, right?

382
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,030
Every field has its experts.

383
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,640
Some things

384
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,640
should be left to the professionals.

385
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,440
Right?

386
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,160
We don't want

387
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,590
Haoyu's condition to be delayed. Right?

388
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,200
That's why I'm anxious.

389
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,350
Look, I've filled

390
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,240
half a notebook with notes.

391
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,480
And I've finished reading these books.

392
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,200
I've completed

393
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,680
Haoyu's transfer procedures

394
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,510
at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

395
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,880
All the paperwork has been submitted.

396
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,960
I've also found a welfare house for her.

397
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,000
It's very good, just nearby.

398
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,550
Who told you to make decisions for me?

399
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,880
When did I ever say

400
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,110
I wanted Haoyu transferred?

401
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,680
You did this.

402
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,680
Go fix it.

403
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,960
Cancel everything.

404
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,400
It can't be canceled.

405
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,640
They're already working on it.

406
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,350
If you miss her,

407
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,550
you can visit her anytime.

408
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,680
I specially chose

409
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,750
a place nearby.

410
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,550
It's just a short walk away. It's very convenient.

411
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,310
I don't need that!

412
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,720
Didn't I tell you this?

413
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,750
Haoyu is not going anywhere.

414
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,640
She stays here with me.

415
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,070
I can cure her.

416
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:47,680
Mom,

417
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,640
why are you being

418
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,880
so stubborn about this?

419
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,070
Right now,

420
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,680
transferring Haoyu

421
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,350
is the best choice for both you and her.

422
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,640
I don't need you to convince me.

423
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,310
Are you done here?

424
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,240
Leave now.

425
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,160
I'll pretend you never came today.

426
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,590
And don't ever bring this up again.

427
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,030
It's too late.

428
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,720
They should be here any moment.

429
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,200
Who is it?

430
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,160
Dean.

431
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,510
Come in.

432
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,830
Dean,

433
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,790
this is

434
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,000
Dean Zhang from the Xishan Lake Welfare House.

435
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,510
This is Director Wang from the Civil Affairs Bureau.

436
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,510
Hello, Dean Zeng.

437
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,070
Hello.

438
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,920
We're here today to pick up

439
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,480
a child named Shi Haoyu.

440
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,350
Haoyu.

441
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,510
This is Haoyu.

442
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,640
These are some of her things—

443
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,270
tools, stationery,

444
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,400
and her favorite items.

445
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,590
She has a pink water bottle

446
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,030
with...

447
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,310
a white bow on it.

448
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,400
She made it herself.

449
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,030
Did you pack it for her?

450
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,880
Yes.

451
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,350
Dean Zeng, don't worry.

452
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,030
Haoyu.

453
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,400
What's wrong?

454
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,030
Get in the car.

455
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,880
Go see her off.

456
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,480
Come back after she arrives there.

457
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,720
Otherwise, she'll be scared.

458
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,720
Okay.

459
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,030
Thank you.

460
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,070
Please take good care of her.

461
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,200
Thank you.

462
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,880
Haoyu.

463
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,240
I'll visit you, okay?

464
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,830
Stay strong.

465
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,920
Hello?

466
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,640
A-Adviser Xu.

467
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,200
It's me.

468
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,000
At 9 p.m. tonight,

469
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,790
I want to take you somewhere

470
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,480
a-and show you something.

471
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,790
J-Just come

472
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,880
by yourself.

473
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,920
Are you sure

474
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,240
we can do it at 9 p.m.?

475
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,440
Yes.

476
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,350
Every week,

477
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,590
between 9 p.m.

478
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,750
and 9:30 p.m. on this night,

479
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
t-they change shifts.

480
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,880
T-This time

481
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,030
works.

482
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,240
Got it.

483
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,110
They're heading there.

484
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,070
Do you know how to drive?

485
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,030
This is my new car!

486
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,480
You have to pay for this!

487
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,240
Well, sir, are you alright?

488
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,310
Well, I'm a police officer.

489
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,480
How about this?

490
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,590
I'll give you my contact information.

491
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,830
Then you can report this to the traffic police.

492
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,590
Let them determine whose responsibility it is.

493
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,590
-I...
-What do you mean?

494
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,550
You want to leave?

495
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,160
You can't!

496
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:21,830
If you leave,

497
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,750
who should I talk to?

498
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,750
I'm on a mission.

499
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,590
My head hurts. It hurts.

500
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,830
My head hurts.

501
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,550
Alright, alright.

502
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,270
I won't leave.

503
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,640
Let me make a phone call, okay?

504
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,830
My head hurts.

505
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,830
My head hurts.

506
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,270
Hello, Captain Shen.

507
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,960
I lost track of Adviser Xu.

508
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:40,880
Danggui.

509
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,680
Locate

510
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,310
Adviser Xu's position immediately.

511
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,200
Follow my plan.

512
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,880
You guys come quickly too.

513
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,400
This is it.

514
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,880
This is it.

515
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,720
This.

516
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,510
This is what we've been doing.

517
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,550
This is it.

518
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,830
I see.

519
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:58,790
Yes.

520
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,720
There's no signal.

521
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,640
The signal must have been jammed.

522
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,590
Fan Yi!

523
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,270
Hurry up!

524
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,000
There's a bomb!

525
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,880
Get out now!

526
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,790
Xu Tongsheng!

527
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,680
Fan Yi!

528
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,590
Go check how much time

529
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,680
is left on the bomb!

530
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,000
Xu Tongsheng!

531
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,440
Xu Tongsheng!

532
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,280
Xu!

533
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,670
Xu! Xu!

534
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,000
Shen Ye?

535
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:51,840
Open the door!

536
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,670
There's a bomb inside!

537
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,630
Give me the axe!

538
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
30 seconds!

539
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,840
Only 30 seconds left!

540
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,230
Shen Ye, there's no time!

541
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,110
Listen to me!

542
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,360
They've been making drugs!

543
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,360
The drug-making equipment is inside!

544
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,280
If I die,

545
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,440
you must continue the investigation for me!

546
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,230
Go now!

547
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,230
I won't leave you behind again.

548
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,070
Step back!

549
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,440
Go now!

550
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,000
Xu, run!

551
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,440
Fan Yi, run!

552
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,030
Run!

553
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,070
Run!

554
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,190
Xu.

555
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,760
Xu.

556
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,150
Is anyone here?

557
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,230
Is anyone here?

558
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,360
-Stop!
-Stop!

559
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,360
Stop.

560
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:39,920
Move!

561
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,960
-Move!
-Move!

562
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,510
Mr. Xu.

563
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,760
How are they?

564
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,400
Captain Shen is in good condition.

565
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,630
However, Adviser Xu

566
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,880
has fallen into a deep coma.

567
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,920
His condition is critical.

568
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,840
What should we do?

569
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,110
We'll see after going back to the hospital.

570
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,960
Captain Shen.

571
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:44,920
Are you alright now?

572
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,480
Danggui.

573
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,230
Where is Adviser Xu?

574
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,480
Adviser Xu just came out of the emergency room.

575
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,880
He's still unconscious.

576
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,400
What about Fan Yi?

577
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,550
Fan Yi is already dead.

578
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,760
When will the family of the patient in Bed 2 arrive?

579
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,030
Soon.

580
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,070
Come to me when he arrives.

581
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,920
Uncle Shen will be here soon.

582
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,190
The skin all over his body is stripped away,

583
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,360
with abrasions and contusions.

584
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,280
His right leg is clearly fractured.

585
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,710
My initial assessment is

586
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,480
he should be crushed to death.

587
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,190
Take the body back.

588
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:13,710
What's wrong?

589
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,070
Adviser Xu isn't here,

590
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,280
so you can't focus on your work?

591
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,150
I wonder how Idol

592
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,000
is now.
