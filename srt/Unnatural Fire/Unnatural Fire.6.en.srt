21
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,910
If Mr. Jia hit her,

22
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,210
it must be because

23
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,520

43
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,920
Jia Sanmeng is the classic type—

After that, he'd kneel on the ground,

seeking forgiveness

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,880

He wouldn't get up

until he heard

58

Qin Qing say,

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,280
"I forgive you".

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
But deep down, he was certain

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,150
Qin Qing would forgive him.

00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,560
He knew Qin Qing was soft-hearted.

198
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,320
against Qin Qing.

199
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,720
But according to her mother's testimony,

200
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,390
and from everything

201
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,360
Qin Qing posted

202
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,390
on social media,

203
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,840
she never told anyone about it.

204
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,080
So maybe she wished

205
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,790
that one day,

206
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,960
you'd stop hurting her.

207
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,960
Unfortunately, her wish didn't come true.

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,670
What?

209
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,270
You've been influenced by Ye Meng?

210
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,360
You're starting to tell stories?

211
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,030
According to

212
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,000
the autopsy report,

213
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,360
wounds are all over

214
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,390
Qin Qing's body.

215
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,840
Especially three months ago.

216
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,080
Guys, the livestreaming show is over.

217
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,870
Actually, you don't have any confidence in this, do you?

218
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,870
I'm also from Beixun.

219
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,630
Can we meet?

220
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,040
[Xing]

221
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,520
[Xing]

222
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,550
Alright.

223
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,510
I'm done, Honey.

224
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,120
We can rest now.

225
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,600
Why?

226
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,380
[Can we meet? I want to take you somewhere.]

227
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,380
[You don't have any confidence in this, do you? I'm also from Beixun.]

228
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,750
Why did you chat

229
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,080
so intimately with this person?

230
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
You even exchanged your phone numbers.

231
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,210
No.

232
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,710
Honey, let me explain.

233
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,110
This person...

234
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,870
This person is just my fan.

235
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,580
It's not what you think.

236
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,910
Why can't you

237
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,150
behave yourself?

238
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,750
Honey, don't hit me!

239
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,800
Don't hit me!

240
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,960
But what you didn't expect was

241
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,190
Qin Qing memorized that account.

242
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,580
Although you deleted it,

243
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,390
she still went to meet

244
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,150
that person.

245
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,720
And the place that person took her to

246
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,790
was an anti-domestic violence seminar.

247
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,750
According to the law,

248
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,640
domestic violence is not a family matter.

249
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,570
Opposing domestic violence

250
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,600
is a shared responsibility

251
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,480
of the country,

252
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,630
society, and every family.

253
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,440
Abusers like

254
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,870
to keep things

255
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,240
within their control.

256
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,510
And they treat the people closest to them

257
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,630
as their personal property.

258
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,720
They are extremely suspicious,

259
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,120
and

260
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,360
whenever something goes wrong,

261
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,120
they think violence is the solution.

262
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,720
Sir.

263
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,120
Do... Do you need something?

264
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,240
What's going on?

265
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,720
Is he here to cause trouble?

266
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,060
Who is he?

267
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,460
What's going on?

268
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,090
What are you doing?

269
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,330
What... What are you doing?

270
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,070
What you're doing is illegal!

271
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,910
Domestic violence!

272
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,960
What should this woman do

273
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,910
when she gets home?

274
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,510
How could he do this?

275
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,020
Honey!

276
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,760
I was wrong!

277
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,770
I was wrong!

278
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,540
I was wrong!

279
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,500
Let me explain!

280
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,550
Honey, I was wrong!

281
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,150
I didn't!

282
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,670
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

283
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,240
Don't hit me!

284
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,270
Don't hit me!

285
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,480
I was wrong, okay?

286
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,010
Forgive me, okay?

287
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,000
Will you forgive me?

288
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,270
I'm not gonna stop

289
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,240
until you say you forgive me.

290
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,510
Will you forgive me?

291
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,670
I was wrong, okay?

292
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,390
Will you forgive me?

293
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,250
I was wrong!

294
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,320
I was wrong, okay?

295
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,080
Will you forgive me?

296
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,160
I was wrong!

297
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,440
She cheated on me.

298
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,310
She was not

299
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,240
as innocent as you think.

300
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:21,960
You are

301
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,790
portraying her

302
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,400
as a perfect victim.

303
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,110
But the real victim is me.

304
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,000
She cheated on me.

305
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,590
That private message account

306
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,030
and the phone number

307
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,240
you just mentioned

308
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,400
are evidence of her cheating.

309
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,400
Yes.

310
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,880
And that so-called seminar or whatever

311
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,350
I don't want to hear the most.

312
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,960
That man tricked her

313
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,830
into going.

314
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,160
A man and a woman having an affair

315
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,550
won't end well.

316
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,310
Jia Sanmeng is not home now.

317
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,510
He went out.

318
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,480
I'll be right there.

319
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,900
I still think

320
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,000
you should leave him immediately.

321
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,280
No.

322
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,270
You said

323
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,590
I don't have any evidence right now.

324
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,940
That's why I have to go back.

325
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,160
It's been so many years.

326
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,030
This time,

327
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,750
I must make him pay the price.

328
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,640
Qin Qing,

329
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,190
he's the type who can be extreme.

330
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,590
Try not to do anything drastic.

331
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay.

332
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,750
During the time she was cheating,

333
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,830
every single second

334
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,840
she spent at home

335
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,830
made me feel very disgusted.

336
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,160
You're back.

337
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,960
Honey, you're home.

338
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,150
I noticed

339
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,920
you were out for quite a while,

340
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,160
and I got a little worried.

341
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,300
Where did you go?

342
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,420
I went to the market to buy vegetables.

343
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,380
It was pretty crowded today.

344
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,790
I'm going to cook for you.

345
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,720
Okay.

346
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,350
As soon as she got home,

347
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,920
she put on an act.

348
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,920
She smiled at me

349
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,310
and even cooked for me

350
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
with her dirty hands.

351
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,070
Now,

352
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,790
she even fabricated these so-called evidence

353
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,110
in an attempt to frame me.

354
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,030
Just based on those,

355
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,310
you're sure she cheated on you?

356
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,410
Don't you think she was quite successful

357
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,790
as a streamer?

358
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,680
How many men

359
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,720
did she seduce every day,

360
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,960
flaunting herself like that?

361
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,550
She thought she found some gullible fool,

362
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,550
but in the end?

363
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,590
It won't end well.

364
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,920
But the person who helped her

365
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,110
was a woman.

366
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,680
The person who sent her private messages

367
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,240
was a woman

368
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,070
called Zheng Xingxing.

369
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,110
Hello.

370
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,340
[Recording]

371
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,070
I'm Jin Chun

372
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,200
who contacted you before.

373
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,000
You told me on the phone

374
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,160
Jia Sanmeng has been abusing Qin Qing.

375
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,650
Is that true?

376
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,280
I've known Qin Qing

377
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,510
for over a year.

378
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,960
I'm well aware of everything

379
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,690
she's been through this past year.

380
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,750
Qing, you're hurt again?

381
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,350
I bumped into something by accident.

382
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,960
Domestic violence happens either never or endlessly.

383
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,110
Qing, you must see things clearly.

384
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,830
You work so hard.

385
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,400
Don't let anyone else drag you down.

386
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,070
My husband isn't like what you think.

387
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,720
He's usually really nice to me.

00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,710
You're having an allergic reaction?

773
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,640
What did you eat for dinner?

774
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,980
Don't mention it. I had some dumplings

775
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:03,710
stuffed with three delicacies.

776
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,400
I didn't notice that they had shrimps.

gives me enough to worry about,

779
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,630
and now I gotta worry about

780
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,760
w-what you eat too?

781
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,280
I told you that you...

782
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,710
you can't eat outside.

783
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,240
You should eat what I cook.

784
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,040
Come and sit here.

785
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,590
I'll apply some ointment for you.

786
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,600
Why did you

787
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,810
have to eat dumplings stuffed

788
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,030
with three delicacies?

789
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,920
Who ordered the dumplings?

790
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,520
Li Danggui

791
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,150
knows

792
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,440
you are allergic to shrimps, right?

793
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,320
Dad, it wasn't Danggui.

794
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,960
My colleagues from the Fire Investigation Department ordered them.

795
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,880
They didn't know.

796
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,510
The Fire Investigation Department?

797
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,280
Why have you been so close to those

798
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,110
from the Fire Investigation Department recently?

00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,670

I'll get you some water. Take some medicine.

804
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,510
Got it.

Adviser Xu, you came.

835
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,400
We couldn't get in at all.

So far, we've confirmed

839
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,480
two deceased people inside.

840
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,670
They were an elderly couple.

841
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,380
The man's surname is Ying, and the woman's surname is Zhang.

842

843

the fire breaking out?

It was too late.

847
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:07,800
By the time it was noticed,

848
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,550
the fire was already out of control.

00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,230

851
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,290

852

Hydrogen is a type of flammable and explosive gas.

879
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,680
It can combust or explode when exposed to an open flame,

high temperatures, or even static electricity.

Once it combusts or explodes,

it can cause serious burns or scalds to individuals.

Please do not place hydrogen-filled balloons in closed spaces like cars.
