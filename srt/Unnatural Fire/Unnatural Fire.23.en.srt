Now for Haoyu,

195
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,370
the best solution

196
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,370
is to help her find

197
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,760
a welfare house that can provide

198
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,400
professional treatment for autistic children

199
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,650
and then transfer her there as soon as possible.

200
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,720
What are you talking about?

201
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,940
Haoyu is sick now.

202
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,600
Where do you want me to transfer her to?

203
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,630
Didn't you hear what the doctor

204
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,690
said just now?

205
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,620
Haoyu is not young anymore.

206
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,540
She needs professional treatment.

207
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,190
I'm not saying that your place is not good.

208
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,220
It's just not suitable for Haoyu now.

209
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,650
I heard everything the doctor said.

210
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,470
The doctor told me to face her condition

211
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,400
positively and optimistically.

212
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,900
The doctor also gave me a book

213
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,750
to teach me how to accompany and treat her.

214
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,120
The doctor didn't even say a word about

215
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,150
transferring her away.

216
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,360
The doctor didn't ask you to

217
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,690
transfer her away indeed.

218
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,970
But look at your welfare house.

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,220
With so many children,

220
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,900
do you have that much time and energy

221
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,210
to focus entirely on Haoyu?

222
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,910
Of course I do.

223
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,940
No, you don't.

224
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,970
What's more, you're just starting to

225
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,420
learn it and read the books now.

226
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,070
How long will this process take?

227
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,150
By that time, Haoyu's disease

228
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,980
won't be cured,

229
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,500
and you'll even be exhausted.

230
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,250
Yes, I do.

231
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,180
I have time.

232
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,040
I have energy.

233
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,110
I also have determination.

234
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,550
I will definitely cure her.

235
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,070
Mom, this is not a small matter.

236
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,600
This is a very big issue.

237
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,750
This concerns Haoyu's decades of life

238
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,440
in the future.

239
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,510
Don't try to scare me.

240
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,720
She is my child.

241
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,750
How can I not think

242
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,650
about her future?

243
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,260
You're really stubborn.

244
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,570
I can understand your persistence.

245
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,760
But this kind of persistence

246
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,080
may not be good for Haoyu.

247
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,840
If you had really understood,

248
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,040
you wouldn't have said such things.

249
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,790
Hello?

250
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,020
Okay. I'll be right there.

251
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,830
Think about it carefully.

252
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,960
You should be the one to think about it carefully.

253
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,250
Dad, I'm back.

254
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,870
You're back, Ye.

255
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,090
Come on. Come on. Let's eat.

256
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,500
Coming.

257
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,080
So we'll eat fried rice today?

258
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,180
Dad, this...

259
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,720
My blood pressure became high again,

260
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,850
so I didn't make any stir-fried dishes.

261
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,860
Just make do with this.

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,600
Then shall I

263
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,860
take you to the hospital?

264
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,610
No need.

265
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,550
I've just taken my medicine.

266
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,550
Xu Tongsheng got injured.

267
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,780
He's in the hospital now.

268
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,750
Let's eat.

269
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,720
Let me tell you.

270
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,270
You can't be

271
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,640
[Got it.]

272
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,590
careless about this matter.

273
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:25,850
Have you forgotten this?

274
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,630
Last time,

275
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,100
when you fell, I was so worried.

276
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,530
Don't mention last time.

277
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,290
I also didn't take it seriously last time.

278
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:33,750
Don't worry.

279
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,080
I won't make you worry again.

280
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,470
Why are you eating so much rice again?

281
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,410
Let me take some away from you.

282
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,330
How about this? After you finish eating,

283
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,710
go inside your room to check your blood pressure again.

284
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,670
The plan failed.

285
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,430
He's injured and is in the hospital.

286
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,590
It's okay.

287
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,910
Try harder next time.

288
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,020
Your student didn't do well in the exam?

289
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,970
He's sad.

290
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,540
It was really so dangerous.

291
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,150
When they called me,

292
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,310
I was almost scared to death.

293
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,500
Do you know what they said?

294
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,360
It missed your head by only this much.

295
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,870
Luckily, it just hit your back.

296
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,290
What if it had hit your head?

297
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,730
Be careful when you go out in the future.

298
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,140
Would you like some fruits?

299
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,110
No, thanks.

300
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,790
Don't bother.

301
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,500
Fortunately, that worker who fell

302
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,630
was wearing a safety harness.

303
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,030
Otherwise, there would have been a serious accident today.

304
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,740
Tongsheng.

305
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,640
I know that recently,

306
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,090
many things have happened.

307
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,000
You're not in a good state,

308
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,110
and your mood isn't good, either.

309
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,150
But look.

310
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,830
You even had an accident while walking in the street.

311
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,200
You have to be more careful

312
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,120
and take good care of yourself.

313
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,690
Understand?

314
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,510
The doctor has just said that

315
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,410
your injury is not serious.

316
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,540
You can be discharged in two days.

317
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,280
But you still need to rest well.

318
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,500
Just go back.

319
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,970
Then I'll leave first.

320
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,200
If anything happens,

321
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,240
call me immediately.

322
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,340
Rest early.

323
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,810
Was it an accident?

324
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,600
That's not right.

325
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,780
That's not right.

326
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,810
We've been investigating the case outside all day.

327
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,150
We didn't find anything unusual.

328
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,000
We've finished interrogating the worker, Qin Shun.

329
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,650
He said he didn't notice that

330
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,730
the plank was loose.

331
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,950
He accidentally stepped on the empty space

332
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,120
and even fell down himself.

333
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,130
He was terrified.

334
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,150
What about the surveillance footage?

335
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,390
The surveillance cameras didn't cover

336
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,070
the position where he was at that time.

337
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,220

338
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,530

382
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,750
Let's continue.

383
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,440
How many?

384
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,650
Small Six!

385
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,190
Who is it?

386
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,130
Police.

387
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,520
Hello, Ma'am.

388
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,450
I'm a police officer.

389
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,190
There's something I'd like to ask you about.

390
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,110
Keep your voice down.

391
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,650
My grandson has just fallen asleep.

392
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,360
Ma'am, here's the thing.

393
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,960
This afternoon,

394
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,880
across from your home,

395
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,690
during construction,

396
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,610
a worker dropped something,

397
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,780
which injured a passerby.

398
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,590
Did you see that?

399
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,280
Y-Yes, I did.

400
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,790
It looked quite frightening.

401
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,780
That's great.

402
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,450
May I come in

403
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,610
so that we can talk about more details?

404
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,710
You... You...

405
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,720
It's alright, Ma'am.

406
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,030
We can talk here if you prefer.

407
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,640
Well, they've been working at this construction site

408
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,410
for quite a long time.

409
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,520
I often saw them staying up there

410
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,650
and walking back and forth.

411
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,910
It looked quite frightening.

412
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,680
But today,

413
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,040
I just feel that there was something odd about this incident.

414
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,210
Something odd?

415
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,540
Could you please elaborate on that?

416
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,760
A few planks fell down after he

417
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,750
stepped on them, right?

418
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,110
Just before those planks fell,

419
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,500
I saw him walking

420
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,800
back and forth

421
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,160
on those planks several times.

422
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,310
He seemed to stamp his feet on them a few times, too.

423
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,470
Soon after that,

424
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,610
I saw him stamp his feet

425
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,790
hard on those planks.

426
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,930
Then the planks and the...

427
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,790
paint buckets and other items

428
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,520
fell down with a bang.

429
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,170
It scared me so much that

430
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,310
I got stunned.

431
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,940
So you mean

432
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,710
this worker did it on purpose?

433
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,960
I'm not sure.

434
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,130
Didn't he fall down too?

435
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,910
But

436
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,750
I just feel that

437
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,440
there was something odd about what happened today.

438
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,340
Ma'am,

439
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,920
what you've told me is very important.

440
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,830
Would it be convenient for you

441
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,210
to come with me now

442
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,610
to provide a statement in the police station?

443
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,570
Now?

444
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,270
It's too late.

445
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,160
My grandson has to sleep now,

446
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,020
and I'll need to take him to school tomorrow morning.

447
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,740
It won't take too long.

448
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:11,790
I understand.

449
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,450
It's just to provide a statement, right?

450
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,200
Well,

451
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,930
can't I do that another day?

452
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,770
How about this? Tomorrow morning,

453
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,320
after I take my grandson

454
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,930
to school,

455
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,030
you can just go to

456
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,790
the school

457
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,430
and pick me up at the school gate.

458
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,300
Alright.

459
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,190
How about this?

460
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,070
Ma'am, please tell me

461
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,890
the school's address.

462
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,010

Thank you.

468
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,920
I'm sorry.

469
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,550
It's okay.

470
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,270
It's just me at home.

471

But it's too late now.

She can only provide her statement

479
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,970
at the police station tomorrow morning.

480
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,390

Fire safety inspections of factories.

951
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,120
A factory is usually full of staff

952
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,060
with large electricity consumption.

953
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,060
There are many combustible and flammable materials there.

954
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,260
Meanwhile, an overload of electricity usage,

955
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,870
improper use of electrical equipment,

956
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:11,900
working without certificates

957
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,390
and operations against rules are the phenomena that happen occasionally.

958
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,460
Therefore, no matter which type of factory it is,

959
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,190
fire safety inspections must be conducted regularly.

960
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,900
We should also discover potential fire hazards in time,

961
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,390
maintain fire control facilities,

962
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,740
clear combustible and flammable materials,

963
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,310
keep the evacuation passageways open

964
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:35,540
and provide fire safety training for the employees regularly

965
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,590
so that the employees can master the basic skills of firefighting,

966
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,860
self-rescue, evacuation and emergency escape.
