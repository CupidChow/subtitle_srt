[Episode 28]

3
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,420
Director Gao,

4
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,890
long time no see.

5
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,250
Gu Deman,

6
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,389
I need to ask you a favor.

7
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,120
Go to my house

8
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,880
and look for a small phone.

9
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,470
My wife knows where it is.

10
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,250
Call the third person

11
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,790
from the bottom in the contacts.

12
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,470
Wait,

13
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,329
who is this person?

14
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,890
What's your relationship with him?

15
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,390
You don't need to worry about that.

16
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,200
You don't know him,

17
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,820
but he definitely knows you.

18
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,220
What should I do

19
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,530
when I find that person?

20
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,990
Ask him for money.

21
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,829
After you get the money,

22
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,900
give it to my wife.

23
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,530
Tell my wife

24
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,340
to take my mother

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,140
and the children,

26
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,000
and leave quickly.

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,190
The farther they go, the better.

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,350
It's best if they go abroad.

29
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,620
You're like this.

30
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,880
It's all thanks to him.

31
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,330
So this matter

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,190
carries significant risk.

33
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,320
What do you mean?

34
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,110
The risk is high,

35
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,070
the difficulty is great.

36
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,620
Even if you're my employer,

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,310
I still have professional ethics.

38
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,030
I can choose to help you

39
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,500
or

40
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,480
not to help you.

41
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,360
Gu Deman,

42
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,910
you've done quite a few things for the Han Group

43
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,610
in the past, haven't you?

44
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,860
You really think I don't know?

45
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,560
If I mention just one thing,

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,390
you wouldn't feel comfortable either, would you?

47
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,240
If I were you,

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,770
I wouldn't

49
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,150
bet everything I have

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,560
on my life right now.

51
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,700
Moreover,

52
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,590
those things you mentioned

53
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,270
might not necessarily cost me my life.

54
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,600
I'll give you ten percent.

55
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,630
Twenty percent.

56
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,490
How much money are you asking for?

57
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,120
One million.

58
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,780
US dollars.

59
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,460
Go on.

60
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,950
Before that,

61
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,220
I must warn you

62
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,120
there's someone in their family

63
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,159
who's very troublesome.

64
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,520
Hello?

65
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,550
Hello?

66
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,070
This is lawyer Gu Deman.

67
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,800
It's Director Gao Weiyuan

68
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,830
who had me retrieve this phone

69
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,430
and make this call.

70
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,210
Don't worry,

71
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,409
I'm safe now.

72
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,430
Very discreet.

73
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,230
No one knows I'm contacting you.

74
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,800
Director Gao Weiyuan said...

75
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,780
In half an hour,

76
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,920
meet me at the market.

77
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,480
Gao Weiyuan has requested to see a lawyer.

78
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,800
I'm worried he might ask the lawyer

79
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,090
to negotiate terms with Shen Yi.

80
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,770
Keep a close eye on your end.

81
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,900
Report any abnormalities immediately.

82
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,410
Ye.

83
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,580
I'm going grocery shopping.

84
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,270
Let's go.

85
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,080
I'll go with you.

86
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,070
No need.

87
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,400
Just wait at home.

88
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,630
I haven't moved all day.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,730
Hurry up,

90
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,480
or the vegetables at the market

91
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,460
won't be fresh anymore.

92
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
The radishes are good.

93
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,200
Sir.

94
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,760
These are quite fresh.

95
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,860
Of course they're fresh.

96
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,900
I'll be back in a bit.

97
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,970
Hello, hello.

98
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,780
Hello, hello.

99
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,120
The vegetables are fresh.

100
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,100
Mr. Shen, today

101
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,970
your son is helping with the groceries?

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,980
Not working?

103
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,580
Mr. Shen, you're so fortunate.

104
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,920
Indeed he is.

105
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,790
Let's just say, Mr. Shen,

106
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,180
your life is

107
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,240
free from worries about food and drink,

108
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,190
and your son is filial.

109
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,800
We can't compare.

110
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,460
Yes.

111
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,750
isn't your son quite good too?

112
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,880
He helps you buy vegetables every day.

113
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,360
Madam, if you say that,

114
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:18,870
my dad will

115
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,630
buy all of these in a moment.

116
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,720
That's fine,

117
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,820
I'd be delighted.

118
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,400
Which ones are fresh?

119
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,670
The lotus root is good today.

120
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,230
It's great for stewing with pork ribs.

121
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,450
With your son back,

122
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,710
make more delicious food.

123
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,680
These greens,

124
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,780
you can stew them with some tofu at home.

125
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,440
They're very fresh.

126
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,070
Yes.

127
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:38,680
Come on.

128
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,120
It's settled then.

129
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,920
This is...

130
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:43,800
Alright.

131
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,360
Alright.

132
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,750
Okay.

133
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,050
We'll continue shopping.

134
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,900
Take care.

135
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,540
Thank you.

136
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,100
Sir.

137
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,360
Your vegetables have fallen on the ground.

138
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,370
You don't want them anymore?

139
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,530
Mr. Shen, you have come to buy groceries.

140
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,950
How about the water chestnuts?

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,640
Are they fresh?

142
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,010
Yes, they're fresh. Just arrived.

143
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,920
Let me make you some water chestnut soup.

144
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,540
Alright.

145
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,080
Okay?

146
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,920
Please weigh a pound for us.

147
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,830
Please peel them for me.

148
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,890
Sure thing.

149
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,380
That's enough, right?

150
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,630
What else would you like to eat?

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,950
Just these will do.

152
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,730
Okay, then I'll...

153
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,840
I'll go buy some meat.

154
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,680
Um...

155
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,600
Let's go together later.

156
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,580
I haven't decided what meat I want yet.

157
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,400
We'll go together after we're done here.

158
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,810
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

159
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,550
I'll make you braised pork ribs.

160
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,040
Right.

161
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,850
There were no ribs.

162
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,510
There were no good ribs.

163
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,340
They've saved some for me today.

164
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,110
Okay.

165
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,039
Um, sir,

166
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,080
add two lettuce, please.

167
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,700
To cut the grease.

168
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:36,730
Alright.

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,750
These two lettuce...

170
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,030
Yes.

171
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,840
Are on the house.

172
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,610
Mr. Shen often buys vegetables from me.

173
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,240
Is that so?

174
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,840
Thank you so much.

175
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,070
Thank you, sir.

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,610
Okay.

177
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,410
Got it.

178
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,120
Wait here.

179
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,800
Alright.

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,810
I'll meet you when I'm done.

181
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,820
Okay.

182
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,870
No rush, take your time.

183
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,150
Alright.

184
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,950
Sir,

185
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,760
where are the ribs I asked you to save for me?

186
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,530
Here they are.

187
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,470
Please cut them for me.

188
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,130
Sure thing.

189
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,720
And two chicken legs, please.

190
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,500
Okay.

191
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,540
Just a moment.

192
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,410
Sir,

193
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,610
this duck looks good.

194
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,360
You know, this duck...

195
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,240
Before it was caught,

196
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:34,790
did it know

197
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,110
that it was going to be caught?

198
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,790
What are you saying?

199
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,900
Of course it did.

200
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,970
But even a dead duck's beak is still hard.

201
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,860
It can still peck someone.

202
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,870
That's true.

203
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,670
So how can we prevent it from pecking people?

204
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,670
If its whole family

205
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,220
lives happily ever after,

206
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,030
it definitely won't peck people anymore.

207
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,030
That makes sense.

208
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,150
Sir, come here.

209
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,030
Let's weigh it.

210
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,870
See how much the duck costs.

211
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,820
Alright.

212
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,540
It's exactly fifty yuan.

213
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,320
The green ones.

214
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,110
Thirty thousand.

215
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,420
Can you give me a better price?

216
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,960
This price is already very low.

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,300
We're not making much profit here.

218
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,820
That's a life we're talking about.

219
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,970
But it's just one life.

220
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,020
It's not an ordinary duck.

221
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,940
It's a duck that kills when it pecks.

222
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,410
At least...

223
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,940
Twenty thousand.

224
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,720
Dad, are you done shopping?

225
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,250
There's still one more duck.

226
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,480
Come on, let me take that for you.

227
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,410
Do you still want this duck?

228
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,570
I'll wait for you up ahead.

229
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,110
No need to cut it.

230
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,720
Okay, no cutting. Got it.

231
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,890
I'll practice my knife skills at home.

232
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,170
Green ones.

233
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,590
Thirty thousand.

234
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,150
Can you give me a discount?

235
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,280
It's not an ordinary duck.

236
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
It's a duck that kills when it pecks.

237
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,120
At least

238
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,880
twenty thousand.

239
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,360
Chun, don't worry.

240
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,600
It's probably just the shock from the explosion,

241
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,830
causing a brief loss of consciousness.

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,630
He'll be fine once she wakes up.

243
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,810
That's great.

244
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,720
Well, if that's all,

245
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,480
I'll be going now.

246
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:56,880
Alright.

247
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,770
Thank you, senior brother.

248
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,600
If anything comes up,

249
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,600
I'll give you a call.

250
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,000
Sure thing.

251
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,570
Sorry for the trouble.

252
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:00,960
No problem.

253
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,060
A lot has happened recently.

254
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,320
No matter what you're doing now,

255
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,320
I hope you will

256
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,570
ensure your own safety.

257
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,780
Don't worry, Chun.

258
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,250
[Stay Loyal to the Party, Serve the People, Be Impartial in Law Enforcement, and Be Well-disciplined]

259
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,250
Senior,

260
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,610
what brings you here?

261
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,280
They notified me to come and sign something.

262
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,390
The case might be closing.

263
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,460
I thought I'd drop by to see you.

264
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,240
Please, have a seat.

265
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,860
Alright.

266
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,640
So you work here?

267
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,910
With what happened at the factory,

268
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,190
it must be difficult to handle, right?

269
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,290
You bet.

270
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,840
The acquisition

271
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,930
was almost finalized.

272
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,810
But now with this mess,

273
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,210
I don't know what to do anymore.

274
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,010
It is indeed quite troublesome.

275
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,200
Yeah,

276
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,760
there are a lot of issues.

277
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,270
We'll solve them one by one.

278
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,640
They'll all get resolved eventually.

279
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,050
What's wrong with you?

280
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,950
You look a bit worn out.

281
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,190
I probably haven't been resting well lately.

282
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,230
I've been at the hospital

283
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,600
taking care of Tongsheng.

284
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,070
Regarding Adviser Xu,

285
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,510
shouldn't there be

286
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,710
someone else to take care of him?

287
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,020
Like doctors and nurses in the hospital,

288
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,650
and your colleagues.

289
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,200
They wouldn't let you trouble yourself too much, right?

290
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,790
Is there something else?

291
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,260
Would you like to talk to me?

292
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,430
Maybe I can help.

293
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,750
Even if I can't,

294
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,670
just talking about it

295
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,490
might make you feel better.

296
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,720
Actually, there is

297
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,030
something else.

298
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,660
It's about my mother.

299
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,980
My mother's welfare house...

300
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,340
As an outsider, I might see things clearer.

301
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,610
What I'm about to say,

302
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,630
I believe you've probably thought about it too.

303
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,860
But from the current situation,

304
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,900
the best solution

305
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,300
is to send these children away.

306
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,390
But I'm really not sure

307
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,020
if a new environment

308
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,640
is good for those children

309
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,680
or not.

310
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,120
And I don't know

311
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,210
if the new environment

312
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,840
will be able to

313
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,120
take good care of them,

314
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,500
or if they can adapt.

315
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,150
These are all concerns.

316
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,120
Yes.

317
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,990
The developmental stages of children

318
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,370
are very important.

319
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,460
But there are too many of them,

320
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,550
and your mother indeed

321
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,890
can't take care of everyone.

322
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,850
Setting a capacity standard

323
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,990
has its reasons.

324
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,820
Overcrowding

325
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,750
is not good for the children.

326
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,070
Look at me,

327
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,510
I went abroad at eighteen

328
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,960
because I knew this home

329
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,960
wasn't the best environment for my growth.

330
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,010
Sometimes,

331
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,440
one must be brave enough to let go

332
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,960
to gain something better.

333
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,700
I'll think about it some more.

334
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,160
Alright.

335
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,400
Anyway, if you have any problems,

336
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,510
call me immediately.

337
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,480
Isn't it time?

338
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,640
You should be getting off work too.

339
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,230
Would you like to have dinner together?

340
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,310
Maybe another day.

341
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,260
Not today.

342
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,230
Why? Do you have to work overtime?

343
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,150
Don't overwork yourself.

344
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,800
I have plans to have dinner with Danning.

345
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,620
I see.

346
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Well, you two best friends

347
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,270
chatting together,

348
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,640
I'd better not intrude.

349
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,660
Let's make plans another day then.

350
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,240
Alright.

351
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:20,790
I'll be going now.

352
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,750
Okay, let me walk you out.

353
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,650
No, no, no.

354
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,570
Don't see me off.

355
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,680
I'm leaving.

356
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,870
Contact me anytime if you need anything.

357
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,360
Okay.

358
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,030
Goodbye, Senior.

359
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,610
Goodbye.

360
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,780
Danning,

361
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,460
where shall we eat tonight?

362
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,710
I'm sorry,

363
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,240
I probably can't make it again today.

364
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,900
The work I have right now

365
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,930
isn't finished yet.

366
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,360
Ms. Du,

367
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,150
we're about to order food.

368
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:47,960
What would you like to eat?

369
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,860
Don't worry about me.

370
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,710
Next time.

371
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,270
I'll definitely treat you next time.

372
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,380
Okay, I'll get back to work then.

373
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,310
Come in.

374
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,349
Chun?

375
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,890
Why are you here?

376
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,920
I heard you say

377
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
you don't even have time to eat,

378
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,510
so I rushed over to bring you food.

379
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,839
Yes.

380
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:26,880
Would you like some water?

381
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,109
No, thanks. Come sit down quickly.

382
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,050
The food will get cold soon.

383
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,080
Here.

384
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,740
It's so abundant.

385
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,970
Of course it is.

386
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,840
Why is there only one portion?

387
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,220
I'm not hungry.

388
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,770
I was also afraid you wouldn't have time

389
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,640
to eat slowly with me.

390
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,620
You really know me well.

391
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,060
But honestly,

392
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,000
what you just did

393
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,680
really took me back to high school.

394
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,960
Do you remember

395
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,150
you used to bring me food all the time back then?

396
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,920
Of course I remember.

397
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,530
You were just like now back then.

398
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,520
When you got busy, you were in a whirlwind.

399
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,320
You wished

400
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,990
you could split one minute into eight.

401
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,000
Eat slower.

402
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,210
No one's competing with you.

403
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,020
Can't help it.

404
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,850
In a rush, too busy.

405
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,000
No matter how busy you are, you need to

406
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,920
take good care of yourself.

407
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,430
Eating like this is bad for your digestive system.

408
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,420
It's fine.

409
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,610
Once this case is over,

410
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,240
I can be promoted to partner.

411
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,720
What case?

412
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,370
Don't worry about it.

413
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,720
Anyway, when the time comes, you can choose any

414
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,450
restaurant in Beixun.

415
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,190
My treat.

416
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:22,830
Alright.

417
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,170
I'll eat you out of house and home then.

418
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,930
Fine.

419
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,540
Go ahead and eat me out of house and home then.

420
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,740
[Attorney Meeting Room]

421
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,900
It's over.

422
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,470
Thank you.

423
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,450
[Attorney Meeting Room]

424
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,740
I want to see your superior.

425
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,410
Take him away.

426
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,560
When Han Kun was in charge,

427
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,370
I was already

428
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,080
the director of Ducheng Processing Factory.

429
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,420
But I never knew

430
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,820
there was a basement in the factory.

431
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,540
Later, Han Kun died,

432
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,440
and Han Pei took over the factory.

433
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,680
That's when I discovered the basement.

434
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,110
I also found out

435
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,550
that Han Pei would always

436
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,230
sneak down there late at night,

437
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,620
busy with who knows what.

438
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,160
I was curious,

439
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,510
so I followed him.

440
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,310
But he caught me.

441
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,750
Han Pei

442
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,780
held a knife to my throat

443
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,530
and said either I work with him

444
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,910
or

445
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,780
he'd kill my entire family.

446
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,750
I was terrified,

447
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,020
so I agreed to work with him.

448
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,900
He didn't really make me do much,

449
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,690
just keep it secret

450
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,160
and help him keep watch.

451
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,240
So when did you

452
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,030
get more involved?

453
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,100
Later, Han Pei also died,

454
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,990
and Han Jun took over the factory.

455
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,080
I realized

456
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,550
he knew nothing,

457
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,940
not even about the basement.

458
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,790
I got greedy.

459
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,230
I thought,

460
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,920
since Fan Yi could make drugs anyway,

461
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,870
might as well make some money off it.

462
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,070
So the culprit behind

463
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,270
the restaurant fire

464
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,770
wasn't any mining machine at all.

465
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,190
Why aren't you wearing masks again?

466
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,540
Do you want to die?

467
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,680
Sorry, Mr. Gao.

468
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,870
We'll be working

469
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,000
for the next few nights.

470
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,260
Alright, alright.

471
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,920
Hurry up.

472
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,680
Hey!

473
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,360
The electrical panel caught fire.

474
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,290
The fire department is here.

475
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,600
What?

476
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,030
Hello?

477
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,940
Wu,

478
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,550
didn't you say that surveillance video

479
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,350
was fine?

480
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,030
How come they've found

481
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,970
new evidence now?

482
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,750
This fire isn't as simple as it seems.

483
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,300
If you want me to keep helping you,

484
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,270
you must first honestly tell me

485
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,770
what exactly you did.

486
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,480
Well,

487
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,000
what could we possibly do?

488
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,920
Who knew Adviser Xu

489
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,640
would be so persistent?

490
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,000
I just wanted to find you

491
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,360
to quickly resolve this matter.

492
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,590
And you keep asking me

493
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,860
what we're doing.

494
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,760
Hearing what you're saying,

495
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,540
I have a rough idea now.

496
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,200
But you're not telling me the whole truth, are you?

497
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,300
I don't care.

498
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,350
Anyway, you have to cover this up

499
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,220
for me.

500
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,670
Don't let them trace this back to our factory.

501
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,370
I do have a solution.

502
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,120
But as far as I know,

503
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,610
the power level required

504
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,740
to divert lightning from a lightning rod

505
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,830
is far beyond what normal manufacturing

506
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,090
processes can reach.

507
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,640
So what exactly were you guys doing?

508
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,360
Alright. I'll tell you.

509
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,220
I was mining Bitcoins.

510
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,870
Alright.

511
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,680
I can help you solve this problem.

512
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,880
But the price will...

513
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,280
increase by ten times.

514
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,210
How much? Ten times?

515
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,220
Are you crazy?

516
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,500
Your appetite is so big.

517
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,940
Aren't you afraid of bursting your stomach?

518
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,000
It's up to you whether you want to do it or not.

519
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,190
Ten times it is.

520
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,560
Then I found someone

521
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,110
to dig a hole overnight.

522
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,980
I moved the drug manufacturing equipment away

523
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,470
and put the mining machines in the basement.

524
00:22:58,890 --> 00:22:59,400
Come.

525
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,510
Go check over there.

526
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,000
Later, wasn't I arrested

527
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,110
because of

528
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,710
the mining machines?

529
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,920
I was just released a couple of days ago.

530
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,900
I wanted to go back to the factory

531
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,110
to see what was going on.

532
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,930
But I found Fan Yi there,

533
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,650
with a camera,

534
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,070
at the newly dug hole

535
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,850
taking photos.

536
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,820
That's when I decided to kill him.

537
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,240
So at that time, you only wanted

538
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,000
to blow up Fan Yi?

539
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,810
You didn't see Adviser Xu?

540
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,000
At that time, I only saw

541
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,340
Fan Yi alone there.

542
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,610
Are you sure?

543
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,520
Well, and besides,

544
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,720
do I need to lie to you?

545
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,590
I'm already in this situation now.

546
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,110
Whether I wanted to blow up one person

547
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,580
or two people,

548
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,550
what's the difference?

549
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,290
Then what?

550
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,640
Then,

551
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,470
I took action.

552
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,680
I bought explosives,

553
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,200
planned to pin everything

554
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
on Fan Yi,

555
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,040
and waited for him to go there.

556
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,420
I tampered with that door.

557
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,790
It couldn't be opened from the inside.

558
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,750
But I never expected

559
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,640
that Adviser Xu would go there too.

560
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,000
Later, when the explosion happened,

561
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,350
Captain Shen also went there.

562
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,130
When you saw

563
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,590
them appear,

564
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,790
what did you think?

565
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,210
W-what?

566
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,790
What did I think?

567
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,030
Well,

568
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,600
what do you think I would think?

569
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,320
Those were two lives!

570
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,170
I'm not some kind of murderous maniac.

571
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,100
I just wanted

572
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,520
to earn more money

573
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,390
so my wife and kids

574
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,360
could have a better life.

575
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,100
Is that wrong of me to think that way?

576
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,660
You took over all the drug manufacturing operations.

577
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,120
What are all the distribution channels?

578
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,240
It's no use asking me about that.

579
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,520
Every time I contacted them,

580
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,510
the code words, locations,

581
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,350
and phone numbers were all different.

582
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,480
They were very cautious.

583
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,110
Besides, I've been

584
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,180
in prison before, haven't I?

585
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,480
They're still wary of me.

586
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,110
After Han Pei died,

587
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,610
all the profits from drug manufacturing

588
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,830
went into your account,

589
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,650
right?

590
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,750
Yes.

591
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,160
But according to our investigation,

592
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,110
after Han Pei's death,

593
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,180
you conducted two drug deals.

594
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,680
The actual profit

595
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,960
was only one-fifth

596
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,760
of the original value of the drugs.

597
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,110
Where did the rest of the money go?

598
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,720
What do you mean, one-fifth?

599
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,720
Your earnings

[Transaction Type, Inward Remittance, Transfer Remittance]

601
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,410
and the difference in the selling price we estimated

602
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,720
are off by a full five times.

603
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,570
Don't you know?

604
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,040
I don't know.

605
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,810
I just took that money.

606
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,030
I took whatever I sold it for.

607
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,600
Don't pretend you don't understand.

608
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,040
You took over the drug business.

609
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,550
Even if you didn't understand the market,

610
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,320
it's impossible to have

611
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,430
such a huge difference of five times.

612
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,790
The only explanation is

613
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,440
there's someone behind you

614
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,310
who's taking the lion's share.

615
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,550
Who is that person?

616
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,180
If you put it that way,

617
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,040
I'm just a sucker.

618
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,040
I sold it cheap.

619
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,270
There's no one behind me.

620
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,650
Gao Weiyuan,

621
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,500
listen to me.

622
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,200
I will definitely protect

623
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,000
your family.

624
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,800
You don't need to worry about anything.

625
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,860
Even if you don't confess now,

626
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,480
I can still find out

627
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,290
who's behind you.

628
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,960
I've already said there's no one behind me.

629
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,190
No one, no one!

630
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,040
There's only this chair behind me.

631
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,430
Whether it's the truth or not in the future

632
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,260
has nothing to do with me anymore.

633
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,500
I know what crime

634
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,750
I've committed.

635
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,400
I have...

636
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,640
I have no future anymore.

637
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,680
Gao Weiyuan,

638
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,790
are you starting again?

639
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,290
What's the point

640
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,200
of covering for the person behind you

641
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,540
now?

642
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,560
It's pointless.

643
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,760
Pointless.

644
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,930
[Refuse] [Answer]

[Du Danning]

646
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,160
Hello, Danning.

647
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,670
Chun, are you off work?

648
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,990
Are you free now?

649
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,640
Let's meet up.

650
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,000
Sure, what do you want to eat?

651
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,930
I'll treat you to a meal.

652
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,750
I don't have much appetite.

653
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,400
Let's go do some pottery.

654
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,500
Pottery?

655
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,680
Do you remember

656
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,240
when we were in high school,

657
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,110
the pottery shop near our school?

658
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,230
Okay.

659
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,330
Let's meet there in a bit.

660
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,350
Alright.

661
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,110
Take your time.

662
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,150
Call me if you need anything.

663
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,860
Okay.

664
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:13,810
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

665
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,740
Oh my God, I can't believe

666
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,060
it's still here.

667
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,240
If you hadn't brought me here,

668
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,410
I would have thought it was gone.

669
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,400
It's exactly the same as when we were kids.

670
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,340
Yeah.

671
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,170
So many years have passed in the blink of an eye.

672
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,660
How come you're so free today

673
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,530
to make plans with me?

674
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,510
How's the case going?

675
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,670
Don't even mention it.

676
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,940
Mercury is in retrograde lately.

677
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,210
Nothing's going smoothly.

678
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,150
What's wrong with you?

679
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,600
It's not really a big deal.

680
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,610
It's just my family.

681
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,640
They've been causing some trouble lately.

682
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,970
Family?

683
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,020
I remember your parents

684
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,930
were especially good to you.

685
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,060
Like you were their precious baby.

686
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,570
I'm not talking about my parents.

687
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,920
It's my husband.

688
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,340
Husband?

689
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,240
You're married?

690
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,590
Oh my God, Danning, you have a husband?

691
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,650
You didn't even tell me.

692
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,220
You could have at least sent me a message.

693
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,380
When did you get married?

694
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,320
We didn't notify anyone.

695
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,950
We just got the marriage certificate.

696
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,510
We were so busy we didn't even have a wedding banquet.

697
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,030
Busy, busy, busy.

698
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,380
One day you'll be so busy

699
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,530
that you won't even remember who I am.

700
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,670
How did you meet?

701
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,810
College classmates.

702
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,620
But he loves photography.

703
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,820
He's very handsome.

704
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,750
He's also very good to me.

705
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,400
Our personalities actually complement each other well.

706
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,120
So we get along very well.

707
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,560
Isn't that great then?

708
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,140
I've been busy working in Haishi these years.

709
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,130
He's a freelance photographer.

710
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,470
So he's relatively more family-oriented.

711
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,090
Isn't that pretty good then?

712
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,820
Complementing each other.

713
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,720
Didn't he follow me

714
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,800
back to Beixun?

715
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,170
After coming back, I've been extremely busy.

716
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,920
I've neglected his feelings.

717
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,280
He says he wants to go out and take on more work.

718
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,720
But I always feel that

719
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,940
someone should be at home.

720
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,900
So I don't agree.

721
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,660
We end up arguing all the time.

722
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,740
He even said to me...

723
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,620
Maybe I should quit being a lawyer.

724
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,620
If I weren't so busy,

725
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,700
it would be better for both of us.

726
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,820
How could he say that?

727
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,880
Why doesn't he give up

728
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,010
his job then?

729
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,690
He says I'm too competitive,

730
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,850
have a strong desire to win,

731
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,390
and not suitable to be a lawyer.

732
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,260
I just don't get it.

733
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,340
As a lawyer, when I represent clients in court,

734
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,180
shouldn't I aim to win?

735
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,780
When did this window close?

736
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,830
Didn't I just open it on purpose?

737
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:49,920
Danning,

738
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,000
I think you're right.

739
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,110
For lawyers,

740
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,580
who doesn't have a strong sense of winning and losing?

741
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,000
It's not your problem.

742
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,510
Anyway, I don't feel

743
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,550
there's anything wrong with me.

744
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,030
He keeps saying

745
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,240
I put too much pressure on myself,

746
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,380
making him unhappy too.

747
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,880
In my opinion,

748
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,880
if he's really that unhappy,

749
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,920
and we can't live together anymore,

750
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,820
then let's just end it.

751
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,090
Don't say things out of anger.

752
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,500
I can tell

753
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,650
he cares about you too.

754
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,920
He doesn't want you to be under too much pressure.

755
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,850
You two should have a good talk,

756
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,790
communicate well.

757
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,190
What's there to communicate about?

758
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,140
I'm seriously talking about divorce.

759
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,140
You won't divorce.

760
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,720
When you were just talking about him,

761
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,790
it was full of love.

762
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,940
You think I can't see that?

763
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,990
I'm a fortune teller. You won't divorce.

764
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,770
Shouldn't we bake this now?

765
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,450
You've shaped it really well.

766
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,100
Let's bake it.

767
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,720
Why did mine have

768
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,180
such a long crack?

769
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,030
Really.

770
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,550
This...

771
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,170
Chun,

772
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,880
look,

773
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,210
yours is cracked too.

774
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,810
Let's fix them together.

775
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,550
It's cracked inside.

776
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,060
Usually, it can't be fixed.

777
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,080
Anyway, you can't see it from the outside.

778
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,720
Forget it.

779
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:17,810
No,

780
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,310
I need to fix this one.

781
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,050
Can you really fix that?

782
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,890
I don't know.

783
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,720
Let's give it a try.

784
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,430
How did it crack?

785
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,520
Why can't I fix it?

786
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,480
Let's go.

787
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,070
Let's go.

788
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,720
Danning,

789
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,960
it's okay.

790
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,840
In a few days,

791
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,310
I'll come with you to make another one.

792
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,970
It was already cracked anyway.

793
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,080
It's fine.

794
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,180
How's the preparation for the court hearing going?

795
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,000
Don't worry,

796
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,200
all the necessary preparations

797
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,260
have been made.

798
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,620
The other side

799
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,179
doesn't have substantial evidence

800
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,610
to prove the adverse reactions

801
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,409
and their causal relationship with the food.

802
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,730
Are you so certain?

803
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,520
They filed a lawsuit before.

804
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,219
but suddenly withdrew it midway.

805
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,989
This proves that in terms of evidence,

806
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,920
they didn't have

807
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,920
much confidence at the time.

808
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,810
and after so much time has passed,

809
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,389
that batch of cheese sticks

810
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,830
would be hard to find now.

811
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,929
Proving causality

812
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,110
will be extremely difficult.

813
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,150
Yes.

814
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,920
But we can't solely rely on

815
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
the other side not having a trump card

816
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,880
to win.

817
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,550
We also need to look at

818
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,000
our own trump card.

819
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:43,770
Anyway,

820
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,070
this case is very important

821
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,540
for the group.

822
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
That's why we're willing to pay

823
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,190
such high legal fees

824
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,250
to have you take on this case.

825
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,500
Of course,

826
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,940
Senior, please rest assured.

827
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,080
Leave everything to me.

828
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:56,790
Alright,

829
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,250
I'll leave it to you then.

830
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,000
Senior, I'll be going now.

831
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,580
Okay.

832
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,320
I won't see you out.

833
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,000
Okay.

834
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,440
Bye.

835

837
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,850

839

840
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,790
I'm going upstairs to water the flowers.

841
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,270
I'll go with you.

842
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,730
I've been lying down all day without moving.

843
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,720
I'll go upstairs for some fresh air.

844
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:24,950
Alright.

845
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,000

Ye,

847
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,220
can you help water

848
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,650
those outside?

849
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,600
Use this?

850
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,850
Yes, that one will do.

851
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,510
That, that red one at the bottom,

852
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,170
no need to water it.

853
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,070
Just water the ones on top.

854
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,710
This pot?

855
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,590
Yes.

856
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,650
Do me a favor.

857
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,250
Is there enough water?

858
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,840
Yes. I have enough here.

859
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,400
Still enough.

860
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,200
No problem.

861
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,480
Pick me up at the entrance of Linzi Lane.

862
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,300
The sooner the better.

863

Yes.

867
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,510
Make the arrest.

868
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,460

Chief Wu, there's been a slight mishap.

875
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,540
I lost them.

Where are we going?

877
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,400
Back to my place.

878
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,960
Didn't you just leave home?

879
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,780
I forgot to bring something.

880
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,110
After I get the thing,

Tell me.

so many questions now?
