00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,710
Adviser Xu.

4
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,250
Why do I feel that

5
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,640
you seem to have a crush on Chun?

6
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,200
Well, I can tell you very

7
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,070
honestly that

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,680
I care about her very much.

9
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,480
That's true.

10
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,160
I also care about her very much.

11
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,870
Now that she's abroad

12
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,030
and living alone in a foreign country,

13
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
I will care about her even more in the future.

14
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,850
Chun

15
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,550
won't stay abroad for too long.

16
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,230
She's a good forensic doctor.

17
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,360
She will definitely come back.

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,680
Nothing is definite.

19
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,160
You don't want her to come back?

20
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,120
What I want doesn't matter at all.

21
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,000
But I understand one thing.

22
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,520
Look. People can't even

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
control their own fates,

24
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,700
but they even want to control others.

25
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,590
Don't you think that's just wishful thinking?

26
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,660
That's right.

27
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,350
For example,

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,860
I didn't want her to go abroad,

29
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,790
but because of your help,

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,660
I couldn't stop her.

31
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,240
Studying abroad was

32
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,870
Chun's own wish.

33
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,820
What rights did I have to interfere?

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,530
No, no.

35
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,400
Don't misunderstand.

36
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,550
What I mean is that

37
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,230
even though Chun is usually

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,310
so close to us,

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,630
when it comes to crucial moments,

40
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,030
it seems that

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,150
she only listens to

42
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,400
you, who is her senior schoolmate.

43
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,670
You've hit the nail on the head.

44
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,360
Do you know what the problem is?

45
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,829
What is it?

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,710
Look.

47
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,190
You two always

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,430
hanged out together every day.

49
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,250
You two seemed very close,

50
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,690
but in fact, your relationship

51
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,300
was just like buddies.

52
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,280
Right?

53
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,120
Chun is very straightforward.

54
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,120
She's a forensic doctor,

55
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,870
but more importantly, she's a girl.

56
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,810
A woman

57
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,390
needs emotional value

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,780
and emotional support.

59
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,560
As a man,

60
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,240
it's not just about

61
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,560
saying it.

62
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
You need to take action.

63
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,530
Yes.

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,520
I'm usually too busy with work.

65
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,840
That's the biggest excuse.

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,400
Who isn't busy?

67
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,400
Am I not busy?

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,490
If you truly value this person

69
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,370
and like her,

70
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,310
no matter what you do, you'll

71
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,310
definitely give priority to her.

72
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,500
Right?

73
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,400
When she's in a bad mood,

74
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,910
you can take her out to have a meal

75
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,880
and cheer her up.

76
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,040
When she's feeling down and depressed,

77
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,040
you can take her to do some boxing

78
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,160
to let her vent it out.

79
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,950
These are all basic tricks.

81
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,310
Don't you think so?

82
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,900
Chun can box too?

83
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,950
Her boxing skills are very good.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,360
I can barely keep up with her now.

85
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,520
Adviser Xu,

86
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,940
stop pondering on it.

87
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,409
It's not something you can ponder on anyway.

88
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,600
Just eat.

89
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,390
The noodles are getting mushy.

90
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,430
What about you, Mr. Han?

91
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,870
When will you return to Americas?

92
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,460
I'll leave here in three days.

93
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,400
Oh, right.

94
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:54,830
Is there anything

95
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,850
you want to give to Chun?

96
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,770
Give it to me.

97
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,510
I'll deliver it to her.

98
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,310
No need.

99
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,930
With you taking care of her,

100
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
she won't be short of anything.

101
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,720
Alright.

102
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,500
That's all for our chat then.

103
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,270
Okay?

104
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,660
I still have something to do.

105

Besides, this place

106
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,390

107

109
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,680
No, no, no.

110
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,360
Go get two bottles of mineral water.

112

Let me take a look.

115
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,450
There are no blisters. It's not serious.

116
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,020
Just wipe it.

117
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,850
It should be fine.

118
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,920
You think this is fine?

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,390
I'm fine just because you said so?

What did I ask for?

125
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,970
I asked for an ice pack! Understand?

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,510
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,840
We really don't have any ice packs here.

128

Stop yelling.

129
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,560
Apply it to your wound for 20 minutes and it'll be fine.

a forensic scientist in the criminal investigation team.

163
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,000
Why did you

164
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,360
come to study psychology?

165
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,560
I got to know a lot of people

as a forensic scientist

167
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,320

through their bodies.

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,790
As I examined them,

170
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,390
they imposed psychological labels

171
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,550
on myself, too.

172
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,270
So,

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,650

[2. Came to the downstairs of Chun's apartment]

195
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:12,630
[3. Helped Chun handle the procedure to go abroad]

196
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,310
[4: Helped the director solve the welfare house's funds problems]

197

[5. High school classmates met again 18 years later]

198
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,160
[6. Happened to appear when climbing the mountain]

Twenty-seven.

203
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,390
He changed his car.

204
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,370
He changed his car.

205
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,230
What's the license plate number?

206
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,230
The license plate number.

207
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,900
Xu.

208
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,010
Hello, Shen Ye.

209
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,000
I suspect that Han Jun

210
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,300
has been tailing Chun.

211
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,610
What's going on?

212
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:55,730
How about this?

213
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,000
Go to Chun's neighborhood now

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,630
to check the surveillance videos.

215
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,390
Then pay attention to

216
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,480
a white SUV.

217
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,590
What's the license plate number?

218
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,800
I can't see it clearly now.

219
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,900
I need to go to the welfare house.

220
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,140
Let's discuss the details when we meet.

221
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,720
Okay.

222
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,850
Mr. Zhang.

223
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,800
Hello.

224
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,500
Mr. Shen.

225
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,190
Hello.

226
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:14,870
I've sorted them out.

227
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,390
Come here and watch them.

228
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,260
Come on. Let me watch them.

229
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,240
You want to watch the video from the 5th,

230
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,610
right?

231
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,720
Yes, please play it first.

233
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,120
How about this?

234
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,600
Please rewind it to the part from the 3rd and let me check.

235
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,630
The part from the 3rd.

237
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,320
It's still during this time period.

238
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,870
Okay.

239
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,110
[Northwest corner]

240
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,620

242
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,030
I'll record it.

243
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,580
Alright.

245
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,030
Director.

246
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,850
Tongsheng, you're here.

247
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,440
Come in.

248
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,240
Come on. Have a seat.

249
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,230
Are you here for something?

250
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,780
Yes, of course there's something.

251
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,630
I'd like to ask

252
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,260
where I can watch the welfare house's

253
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,550
surveillance videos.

254
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,920
You can watch them right in my office.

255
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,010
What's wrong?

256
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,170
I've been studying surveillance cameras recently, haven't I?

257
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,120
I just want to check

258
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,000
whether there are any blind spots for

259
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,230
the surveillance cameras in our welfare house.

260
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,390
Just check them.

261
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,720
Let me know if you find any issues.

262
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,330
Okay.

263
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,750

268
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,320
Mom, what are you doing?

269
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,600
What are you doing?

270
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,440
How is it?

271
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,870
Are you getting used to the food there?

272
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,260
Are the living conditions good?

273
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,700
Are you getting along well with your classmates?

274
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,190
Mom, you're asking me so many questions.

275
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,930
Which one do you want me to

276
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,020
answer first?

277
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,870
Just answer them one by one slowly.

278
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,970
It's pretty good.

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,930
The food is good, and the accommodation is nice.

280
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,320
Look. This is the place I'm living in.

281
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,290
How nice it is.

282
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,030
It looks alright.

283
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,050
Didn't you say it was hard to find a place to live in?

it was hard for me to find a place to live in.

287
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,150
You're quite impressive.

288
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:34,970
Indeed.

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,870
While you're there,

290
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,480
I surely have to be concerned

[Pay attention to children, accept them and try to understand them with sincerity.]

292

301
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,500
So you're here to visit my mom in the welfare house today?

302
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,960
Yes, I'm here to visit Director Zeng.

about Shen Ye with you.

Could you give us some privacy?

Oh, my God!

314
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,840
I've been away for just a few days,

315
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,490
and there's already gossip about Shen Ye?

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,080
Has Han Jun contacted you recently?

Han Jun?

319
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,690
He just sends me a few messages a day.

What's wrong?

321
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,870
You have to be wary of Han Jun.

322
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,360
I think he has been tailing you all this time.

323
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,460

he has appeared in all of them.

328
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,440
Moreover,

329
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,630
he's very familiar with your

330
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,360
whereabouts and movements.

331
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,020
Is it possible that

332
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:34,840
during that period,

333
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,340
he was helping me with the formalities for going abroad,

so our schedules

335
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,660
might have overlapped?

00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,670
to check earlier surveillance videos

338

No.

I found it myself.

and I refused.

00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,320
any news about him all this time.

382
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,030
Just today, I found out that

383
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,550
he had been put in jail for fighting.

384
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,840
The jail called me and asked me

385
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,580
to pick him up tomorrow.

386
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,640
Look. I can't let my son

387
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,280
come back home without a place to live in.

388
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,530
So, you'll

389
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,240
have to move out tomorrow.

390
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,960
But you've

391
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,460
signed a contract with me.

392
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,050
You can't just break the contract like this.

393
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,440
Where do you think I can live?

394
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,410
If I hadn't had no choice,

395
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,550
I wouldn't have done this.

396
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,240
I...

397
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,970
How about this?

398
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,550
According to the contract, I can

399
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,730
compensate you for your losses.

400
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,650
During this period,

401
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,060
you can stay in a hotel first.

402
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,200
I'm sorry for the trouble.

403
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,960
I've finally found my son.

404
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,410
Just let us get reunited properly.

405
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:28,960
Okay?

406
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,880
Thank you.

407
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,050
I'm sorry for the trouble.

408
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,440
I've really caused you trouble.

409
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,360
Alright.

410
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,590
Give me some time

411
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,420
to find a new place.

412
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,370
Okay.

413
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,660

Hello?

416
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,030
Do you have a house

417
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,470
for rent?

418
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,370
That house was rented out yesterday.

419
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
I forgot to remove it from the listing.

420
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,990
I'm sorry.

421
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,640
Thank you.

422
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,090
Hello?

423
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,000
I saw your rental

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,070
Yes.

426
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,610
When do you want to move in?

427
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,890
I want to move in

428
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,400
before 12 o'clock tomorrow.

429
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,630
That's not okay.

430
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,110
The current tenant won't move out until next week.

431
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,560
Next week?

432
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,920
Alright.

433
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,040
Thank you.

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,830

Nothing.

Well, our landlady met

446
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,870
a problem today.

447
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,800
I might have to move out by noon tomorrow.

Well, what's going on?

find a place to live in now?

00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,270
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

452
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,070
Is the landlady there?

453
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,640
Ask her to come over.

454
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,610
I'll reason with her.

455
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,160
It's fine.

456
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,110
There's no need to reason with her.

457
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,750
I've already talked this over with her.

What's more,

459
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,480
I've already started looking for a new place.

460
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,680
You're unfamiliar with

461
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,880
the surroundings and the people there.

468
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,800
You should move into my place.

469
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,360
That house of mine is vacant anyway.

470
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,240
Right?

471
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,320
If you move into that house,

472
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,030
I won't have to worry, either.

473
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,530
Senior,

474
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,960
I appreciate your kindness.

475
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,560
I won't move into your house.

476
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,620
These are all small matters.

477
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
I can solve them myself.

Okay?

479
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,370

480
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,510
to do me a favor.

481
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,510

482
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,590
and I'm worried about it.

483
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,400
If you move into that house,

484
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,160
you can help me look after the house.

485
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,070
Right?

486
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,160
Then how about this?

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,160
I definitely won't

488
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,500
move into your house.

489
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,310
But if you need me

490
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,660
to look after the house,

491
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,480
I can go check on it when I'm free.

513

a Chinese girl living there.

When you come,

515
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,010
just knock on the door directly.

516
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,070

517

543
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,310
have you found a place to live in?

544

If you haven't found it,

545
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:42,680
you should

546
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
really move into my place.

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,070
I'm here.

563
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,680
didn't rent out the room.

564
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,660

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,690
I'm sorry.

572
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,830
Then I'll...

573
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,690
I'll leave now.

574
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,460
I'm sorry.

575
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,160
It's okay.

576
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,800
Which city in China are you from?

577
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,970
I'm from Beixun.

578
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,960
No wonder your accent sounds

579
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,000
so familiar.

580
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,640
How about this?

581
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,270
You can stay in my place temporarily.

582
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,770
I mean...

583
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,700
you can hardly find a place to live in

584
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,680
within such a short time.

585
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,480
As a girl,

586
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,350
you can't sleep in the street

587
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,240
tonight, huh?

588
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,650
It's fine.

589
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,790
I can find a place by myself.

590
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,670
Thank you.

591
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,890
I don't mean anything else.

592
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,590
I just think that

593
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,770
we're both Chinese,

594
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
and we're both girls,

595
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,240
so we can look after each other.

596
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,690
My secondary bedroom is still vacant.

597
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,480
It's quite convenient.

598
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,440
Come in.

599
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,180
Alright.

600
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,050
Thank you.

601
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,640
As soon as I find a place to live in,

602
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,790
I'll move out right away.

603
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,400
I'm really sorry for the trouble. Thank you.

604
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,840
It's okay.

605
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,520
I haven't asked your name yet.

606
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,410
My name is Jin Chun.

607
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,130
What's your name?

608
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,300
My name is Lian Xiangqin.

609
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,950
Xiangqin.

610
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,770
Here's a new pair of slippers.

611
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,730
They've never been used.

612
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,030
You can use them from now on.

613
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,370
Thank you.

614
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,960
So, about these...

615
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,270
About these shoes,

616
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,350
is there any specific rule for placing them?

617
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,590
After I take off my shoes,

618
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,500
can I put them

619
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,290
here?

620
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,110
There is no specific rule.

621
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,140
You can put them wherever you like.

622
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,830
My boyfriend and I

623
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,870
place them casually, too.

624
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,880
Boyfriend?

625
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,730
I'm alone now.

626
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,240
He's not here now.

627
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,640
Jin Chun.

628
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,200
How long are you going to stay abroad?

629
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,870
About two years.

630
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,300
I'm here to study.

631
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,480
Which school?

632
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,300
What major?

633
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,200
I'm studying in the psychology training class at Chad Hahn University.

634
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,590
Chad Hahn University?

635
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,000
That's good.

636
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,700
If we get along well,

637
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,830
you can live here

638
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,550
for two years.

639
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,080
Thank you so much.

640
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,310
If it weren't for you today,

641
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,200
I didn't know where

642
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,230
I could stay tonight.

643
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,240
You're welcome.

644
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,600
These flowers smell so nice.

645
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,440
Right?

646
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,340
Natural fragrances

647
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,030
are much better than artificial perfumes.

648
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,440
I also like the scent

649
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,820
of natural fragrances very much.

650
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,600
It's quite soothing.

651
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,240
Do you usually

652
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,350
not wear perfume?

653
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,070
I can't smell any perfume on you.

654
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,340
That's right. I never wear perfume.

655
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
I don't really like perfume.

656
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,070
Me, neither.

657
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,600
Thank you.

658
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,200
Let me show you

659
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,880
the room where you'll be staying.

660
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,070
Okay.

661
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,880
Come on. This way.

662
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,720
This is your room.

663
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,440
The lighting is so good.

664
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,680
The light is great.

665
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,550
The room is nice, too.

666
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,690
Thank you very much.

667
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,450
I really like it.

668
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,340
Thank you.

669
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,060
You're welcome.

670
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,160
How about this?

671
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,350
To express my gratitude,

672
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,840
I'll cook dinner for you tonight.

673
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,680
Sure!

674
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,780
Just bring your suitcase inside first.

675
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,440
Alright.

676
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,590
What's wrong?

677
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,750
Does the food not suit your taste?

678
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,240
It's not like that.

679
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,590
It's very delicious.

680
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,150
You don't need to consider my feelings.

681
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,320
If you don't like it,

682
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,000
just tell me.

683
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,400
Or you can tell me what kind

684
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,590
of cuisine you prefer,

685
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,240
what flavor you like

686
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,110
and how your appetite is.

687
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,960
I'll make different dishes for you next time.

688
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,610
No need.

689
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,880
This flavor is great.

690
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,000
This is your hometown cuisine, right?

691
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:14,720
Yes.

692
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,550
It's just that your cooking

693
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,590
reminds me of

694
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,830
a close friend.

695
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,750
His cooking is also very delicious.

696
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,110
Is your friend also from Beixun?

697
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,590
You're so good at cooking.

698
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,510
Who taught you these skills?

699
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,810
I just love to eat,

700
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,400
so,

701
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,680
I like to study cooking skills when I have time.

702
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,750
I've learnt them all by myself.

703
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,080
How old are you?

704
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,450
You look

705
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
a bit younger than me.

706
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,510
I'm 34 now.

707
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,200
You're indeed two years younger than me.

708
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,490
Before coming here,

709
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,200
were you working as a psychologist in China?

710
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,610
No.

711
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,040
I studied forensic medicine for my bachelor's degree.

712
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,760
After graduation, I've been working in

713
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,960
the public security unit.

714
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,310
Since you worked as a public servant,

715
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,440
why did you decide

716
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,680
to study abroad?

717
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,350
It isn't that easy to get admitted to

718
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,510
the training program at Chad Hahn University.

719
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,550
I just wanted to further my studies.

720
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,480
It's quite difficult to get into Chad Hahn University indeed.

721
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,360
Fortunately, I have a senior schoolmate

722
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,710
who helped me a lot.

723
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,440
Otherwise, I might not have been able to come.

724
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,720
Is it the senior schoolmate

725
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,880
who keeps calling you?

726
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,160
Yes.

727
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,480
He's so nice to you.

728
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,440
Is he pursuing you?

729
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,360
No.

730
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,710
Not at all.

731
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,830
So what kind of person is he?

732
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,280
Let me get you a bowl of soup.

733
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,350
I'm quite good at making soup.

734
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,070
Taste it.

735
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,660
[Alarm]

736
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,180
What are you doing?

737
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,040
Don't use this mobile phone

738
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,690
alarm ringtone anymore.

739
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,530
I'm really annoyed.

740
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,670
Well...

741
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,810
Are you crazy?

742
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,870
What's going on?

743
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,920
[Northwest corner]

744
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,710
This is a surveillance video from the welfare house.

745
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,790
Look at this white car.

746
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,130
No matter where Chun went,

747
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,680
this car always appeared.

748
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,510
Fast forward it a bit more.

749
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,080
This part was captured

750
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,960
by the telescope in my house.

751
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,010
This white car

752
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,600
once appeared in the Han Group, too.

753
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,940
And Han Jun

754
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
once got into this car.

755
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,830
This car also once appeared

756
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,510
outside Chun's apartment.

757
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,420
I've looked into it, too.

758
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,510
From Chun's home to the Criminal Investigation Division,

759
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,470
from morning to night,

760
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,440
Han Jun showed up

761
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,740
at random times.

762
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,960
This person is definitely suspicious.

763
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,450
I've also shared this

764
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,820
information with Chun.

765
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,430
She said she would be careful.

766
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,190
Why don't we ask her to come back?

767
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,480
There's no rush.

768
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,710
This training

769
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,160
is quite a rare chance for her.

770
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,830
Let's take it one step at a time.

771
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,750
But the most important thing right now is that

772
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,750
we absolutely cannot let Han Jun leave China.

773
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,310
He has told me that in three days,

774
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:20,890
he'll go to Americas.

775
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,200
Three days.

776
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,920
There are only three days left. How can we stall him?

777
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,350
He was only tailing her.

778
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,090
There was no substantial criminal act.

779
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,670
That's why I've been thinking about

780
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,880
what the real problem is exactly.

781
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,270
How about this?

782
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,760
I'll inform

783
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,510
Chief Wu of this first.

784
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,310
Let's get prepared in advance.

785
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,280
There are still three days left.

786
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,420
As soon as he slips up,

787
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,070
we'll take action immediately.

788
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,160
That's all we can do for now.

789
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,230
[Han Jun] [Jin Chun]

790
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:56,350
[Han Jun]

791
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,070
[A countdown to Han Jun's departure from China: 61 hours and 59 minutes]

792
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,960
Jin Chun.

793
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,030
I'm really sorry.

794
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,190
I must have scared you this morning.

795
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,720
I want to apologize to you.

796
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,520
My behavior this morning

797
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,980
was really inappropriate.

798
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,520
But at that moment, I really

799
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,130
couldn't control my emotions.

800
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,720
So,

801
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,960
I just rushed in.

802
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,720
I didn't mean to do that.

803
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,590
And recently,

804
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,420
I've been living alone.

805
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,880
I truly forgot that you were here.

806
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,270
I didn't tell you my living habits

807
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,590
in advance.

808
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,580
That's just my fault.

809
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,270
So, I'm here

810
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,630
to apologize to you.

811
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,350
I'm sorry.

812
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,950
If you have any living habits,

813
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,260
you should have told me in advance.

814
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,090
I would definitely respect you.

815
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,320
But you shouldn't have done that just now,

816
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,680
suddenly

817
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,030
rushing in like a mad woman.

818
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,510
By doing that,

819
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,750
you invaded my privacy.

820
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,550
If we can't even

821
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,770
respect each other,

822
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
why should we still

823
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,110
live under the same roof?

824
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,440
Yes, yes,

825
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
What you said is right.

826
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,640
That's why I feel...

827
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,550
very sorry.

828
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,680
So, can you please not leave?

829
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,680
I've even made breakfast for you.

830
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,680
Because I'd like to apologize to you.

831
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,440
I know it was my fault.

832
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,680
I'm sorry.

833
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Stop crying.

834
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,580
I won't leave.

835
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,320
From now on, if you have any habits,

836
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,210
you need to tell me.

837
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,110
Understand?

838
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,450
I'll tidy up my things

839
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,920
and then eat the breakfast you made.

840
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,640
Come on.

841
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,960
So this is Beixun-style breakfast?

842
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,160
Just eat now.

843
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,310
Actually,

844
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,830
the good friend from Beixun

845
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,400
I've been telling you about

846
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,240
is my boyfriend.

847
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,470
After living with him for a long time,

848
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,880
many of my habits

849
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,200
have become the same as his.

850
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,110
My taste

851
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,070
has also changed a lot accordingly.

852
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,550
I see.

853
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
I'm sorry for what I did just now.

854
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,320
I couldn't control my emotions.

855
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,250
Because since I was a kid,

856
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,110
I've had neurasthenia.

857
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,030
I can't stand those high-frequency sounds

858
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,360
from mobile phone alarm ringtones.

859
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,280
Your alarm clock...

860
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,280
I just...

861
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,230
lost control of my emotions at that moment.

862
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,400
When I was a kid, it was always my mom

863
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
who woke me up.

864
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,940
After my mom passed away,

865
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,580
I suffered from insomnia and anxiety

866
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,550
for a very long time.

867
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,150
Only after I got to know my boyfriend

868
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,070
was I able to sleep well again.

869
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,530
He has a good sleep schedule.

870
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,830
He also goes to bed early and wakes up early.

871
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,030
He doesn't need an alarm clock.

872
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,010
So,

873
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,880
I'm really sorry.

874
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,840
It's okay.

875
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,590
I'm the one who should apologize.

876
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,800
I really didn't know

877
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,760
about your condition.

878
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,440
I'll be more careful in the future.

879
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,920
I'll turn down the volume of my phone.

880
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,390
Well, do you need me to wake you up?

881
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,070
That... That won't be necessary.

882
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,000
My boyfriend has left something nice

883
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,760
to me.

884
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,150
Your boyfriend is quite thoughtful.

885
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,150
Jin Chun.

886
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,760
Do you have someone whom you fancy now?

887
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,360
I don't have time to think about such things.

888
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,670
What about that senior schoolmate

889
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,840
who kept helping you?

890
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,510
Don't you have any feelings for him?

891
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,070
Feelings?

892
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,850
He and I

893
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,670
are just

894
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,270
senior and junior simply.

895
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,000
But he is indeed very nice to me.

896
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,900
I'm very grateful to him.

897
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,760
That's all.

898
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,190
Now with the heavy load on my brain,

899
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,560
I really can't think about anything else.

900
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,130
I just want to come here and study hard.

901
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,540
Studying hard is enough.

902
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,830
It's so delicious. The food you made is good.

903
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,700
Then you should eat more.

904
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,110
Where are the cardboard boxes

905
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,840
I've put in that corner?

906
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,320
When I was doing some cleaning this morning,

907
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,270
I threw them away for you.

908
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,780
Who told you to throw them away?

909
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,510
I saw that they were already dirty

910
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,550
and probably couldn't be used anymore,

911
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:36,960
so I...

912
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,440
Before you threw them away,

913
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,970
couldn't you ask for my opinion first?

914
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,880
I'm sorry.

915
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,010
It was indeed my fault.

916
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:41,920
I should have told you first.

917
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,400
Do you know what those

918
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,070
cardboard boxes

919
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,710
mean to me?

920
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,320
My boyfriend left

921
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,720
those things to me!

922
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,920
[You need to go out to enjoy sunshine when the weather is fine. Don't stay at home all this time, or mushrooms will sprout on you.]

923
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,920
[Baby, you need to go to bed early and get up early.]

924
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,200
Shen Ye.

925
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,810
Xu, here's the thing.

926
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,770
Recently, I've looked through

927
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,840
the surveillance videos of public areas.

928
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,380
There are a few shots of Han Jun in these videos.

929
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,670
His schedule seemed normal.

930
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,180
He was just handling business as usual.

931
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,110
After I sort them out,

932
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,840
I'll send them to you.

933
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,540
Alright.

934
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,320
How's your investigation?

935
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,190
Have you found anything?

936
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,290
I haven't...

937
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,920
found any issues yet.

938
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,710
That's normal.

939
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,830
He spends most of his time

940
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,300
at the Han Group.

941
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,590
He usually lives there, too.

942
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,400
It's indeed difficult to find a breakthrough.

943
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,110
Yeah.

944
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,080
So you went out?

945
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,230
I was thinking about

946
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,920
taking my grandma to see my father's grave.

947
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,710
