00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,930
The workers there

382
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,420
staged a well-organized protest.

383
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,870
And none of them speak Mandarin,

384
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,720
so we couldn't communicate at all,

385
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,120
and we couldn't get in either.

386
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,550
What's their reason for not letting us in?

387
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,900
What reason could there be?

388
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,000
The fire investigation team

389
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,080
just found out the cause of the fire

390
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,140
might have come from the factory.

391
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,120
But when we came there again,

392
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,880
they wouldn't let us in anymore.

393
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,730
What about the factory director?

394
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,050
That Gao Weiyuan?

395
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,450
Mentor,

396
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,960
you also know about this case?

397
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,950
Just some basic information.

398
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,010
Gao Weiyuan doesn't answer his phone,

399
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,330
even when we get through.

400
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,460
Those workers

401
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,530
were probably arranged by him.

402
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,590
About this matter...

403
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,160
How about this?

404
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,579
I'll help you coordinate

405
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,319
police forces from other jurisdictions.

406
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,640
Will that be easy to arrange?

407
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,950
I don't think we need that for now.

408
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,160
When it comes to

409
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,000
police-civilian relations,

410
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,240
we have to be extra cautious.

411
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,160
You're too hasty.

412
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,160
Let me tell you, Shen Ye,

413
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,240
you can't

414
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,660
rush this case.

415
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,750
Think it through carefully.

416
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,720
One wrong step,

417
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,910
and you won't be able to remedy it.

418
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,880
Chief Wu,

419
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,430
then...

420
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,080
Director Wang.

421
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,770
Mentor.

422
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
I need backup.

423
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,590
This case is frustrating

424
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,640
the hell out of me.

425
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,070
Alright.

426
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,450
You set the time.

427
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,310
When you go to that factory again,

428
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,620
I'll help coordinate

429
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,140
police support from two nearby

430
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,920
police stations.

431
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,700
Communication shouldn't be a problem.

432
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,690
By then,

433
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,860
you can decide

434
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,550
how to handle things on-site.

435
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,020
That's great.

436
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,680
Is tomorrow morning okay?

437
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,500
Sure.

438
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,880
Mentor,

439
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,000
you just saved my life.

440
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,710
The key is that you need to make progress.

441
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,600
However,

442
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,790
your Chief Wu's

443
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,270
advice just now

444
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,610
is very pertinent.

445
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,150
Remember—

446
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,540
be careful with your approach tomorrow.

447
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,550
Understood.

448
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,000
Dad, what is it?

449
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,590
Chun.

450
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,130
Are you free tomorrow?

451
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:58,920
What for?

452
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,810
If you have time,

453
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,070
let's have a meal together.

454
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,470
Just tell her straight out.

455
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,380
No matter what, she's in the wrong.

456
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,830
A younger person leaving

457
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,640
before an elder—

458
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,950
that's just disrespectful.

459
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,630
Tell her

460
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,200
I've arranged another date with Jiang He's mother.

461
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,380
This time, I'll be there too.

462
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,450
We'll get to know each other better

463
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,830
and clear up any misunderstandings.

464
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,710
[Jin Chun]

465
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,940
I'll talk to her properly.

466
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,200
Chun.

467
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,480
This matter...

468
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,340
Just

469
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,130
do it as a favor to me.

470
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,980
Go meet them one more time.

471
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,480
After the meeting,

472
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,520
I can help you see

473
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,200
what's really going on.

474
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,720
Your mother, she...

475
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,910
Alright, Dad, I got it.

476
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,070
So, what did she say?

477
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,280
I'll go tomorrow evening.

478
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,930
Okay, okay.

479
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:50,920
It's settled.

480
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,160
What are you doing?

481
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,240
What are you all doing here?

482
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,400
Calm down!

483
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,110
Calm down!

484
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,460
Calm down, calm down!

485
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,010
[Factory Area—Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out]

486
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,380
Quiet down!

487
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,530
Quiet down, quiet down!

488
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,560
Enough, enough, enough!

489
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,480
Captain Shen,

490
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,720
I'm really sorry.

491
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,920
I was too busy yesterday

492
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,160
and missed your call.

493
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,680
I was just about to call you back today,

494
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,280
you see,

495
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,830
and what a coincidence that you're here now.

496
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,540
Director Gao,

497
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,970
we've identified the source of the fire.

498
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,290
It didn't originate from the restaurant.

499
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,770
It's highly likely that it came from your factory.

500
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,390
Today, we need to enter the factory to investigate.

501
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,730
I-Is that so?

502
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,480
Well...

503
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,420
Then, it seems that you all

504
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,270
have made a wasted trip.

505
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,960
There's no need to enter the factory today.

506
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,750
Because I've already found out

507
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,680
the real cause

508
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,460
of this fire.

509
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,030
Everyone, take a look at this.

510
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,170
This is the lightning strike pattern

511
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,510
left after it struck

512
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,790
the distribution cabinet,

513
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,690
which is also the real cause

514
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,350
of this fire.

515
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,440
That night, there was a heavy thunderstorm.

516
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,310
There was lightning

517
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,640
that accidentally struck the distribution cabinet

518
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,000
instead of the lightning rod.

519
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,710
Then,

520
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,730
the sparks that burst from the distribution cabinet

521
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,690
ignited the oil wok

522
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,130
in the restaurant's kitchen.

523
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,050
So this fire was a natural disaster

524
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,290
that has nothing to do with

525
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,470
the neighboring restaurant

526
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,960
or the Ducheng Processing Factory.

527
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,410
You just mentioned... the lightning rod.

528
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,870
Right.

529
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,640
Why didn't the lightning strike the lightning rod

530
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,540
instead of hitting this thing?

531
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,200
And you've also checked the residual magnetism.

532
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,460
How do you explain that?

533
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,190
First of all, lightning rods are not

534
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,480
100% effective in attracting lightning.

535
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,530
Secondly, I've verified that.

536
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,070
Due to the soil composition,

537
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,310
that lightning rod

538
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,050
wasn't completely perpendicular to the ground.

539
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,000
It had an error exceeding

540
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,680
0.3% of the standard allowance.

541
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,890
Therefore,

542
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,600
it's entirely possible for lightning to strike here.

543
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,280
Most importantly...

544
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,840
the evidence is irrefutable.

545
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,860
Adviser Xu...

546
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,350
you're already very excellent.

547
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,270
But some things

548
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,830
can't be solved just by finding melted beads

549
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,960
or watching videos.

550
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,410
Have you learned something from this?

551
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,390
Officer Shen!

552
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,210
The workers in the factory

553
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,240
were a bit agitated just now!

554
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,320
We're so sorry!

555
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,520
We apologize to you!

556
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,460
Say you're sorry.

557
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,590
-We're sorry, Officer Shen!
-We're sorry, Officer Shen!

558
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,590
Please don't hold grudges against us!

559
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,940
Let's have tea sometime!

560
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,180
D-Do you still want to go into the factory

561
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,330
to investigate further?

562
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,080
Xu.

563
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,580
What do you think about what he said today?

564
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,150
Xu?

565
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,240
Xu!

566
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,110
Tell me, what are the odds

567
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,470
of me getting struck by lightning?

568
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,640
The probability is way too small.

569
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,650
Then, how could it possibly strike over there?

570
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,580

00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,400
Elderly people's illnesses

762
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,650
often come on suddenly.

763
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,280
At those times,

764
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,360
if there's no one around,

765
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,130
it can be very dangerous.

766
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,110
Fortunately, we've stabilized his condition today.

767
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:04,840
Dad.

768
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,030
Dad, you're awake?

769
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,070
With your condition,

770
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,460
you need to take your blood pressure medication on time.

771
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,800
Did you not take it today?

772
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,760
Yes.

773
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,820
The medicine should be taken after meals, right?

774
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,430
You didn't have dinner?

775
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,770
How can you be so careless

776
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,630
about your own health?

777
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,110
Doctor...

778
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,700
this... this is my fault.

779
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,230
It's my father's birthday today.

780
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,920
He wanted to wait for me to come back for dinner,

781
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,710
so... so...

782
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,360
Young man,

783
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,400
I understand you're busy with work,

784
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,280
but you should also make time

785
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,260
to take care of your family.

786
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,470
Do you know

787
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,690
what they also call hypertension?

788
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,220
The silent killer.

789
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,280
Many patients

790
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,510
develop symptoms without any

791
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,260
prior warning signs.

792
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,130
Do you know what complications

793
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,550
this disease may cause?

794
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,440
Coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction...

795
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,280
Alright, alright.

796
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,320
Please... please don't say any more.

797
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,920
What should I do for my dad now?

798
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,640
Put your work aside for now,

799
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,960
spend some quality time with him,

800
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,650
and take care of him.

801
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,500
Let's have your father

802
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,520
stay in the hospital for observation for a few days.

803
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,340
T-Thank you for your hard work, Doctor.

804
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,110
Dad.

805
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,240
Dad, I was wrong.

806
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:25,980
Dad.

807
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,940
I really was wrong.

808
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,850
I won't go anywhere for the next few days.

809
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,460
I'll stay here

810
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,040
to take care of you.

811
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,000
I'll call my team right now

812
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,140
to ask for leave.

813
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,840
I'm hungry.

814
