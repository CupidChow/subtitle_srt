00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,880
to speak in front of those entrepreneurs,

383
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,970
you know, to share their experiences.

384
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,630
No way.

385
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,750
Why not?

386
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,630
You can't ask Tongsheng, that's not okay.

387
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
I know.

388
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,480
Well...

389
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,400
But I don't have

390
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,640
other way now.

391
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,070
Besides,

392
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,780
Tongsheng himself has agreed to it.

393
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,220
How can you only think about yourself?

394
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,440
When Tongsheng came to the institution,

395
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,030
what was the situation?

396
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,100
Don't you know?

397
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,030
And you still want him to share his experience?

398
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,920
To repeatedly talk about his own experiences?

399
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,370
Aren't you just rubbing salt

400
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,210
into his wounds?

401
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,810
I understand Tongsheng's situation better than you do.

402
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,960
I had no other choice.

403
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,350
Look at these children of mine.

404
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,900
Aren't they even younger?

405
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,110
I can't just stand by and

406
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,000
watch them leave me,

407
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,060
can I?

408
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,450
I don't care what you do,

409
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,030
but you can't ask Tongsheng for help.

410
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,850
Then help me find the money.

411
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,680
Didn't I help you prepare

412
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,630
the presentation?

413
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,110
Preparing a presentation and finding someone

414
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,200
are two different things.

415
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,170
As long as we have someone to speak from experience,

416
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,000
those entrepreneurs

417
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,200
will understand us better.

418
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,930
Enough, enough, enough.

419
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,100
No matter what you say,

420
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,550
you always have your own reasons.

421
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,520
I'm tired of arguing with you.

422
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,280
Then help me find the money!

423
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,450
It's really hard to write a commendation report.

424
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,310
Serves you right.

425
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,740
You don't understand.

426
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,370
Have you ever seen

427
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,240
a bouquet toss at a wedding?

428
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,240
This is like

429
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,760
the bride's bouquet.

430
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,760
If you catch it,

431
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,240
you'll be the next bride.

432
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,630
As they say,

433
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,760
today my Idol reads my script,

434
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,400
tomorrow it'll be my turn to read.

435
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,160
But the problem is,

436
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,370
don't you need to have a bouquet first?

437
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,440
Okay, write it like this:

438
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,100
All members  of the Fire Rescue Brigade

439
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,720
work together with one heart...

440
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,830
Right.

441
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,400
Each displaying...

442
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,350
Idol, wait for me a moment.

443
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,390
I'll finish it soon.

444
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,810
No need to write anymore.

445
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,030
This way, please.

446
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:58,880
Well.

447
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,160
This is our...

448
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,090
Adviser Xu, right?

449
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,590
Hello, hello, hello.

450
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,520
You're truly talented and handsome.

451
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,370
Let's start the interview then.

452
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:08,900
Let's do it over here.

453
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,350
Come.

454
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,780
Let's go over here to set things up.

455
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,400
Idol,

456
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,720
we're going to be on a live stream.

457
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,880
Let me tidy you up a bit.

458
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,540
Mao Mao,

459
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,560
you go in a bit.

460
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,240
No, let's go together.

461
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,370
It's fine, you go ahead.

462
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,960
Stop messing around.

463
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,000
Let's go help.

464
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,850
Coming, coming.

465
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:25,710
How is it?

466
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,550
I'm not late, am I?

467
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,560
There was some traffic on the way.

468
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,480
They just arrived.

469
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,630
Captain Shen.

470
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,400
Hello, hello, hello.

471
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,320
Sorry to keep you waiting.

472
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,160
You two are really

473
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,320
not only outstanding in solving cases,

474
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,830
but also so handsome.

475
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,670
Oh please, cut it out.

476
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,520
Let's get started.

477
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,160
Okay, okay, okay.

478
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,980
[China Fire Rescue]

479
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,270
Hurry up, Xu, come on.

480
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:41,950
Come on.

481
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,200
It's this way, right?

482
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,130
Yes, yes, yes, right here.

483
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,200
Let's use this side as the background.

484
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,920
Which side?

485
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,590
This side as the background, right?

486
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,170
Yes, yes, yes.

487
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,490
We'll sit here.

488
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,160
Okay.

489
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,360
Thank you very much for your explanation, Officer Shen.

490
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,030
So, next,

491
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,360
I'd like to ask Adviser Xu a question.

492
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,080
How did you come up with

493
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,160
such an unusual

494
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,970
method of electrical fire ignition?

495
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,960
What implications does this have

496
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,130
for the special rectification of three-in-one premises?

497
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,900
Many things have reasons behind them.

498
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,670
How could it be dismissed as just an accident

499
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,920
and be covered up?

500
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,770
Moreover, everything follows cause and effect.

501
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,550
If the cause is like this,

502
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,190
how could it possibly lead to such a result?

503
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,350
Let me say a few words.

504
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,910
It's like this.

505
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,200
Three-in-one premises

506
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,380
have a lot of combustible materials,

507
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,470
inadequate fire safety facilities,

508
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,350
and people with weak

509
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,270
fire safety awareness.

510
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,640
In the event of a fire,

511
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,050
it's highly likely to cause mass casualties,

512
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,910
posing a huge threat

513
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,250
to people's lives and property.

514
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,930
In this case of the three-in-one restaurant fire,

515
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,040
the main responsibility

516
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,000
lies with the factory.

517
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,620
However, the restaurant itself

518
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,130
should also enhance fire safety awareness

519
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,560
[Live]

520
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,470
and set up effective fire compartments.

521
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,420
Let me ask Adviser Xu another question.

522
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,590
Ducheng Processing Factory,

523
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,040
in this case,

524
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,310
hired a private fire investigator.

525
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,000
How does this

526
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,350
affect you?

527
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:54,850
Let me address this.

528
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,690
The involvement of these so-called

529
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,050
fire investigation experts

530
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,750
has a certain impact

531
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,970
on us public officials

532
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,840
handling the case.

533
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,220
The report from the Fire Investigation Department

534
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,980
is not just a piece of paper.

535
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,970
It's a responsibility.

536
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,110
It involves economic allocation

537
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,790
and responsibility assignment issues.

538
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,890
Fire scenes are complex.

539
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,500
Our public fire investigators

540
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,490
need to be highly professional

541
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,030

542
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,910

search for evidence,

544
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,140
and quickly

545
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,210
provide the public

546
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,230
with the truth.

547
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,110
One last question,

548
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,990
Officer Shen.

549
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,550
The truth behind the restaurant fire

550
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,850
turned out to be illegal mining by the factory,

551
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,980
causing this tragedy.

552
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,000
What lessons

553
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,050
can we learn from this?

554
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,730
Actually, I've always suspected

555
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,000
that the truth behind this restaurant fire case

556
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,910
could it really be...

557
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,130
Ducheng Processing Factory's

558
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,000
unauthorized mining activities

559
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,120
are prohibited by the state.

560
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,440
It's illegal

561
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,770
and something that we,

562
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,880
the public security organs, must crack down on severely.

is not feeling well today.

570
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,540
To complete the mission,

571
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,880
you didn't need to tell them those things.

572
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,230
Shen Ye,

573
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,620
trust me,

574
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,450
there must be something wrong with this matter.

575
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,690
Fan Yi might be the breakthrough point.

576
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,360
Don't you think

577
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,820
he's acting strange?

578
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,030
How is he strange?

579
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,970
And how do we break through?

580
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,240
I haven't figured that out yet.

581
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,910
I think you're becoming obsessed.

582
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm starting to get obsessed too, following you.

583
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,440
Don't you think life

584
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,640
is sometimes just like this?

585
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,590
Everyone encounters difficulties.

586
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,240
Some people encounter fewer,

587
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,860
but perhaps one difficulty

588
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,060
spans their entire life.

589
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,030
Some people encounter many,

590
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,640
and their journey

591
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,830
is full of stumbles and setbacks.

592
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,210
But eventually, they'll get through it.

593
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,570
Things are as they are now.

594
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,090
Why don't we look forward?

595
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,470
Take some time alone to think.

596
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,540
I believe you'll figure it out.

597
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,130

I'm here to take my son home.

Shen Ye is all grown up now.

He can go home by himself.

608
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,760
Why did you come here

without telling me?

610
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,450
The team has been,

611
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,740
quite busy lately.

612
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,730
I understand.

The last time I saw you

was on a live stream.

It's okay, I'll leave you to it.

619

Since I'm free, I came to see you.

Dad, please don't say that.

623
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,240
Right.

624
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,650
I shouldn't have said that.

625
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,430
I shouldn't have come at all.

626
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,090

Wouldn't that be nice?

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,300
Why do I have to bother my child?

By the way, Ye,

640
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,640
I've heard that recently

641
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,110
you've been working overtime and not going home.

642
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,130
What's going on?

643
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,640
Isn't it good that I'm being more diligent?

644
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,720
This is exactly in line with your

645
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,750
constant teachings to us.

646
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,310
No, being diligent is a good thing,

647
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:52,970
but you can't

648
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,330
neglect your family.

649
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,000

It doesn't look good.

653
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,270
I've already talked to my dad about this.

654
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,010
If you can't even manage things at home,

655
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,860
I'm not trying to criticize you, but

656
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,900
you won't be a good police officer either.

657
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,150
You should know when to stop it.

658
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,160
How's your study going recently?

659
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,630
It's still the same.

00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,910
twenty mutton kebabs, please.

762
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:58,760
Alright.

763
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,730
Tell us, Xu,

764
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,060
what's troubling you?

765
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,650
What else could he be worried about?

766
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,310
It's probably just about the case, isn't it?

767
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,320
What else could it be

768
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,130
that he cares about?

769
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,550
It seems like I'm the one who said that.

770
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,410
You registered it

771
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,260
so I can't say it?

772
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,670
Alright, alright, it's yours.

773
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,420
If you don't want to talk about it, forget it.

774
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,300
Chun,

775
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,440
why don't you tell us what's wrong?

776
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,120
Okay, I'll go first then.

777
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,860
Why don't you want to go home?

778
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:26,970
Well...

779
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,530
Alright, I'll speak first.

780
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,730
I'm currently facing

781
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,960
a serious mid-life crisis.

782
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,690
If I don't handle it well,

783
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,490
I might have to retire early.

784
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,160
That serious?

785
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,240
What happened?

786
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,980
My dad has been

787
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,340
really neurotic lately.

788
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,430
Today he came to find me at the station.

789
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,680
Although he didn't make a scene,

790
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,370
I feel that

791
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,070
his patience

792
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,260
has reached its limit.

793
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,390
Don't you think

794
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,410
there's something wrong with his behavior?

795
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,510
It's quite problematic,

796
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,870
and extremely baffling.

797
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,210
Shen Ye, it's not without reason.

798
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,260
Actually, Shen Yi...

799
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,900
Actually,

800
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,380
this baffling behavior,

801
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,730
there must be a reason for it.

802
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,330
So why is he acting so strangely?

803
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,960
I think my dad

804
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,040
might be going through andropause.

805
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,550
I looked it up online.

806
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,830
Many men

807
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,970
at this age

808
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,390
become very peculiar.

809
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,400
Really.

810
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,930
Isn't your dad acting strange?

811
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,540
My dad isn't strange,

812
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,440
but my mom is.

813
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,120
Right,

814
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,840
your mom keeps pushing you to go on blind dates, right?

815
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,520
Don't mention blind dates again.

816
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,210
I get annoyed just hearing those two words.

817
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,860
Come on, let's drink to our troubles.

818
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
Xu, eat more.

819
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,040
We ordered so much.

820
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,350
Chun,

821
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,030
have you ever rebelled from childhood to now?

822
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,940
Yes, I have.

823
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,490
Now I'm working as a forensic doctor.

824
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,970
It's the result of my rebellion.

825
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,530
Didn't Auntie approve of you becoming a forensic doctor?

826
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,400
She wanted me to study medicine.

827
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,920
I wanted to be a police officer.

828
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:52,930
So I combined the two,

829
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,760
killing two birds with one stone,

830
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,830
becoming a forensic doctor.

831
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,940
But the funniest thing is,

832
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,180
I finished my studies,

833
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,130
and she didn't even know

834
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,620
that I was actually studying forensic medicine.

835
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,550
How did you keep it from her?

836
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,400
I didn't need to hide it.

837
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,000
Because for these past few years,

838
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,000
she never once asked

839
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,080
what major I was studying.

840
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,510
Until I graduated,

841
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,120
she found out I studied forensic medicine.

842
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,540
She was very angry,

843
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,800
because she couldn't accept

844
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,400
that I would be

845
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,820
working with dead bodies all day.

846
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:13,730
Let me tell you,

847
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,510
this could only be you.

848
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,280
If it were me,

849
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,480
I definitely couldn't have kept it from my dad.

850
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,300
That just shows your dad

851
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,700
really cares about you.

852
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,110
No,

853
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,510
it's very likely that I grew up

854
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,050
in a single-parent family.

855
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,620
My dad has been watching me closely

856
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,980
since I was little.

857
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,830
Plus, now that he's getting older,

858
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,300
he's afraid someone might lead me astray.

859
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:32,820
You know,

860
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,370
whether I'm working

861
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:34,890
overtime

862
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,340
or I don't have time to keep him company,

863
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,150
no matter what,

864
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,370
I'm still his son, right?

865
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,600
Are you really his son?

866
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,900
Xu, you're at it again.

867
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,900
That day when we were hiking, you told me

868
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,460
your childhood dream

869
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,720
was to be a painter, right?

870
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,770
I remember you said

871
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,280
you wanted to build robots when you were little,

872
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:52,820
didn't you?

873
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,990
How did you end up becoming a police officer?

874
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,230
My dad told me

875
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,190
I used to draw when I was little...

876
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,360
Your dad told you that?

877
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,480
Can you really draw?

878
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,760
Of course I can draw, Xu.

879
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,780
What kind of joke is this?

880
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,800
All those paintings on our walls at home,

881
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,760
aren't they all painted by me?

882
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,400
Alright then.

883
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,280
Uncle,

884
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,980
give me a pen and a piece of paper.

885
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,000
Well...

886
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,960
What's all this about drawing?

887
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,680
We haven't even finished eating these skewers.

888
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,360
Come on, draw.

889
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,370
Draw something for me to see.

890
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:29,790
What's wrong?

891
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,320
Can't draw, can you?

892
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,870
That's right, you can't draw.

893
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,000
See for yourself.

894
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,880
[Miracle moment of Little Painter]

895
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:38,370
[Miracle moment of Little Painter]

896
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,590
Is one of them yours?

897
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,820
[Miracle moment of Little Painter]

898
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,220
Did you paint any of these?

899
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,090
[Miracle moment of Little Painter]

900
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,390
Because your name isn't even Shen Ye.

901
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,610
Your name is He Xi.

902
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,290
Shen Yi is not your biological father.

903
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,720
Everything about you is fabricated.

904
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,920
You only have one relative,

905
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,900
your grandmother.

906
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,270
She's waiting for you at the nursing home.

908
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,600
Impossible!

909
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,030
Impossible!

910
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,440
No, absolutely not.

911
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,450
How I grew up as a child,

912
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,010
don't I know?

913
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,170
My father told me

914
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,120
my mother passed away early

915
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,140
and he raised me.

916
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:07,920
My father told me...

917
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,710
Your father told you.

918
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,280
Your father told you.

919
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,700
Everything was told to you by your father.

920
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,560
Are you allergic to shrimp?

921
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,750
Are you really allergic?

922
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,960
That time at my house,

923
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,710
in the noodles you ate,

924
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,960
I put shrimp paste.

925
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,030
Did you have an allergic reaction?

926
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,030
Tongsheng.

00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,130

Xu Tongsheng.

930
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,870
You came to me before,

931
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,400
hoping I would help you

932
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,630
recover his memories together.

933
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,940
But what are you doing now?

934
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,780
About the shrimp incident,

935
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,800
did you ever tell me about it?

936
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,240
About the painting,

937
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,720
did you ever mention it to me?

938
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,190
Today, do you really have to use

939
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,430
such an extreme method

940
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,580
to stimulate him?

941
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,620
Haven't I told you

942
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,350
recovering memories

943
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,870
is not a matter of a day or two?

944
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,080
The trigger spot needs to be found through multiple attempts.

945
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,230
If you're going to do this,

946
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,680
how can I possibly help you?

947
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,340
I'm leaving first.

948
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,060
My father told me

Your father told you.

953

That time at my house,

your grandmother.

She's waiting for you at the nursing home.

968
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,430
The shrimp peeled by grandma
