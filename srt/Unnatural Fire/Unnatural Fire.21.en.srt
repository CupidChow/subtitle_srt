You haven't been home for days.

4
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,150
Every day, I couldn't see you.

5
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,300
And now, I finally get to see you.

6
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,550
I see you in the hospital.

7
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,039
You have no idea,

8
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,770
when I just received that phone call,

9
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,400
my blood pressure

10
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,680
shot up instantly.

11
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,290
Everything went black before my eyes.

12
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,590
I couldn't even walk straight.

13
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,630
What am I going to do with you, son?

14
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,050
If anything happened to you,

15
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,630

Why are you just staring at me?

17
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,579
I'm already so upset,

18
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,900
and you're not saying anything to comfort me.

19
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,460
What's wrong, son?

20
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,020
Did you have serious problems because of that accident?

21
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,040
I'm hungry.

22
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,030

Slow down, slow down.

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,280
Come on.

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,490
Just make do with this.

28
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,690
This boxed meal certainly can't compare to my home cooking.

29

While you're eating, you need to tell me

30
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,210
how exactly you ended up in a car accident.

31
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,750
It was really nothing.

32
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,190
I was just careless.

33

You're such a steady person.

34

You've never had a car accident, even when chasing criminals.

35

How could you suddenly be "careless"?

37
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,510

38
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,000
I really was just careless.

39
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,210
Just let me finish my meal.

40

Go ahead and eat.

If you say you were careless,

43
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,820
then so be it.

44
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,620
But I'm telling you, in your current condition,

45

You tell me.

63
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
How did you just speak to him?

64
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,600
He's usually so steady

Are you asking me?

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,330
why he had a car accident?

90
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,400
I should be the one asking you that.

91
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,720
Before the accident, wasn't he

92
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
with you guys?

93
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,240
Yes, he was with us.

94
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,180
You were having a meal, right?

95

let's lay everything out.

100
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,690
What's going on here?

101
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,830
Why has my son been

102
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,820
through a lot

103
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,340
when he has been with you lately?

104
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,340
First, he had a severe allergic reaction to shrimp.

105
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,250
He nearly died.

106
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,040
And then,

107
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,240
he's been working around the clock with you

108
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,430
on cases.

109
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,980
I never get to see him,

110
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,580
and he can't even eat the meals I cook.

111
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,020
He doesn't even check in with me anymore.

112
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,540
And now,

113
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,030
he's had a car accident.

114
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,210
Is it

115
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,790
that if he stays with you any longer,

116
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,700
I'll lose my son forever?

117
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,790
Uncle Shen,

118
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,500
you're taking this too seriously.

119
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,510
Besides,

120
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,070
Shen Ye knows what he's doing.

121
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,270

For outsiders like you,

125
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,560
it's just "an accident."

126
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,470
But I'm his father.

127
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,360
I can't bear these "accidents."

128
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,410

130
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,870
then stay away from him.

exactly what I mean.

Ridiculous.

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,360
Let me find some of their profiles for you.

193
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,080
No need, no need.

194
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:57,960
I'm just here

195
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,160
to find Mr. Shen Yi.

196
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:00,760
Young man,

197
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,030
let me tell you,

198
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,200
Mr. Shen is not good.

199
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,510
My kid

200
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,830
took his class before.

201
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,840
I'm telling you, the discipline was terrible.

202
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,360
Yeah.

203
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,080
Mr. Shen

204
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,320
only focuses on his own experiments

205
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,650
and doesn't manage the children at all.

206
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,680
This is our

207
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,470
Mr. Wang's profile.

208
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,600
You can take a look first.

209
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,680
No need. It's like this.

210
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,000
My nephew

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,790
took Mr. Shen's class before

212
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,820
and really liked him.

213
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,730
So I made a special trip here

214
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,120
to thank him.

215
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,970
I'm sorry,

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,480
but Mr. Shen Yi has already resigned.

217
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,000
Resigned?

218
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,910
Yes, he left not too long ago.

219
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,860
Resigned?

220
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,110
I don't get it—

221
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,960
at his age,

222
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,320
how can he be such a poor teacher?

223
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,000
Thank you.

224
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,020
You know what,

225
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,200
I heard that this Mr. Shen

226
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,150
is a professor at the Binjiang University of Technology.

227
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,620
If he is really a university professor,

228
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,270
why would he come here

229
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,360
to teach children?

230
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,860
I think your daughter's teacher

231
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,670
would be more suitable.

232
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,000
Excuse me,

233
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,000
I'd like to ask about something.

234
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,490
Where did the patient named Shen Ye

235
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,670
in bed nine go?

236
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,140
He was discharged this morning.

237
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,530
Discharged?

238
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,410
Shouldn't he

239
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,620
be under observation for a few more days?

240
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,000
It was the patient's father

241
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,150
who requested an early discharge.

242
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,110
And the patient had recovered well,

243
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,420
so the doctor allowed him to be discharged.

244
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,540
He just needs to come back for regular check-ups.

245
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,830
Alright, thank you for your help.

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,710
Hello,

249
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,030
the subscriber you have dialed is powered off.

250
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,810
Sorry...

251
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,870
Hello,

252
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,150
this is the office of

253
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,870
Binjiang University of Technology.

254
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,370
Hello,

255
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,620
I'm Xu Tongsheng, the adviser from

256
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,910
the Fire Investigation Department of the Fire Brigade.

257
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,280
It's like this.

258
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,630
I have a few questions about

259
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,270
Mr. Shen Yi

260
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,210
that I'd like to ask you.

261
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,290
Are you available right now?

262
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,210
May I come over?

263
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,530
I'm sorry,

264
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,880
but we're about to finish work.

265
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,230
Why don't you come back tomorrow?

266
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,280
Alright.

267
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,350
Thank you then.

268
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,290
Stop knocking.

269
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,360
That family isn't home.

270
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,910
I'm sorry.

271
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,690
Hey, Chun.

272
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,870
Hey, Danggui.

273
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,900
Have you been in touch

274
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,110
with Shen Ye in the past few days?

275
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,530
Captain Shen has taken leave.

276
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,970
He hasn't contacted me these past few days.

277
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,340
Why don't you try his place?

278
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,760
I'm at his place right now.

279
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,630
No one's home.

280
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,200
Then I have no idea.

281
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,030
Alright, got it.

282
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,160

283
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,080
[Xu Tongsheng]

284
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,480
[Xu Tongsheng]

285
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,490
[Where are you?]

286
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,780
[I went to the hospital to see you, but they said you...]

287
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,190
Where are you?

288
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,610
I went to the hospital to see you, but they said you had been discharged.

289
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,660
You're not at home either.

290
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,580
Are you okay now?

291
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,240
Let me know when you see this.

292
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,520
Even just an emoji would be fine.

293
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,570
[Shen Ye]

294
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,870
Hey, Chun.

295
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,910
Hey, Senior.

296
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,810
Yesterday,

297
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,870
I went to visit a colleague of mine

298
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,790
named Shen Ye.

299
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,680
I'd like to ask

300
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,320
how he's doing now.

301
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,290
Shen Ye...

302
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,220
His injuries weren't severe.

303
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,280
Although he was discharged early,

304
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,470
he had already recovered

305
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,430
quite well by then.

306
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,850
In principle,

307
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,420
there shouldn't be any further deterioration.

308
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,980
When does he need a follow-up?

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,230
He's scheduled it for today.

310
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,180
It should be about time.

311
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,280
Senior,

312
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
could you please keep him there for me?

313
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,510
I'll come over right away.

314
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,080
Okay.

315
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,600
Okay.

316
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,840
Please come in.

317
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,570
Hello.

318
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,780
I'm Xu Tongsheng, the adviser from

319
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,250
the Fire Investigation Department of the Fire Brigade.

320
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,460
Hello.

321
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,080
You're the one who called yesterday

322
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,380
asking about Mr. Shen Yi, right?

323
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,050
Yes, that's me.

324
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,060
Nice to meet you.

325
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,100
Please wait a moment.

326
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,120
Here, please have a seat.

327
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,870
Okay, thank you.

328
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,240
Please sit.

329
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,480
After receiving your call yesterday,

330
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,030
I thought about it.

331
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,280
The name, Shen Yi...

332
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,490
does sound familiar.

333
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,380
So,

334
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,770
I specifically looked him up

335
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,030
in our system today.

336
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,700
He was

337
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,780
indeed a teacher

338
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,870
here before,

339
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,440
but I'm not familiar with him.

340
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,480
If you don't mind my asking,

341
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,810
what's wrong

342
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,090
with Mr. Shen Yi

343
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,030
that requires you

344
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,210
to come here specifically to ask about him?

345
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,530
Stand properly.

346
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,360
Nurse.

347
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,130
Nurse, we're here for a follow-up.

348
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,030
Shen Ye.

349
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,740
Shen Ye.

350
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,480
Patient, please come with me.

351
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:11,640
This way.

352
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,030
Let's go.

353
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,099
I'm sorry,

354
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,140
but hospital regulations state

355
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,670
that patient's family members

356
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,920
must wait outside.

357
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,609
Alright then.

358
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,670
He's not feeling well.

359
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,890
Please take care of him for me.

360
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,800
Sure, don't worry.

361
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,960
Come on, be careful.

362
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,670
Slow down.

363
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,280
If you put it that way,

364
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,980
I do recall something.

365
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,930
About...

366
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,310
ten or so years ago,

367
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,790
there was an explosion

368
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,390
in our laboratory.

369
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,590
The person in charge at that time...

370
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,990
was named Shen Yi.

371
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,610
And this incident

372
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,160
is brought up every year

373
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,620
as a negative example

374
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,460
of the laboratory's fire safety,

375
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,100
so that's why it sounds familiar.

376
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,220
Do you know the specific details

377
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,100
of what happened back then?

378
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,920
I hadn't been transferred here at that time,

379
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
so I'm not familiar

380
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,290
with the details.

381
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,920
I can't tell you much about it.

382

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,630
Why do you think?

575
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,070
Because your organizational affiliation

576
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,060
is originally with the unit.

577
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,320
How long you're temporarily transferred here

578
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,460
is up to me.

579
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,540
Director Zhao,

580
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,590
you never submitted the revised conclusions

581
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,690
for the old cases

582
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,510
to the criminal investigation department, right?

583
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,660
I don't need you

584
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,740
to teach me how to do my job.

585
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,140
Go back right now.

586
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,420
Get back to your unit!

587
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,960
No matter where I go,

588
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,110
I will find out the truth.

589
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,720
Shen Yi must

590
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,230
give Shen Ye some kind of drug again.

591
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,350
Drug?

592
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,400
Could Captain Shen be in danger?

593
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,580
Let's call the police.

594
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,760
Have you forgotten

595
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,290
you're also a police officer?

596
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,000
Do we have any actual evidence

597
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,750
that can prove

598
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,440
Shen Yi deliberately

599
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,400
wanted to harm his son?

600
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,480
Besides,

601
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,740
Shen Ye trusts him so much.

602
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,440
Chun.

603
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,620
He bought so many groceries.

604
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,260
I guess he's

605
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,620
not planning to go out anytime soon.

606
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,490
So what should we do?

607
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,510
Hello?

608
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,190
Chun,

609
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,400
I need Shen Ye's help,

610
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,200
but for some reason,

611
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,090
I can't reach him.

612
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,560
Where are you?

613
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,510
I'm at the Fire Investigation Department.

614
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,650
Wait for me there.

615
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,720
I happen to have something to tell you.

616
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,630
See you in a bit.

617
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,230
Take me to the Fire Investigation Department.

618
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,830
I can find

619
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,380
someone unfamiliar to come over while I'm there.

620
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,920
Shen Yi knows you too well.

621
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,260
Tongsheng.

622
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,820
Where's Shen Ye?

623
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,200
I need his help to investigate Shen Yi.

624
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,240
I know where he is.

625
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,390
Take a look at this first.

626
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,940
What's this?

627
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,110
Shen Yi has been giving Shen Ye

628
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,200
a large amount of drugs

629
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,920
and has cut off

630
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,150
his contact with the outside world.

631
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,920
Shen Ye has been missing for two days.

632
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,190
None of us can reach him.

633
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,770
How is he now?

634
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,210
He's been locked up by Shen Yi.

635
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,210
I know the address.

636
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,830
I've already reported the situation

637
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,250
to the captain.

638
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,440
He asked us to find a way

639
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,450
to save Shen Ye first,

640
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,700
and he'll handle the rest.

641
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,430

642
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,840

Who is it?

00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,530
Hello, you have a local express delivery.

647
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,290
I didn't order any local express delivery service.

648
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,440
701. This is the place.

649
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,550
That's right.

I've already reported to Chief Wu.

Fortunately,

657
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,030
Danggui mentioned to me

658
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,920
that Shen Ye keeps a spare key in his office.

659
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,420
I'm talking to you!

660
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,240
Stop!

661
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,150
Professor Shen.

662
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,100
We meet again.

663
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,720
What do you mean by this?

664
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,990
There are some things...

665
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,760
I don't want Shen Ye to hear,

666
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,120
so I made you meet me here.

667
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,170
I have nothing to talk to you about.

668
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,120
I know everything you've done.

669
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,180
He Xi!

670
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,220
You're very familiar with this name, aren't you?

671
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,720
Wh-What's wrong?

672
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,580
There's a surveillance camera in the living room.

673
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,620
If the camera can also listen in,

674
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,300
what if Shen Yi is listening?

675
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,510
What should we do now?

676
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,360
We can't get in anymore.

677
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,650
Tongsheng, are you there?

678
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,160
There is a camera in Shen Yi's living room.

679
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,070
I don't know if there's

680
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,050
audio monitoring too.

681
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:05,830
Check

682
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,540
if Shen Yi is wearing

683
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,650
an earpiece.

684
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,520
If he is,

685
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,760
just cough once.

686
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,530
He coughed twice.

687
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,240
No audio monitoring.

688
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,200
No, that's not right.

689
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,660
That means there's both audio monitoring

690
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,720
and the video feed.

691
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,110
How did you figure that out?

692
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,850
Tacit understanding.

693
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,050
Let me tell you a story.

694
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,960
Twenty years ago...

695
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,790
Professor Shen

696
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,530
was in charge of an experimental project.

697
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,690
At that time, he was truly...

698
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,430
renowned and full of ambition.

699
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,480
And that experimental project

700
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,100
carried all of his ambitions.

701
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,360
However,

702
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,450
this project

703
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,750
didn't go smoothly.

704
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,890
After yet another failure,

705
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,060
Professor Shen decided to take a reckless gamble.

706
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,030
But this decision...

707
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,550
also led to devastating consequences.

708
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,610
That's all in the newspapers.

709
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,970
You called me here just to say this?

710
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,210
I'm saying all this

711
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
to remind you

712
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,210
that He Xi's father

713
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,200
died because of you.

714
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,960
If you have something to say, just say it.

715
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,940
Shen Ye is He Xi.

716
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,880
He Runian, whom you caused to die,

717
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,200
was his real father.

718
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,050
I'll tell you one more time.

719
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,180
He didn't die because of me.

720
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,360
That experiment was just an accident.

721
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,640
His death pained me too.

722
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,770
Then what was your purpose

723
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,640
in adopting him?

724
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,410
Purpose?

725
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,550
My colleague passed away.

726
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,520
Out of kindness,

727
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,400
I adopted his child.

728
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,330
Is that wrong?

729
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,840
You forged his identity,

730
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,810
[Draw a Beautiful Future]

731
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,880
fabricated his past,

732
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,440
and made him believe

733
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,840
that you were his biological father.

734
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,150
Why did you do all of that?

735
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,900
The doctor told me not to tell him.

736
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,920
He had completely lost his memory at that time.

737
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,360
I didn't want him to suffer

738
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,230
secondary trauma,

739
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,920
so I concealed his past.

740
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,000
What's wrong? It's as simple as that.

741
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,170
You've been drugging him

742
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,550
and still say you don't want to hurt him?

743
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,750
Adviser Xu.

744
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,800
You're being overly concerned about

745
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,420
my family affairs, aren't you?

746
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,030
I'll say it again, just like I did that night

747
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,560
at the hospital.

748
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,840
You have no right

749
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,310
to interfere in matters between my son and me.

750
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,600

751
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,120

Shen Ye.

00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,670
Get him out of here first.

How did he get like this?

781
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,710
It's probably

782
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,310
caused by some kind of sleeping medication.

Not exactly.

00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,000
