00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,600
Especially those in large pots.

193
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,600
Some are very valuable

194
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,200
and can't be bought just with money.

195
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,770
If you use the rake

196
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,040
to damage

197
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,870
all its roots...

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,320
it won't be able to absorb nutrients

199
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,240
and will die.

200
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,670
It's like

201
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,720
if someone knocked out all your teeth,

202
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,900
how would you eat?

203
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,180
Wouldn't you starve to death?

204
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,880
We both hope that these flowers

205
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,080
will bloom every year

206
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,360
and remain healthy, right?

207
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,180
You drew it really well.

208
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,710
[Binxi Branch Bureau of the Beixun Municipal Public Security Bureau]

209
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,840
Shen Yi could say something like...

210
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,720
"buying his life with money,"

211
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,510
which practically confirms

212
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,080
my earlier judgment.

213
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,460
He's been manufacturing drugs all along.

214
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,980
Actually, I should have realized that a long time ago.

215
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,590
There's no way he would've been content

216
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,530
with being just

217
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,500
some interest-based science teacher.

218
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,950
Ever since he was young,

219
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,930
he wanted to use his

220
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,240
talents in math, physics, and chemistry

221
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,520
to change his fate...

222
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,790
and make a name for himself.

223
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,920
Leaders,

224
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,390
we found the illicit funds at Shen Yi's home.

225
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,430
He himself has fled.

226
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,080
Found them?

227
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,550
He played a trick of hiding in plain sight.

228
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,000
The money was right in their house.

229
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,080
Good.

230
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,510
It's good that we've caught him.

231
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,120
He's escaped.

232
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,480
He's escaped?

233
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,230
Money is his life.

234
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,630
Earlier...

235
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,610
you could say that his academics were his life.

236
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,160
But...

237
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,120
ever since his academic path

238
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,870
was cut off

239
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,780
and he had a son,

240
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,400
his son has become his life.

241
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,370
Now, it's clear...

242
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,650
that Shen Ye doesn't acknowledge him anymore,

243
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,940
so all he has left now is money.

244
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,730
If he loses his money as well,

245
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,120
he will definitely become

246
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,320
a desperate fugitive.

247
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,360
So we must quickly find a way

248
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,080
to locate him.

249
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,120
Gu Nuo,

250
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,510
let me be direct with you.

251
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,550
We have cross-referenced

252
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,260
your and Shen Yi's backgrounds

253
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,680
and social networks.

254
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,710
After the incident with He Runian,

255
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,970
you two avoided meeting each other,

256
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,480
which has indeed

257
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,580
significantly affected our work.

258
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,270
However, we have still

259
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,320
managed to gather some leads.

260
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,640
Since I've chosen to turn myself in,

261
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,810
I have nothing to hide.

262
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,270
I will truthfully

263
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,240
report everything

264
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,870
to the organization

265
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,870
and to my superiors.

266
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,460
Shen Yi's performance in front of Shen Ye

267
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,910
was a bit exaggerated.

268
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,090
There are also gaps

269
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,260
in Shen Ye's memory.

270
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,510
It seems you've known

271
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,790
Shen Yi since childhood, right?

272
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,510
So, you're probably the one

273
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,930
who knows Shen Yi better than anyone else in this world,

274
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,620
right?

275
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,150
Then, from the perspective of

276
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,720
a criminal investigation expert, tell me

277
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,330
what incident or trait

278
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,510
best captures Shen Yi's

279
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,440
characteristics.

280
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,690
Don't worry if it's from long ago

281
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,540
or seems trivial.

282
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,470
You're right.

283
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,470
Shen Yi and I...

284
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,680
must have been destined in our previous lives.

285
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,420
He's one month older than me.

286
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,650
When I was born,

287
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,369
he was exactly one month old.

288
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,160
That day...

289
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,849
my mother had a difficult labor.

290
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,720
They said...

291
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,720
all the women in the village came to help.

292
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,530
They tried everything

293
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,069
for a whole day and night,

294
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,400
but I still hadn't been born.

295
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,680
My mother was in so much pain and exhaustion

296
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,640
that she passed out.

297
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,640
Later, she told me...

298
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,790
that in her dream,

299
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,000
she suddenly heard a baby crying.

300
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,640
That was Shen Yi.

301
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,140
My mother thought

302
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,590
it was me crying.

303
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,520
So, she gathered her courage

304
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,750
and used her last bit of strength

305
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,160
to finally give birth to me.

306
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,790
You were right earlier.

307
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,200
We've known each other since we were little...

308
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,200
and we've grown up together.

309
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,270
When we were kids,

310
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
we climbed trees together,

311
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,790
crawled into tree hollows, and dug holes in the ground.

312
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,880
We went to school together

313
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
and came home together.

314
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,880
Most importantly...

315
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,760
I was raised by his mother.

316
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,440
My own mother

317
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,830
passed away...

318
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,400
when I was 5.

319
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,150
Once I left that village,

320
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,640
I never went back.

321
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,640
Neither did he.

322
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,190
The only difference is

323
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,880
that I became a criminal police officer...

324
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,480
while he became a professor.

325
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,160
He was supposed to have a bright future.

326
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,740
But

327
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,700
the explosion at the BUT...

328
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,960
completely destroyed

329
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,340
everything for him.

330
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,780
He came to me for help.

331
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,260
I could have refused if it were someone else.

332
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,400
But it was him.

333
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,580
I chose to help him.

334
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,270
I helped him dispose of

335
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,720
He Runian's body.

336
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,400
I knew very well in my heart...

337
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,510
that this was the beginning of all the mistakes.

338
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,030
Once you cross that line

339
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,000
the first time,

340
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,030
there will inevitably be a second time.

341
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,790
After the second time,

342
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,230
there will be a third time.

343
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,350
Until there's no turning back.

344
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,540
Chief,

345
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,330
if you want to hear my opinion,

346
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,330
I suggest...

347
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,740
that to find Shen Yi as quickly as possible...

348
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,070
we should still look for

349
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,030
a breakthrough from Shen Ye.

350
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,590
Chief Wu.

351
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,450
I didn't expect

352
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,660
that Shen Yi would exploit this.

353
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,750
If I had known, I would have done

354
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,680
some desensitization exercises.

355
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,640
You don't need to beat yourself up so much.

356
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,750
Everyone has weaknesses.

357
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,400
You've already found the illicit funds

358
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,880
and identified Shen Yi as the suspect.

359
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,830
That's already

360
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,830
a major breakthrough in the case.

361
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,410
Then, have we confirmed

362
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
the source of those illicit funds?

363
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,850
The amount

364
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,200
basically matches what Gao Weiyuan

365
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,260
didn't get.

366
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,960
And the Anti-Narcotics Unit  has also found

367
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,310
information on clients

368
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,070
that Shen Yi had contacted before.

369
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,340
What about Shen Yi?

370
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,510
Any news?

371
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,880
It's been several days,

372
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,310
and there's no sign of him at all.

373
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,880
Shen Yi

374
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
is a person with very strong

375
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,110
counter-surveillance skills.

376
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,180
Actually, the best way

377
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,590
is to lure him out.

378
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,790
Any ideas?

379
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,640
Chief Wu,

380
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,950
this is today's newspaper.

381
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,810

00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,710
so I've already stated this

572
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,530
at the police station entrance.

573
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,449
I said I was deeply saddened

574
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,980
by his accident.

575
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,810
But...

576
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,030
if you insist on

577
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:34,739
asking these kinds of questions,

578
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,199
I...

579
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,920
I, as a researcher,

580
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,179
can only tell you

581
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,550
all such experiments that aim for...

582
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,170
this kind of breakthrough...

583
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,030
such experiments are all highly dangerous.

584
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,840
They are all extremely risky.

585
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,960
So, Professor He...

586
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,170
What about him?

587
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,060
He... He didn't die in vain.

588
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:50,830
Really, he...

589
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,370
His death also, well, made

590
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,420
tremendous contributions to...

591
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,260
to our country's scientific research.

592
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,400
Professor He didn't die in vain?

593
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:55,730
Yes.

594
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,550
So, you mean

595
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,800
Professor He's

596
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,740
death was justified?

597
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,630
I didn't mean that!

598
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,030
That's exactly what you just implied!

599
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,550
I didn't say he died in vain!

600
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,550
So, in your view,

601
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,560
scientific research is more important

602
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,910
than anything else, including human life?

603
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,830
Is that what you meant?

604
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,560
How can you interpret it that way?

605
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,880
For the sake of research...

606
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,810

607

Professor Shen! Professor Shen!

609
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,030
At such a critical moment,

610
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,490
how could you speak so carelessly?

611
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,450

how much impact this has

613

615
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,000
I didn't speak carelessly.

616
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,710
It's just that those reporters

617
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,550
were pressing me for answers...

618
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,030
so I told the truth.

620

There are plenty of "truths" in this world,

621
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,400
but does that mean you should speak every one of them?

622

Even the principal has come to me.

645
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,790
You'd better find a way
