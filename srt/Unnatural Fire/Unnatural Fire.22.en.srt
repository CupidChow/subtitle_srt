00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,680
and my biological father is He Runian.

386
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,720
He was also your colleague.

387
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,690
I don't believe anything they said.

388
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,720
I just want to hear it from you.

389

390
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,830
what happened back then?

391
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,470
I only remember

392
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,050
that day,

393
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,100
I saw you in the crowd.

394
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,970
Xi.

395
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,110
Xi?

396
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,350
You were so small,

397
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,790
and covered in dirt.

398
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,570
Xi, why are you here?

399
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,870
Your eyes were filled with fear.

400
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,970
Tell me.

401
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,430
What did you say?

402
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,880
You wouldn't answer any of my questions.

403
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,930
Louder.

404
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,820
Kid!

405
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,660
Then you fainted.

406
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,370
It's okay.

407
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,330
It's okay, Xi.

408
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,440
I didn't know

409
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,790
where to take you.

410
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,910
I could only bring you home.

411
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,940
But you gave me a new name.

412
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,870
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

413
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,220
The doctor advised me not to tell you.

414
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,570
You had amnesia.

415
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,440
No matter what I asked, you couldn't remember.

416
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,510
I was worried you'd be hurt again,

417
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,080
so I hid everything

418
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,960
from you.

419
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,970
But now, I know anyway.

420
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,190
It's been so many years.

421
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,640
I suddenly realized

422
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,840
everything in my life has been a lie!

423
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,680
My childhood is a lie.

424
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,940
My name is a lie.

425
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,620
Even my dad

426
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,150
is fake!

427
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,390
Do you think I can accept this?

428
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,790
But my feelings for you are real.

429
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,330
My love for you is real!

430
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,360
That was never a lie.

431
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,890
Yes,

432
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,670
your biological father and I

433
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,640
were not just colleagues.

434
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,130
We were also good friends.

435
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,190
I remember when you were very little,

436
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,670
I often visited your home.

437
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,540
I would hold you,

438
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,590
play with you,

439
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,100
and build blocks with you.

440
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,330
I was very envious at that time.

441
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,540
I thought

442
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,040
if only I could have

443
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,510
such an adorable child

444
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,480
of my own.

445
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,160
Later...

446
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,590
Later, an accident happened to your family.

447
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,510
And I had a chance to adopt you.

448
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,540
I treasured that chance.

449
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,270
I really did.

450
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,270
I started from scratch,

451
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,240
learning how to be a father.

452
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,390
I helped you with your homework,

453
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,470
went to your parent-teacher meetings,

454
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,470
and took you on spring outings and autumn trips.

455
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,510
I learned to cook for you.

456
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,400
Yes, I learned to cook for you.

457
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,860
I remember...

458
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,690
I remember every time

459
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,670
you ate every bit

460
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,110
of what I made

461
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,550
and

462
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,530
smiled happily,

463
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,760
I'd think...

464
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,590
I'd think

465
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,480
no... no matter what,

466
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,690
it'd be worth it.

467
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,580
I don't want to hear this!

468
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,420
There's only one thing I want to know.

469
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,370
Did you have anything to do with the death of He Runian,

470
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,020
my biological father?

471
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,080
I was responsible.

472
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,400
When the accident happened,

473
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,640
I was there.

474
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,460
But Ye,

475
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,090
I couldn't save him.

476
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,970
I couldn't save him.

477
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,350
That is also why I

478
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,640
have always felt I owe him.

479
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,960
Really.

480
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,320
But to say something I shouldn't,

481
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,960
I'm still grateful

482
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,480
that fate gave me the chance...

483
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,650
gave me the chance

484
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,420
to keep you by my side,

485
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,270
to love you in his place,

486
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,000
to give you a complete childhood,

487
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,030
and to give you a complete home.

488
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,720
But later, I realized

489
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,720
I didn't give you

490
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,110
a complete home.

491

495
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,720
how to be a good father.

496

What meaning would my life have?

504
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,310
So later,

505
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,140

506
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,800

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,100
Adviser Xu.

577
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,100
How did she go missing?

578
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,350
This is what happened.

579
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,360
Today, I saw Grandma

580
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,500
was in good condition,

581
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,240
so I took her for a walk in the garden.

582
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,180
Grandma said

583
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,510
she wanted a big leaf.

584
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,680
She... She wanted to pick one.

585
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,070
So I went to pick one for her.

586
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,110
But in the blink of an eye,

587
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,470
she disappeared.

588
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,610
I've searched the entire garden,

589
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,150
but I really couldn't find her.

590
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,860
Take me to check the surveillance footage.

591
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,890
Okay.

592
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,690
This way.

593
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,400
Okay.

[Camera 1] [Camera 2]

595
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,050
Is that all?

596
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,690
Yes.

597
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,190
Our surveillance facilities

598
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,190
are indeed limited.

599
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,130
She should still be in the nursing home.

600
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,220
Let's do this. Please notify

601
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,040
everyone who can help.

602
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,590
Ask them to help look for her.

603
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,360
Okay.

604
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,150
Take me

605
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,220
to where she disappeared.

606
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,010
Okay.

607
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,230
This way.

608
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,110
This is the garden.

609
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,320
I was right here

610
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,550
picking a leaf for Grandma.

611
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,290
When I turned around, she was gone.

612
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,230
Then let's do this.

613
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,610
We'll split up and look for her.

614
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,480
Okay.

615
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,670
My daughter said

616
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,880
she'll come back in a few days.

617
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,370
She'll visit me

618
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,980
and bring some local specialties there.

619
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,230
Sir, have you seen

620
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,800
an elderly lady about this tall?

621
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,480
No.

622
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,320
Grandma!

623
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,340
Grandma!

624
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,100
Hello, have you seen Grandma He?

625
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,400
No, I haven't.

626
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,290
Mr. Shen,

627
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,860
have you seen Grandma He?

628
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:21,740
No.

629
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,440
Sir, Madam,

630
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,760
have you seen Grandma He?

631
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,260
No.

632
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,690
No.

633
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,840
If you see her,

634
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,800
please contact me.

635
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,620
Okay.

636
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,260
Sir, Madam,

637
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,840
have you seen Grandma He?

638
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,830
No.

643
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,420
When we talk about the functions of the police,

644
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,790
it's not just about the functions

645
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,750
of police agencies or individual officers,

646
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,680
especially during the process of fulfilling the functions.

647
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,560
I hope that each department,

648
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,470
after you go back,

649
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,280
can carefully review

650
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,810
and submit the report as soon as possible,

651
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,600
regarding the issues

652
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,510
each department may have.

653
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:41,670
Okay?

654
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,260
I can tell you this.

This assessment

656
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:51,990
is actually

657
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,010
one of the priorities this year.

658
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,200
It needs to be combined

659
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,030
with the specific tasks of each department.

660
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,880
Marshal Gu, I need to take this call.

661
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:01,930
However...

662
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,440

663
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:11,670

664

665
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,510
I found her.

667
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,310
Where did you go?

668
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,380
Let me see if you're okay.

669
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,710
Gosh.

670
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,500
Where did you find her?

671
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,260
When I just came out

672
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,510
from the garden's bathroom,

673
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,190
I felt like something

674
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,130
was moving in the bushes.

675
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,880
It turned out she fell down

676
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,350
in there all by herself.

677
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,880
