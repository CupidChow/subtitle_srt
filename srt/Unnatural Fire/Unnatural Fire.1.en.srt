00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,480
to come back and see her.

385
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,070
But now, suddenly, you remember her

386
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,680
and want to take her ashes away?

387
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,920
Oh, what a devoted son

388
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,000
you are.

389
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,960
And who knows

390
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,680
you might even bury her with Han Kun?

391
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,640
They were husband and wife.

392
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,310
When Dad died,

393
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,790
you didn't ask a single question.

394
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,440
You didn't lift a finger.

395
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,070
What right do you have

396
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,620
to judge me now?

397
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,690
Han Pei.

398
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,400
We've always been like this.

399
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,520
We've talked about this so many times.

400
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,200
Neither of us can convince the other.

401
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,030
I just want to take Mom away.

402
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
Nothing else concerns me.

403
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,440
Nothing concerns you?

404
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,480
All these years,

405
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,830
as your elder brother, I've always been the one

406
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,960
thinking about you.

407
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,750
Now it's just the two of us left.

408
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,800
What?

409
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,270
Are you saying you don't even want to

410
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,510
acknowledge your own brother anymore?

411
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,880
Don't forget

412
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,000
the one who went to prison back then

413
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,160
was Han Pei.

414
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,920
What are you standing there for? Come in!

415
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,790
Chief Wu,

416
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,880
we can apply for an arrest warrant

417
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,920
for Han Pei now.

418
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,880
This hostage case

419
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,410
[Wu Yong, Captain of the Criminal Investigation Division, Binxi Branch Bureau of the Beixun Municipal Public Security Bureau]

420
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,310
can actually

421
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,160
be combined

422
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,750
with the 2/16 arson case.

423
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,160
Fingerprint analysis confirms

424
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,110
that the suspect, Chen Guang, who was shot dead,

425
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,720
was the arsonist

426
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,510
in the 2/16 arson case.

427
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,070
And the victim, Sun Ling,

428
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,590
was the wife of Wei Kang,

429
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,030
who died in that fire.

430
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,960
According to her statement after regaining consciousness,

431
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,400
Han Pei resented Sun Ling

432
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,790
for persistently investigating Wei Kang's death.

433
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,350
That gives him a clear motive.

434
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,000
You know very well

435
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,550
the probative force of the victim's statement.

436
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,440
It only proves Han Pei's motive,

437
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,030
not the crime itself.

438
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,310
I know that.

439
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,110
But we found a video recording

440
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,880
with audio

441
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,160
on Sun Ling's computer.

442
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,400
Its content is enough to prove

443
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,310
that both cases

444
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,880
were orchestrated by Han Pei

445
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,960
and executed by Chen Guang.

446
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,440
So Han Pei planned

447
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,400
a murder to silence her?

448
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,590
That's right, Chief Wu.

449
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,240
The evidence is solid.

450
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,350
Why hasn't the arrest been approved yet?

451
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:48,960
What's the meaning of this?

452
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,510
Didn't I hold you back before?

453
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,400
How can you say that?

454
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,590
We got to where we are today

455
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,110
all thanks to your leadership!

456
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,790
Quit the flattery.

457
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,400
Come get the documents

458
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,350
and send them to the prosecutor's office.

459
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,400
Satisfied now?

460
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,480
Thank you, Chief Wu.

461
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,350
Once the arrest is approved,

462
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,310
I'll inform you immediately.

463
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,110
So, what do you think?

464
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,270
Confident about the arrest?

465
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,350
With me on the case, you can rest assured.

466
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,270
Alright then, no need to stand around here.

467
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,680
Waiting for your good news.

468
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,720
Hello?

469
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,110
It's me.

470
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,150
[Public Security has requested an arrest from the procuratorate] [Probably approved soon]

471
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,350
Jun.

472
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,830
I want to ask you something.

473
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,830
If one day someone tries to harm me,

474
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,860
and I need you, a top lawyer,

475
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,110
to save my life,

476
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,630
would you?

477
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,110
We're brothers.

478
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,860
I need to avoid a conflict of interest.

479
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,030
Han Pei ordered Chen Guang…

480
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,730
Captain Shen,

481
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,510
the prosecutor's office has approved it.

482
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,920
Let's go!

483
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,050
Yes!

484
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,000
Fire!

485
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,510
Stop the car!

486
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,070
Get out now!

487
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,960
[Zhao Zhiyuan, Director of the Fire Alarm Technology Department, Beixun Fire Rescue Brigade]

488
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,270
Tongsheng,

489
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,000
sit.

490
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,270
Director Zhao.

491
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,640
No need to bother.

492
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,590
This…

493
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,400
"Director Zhao"

494
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,490
is for others to hear.

495
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,200
When it's just us,

496
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,300
call me Uncle Zhao.

497
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,760
I'd rather stick to Director Zhao.

498
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:35,920
You brat,

499
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,070
you've been doing well lately.

500
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,110
Earned yourself a Second-Class Merit.

501
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,750
If I didn't achieve that,

502
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,070
I wouldn't be standing here.

503
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,120
Honestly,

504
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
you did a great job

505
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,200
at the division.

506
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,290
They still need you there.

507
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,070
If you're gold,

508
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,320
you'll shine anywhere.

509
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,240
But I want to shine

510
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,770
here, in the Fire Investigation Department.

511
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,070
Of course,

512
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,310
I have Deputy Chief Peng to thank for this.

513
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,140
Without him,

514
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,440
I wouldn't be working under you.

515
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,110
Good.

516
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,200
Since you're here,

517
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:00,880
do your best.

518
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,920
No worries about work,

519
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,270
but there's one thing.

520
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,480
No.

521
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,400
I haven't even said anything yet,

522
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,710
and you're already saying no?

523
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,090
No need to hear it.

524
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,440
You're not allowed

525
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,460
to enter the archives room.

526
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,200
If you need any documents,

527
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,270
submit a request.

528
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,590
I'll have Mao Mao bring them to you.

529
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,440
Why?

530
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,200
No reason.

531
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,040
You don't need to review

532
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,240
past reports anymore.

533
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,640
Everything is clear.

534
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,310
It was an accident.

535
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,780
But the 2/16 case

536
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,000
bears many similarities

537
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,200
to my family's old case.

538
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,960
It was almost ruled an accident too.

539
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,930
Tongsheng,

540
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,270
how many times has this happened?

541
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,790
Every time there was a case

542
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,370
involving a water heater fire,

543
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,640
you rushed to the scene

544
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
at the first opportunity.

545
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,770
Deep down, you know the truth.

546
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,200
Most of them are accidents.

547
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,000
Yes,

548
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,360
there are exceptions where human action is involved.

549
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,440
But you can't

550
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,480
cause a scene

551
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,790
every time

552
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,110
you find a man-made

553
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,070
water heater fire.

554
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,240
Wei Kang was murdered just before

555
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,070
he was about to testify in court,

556
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,440
giving evidence that was unfavorable to the Han Group.

557
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,480
Moreover, Han Group

558
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,440
happens to be involved in water heater manufacturing...

559
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,030
Enough.

560
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,510
Xu Tongsheng.

561
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,050
This happened eighteen years ago.

562
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,830
What matters now is moving forward.

563
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:17,920
I believe,

564
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,750
if your parents were still here,

565
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,590
they would

566
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,440
want you to live well.

567
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,640
I also hope

568
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,680
you can focus more

569
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,240
on your current job.

570
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,790
Did my father

571
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,350
investigate Han Group back then?

572
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,680
Stop overthinking.

573
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,350

00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,480
One thickness is similar to that of the car window,

766
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,590
while the other thickness

767
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,400
could potentially be from a container

768
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,760
used to store combustion improver.

769
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,000
The third is about the fire source.

770
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,070
[Image 1: Physical Evidence - Blanket Inside the Car]

771
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,880
I found a lighter at the scene,

772
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,760
which was lit.

773
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,280
It's possible that this was the source of the fire.

774
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,030
Based on these findings,

775
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,630
I conclude that the scene

776
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,870
cannot rule out foul play.

777
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,590
Han Pei and Han Jun,

778
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,440
one is dead and the other is injured.

779
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,480
I suspect that this case

780
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,190
is not as simple as it seems,

781
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:11,960
and may

782
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,880
even be connected to my family's old case.

783
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,300
So, Director Zhao,

784
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,320
I'm applying again

785
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,510
to retrieve the relevant files from back then.

786
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,000
Alright, .

787
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,670
stop talking so much.

788
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:19,920
Don't worry about this.

789
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,850
All the related documents

790
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,670
and subsequent investigations

791
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,030
are being handed over to others.

792
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,280
That's the work arrangement.

793
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,070
Just follow the arrangements.

794
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,510
Hello, Wu.

795
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,960
Hello, Zhao.

796
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,710
I heard that you concluded it was human-caused

797
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,390
right at the scene this time.

798
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,300
What does that mean?

799
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,170
We haven't released a report yet.

800
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,630
But Adviser Xu from your side

801
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,060
seemed quite certain.

802
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,260
Wu,

803
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,480
since when

804
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,760
have you become so familiar

805
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,590
with the staff in our Fire Investigation Department?

806
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,000
We met during

807
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,110
that hijacking case.

808
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,000
And now, Adviser Xu is in charge of this case as well?

809
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,800
This case

810
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,320
is actually handled by Mao Mao and Jiang Li.

811
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,480
The two of them will keep you

812
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,510
informed

813
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,670
on the situation.

814
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,400
I feel like during the last hijacking case,

815
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,140
Adviser Xu seemed a bit...

816
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,280
Sorry, Wu.

817
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,230
I'm busy here.

818
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,670
Let's talk later. See you.

819
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:49,790
Han Group

820
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,630
was founded by Han Kun

821
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:58,960
[Han Kun] [Father and son] [Han Pei] [Han Jun]

822
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,710
23 years ago.

823
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,670
It started in security services,

824
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,230
but later expanded into running three nightclubs.

825
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,360
In the following years, it took control

826
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
of a water heater manufacturing plant,

827
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,550
a food processing factory,

828
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,710
and an auto repair shop.

829
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,590
Han Kun had two sons,

830
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,990
identical twins,

831
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,070
both 36 years old.

832
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,480
The eldest son, Han Pei,

833
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,140
had always been by Han Kun's side in the city.

834
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,600
The youngest son, Han Jun,

835
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,070
went abroad at the age of 18

836
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,570
and settled overseas.

837
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,790
This was

838
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,880
his first time returning

839
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,930
to China in 18 years.

840
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:21,070
[Han Group was established in 2000]

841
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,360
A year ago,

842
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,000
Han Kun suddenly passed away from a heart attack,

843
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,030
and his eldest son, Han Pei,

844
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,190
took over his business.

845
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,920
However, it's worth noting that today,

846
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,510
the prosecutor's office

847
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,630
just approved the arrest of Han Pei,

848
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,880
and then this incident occurred.

849
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,970
Today is the anniversary of Han Kun's death.

850
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,380
The two brothers were traveling in Han Pei's car,

851
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,320
heading out from their home

852
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,410
to commemorate Han Kun.

853
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,000
Just after leaving

854
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,190
the Chenxing Road Tunnel,

855
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,600
the car exploded and caught fire.

856
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,520
The driver died on the spot,

857
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,150
and the passenger in the front seat was injured and is now in a coma,

858
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,260
currently undergoing treatment.

859
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,710
Can you confirm

860
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,070
who was driving?

861
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,220
We are currently unable to confirm that.

862
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,230
Since Han Pei and Han Jun

863
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,610
are identical twins,

864
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,230
it's impossible

865
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
to distinguish them using DNA alone.

866
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,350
We can only differentiate them through their fingerprints.

867
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,550
Our team has already

868
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,670
gone to Han Pei's residence

869
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,730
to collect his fingerprints.

870
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,670
As for Han Jun,

871
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,200
we've also contacted the Immigration Bureau

872
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,800
to retrieve his fingerprints from when he entered the country.

873
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,800
Are there any other ways

874
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,390
we can determine their identities?

875
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:05,850
We've retrieved footage

876
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,550
from the underground parking garage

877
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,550
of Han Pei's home.

878
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,400
Since the two were heading to commemorate Han Kun,

879
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,360
they were dressed similarly.

880
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,550
However, in their daily lives,

881
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,440
their clothing habits

882
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,550
are very different.

883
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,590
After interviewing Han Pei's employees

884
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,250
[Han Kun] [Father and son] [Han Pei] [Han Jun]

885
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,120
and reviewing the brothers' habits,

886
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,030
we preliminarily concluded

887
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,230
that the driver of the car was Han Pei,

888
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,480
while the passenger in the front seat who was injured is Han Jun.

889
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,960
Additionally,

890
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,710
during the hijacking case,

891
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,800
we had already conducted

892
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,390
an investigation into Han Pei's social connections.

893
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,480
He is known for being flamboyant and domineering,

894
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,760
which has led him to have many enemies.

895
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,400
On the other hand, Han Jun has just returned to the country

896
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,330
and has minimal social connections here.

897
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,670
We've also contacted

898
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,070
his workplace abroad,

899
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,540
where he works as a public interest lawyer

900
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,440
and has a good reputation.

901
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,150
Alright,

902
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,230
we'll continue

903
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,880
the investigation in this direction.

904
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,000
Please ensure complete confidentiality.

905
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,150
Yes!

906
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,070

00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,550
Come here for a moment.

912
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,480
Go take care of something.

913
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,590
As for the case details,

914
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
all external statements

915
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,070
should strictly say one dead, one injured.

916
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,400
We cannot allow any speculation

917
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,920
that Han Pei is the deceased

918
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,670
to leak out.

919
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,230
Got it?

920
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:07,960
Got it.

921
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,590
Also,

922
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,400
make sure the hospital records list

923
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,740
both Han Pei and Han Jun with their names.

924
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,920
And send someone to keep an eye on things.

925
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,710
Understood.

926
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,150
Go ahead.

[Yuan Zhoulyu]

930
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,590
Chun, I went to the scene.

931
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,360
You should rest up.

932
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,230
Why didn't you call me when you went to the scene?

933
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,030
Send me the location.

934

The victim of the fire?

938
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,030
Yes.

939
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,030
The cause of death was a vehicle fire

940
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:26,710
that resulted in an explosion.

941
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,340

to wake me up for cases like this.
