[Episode 15]

3
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,400
Jin Chun!

4
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,280
I'm here!

5
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,050
Tongsheng!

6
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,630
Shen Ye, over here!

7
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,810
I'm here!

8
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:55,970
Chun!

9
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,200
Captain Shen.

10
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,479
I just fell from up there.

11
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,100
Adviser Xu.

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,870
She fell from there.

13
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,790
Is it serious?

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,230
Adviser Xu.

15
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,480
I'm fine. I just twisted my ankle.

16
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,210
There are just a few minor scratches. It's alright.

17
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,840
Is it serious?

18
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,509
No, it's not.

19
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,389
Why are you here?

20
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,760
It's just a coincidence.

21
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,470
Come on. Let's go up first.

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll carry you on my back.

23
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,560
I can do it...

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,250
Come on. Let me carry you on my back.

25
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,810
Alright.

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,240
Give me the bag.

27
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,530
Come on. Be careful. Be careful.

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,810
Come on. Watch out.

29
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,180
Watch your step.

30
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,190
We're at the entrance.

31
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,350
Senior.

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,940
Thank you so much.

33
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,310
I'll treat you to a nice meal

34
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,360
another day.

35
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,150
Okay.

36
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,630
I'll wait for your call then.

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,260
I have to go now, everyone.

38
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,430
Bye bye.

39
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,030
See you, Mr. Han.

40
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:52,740
Take a good rest.

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,240
Okay.

42
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,079
Bye bye.

43
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,020
How are you feeling?

44
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,500
Do you need me to accompany you to the hospital?

45
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,230
It's alright. I'm fine.

46
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,640
Are you really fine?

47
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,820
Yes, I am.

48
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,120
I majored in medicine.

49
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,470
When I say I'm fine, I'm just fine.

50
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,670
Alright then. Don't move.

51
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,520
I'll drive the car over here.

52
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,510
How's it going?

53
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,210
Is there any progress?

54
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,740
It's okay. Be patient.

55
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,260
It's hard to find the trigger spot after all.

56
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,520
If we can't find it this time,

57
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,560
we'll still have a chance next time.

58
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,250
Let's go.

59
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,150
Next time,

60
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,710
we'll definitely find

61
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,710
the place which Chun wants to go to.

62
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,960
Alright. Let's go to a different place next time.

63
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,870
Dad.

64
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,770
Why are you here?

65
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,900
So this is his home?

66
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,050
I've been staying at his home for the past couple of days.

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,630
Why are you staying at his home?

68
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,530
Don't even mention it.

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,120
There was a power outage at our home.

70
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,520
The food you had put in the fridge

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,230
was all rotten.

72
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,360
There was no water supply or electricity.

73
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,600
I couldn't do anything there.

74
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,710
Why didn't you answer the phone?

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,530
He and I

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,870
went hiking in the mountains today.

77
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,800
There was no signal for my mobile phone.

78
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,350
You always have an excuse for everything.

79
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,630
I couldn't find you,

80
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,089
and you didn't answer the phone.

81
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,579
You were even not in the office.

82
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,120
If Danggui hadn't told me that

83
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,870
you were staying here,

84
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,360
I would've thought that a criminal police officer

85
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,860
had gone missing in broad daylight.

86
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm a grown man now.

87
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,600
How could I go missing?

88
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,400
Cut the crap.

89
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,470
Let's go home.

90
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,040
Well, I'll come back

91
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,159
to fetch my stuff in a couple of days.

92
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,240
Have you eaten?

93
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,070
Let me take you to eat something.

94
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm full from all this anger.

95
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,440

The comparison results you requested are out.

The alloy composition and carbon content

99
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,960
of the two samples are completely identical.

100
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,710
But strangely,

101
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,510
this blower fragment

102
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,510
you sent here

103
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,000
is evidence from 2005,

while the Han Group's

105

blower fragment

106
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,920
was launched in 2007.

110
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,050
You're here so early.

111
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,320
Would you like some hot tea?

112
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,080
Director Zhao.

113
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,900
I've found out about the truth

114
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,600
of the case from back then.

115
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,880
Tell me about it.

116
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,830
On the day of the incident,

117
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,070
someone disguised himself as a repairman

118
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,960
and entered my home.

119
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,680
He replaced the original blower

120
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,700
of our water heater

121
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,030
with a high-power blower.

122
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,200
Then he loosened the valve

123
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,760
so that the gas would leak slowly.

124
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,190
There was another person lurking

125
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,610
on my father's way back home from work.

126
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,700
He deliberately splashed paint on my father,

127
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,140
prompting him to go home and take a shower.

128
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,120
It was the smell of paint on him

129
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,950
that prevented him from noticing

130
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,000
the gas smell in the house.

131
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,470
After the water heater started working,

132
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,060
the gas began to leak heavily.

133
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,120
The high-power blower that was incompatible

134
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,730
with the water heater short-circuited and caught fire.

135
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,080
Then it co-occured with the gas leak.

136
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,800
The entire process of the incident

137
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,620
was just like that.

138
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,430
So at the crime scene back then,

139
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,480
the primary molten bead from the water heater's

140
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,510
short circuit could be found.

141
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,680
And the overall fire spread traces at the scene

142
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,850
also matched the characteristics of a gas explosion.

143
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,270
As for the evidence of human involvement,

144
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,320
I found a blower fragment

145
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,170
[Comparison and Analysis of the Metallic Composites of the Gas Water Heater's Blower Motor]

146
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,870
in the old evidence box,

147
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,950
which shouldn't have been there.

148
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,460
After comparison,

149
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,270
this blower model

150
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,290
and the one produced by the Han Group's subsidiary,

151
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,070
the Ducheng Processing Factory,

152
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,210
in its early stages,

153
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,160
are identical in composition

154
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,000
and manufacturing processes.

155
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,600
This particular blower model

156
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,420
was first used in products and was launched

157
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,690
in 2007.

158
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,070
At the time of the incident,

159
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,360
the only people who could obtain this blower

160
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,460
were members of the Han Family.

161
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,320
So they were the ones

162
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,960
who caused the fire at my house.

163
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,570
Your analysis is clear

164
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,660
and the evidence is conclusive.

165
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,850
From the fire investigation's perspective,

166
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,010
we can basically determine that

167
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,240
human involvement cannot be ruled out.

168
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,840
If this report is submitted,

169
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,210
it might be possible to file a case.

170
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,920
However, the prime suspect,

171
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,070
Han Pei, is dead.

172
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,590
So, requesting the criminal investigation department to reopen the case

173
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,030
doesn't have much significance.

174
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,669
Tongsheng,

175
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,650
I actually think that

176
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,909
if this matter

177
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
stops here,

178
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,190
it might be

179
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,200
the best outcome for you.

180
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,820
The best outcome for this matter

181
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,810
is to reveal the truth

182
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,720
and bring the murderer to justice.

183
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,870
Director Zhao,

184
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,210
please revise the conclusion as soon as possible

185
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,440
and submit it to the criminal investigation department.

186
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,820
Tongsheng.

187
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,510
You really should let go of your obsession.

188
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,840
The one who should let go of his obsession

189
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,750
is you.

190
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,360
I've read the case report.

191
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,690
The number of deaths back then

192
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,030
was three.

193
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,640
I've always thought that my friend

194
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,510
died in the fire in my place.

195
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,970
But now I understand that

196
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,000
in order to protect me,

197
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,960
you did that back then.

198
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,930
But now I've grown up.

199
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,820
I think

200
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,120
we should face

201
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,000
all of this together.

202
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,350
What do you think, Director Zhao?

203
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,060
You knew I was coming,

204
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,200
so you even brewed coffee for me?

205
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,450
Have you received the case filing report

206
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,300
for my family's old case?

207
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,480
What?

208
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,480
Didn't Director Zhao ask you to come here?

209
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,760
Nonsense.

210
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,370
I'm here to get a report indeed,

211
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,920
but it's not the one about your family's old case.

212
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,480
Well, what's going on?

213
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,960
Has there been any progress on your family's case?

214
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,970
I've figured out the method

215
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,960
of the crime.

216
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,530
Based on the evidence we have now,

217
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,360
we can change the conclusion to

218
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,710
"Human involvement cannot be ruled out."

219
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,250
So I've applied to Director Zhao

220
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,570
to reopen the case

221
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,620
and submit it to your criminal investigation department

222
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,320
for a reinvestigation.

223
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,250
Xu, let me tell you.

224
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,430
This is good news.

225
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,630
You've persevered for so many years,

226
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,950
and there's a result finally.

227
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,000
Reopening the case now

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,080
is completely fine.

229
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,000
But if we want to find the suspect,

230
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,030
it'll still be quite difficult.

231
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,510
Yes, I know that.

232
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,400
There's a lack of motives and circumstantial evidence, right?

233
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,240
That's right.

234
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,390
So I was thinking that

235
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,160
after the case was reopened,

236
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,410
I could assist your criminal investigation department

237
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,080
with the investigation.

238
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,630
Before or after we reopen the case,

239
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,010
investigation can be done anytime.

240
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,960
Besides,

241
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,070
considering our relationship,

242
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,120
why don't you explain it to me first?

243
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,270
Sit down.

244
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,400
Why are you standing there? Sit down.

245
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,280
Tell me.

246
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,800
What clues have you found so far?

247
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,340
Here's the thing.

248
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,600
Back then, my father

249
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,720
once investigated the Han Group.

250
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,570
On the afternoon of the incident,

251
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,330
someone disguised himself as a repairman

252
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,100
and entered our home.

253
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,560
He tampered with

254
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,390
our water heater.

255
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,790
But as for the specific reason why he

256
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,710
wanted to kill my father,

257
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,270
I haven't figured it out yet.

258
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,670
Do you still remember what that repairman

259
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,500
looked like?

260
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,810
I never saw him,

261
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,240
but my friend did.

262
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,120
Then this friend of yours

263
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,270
is a very crucial

264
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,290
eyewitness.

265
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,360
That's right.

266
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,060
If that's the case,

267
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,510
it's going to be difficult.

268
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,930
Actually, it's not that difficult.

269
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,790
Why don't you go meet someone with me?

270
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,210
Since I'm already here,

271
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,000
I might as well go with you.

272
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:16,960
Let's go.

273
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,190
So we're here to meet someone?

274
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,920
You'll find out soon.

275
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,840
Seven, eight.

276
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,970
One, two, three,

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,050
four, five, six,

278
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,870
seven.

279
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,010
Eight.

280
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,750
Eight.

281
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,550
Grandma.

282
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,360
Nine.

283
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,690
Grandma, we're here to visit you.

284
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,220
Hello, Grandma.

285
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,240
I... I'm his colleague.

286
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,070
I'm here to visit you.

287
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,490
He Xi.

288
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,530
Oh, He Xi.

289
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,410
My He Xi.

290
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,770
You're finally here to visit me.

291
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,130
He Xi.

292
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,880
Good boy, have a seat.

293
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,910
Have a seat.

294
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,340
Have a seat.

295
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,150
Good boy.

296
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,310
You've grown taller.

297
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,040
And you've become stronger.

298
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,840
But you're a bit tanned.

299
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,700
Remain seated here.

300
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,660
I will peel an apple for you.

301
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,840
Well, X-Xu...

302
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,500
I will peel an apple for you.

303
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,640
Grandma.

304
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,550
I'm here to visit you.

305
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,910
Xu Heng.

306
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,380
So you brought He Xi here to visit me?

307
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,660
Have a seat, too.

308
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,710
I will get you two something delicious.

309
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,950
Xu Heng?

310
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,660
I'll fetch the shrimps that He Xi loves the most.

311
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,270
Look.

312
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,740
I'm shelling them for you.

313
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,870
The shrimps I shelled are so good.

314
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,480
He Xi loves them the most.

315
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,610
Grandma.

316
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,860
I...

317
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,870
I... I don't eat shrimps.

318
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,130
He Xi is just so considerate towards me,

319
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,260
so he said that he didn't want to eat shrimps.

320
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,740
Right, He Xi?

321
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,600
Here you are.

322
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,680
Hurry up.

323
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,210
Eat it.

324
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,340
Eat.

325
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,060
Eat.

326
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,520
Grandma.

327
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,550
I'm allergic to shrimps.

328
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,290
Xu.

329
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,370
Come out and let's talk.

330
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,060
He Xi.

331
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,540
The shrimps I shelled are so good.

332
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,850
He Xi loves the shrimps I shelled the most.

333
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,880
Look at this shrimp I've shelled.

334
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,500
This shrimp I've shelled is so good.

335
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,610
Xu Tongsheng, what do you mean?

336
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,700
You said you'd take me to meet someone,

337
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,990
and it's just to see Grandma?

338
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,840
How many times have I told you?

339
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,880
I'm not He Xi.

340
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,730
Have you thought of something?

341
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,700
Yes.

342
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,300
I did think of something.

343
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,390
I thought of the idea that you didn't

344
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,470
consider my feelings.

345
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,360
You didn't consider

346
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,310
Grandma's feelings, either.

347
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,700
Grandma is so old now,

348
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,380
and she has Alzheimer's.

349
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,390
How can you do this to her?

350
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,380
Don't you have any compassion?

351
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,190
But she remembered you.

352
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,490
She is your grandmother.

353
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,130
Tomorrow, bring Li Danggui here.

354
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,090
She'll call Li Danggui He Xi, too.

355
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,270
The day after tomorrow, bring Mao Mao here.

356
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,390
And Mao Mao will be He Xi.

357
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,590
Bring everyone here,

358
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,090
and everyone will be He Xi.

359
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,880
Last time at your home,

360
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,630
you did the same thing,

361
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,900
but I didn't say anything.

362
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,900
I'm quite clear about

363
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,120
how I grew up.

364
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,380
My father is Shen Yi.

365
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,900
My name is Shen Ye.

366
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,120
Remember that.

367
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,080
He Xi,

368
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,000
you're here to visit me.

369
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,420
I'm here.

370
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,400
I'm here to visit you.

371
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,440
He Xi is such a good boy.

372
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,920
Right?

373
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,369
You always come here to visit me.

374
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,740
What a good boy.

375
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,060
[Shen Ye]

376
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,020
[Gas Explosion]

377
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,450
[Explosion]

378
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,910

Hello, Uncle Shen.

About the Ducheng Processing Factory,

575
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,430
there's nothing unusual.

576
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,350
The data you gave me

577
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,650
all matches the reports they submitted.

578
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,480
It also complies with fire department regulations.

No, there isn't.

you should go home and rest early, too.

fourth typhoon, Peace.

588
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,550
It's very likely to become

589
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,480
the first typhoon to make landfall over our country this year.

599
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,230

They're very delicious. You can taste them.

660
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,490
That's great.

Your complexion looks quite good.

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,920
It looks like you've been doing well lately.

666
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,480
Every day, I just go to work,

667
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,070
get off work

668
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,920
and come home.

669
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,750
My life is pretty normal.

670
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,500
I guess that's good.

671
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,590
That's quite good indeed.

672
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,900
How about you? How have you been?

673
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,300
I've been doing alright, too.

674
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,130
Currently, I'm just dealing with

the Han Group's

676
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,440
various loose ends.

677
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,680
Once I finish handling them,

678
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,160
I'll still go abroad.

679
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,670
As a forensic doctor,

680
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,690
are you extremely

681
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,830
busy with your work?

682
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,210
Do you have time to go out and have fun?

683
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,880
Going out to have fun?

684
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,720
Senior,

685
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,880
let me tell you a secret.

686
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,860
Since I started working,

687
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,770
I haven't taken a single day off.

688
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,510
That's too pitiful.

689
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,650
What about you?

690
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,080
Do you often go out to have fun?

691
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,790
Yes, to some extent.

692
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,580
Since I'm a public interest attorney,

693
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,110
I've been to many places

694
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,570
and seen a lot of scenery.

695
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,070
Why

696
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,280
did you choose to be a public interest attorney?

697
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,970
Because I always hope

698
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,930
to do something

699
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,200
meaningful.

700
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,740
Therefore, being a public interest attorney

701
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,010
is quite good.

702
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,310
However, speaking of this,

703
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,750
I really didn't expect that

704
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,030
you would become a forensic doctor.

705
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,470
In my mind,

706
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,590
the forensic doctor

707
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,580
always seems to be a

708
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,400
very cold and detached profession.

709
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,350
This doesn't feel like

710
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,400
the little Jin Chun I knew.

711
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,790
Indeed.

712
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,640
I also didn't expect that

713
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,030
I would become a forensic doctor.

714
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Who said this?

715
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,470
Life is like a book

716
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,480
without any plot spoilers.

717
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,200
That sounds like

718
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,620
something you would say, Senior.

719
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,750
Is that so?

720
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,180
Senior.

721
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,580
Do still you remember this?

722
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,540
In high school,

723
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,350
you really liked things

724
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,750
with a bit of an artistic style.

725
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,640
Oh, right!

726
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,260
Now that you mention it, I remember this.

727
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,030
Back then,

728
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,570
did I lend you

729
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,500
a book written by Borges?

730
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,750
Yes,

731
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,730
What is...

732
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,180
the title of that book?

733
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,440
The Book of Sand.

734
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,200
Yes.

735
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,930
Right?

736
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,010
The Book of Sand.

737
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,200
My goodness.

738
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,980
I think I forgot to return it to you.

739
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,860
I forgot to ask you for it, too.

740
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,090
I've kept the book for 18 years after I borrowed it.

741
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,270
Have you finished reading it?

742
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,110
Hello, I'm here to serve the dishes.

743
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,590
Let's have some soup.

744
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,190
Here are your noodles.

745
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,300
You've served them reversely.

746
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,240
Sorry for my bad memory.

747
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,900
I thought it was the same as before.

748
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,760
Come on.

749
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,820
This is yours.

750
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,040
This is yours.

751
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,510
Before?

752
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,480
Come on, He Xi.

753
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,720
Taste the spicy noddles.

754
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,680
No, no.

755
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,020

I'll take you to practice boxing.

Boxing?

768
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,159
Is it that exciting?

769
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,330
It's quite exciting indeed.

770
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,830
Boxing is really good.

771
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,659
It's beneficial for both physical and mental health.

772
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,920
It helps to release

773

777
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:00,920
Okay.

You came on a motorcycle?

784
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,780
That's impressive.

785
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,210
I also like motorcycles very much.

786
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,940
Can you teach me when you have time

787
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,150
so that I can experience it too?

788
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,480
Okay.

789
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,520

I heard you, Dad.

796
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
I was working overtime.

797

798
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,130
you can touch this side.

Hello, Dean Zeng.

810
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,160
Tongsheng,

811
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,330
you asked me

812
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,480
to investigate that photo of

813
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,090
the little boy.

814
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,340
I've asked many people about it.

815
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,180
My old friends all said that

816
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,040
they didn't have it in their archives.

817
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,190
Later, a friend of mine who used to work

818
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:25,880
in the Civil Affairs Department

819
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,550
told me that

820
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,030
this photo looked a bit

821
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,070
familiar to him.

822
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,360
There was once

823
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,020
a public notice about this boy.

824
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,690
Could you give me his contact information?

825
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,060
Why don't you come to the welfare house tomorrow?

826
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,800
I'll ask him to meet you here.

827
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,280

Come back early after work.

832
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,640
I remember

833
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,590
this kid.

834
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,670
It happened more than ten years ago.

835
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,170
Back then, at night,

836
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,710
a man dressed

837
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,280
elegantly

838
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,830
brought a little boy of this height or so

839
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,180
to our department

840
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,130
for adoption registration.

841
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,000
He said he couldn't find

842
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,990
this boy's biological parents.

843
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,600
When we asked this boy some questions,

844
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,910
he didn't say anything.

845
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,410
He was scared of whoever he saw,

846
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,520
and he just clung tightly

847
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,890
to that man's clothes.

848
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,850
If we pressed him for an answer, he would even cry.

849
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,550
Could you take a look

850
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
to see if it's this man?

851
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,230
It's been such a long time.

852
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,750
I don't remember it cleraly.

853
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,400
But it does look like him.

854
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,380
Please go ahead.

855
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,230
Is there anything else?

856
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,300
Later,

857
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,840
we followed the procedure

858
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,890
and made the child's case public.

859
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,020
After quite some time,

860
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,940
indeed no one came to claim him.

861
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,270
And no one provided any related information.

862
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,410
So,

863
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,350
we finished the adoption procedure.

864
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,400
The boy seemed to have

865
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,930
experienced some psychological trauma.

866
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,500
He was quite dependent on that man.

867
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,630

868
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,850
