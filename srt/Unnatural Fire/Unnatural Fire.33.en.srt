But so what?

7
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,230
Why do you insist on investigating?

8

Because...

9
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,470
I don't want to believe

10

she didn't want the truth to come out...

15

17
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,710

19
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,600

because I didn't know any lawyers in the country.

161
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,240

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,080

168
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,630
Since we were old classmates, I thought it'd save me some trouble.

you need to have the ability to cope,

183
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,440
and you need to find ways

184
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,590

185
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,790

00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,390
How will you manage in the future?

192
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,320
You'll be worn down bit by bit!

193
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,450
As someone watching from the outside,

194
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,350
I must tell you...

195
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,070
that your current state

196
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,000
is far more serious

197
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,390
than you think.

198
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,890
You've been hitting that punching bag for hours,

199
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,790
trying to vent your feelings for so long.

200
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,670
You know better than anyone

201
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,840
whether you feel any better inside!

202
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:05,920
I think you

203
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,680
need external help now.

204
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,550
What I mean is...

205
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,750
have you considered

206
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,829
changing your environment for a while?

207
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,410
Find a place

208
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,109
to heal your emotions properly first.

209
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,750
As it happens, my alma mater,

210
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,510
Chad Hahn University,

211
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,190
offers a psychology research program...

212
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,000
Thank you, Senior.

213
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,790
I don't need this option.

214
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,720
Okay.

215
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,640
How you choose

216
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,720
is your freedom.

217
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,350
But I hope

218
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,920
that the next time I see you,

219
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
you can return to being

220
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,480
the sunny, cheerful Jin Chun again.

221
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,600
I'll head out now.

222
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,340
Goodbye, Senior.

223
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,900
Goodbye.

224
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,750
You're finally back.

225
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,740
Why are you guys here?

226
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,000
You weren't answering your phone or responding to WeChat messages,

227
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,270
so we came to find you.

228
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,330
We were thinking of taking you out for dinner.

229
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,470
Where have you been?

230
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,090
I went boxing.

231
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,200
Come in first.

232
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,410
Change your shoes yourselves.

233
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,430
I'll go in and change my clothes first.

234
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,780

235
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,350
What would you like to eat?

236
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,240
I'll order takeout for you.

237
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,690
Not going out to eat?

238
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,880
No, we're not going out.

239
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,520
Before we eat,

240
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,070
Shen Ye has something to ask you.

241
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,050
Why did you... why did you take time off?

242
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,730
You haven't taken any time off in so many years.

243
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,370
It's precisely because it's been so many years

244
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,270
that I haven't taken any time off.

245
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
That's why I'm taking one now.

246
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,640
What's wrong?

247
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,620
I thought

248
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,800
it had something to do with the director.

249
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,000
It's not, huh?

250
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,930
Of course not.

251
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,550
She's been like this

252
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,590
all these years, hasn't she?

253
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,940
I've already gotten used to it.

254
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,230
Well,

255
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,590
about that Du Danning case,

256
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,350
don't take it to heart too much.

257
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,520
What's wrong with you two?

258
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,270
Why are you worrying about nothing?

259
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,460
I've been a forensic doctor for so many years.

260
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,550
What can't I handle?

261
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,600
I'm fine.

262
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,450
I'm really fine.

263
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,580
I'm doing well.

264
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,240
It's just because I've been so diligent

265
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,070

266
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,690

268
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,480

269
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,110
We didn't have any problems.

270
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,060
How about this?

271
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,930
Tomorrow, we'll both take a day off too,

272
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,400
and let's go hiking together?

273
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,540
I don't want to go hiking.

274
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,790
I just want to stay at home

275
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,750

282
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,160
please head out.

283
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,270

298
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,920
just let us know anytime.

299
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,920

300
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,860

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,310
daily matters.

380
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,640
The two of them

381
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,070
just don't communicate well.

382
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,110
For example,

383
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,550
that blind date.

384
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,590
Your auntie, well,

385
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,930
she thought Jiang He

386
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,460
was a good young man.

387
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,480
She wanted to settle this marriage quickly.

388
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,180
But Chun

389
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,270
just wouldn't follow her mother's wishes.

390
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,000
Then her mom started to get anxious

391
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,800
and nagged me about it every day,

392
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,640
saying in the future,

393
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,520
if both of us are gone,

394
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,690
leaving Chun alone,

395
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,790
what will happen to her?

396
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,630
I say, why don't you express these concerns

397
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,270
properly to Chun?

398
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,180
But she won't.

399
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,890
As for Chun,

400
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,880
young people have their own ideas.

401
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,470
I respect that.

402
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,870
But she

403
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,870
doesn't say anything

404
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,240
to her mother either.

405
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,770
It's understandable.

406
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,500
Her mom is quick-tempered.

407
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,480
When they start talking,

408
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,680
they often end up in an argument.

409
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,680
I don't know

410
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,000
when

411
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,400
they started

412
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,480
being like this.

413
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,680
I remember when she was little,

414
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,320
she and her mother

415
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,350
got along very well together.

416
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,750
Once, on Chun's birthday,

417
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,750
her mother...

418
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,550
Oh, right.

419
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,200
There's a video.

420
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,880
What video?

421
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,580
[Xu Tongsheng]

422
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,430
We'll be there right away.

423
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,750
Tongsheng, you're here!

424
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,820
You're back, Director.

425
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,640
Sit back down.

426
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,590
It's so good to have you here.

427
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,150
Here.

428
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,480
Let me pour you some water. Have you had anything to drink?

429
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,420
I'll do it myself! I'll do it myself!

430
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,750
Let me, let me. You sit.

431
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,680
Here.

432
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,800
Okay, thank you.

433
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,640
No need to be so polite with me.

434
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,440
I came today mainly...

435
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,600
to talk to you

436
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,070
about Jin Chun.

437
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,910
I can't control her anymore.

438
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,640
I don't plan to interfere anymore.

439
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,720
She can do whatever she wants.

440
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,030
Director,

441
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,290
don't you feel that the issues...

442
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,090
between you and Jin Chun...

443
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,200
are getting more serious?

444
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,590
Yes,

445
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,310
there are issues.

446
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,790
But I don't know

447
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,830
where the issues lie.

448
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,880
Whenever we talk

449
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,830
or meet,

450
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,480
regardless of the reason,

451
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,750
we always part on bad terms.

452
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,240
She says I meddle in her affairs,

453
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,680
but she also interferes in mine

454
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,440
without my permission.

455
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,150
She went behind my back,

456
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,650
contacted the Civil Affairs Bureau

457
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,890
and other welfare houses,

458
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,930
and forcibly took away

459
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,770
a sick child of mine.

460
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,720
Tongsheng, you know it.

461
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,820
Every child in this institution

462
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,550
is like my own flesh and blood.

463
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,880
How could I bear to part with them?

464
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,590
Yes.

465
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,560
How could she do that to me?

466
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,450
Yes, I... I understand.

467
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,270
I understand everything

468
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,400
you've said, Director.

469
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,440
Is there...

470
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,480
a possibility that...

471
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,640
you haven't seen

472
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
the whole picture?

473
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,200
Let me show you something.

474
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,590
Look.

475
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
It's Yu.

476
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,490
Yes.

477
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,160
This was recorded after Yu was transferred to

478
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,810
a more experienced welfare house.

479
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,100
She recovered really fast,

480
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,300
didn't she?

481
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,160
She's even smiling.

482
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,590
She's doing so much better than before.

483
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,760
Jin Chun also grew up in the welfare house.

484
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,290
She thinks just like you do.

485
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,990
She wants what's best for the kids too.

486
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,240
Remember the presentation

487
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,120
from last time?

488
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,380
She stayed up several nights working on it.

489
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,790
After Yu was transferred,

490
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,380
she went to great lengths

491
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,240
trying to help the institution secure funding.

492
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,830
It just didn't work out in the end.

493
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:13,890
That's why I didn't tell you.

494
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,270
Really?

495
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,160
Really.

496
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,300
Well, that was a good thing.

497
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,680
Why didn't she tell me?

498
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,590
Director,

499
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,970
we all know and remember your kindness

500
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,410
toward me

501
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,270
and the children.

502
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,120
You will always be our mom.

503
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,510
But to be honest,

504
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,750
for Chun,

505
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,480
you are indeed...

506
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,310
much better to us than to her.

507
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,000
It's not comparable.

508
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,680
Unlike you,

509
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,070
she has parents.

510
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,680
She must be much happier than you are.

511
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,640
Tongsheng.

512
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,890
The attention I give to all of you

513
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,790
is definitely more than what I give to her.

514
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,480
Is it possible

515
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,780
that this kind of thinking...

516
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,390
is exactly what's making the distance...

517
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,060
between you and Chun grow larger?

518
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,240
That's why she's stopped

519
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,400
saying anything to you?

520
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,540
After all these years, she's gotten used to being...

521
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,110
independent, strong, and mature.

522
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,280
When she encounters problems,

523
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,240
she just silently endures them alone,

524
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,510
not telling anyone.

525
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,440
Recently...

526
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,850
she's really not been doing well.

527
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,720
What happened to her?

528
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,720
She's faced

529
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,720
a major setback at work.

530
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,860
She's completely fallen apart.

531
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,300
Right now...

532
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,570
she really needs you there for her.

[Xu Tongsheng]

535
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,180
Chun!

536
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,040
We're both outside your door.

537
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,680
Call us anytime if you want to talk.

538
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,020
Chun, can you open the door?

539
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,550
I want to go in and use the bathroom.

540
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,200
I've been standing outside

541
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,110
your apartment all day.

543
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,050
If you have something to say, say it here.

00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,680
No,

545
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,760
I really can't hold it anymore.

546
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,690
Right,

547
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,750
I want to get some water too.

00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,140
Oh, here are the flowers for you.

549

Xu,

550
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,880
put that beer in the fridge!

551
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,990
I know, I know!

552
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,280
Why is it so dark in here?

553
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,920
Don't cook the noodles yet!

554
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,790
I know, I know!

555
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,680
They would get clumpy!

556
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,480
Oh my god.

557
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,640
What did you buy?

558
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,400
I bought a bunch of stuff,

559
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,330
snacks and such.

560
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,510
Let's have some of this.

561
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,420
D-Don't bring it all over.

562
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,480
Quick, take this. That's right.

563
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,680
Let me help you take some of that.

564
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,000
Okay.

565
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,520
No need to take that much.

566
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,790
Just o-one bottle is enough.

567
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,550
Let's go.

568
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,270
Let's go.

569
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,470
Here.

570
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,930
Come on, give me a cushion.

571
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,390
Right, give me one.

572
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,720
What are you watching here?

573
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,260
Change it.

574
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:45,990
Change it.

575
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,200
Let's switch to something funny.

576
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,880
This is good, this is good.

577
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,680
We can watch it.

578
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,480
I've watched it before.

579
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,000
Really?

580
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,600
Yes, yes, yes.

581
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,270
Is this good?

582
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,030
It's good, it's good, it's good.

583
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,000
It gets funnier towards the end.

584
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,750
Come on, come on.

585
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,400
She doesn't want to drink. Let's drink it ourselves.

586
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,130
Cheers.

587
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,000
I've seen this before.

588
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,880
Let me tell you.

589
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,670
Don't spoil it.

590
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,760
Try this. It's really sweet.

591
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,590
Let me have some.

592
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,400
It really is sweet.

593
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:13,960
Right?

594
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,760
You picked it?

595
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,550
Let me give you a spoiler.

596
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,280
Why are you being so annoying?

597
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,070
Let me watch it myself.

598
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,000
Why would you spoil it for me?

599
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,480
This is really sweet.

600
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,000
Longan.

601
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,929
You've picked good fruit.

602
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,110
Can you two stop it?

603
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,320
Can you two leave

604
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,920
and let me have some quiet time to myself?

605
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,300
Can you?

606
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,150
I told you

607
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,960
that I just want to

608
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,760
be with myself for some time.

609
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,860
I'm fine.

610
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,570
I'm really, really fine.

611
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,800
I'm feeling really, really good right now.

612
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,530
I can take care of myself.

613
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,630
Don't worry, okay?

614
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,480
I know why you came

615
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,150
and did all this.

616
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,360
You're just trying to help me.

617
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,150
I appreciate that you came to my home.

618
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,030
But can you leave now?

619
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,320
Can you leave?

620
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,760
Can you leave?

621
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,600
Can you please leave?

622
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,880
Can you leave?

623
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,360
I don't need you right now!

624
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,190
The better you are to me,

625
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,760
the worse I feel!

626
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,400
I just want to be

627
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,440
alone and by myself!

628
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,700
I want to sort out

629
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,030
what exactly has happened

630
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,480
to me recently!

631
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,590
How did I end up

632
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,340
living like this?

633
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,570
I can't do anything right!

634
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,320
Everything

635
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,710
in my life is a mess!

636
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:36,420
I don't want you to see me

637
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,590
like this right now.

638
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,290
Please... please don't stay here

639
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,440
and let me see you, okay?

640
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,230
I don't want to see you.

641
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,640
I just want to figure out...

642
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,420
what's wrong with my life.

643
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,970
What exactly happened

644
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,190
that made me end up like this?

645
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:01,760
Come on.

646
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,440
Feeling better now after crying it out, right?

647
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,200
Chun, oh Chun.

648
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,590
We've been working together

649
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,630
for 11 years now.

650
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Seeing you like this really makes me want to laugh.

651
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,810
This isn't like you at all, really.

652
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,210
How many cases have you handled?

653
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,990
How many autopsies have you performed?

654
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,840
And you're falling apart

655
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,830
over one Du Danning case?

656
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,400
Yes,

657
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,070
you and Du Danning were childhood friends.

658
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,280
Your relationship was different.

659
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,030
But think about me.

660
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,510
Think about me and Shen Yi.

661
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,030
Right?

662
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,960
You make it sound like

663
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,190
I'm being so melodramatic.

664
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,930
So you admit you're being melodramatic now?

665
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,680
Let me tell you,

666
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,110
you did the right thing!

667
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,410
Revealing the truth

668
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,670
is our duty.

669
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,610
We can't shy away from it.

670
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,810
Don't start crying again after just a few words!

671
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,680
Hold it back!

672
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,030
Look what a mess

673
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,030
you've become.

674
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,170
Come on, cheers.

675
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,030
Let's drink.

676
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,800
That's more like it.

677
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,110
Xu.

678
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,400
Say something too.

679
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,440
Alright, that's enough.

680
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,510
I get it.

681
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,760
I'm tired of just listening to all this.

682
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,270
I haven't said a word.

683
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,740
I'm not trying to comfort you.

684
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,230
I just know two things

685
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,070
that I think...

686
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,940
you need to know too.

687
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,360
The first thing is...

688
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
Let me show you.

689
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,110
[Recording]

690
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,590
How do you think we should

691
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,400
raise him in the future?

692
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,230
There are so many children in the welfare house,

693
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,500
and you've taken such good care of them all.

694
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,240
Now, you don't know how to raise your own child?

695
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,360
Those are other people's children.

696
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,540
Of course, I know how to raise them.

697
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,510
But my own kid?

698
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,800
I have no idea.

699
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
Just think about it.

700
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,670
What kind of person...

701
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,220
do you hope he'll become

702
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,840
when he grows up?

703
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:28,230
[Recording]

704
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,840
I hope he has a home

705
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,210
where he can always return to whenever he wants.

706
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,870
Whatever he wants to eat,

707
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,800
we will make it for him.

708
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,850
If it's a girl,

709
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,760
then she should have pretty clothes to wear.

710
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,660
When she grows up,

711
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,630
she should have a job

712
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,070
that can support her.

713
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,370
Is that all?

714
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,380
And also...

715
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,650
he should never have to worry or feel afraid.

716
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,250
Actually,

717
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,760
it's very simple.

718
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:05,990
Just give him

719
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,020
what you wanted most

720
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,230
when you were little,

721
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,710
and it'll be fine.

722
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,580
Achieving all those...

723
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,710
is already very hard.

724
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm afraid I won't even manage to do those.

725
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,660
Baby, don't worry.

726
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,800
You have Dad and Mom to protect you.

727
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,710
Dad,

728
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,380
when will Mom come back?

729
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,070
I'm so sleepy.

730
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,040
Mom

731
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,720
went to buy you a birthday cake.

732
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,510
When she comes back in a bit,

733
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,460
we'll celebrate your birthday together.

734
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,650
Come on.

735
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,900
Lie down first.

736
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,280
How about I tell you a story?

737
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,230
Okay.

738
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,870
Mom's back.

739
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:28,950
You're back.

740
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,320
This umbrella won't close.

741
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:33,880
Here, let me.

742
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,750
Close it, close it.

743
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,780
Oh my goodness.

744
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,080
It's pouring outside.

745
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,550
What... what happened?

746
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,510
One of the kids has been sick

747
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,510
these past few days,

748
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,480
running a high fever the whole time.

749
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,760
I've been at the hospital taking care of him.

750
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,190
I was rushing home,

751
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:48,880
and on the way,

752
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,190
I tripped and fell hard.

753
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,440
The cake fell to the ground.

754
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,420
Quick, let's check it.

755
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,720
Oh no,

756
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,760
it's all messed up.

757
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,730
This won't do.

758
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,990
It's all dirty.

759
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,230
We can't eat it now.

760
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,150
There's mud on it.

761
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,590
Alright, alright, stop it.

762
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,520
Just leave it.

763
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,720
Where's Chun?

764
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,150
She's been asleep for a while.

765
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,190
It's my fault, it's my fault.

766
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,210
Mom!

767
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
Chun.

768
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,810
Mom!

769
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,190
Happy birthday.

770
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,400
Did I wake you up?

771
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,900
Mom,

772
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,210
where's my birthday cake?

773
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,870
I'll make it up to you next time. I promise.

774
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,000
Director Zeng!

775
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,040
Are you home?

776
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,560
The child has a fever!

777
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,100
He's even speaking deliriously now!

778
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,430
How high is the fever?

779
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,630
40 degrees!

780
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:41,590
Chun,

781
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,970
stay at home and sleep well, okay?

782
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,730
When you wake up,

783
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,710
I'll be back.

784
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,930
Be good.

785
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:46,920
Go to sleep, go to sleep.

786
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,650
I'm going.

787
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,970
Be careful.

788
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,400
There are more than a dozen recordings

789
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,850
like this one in your home.

790
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,830
When you have time,

791
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:02,920
I think you should go home and watch them.

792
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,670
Maybe you'll have a...

whole new understanding of the director.

794
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,960
Now, the second thing is...

795
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,440
I know a secret.

796
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,480
What secret?

797

00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,960
the director also

799
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,110
grew up in the welfare house.

800
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,150
She's an orphan too,

801
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,840
just like us.

After being burned,

806
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,900
we should rinse the affected area

807
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,330
with clean, running cold water for at least 10 minutes.

808
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,210
The water flow should not be too strong.

809
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:27,170
Remove any clothing that is covering the surface of the wound in cold water.

810
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,980
Remember to be careful and cautious.

811
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:30,490
Do not forcefully peel off clothing.

812
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,530
Give a small amount of lightly salted water to prevent shock,

813
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,770
and seek medical treatment promptly.
