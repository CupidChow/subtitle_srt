00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,810
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,120
Yes.

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,870
I did go back.

5
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,150
But as I told you earlier,

6
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,640
before I left,

7
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,150
I had a big argument with my mom.

8
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,400
So,

9
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,590
on my way back,

10
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,950
the more I thought about it,

11
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,070
the more I felt it wasn't right.

12
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,430
So I went back

13
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,430
to apologize to my mom.

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,870
What was the argument about?

15
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,329
Mom,

16
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,250
please come back and live with us.

17
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,870
Before,

18
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,400
we were always worried about you traveling between two places,

19
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,410
that your body couldn't handle it.

20
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,470
But now,

21
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,880
you don't even come back at all.

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,900
It's not like there's no place for you to stay at home,

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,490
right?

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Every day,

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,860
Tianyou keeps talking about you.

26
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,210
He says his mom's cooking

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,280
isn't as good as yours.

28
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:34,800
These past few days,

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,710
he hasn't been eating properly.

30
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,140
That won't do.

31
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,430
Tianyou is at a growing age.

32
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,590
How about this,

33
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,310
let's do it this way.

34
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,800
I'll write down some recipes for you,

35
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,910
and you can ask Yingying

36
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,560
to cook for him following the recipes.

37
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,400
Mom,

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
you know that's not what I meant.

39
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,120
You know there's so much going on at home now,

40
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,190
and Yingying and I are so busy with work.

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,710
We really can't manage it all.

42
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,400
Mom,

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,710
you're not going to abandon

44
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,280
even your own grandson

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,910
because of this old man, are you?

46
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,590
Mom hasn't,

47
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,470
how could Mom possibly abandon you?

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,080
Then come back with me now.

49
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,970
You're here every day,

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,200
with all this good food and drink.

51
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,000
There's even cake here.

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,430
What's all this for?

53
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,590
Hao Chengcai,

54
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,680
what,

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,400
don't we even have the right

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,180
to eat cake?

57
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,400
I'm talking to my mom.

58
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,310
Why are you interrupting?

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,960
You're being too unreasonable.

60
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,280
Alright, alright, alright.

61
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,120
Mom, why are you

62
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,310
still protecting him?

63
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,560
His health is poor.

64
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,750
He can't get angry.

65
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,030
His health is poor,

66
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:33,840
then

67
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
what about Tianyou's health?

68
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,120
Don't you care about that anymore?

69
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,360
Okay,

70
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,750
tell me straight today,

71
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,030
are you choosing this old man

72
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,870
or your grandson?

73
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,750
You're just an unfilial brat.

74
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,750
Who are you calling names?

75
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,870
Okay, okay, okay, that's enough.

76
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,030
Alright, alright, alright.

77
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,520
Well, son,

78
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,520
you should go home now.

79
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:52,960
It's getting late,

80
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,000
and you, you have work tomorrow.

81
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,590
Mom, you're doing this again.

82
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,520
You go ahead first.

83
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,360
Mom, this...

84
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,910
I'll take care of this.

85
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,960
You said it yourself, didn't you?

86
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes, yes, yes.

87
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,590
I did say that.

88
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,630
Right.

89
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,960
It must be Ying Youchang.

90
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,190
My mom must have, after I left,

91
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,230
told him she wanted to come back to our home.

92
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,240
So what?

93
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,310
So what?

94
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,560
Ying Youchang is disabled in both legs.

95
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,750
He has to use a wheelchair every day.

96
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,040
Eating, drinking, using the bathroom, sleeping,

97
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,560
my mom has to take care of him for everything.

98
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,560
Now that my mom says she wants to go home,

99
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,160
that's why he panicked

100
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,070
and killed my mom.

101
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,750
Moreover,

102
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,360
my mom cares so much for Tianyou.

103
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,390
So she...

104
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,360
So she couldn't possibly

105
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,720
have abandoned us.

106
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,920
Whether she abandoned you or not,

107
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,680
I don't know.

108
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,800
But you definitely abandoned her.

109
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,360
You said you went back to apologize.

110
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,750
You saw your mom's house on fire,

111
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,720
and you didn't even care.

112
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,720
You didn't even make

113
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,430
a single call to the police.

114
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,000
Have you ever heard

115
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,390
that many criminals, after committing a crime,

116
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,510
often return to the scene

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,390
to admire their handiwork?

118
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,920
What do you mean?

119
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,240
What are you implying?

120
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,630
You... you're saying

121
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,360
I set the fire

122
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,190
and burned my mom to death?

123
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,070
What else could it be?

124
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,120
When you went back the second time,

125
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,800
what did you do?

126
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,510
You didn't even try to put out the fire.

127
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,510
You just watched your mom

128
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,480
burn to death inside?

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,190
You saw it too, didn't you?

130
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,390
The scene was already

131
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,430
burned to that state.

132
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,750
It wasn't like

133
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,750
no one was trying to put out the fire.

134
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,240
Someone had already called the police.

135
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,190
After I went back,

136
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,160
what do you think I could do?

137
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,480
Should I have rushed into the fire

138
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,710
and gotten burned to death too?

139
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,040
Someone called the police,

140
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,560
is that your reason for turning away?

141
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,830
I called you all day,

142
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,560
but you didn't answer.

143
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,390
Now you're sitting here

144
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,270
like nothing happened.

145
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,360
How do you explain that?

146
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,750
I had to meet

147
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,070
an important client.

148
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,680
Meeting a client

149
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,310
is more important than your mother's life?

150
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,160
Officer Shen,

151
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,510
do you have children?

152
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,120
Do you know

153
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,120
how hard it is to raise a child?

154
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,120
Have you ever had

155
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,920
moments when you felt helpless?

156
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,800
Let me tell you,

157
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,040
my mom

158
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,870
was very good to me

159
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,070
and especially good to Tianyou.

160
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,070
Although I...

161
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
I usually treat her

162
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,870
very poorly,

163
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:58,800
but I

164
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,830
love my mother very much.

165
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,870
I have no reason

166
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,600
to kill my mother.

167
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,870
I suggest you investigate Ying Youchang.

168
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,920
I think

169
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,360
he might be responsible for this.

170
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,510
[Photo of the scene]

171
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,270
That Hao Chengcai

172
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,680
must have concealed crucial information.

173
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,720
The timing of his return to the scene

174
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
was just too convenient.

175
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,920
Who would see their own mother

176
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,190
in a fire and not try to save her?

177
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,510
He didn't even care

178
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,680
how his own mother died.

179
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,510
Only those who know the truth

180
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,480
don't care about the truth.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,870
The main issue is that

182
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,390
our interrogation time was too rushed this time.

183
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,120
Our understanding of Hao Chengcai

184
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,960
is still too limited.

185
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,510
This guy is quite a jerk,

186
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,360
but he's not wrong about one thing.

187
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,510
Zhang Yulan's death

188
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,150
doesn't benefit him

189
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,200
in any way.

190
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,440
Focus on investigating

191
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,440
Hao Chengcai's social connections.

192
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,720
Oh right, Danggui,

193
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,270
and that phone call.

194
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,600
Who was the client

195
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,720
he mentioned he was going to meet?

196
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,550
Go quickly.

197
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,150
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Okay.

198
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:12,790
Chun,

199
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,440
the test results are out.

200
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,400
[Test Result]

201
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,900
[Test Result]

202
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,220
Chun, is there any problem?

203
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,510
There's no problem with this,

204
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,510
but during the autopsy just now,

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,130
I discovered something

206
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,700
very unexpected.

207
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,870
[Son Hao Chengcai] [Couple] [Daughter-in-law Wang Yingying]

208
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,340
[Big discovery. Come quickly.]

209
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,910
Major discovery. Come quickly.

210
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,090
Tell me.

211
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,030
What have you found?

212
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,820
Zhang Yulan's house

213
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,470
is a locked room.

214
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,630
A locked room?

215
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,540
Look,

216
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,920
this door.

217
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,720
Based on the

218
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,600
fire spread trace,

219
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,510
the entire door was doused with a combustion improver,

220
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,390
which is the wine.

221
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,360
The area near the lock in the center of the door

222
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,240
was burned the most severely.

223
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,080
So this

224
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,320
is the point of origin.

225
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,600
How can you be sure

226
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,960
it's definitely a locked room?

227
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,690
Because no one

228
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,870
would set the door on fire first

229
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,890
and then open it to leave.

230
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,390
What if they poured the combustion improver first?

231
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,030
They could leave, lock the door,

232
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,030
and then place

233
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,200
a delayed ignition device inside.

234
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,200
First, we didn't find

235
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,630
any delayed ignition device at the scene.

236
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,800
Second,

237
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,080
and most importantly,

238
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,120
look at this lock.

239
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:24,960
This safety catch

240
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,840
wouldn't normally be exposed,

241
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,150
but now we can see

242
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,960
traces of combustion improver

243
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,840
and burn marks on it.

244
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,260
Moreover, this lock

245
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,200
was locked.

246
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,870
So it was locked first,

247
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,270
then doused with the combustion improver.

248
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,750
What if it was deliberately

249
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,790
designed to look like a locked room?

250
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,720
They could lock the door first,

251
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,000
then pour the combustion improver,

252
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,720
then leave,

253
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,550
and lock the door again.

254
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,150
This safety catch and this lock

255
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,080
are very close together.

256
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,510
If there had been any reopening

257
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,790
or closing action,

258
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,120
the combustion improver

259
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,000
would have been wiped off.

260
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,670
So this lock, once locked,

261
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,600
was never opened again.

262
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,320
The windows in Ying Youchang's house are sealed shut.

263
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
It really is a locked room.

264
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,510
Could it not be Hao Chengcai,

265
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,360
but Ying Youchang instead?

266
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,670
Ying Youchang is disabled in both legs.

267
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,790
He has to use a wheelchair every day.

268
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,600
For eating, drinking, and using the bathroom,

269
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,510
my mother has to take care of everything for him.

270
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,030
Now that my mother says she wants to go home,

271
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,360
he must have panicked and decided to kill.

272
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,120
This must be his doing.

273
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,340
After the autopsy,

274
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,740
I can also confirm two things.

275
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,320
First,

276
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,200
the fruit knife found on Zhang Yulan

277
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,790
had two sets of fingerprints on it.

278
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,440
One belonged to Zhang Yulan,

279
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,790
and the other to Ying Youchang.

280
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,630
Zhang Yulan's

281
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,510
blood test showed

282
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,120
negative for carboxyhemoglobin,

283
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,480
but Ying Youchang's blood

284
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,550
had a carboxyhemoglobin

285
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,440
concentration as high as

286
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,670
54.3 percent,

287
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,750
which is lethal.

288
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,670
This means

289
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,720
Zhang Yulan

290
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,440
died from

291
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,790
hypovolemic shock due to

292
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,030
a penetrating stab wound to her heart,

293
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,960
causing severe blood loss.

294
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,310
However, Ying Youchang

295
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:53,910
died from

296
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,550
carbon monoxide poisoning after

297
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,080
inhaling excessive amounts during the fire.

298
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,480
The fruit knife was an item

299
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,670
commonly used by both victims when they were alive,

300
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,360
so the fingerprints don't provide

301
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,150
clear direction for the investigation.

302
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,000
Ying Youchang's hands were tied.

303
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,960
How did he get

304
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,750
the injury on his head?

305
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,150
During the autopsy,

306
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,320
I found that the wound on his head

307
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
wasn't fatal.

308
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,550
It might have been

309
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,200
just an accidental bump.

310
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,480
Ying Youchang was disabled in both legs.

311
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,120
Was he capable of

312
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,030
killing Zhang Yulan?

313
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,840
Generally, people who have been

314
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,630
in wheelchairs for years

315
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,200
have stronger upper body strength.

316
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,910
For him to kill with one strike,

317
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,910
stabbing a standing Zhang Yulan

318
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,320
and plunging the entire knife

319
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,600
into her heart

320
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,870
would be extremely difficult.

321
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,120
Zhang Yulan could have

322
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
dodged at any moment.

323
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,200
Really.

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,670
I'll be Zhang Yulan.

325
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,480
You hold the knife.

326
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,670
You're Ying Youchang.

327
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,200
Try to stab me.

328
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,000
See?

329
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,200
But I did stab you.

330
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,440
All your assumptions

331
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,030
are based on him sitting down.

332
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,750
But if I stand up,

333
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,720
I can kill you.

334
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,360
In this autopsy, I discovered that

335
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,600
Ying Youchang's

336
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,480
leg bones

337
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,600
were completely normal.

338
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,870
His muscles showed

339
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,080
only slight atrophy,

340
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,270
and his nerves

341
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,630
were essentially the same as a normal person's.

342
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,240
This means

343
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,240
he could have stood up

344
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,510
at any time if he wanted to.

345
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,120
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

346
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,080
I've investigated this thoroughly.

347
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,120
He's been in a wheelchair since his injury.

348
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,510
No one has ever seen him stand up.

349
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,360
Could he have been faking it?

350
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,200
Did he want Zhang Yulan

351
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,680
to keep taking care of him like this?

352
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,630
Well, there's

353
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,550
another possibility.

354
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,120
PTSD.

355
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,910
Post-traumatic stress disorder

356
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,910
doesn't just affect

357
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,720
the psychological aspect,

358
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,550
but also the physiological level.

359
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,870
You mentioned earlier

360
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,120
that after Ying Youchang was injured,

361
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,960
he's been in a wheelchair ever since.

362
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,080
It's possible that at that time,

363
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,550
he experienced

364
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,600
some kind of traumatic event.

365
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,240
For example,

366
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,080
his coworkers

367
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,150
might have been amputated,

368
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,360
or some of them

369
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,360
died on the spot,

370
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,630
leading him to believe

371
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,030
that he was also severely injured.

372
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,150
Under such strong psychological influence,

373
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,670
even if his physical functions

374
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,670
are completely healthy,

375
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,550
he still can't stand up.

376
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,320
So you're saying

377
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,080
that Ying Youchang's legs

378
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,910
might not have any problems?

379
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,390
It's that he

380
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,750
believes he has a problem.

381
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,720
That's correct.

382
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,750
Then can he stand up?

383
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
I don't know about that.

384
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,600
I can't

385
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,200
perform an autopsy on his psychological state.

386
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,270
But I can only say

387
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,510
that he has the physiological

388
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,320
conditions to stand up.

389
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,480
If that's the case,

390
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,150
then that day...

391
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,080
The situation that day should have been like this.

392
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,200
Around 10 o'clock,

393
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,790
Hao Chengcai and Zhang Yulan

394
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,550
had an argument.

395
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,120
Around 10:30,

396
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,960
Zhang Yulan confessed to Ying Youchang

397
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,750
that she wanted to go back

398
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,670
to take care of her son's family.

399
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,910
What?

400
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,150
You're really leaving?

401
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,790
Come, come, have a drink.

402
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,910
Take a sip.

403
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,390
Now you say you won't take care of me,

404
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,270
just like that?

405
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,390
You're really cruel, aren't you?

406
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,200
People can't be greedy and insatiable.

407
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,840
So all these years,

408
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,480
I've been taking care of an ungrateful wolf.

409
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:42,840
What?

410
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,390
You regret it?

411
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,270
I do regret it.

412
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,750
Go ahead and regret it.

413
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,270
After killing Zhang Yulan,

414
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,200
Ying Youchang finally calmed down.

415
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,440
He probably recalled

416
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,390
all the good things Zhang Yulan had done for him over the years.

417
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,000
He finally decided to die with her.

418
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,790
After setting the fire,

419
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,480
to prevent himself from changing his mind,

420
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,200
he even tied himself up.

421
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,550
It seems

422
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,720
he still had feelings for Zhang Yulan.

423
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,080
In the last moment,

424
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,320
he wanted to take one last look at Zhang Yulan,

425
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,960
but accidentally hit his head on the corner of the table

426
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,960
and passed out.

427
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,150
This way,

428
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,240
all the evidence at the scene

429
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,790
can be explained.

430
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,390
Could the psychological impact

431
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,030
really be that significant?

432
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,960
Of course it can.

433
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,550
There are many similar situations

434
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,200
in life.

435
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Let me give you an example.

436
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,870
For instance, some people in China

437
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,240
eat noodles and other wheat products without any issues.

438
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,080
But after going abroad,

439
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,960
they learn about something

440
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,240
called a gluten-free diet.

441
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,750
You know what that is, right?

442
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,720
Wait, wait.

443
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
What's a gluten-free diet?

444
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,840
Simply put,

445
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,670
it's removing the gluten

446
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,470
from flour.

447
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,650
You mean the gluten in roasted gluten?

448
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,240
Yes.

449
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,349
Just say it like that next time.

450
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,550
Don't interrupt.

451
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,829
In this world,

452
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,960
there are indeed people

453
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,200
who are allergic to gluten.

454
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,640
That's why this diet exists.

455
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,480
But some people,

456
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,160
when they were in China,

457
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,589
weren't actually allergic to gluten.

458
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,349
After going abroad,

459
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,510
they developed a sense of belonging.

460
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,290
They start to think,

461
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,030
"Actually, I've always been

462
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,319
allergic to gluten."

463
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,720
Then they attribute all their

464
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,810
minor ailments

465
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,660
to gluten.

466
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,520
As a result,

467
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,579
when they actually eat

468
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,480
flour that they weren't

469
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,200
allergic to before,

470
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,590
they start to have allergic reactions.

471
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,750
So food allergies

472
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,510
can also be influenced by psychology.

473
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,400
That's right.

474
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,350
I'm cooking shrimp for you in the pot.

475
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,720
Your favorite.

476
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,210
He Xi.

477
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,070
So they're not actually allergic to gluten,

478
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,160
it's actually psychological.

479
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,170
As for whether there's a physical allergy,

480
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,480
further testing is needed.

481
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,750
However,

482
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,880
if

483
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,070
you don't tell them

484
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,200
there's gluten in the flour,

485
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,960
they might eat it without any problems.

486
00:17:59,030 --> 00:17:59,900
That's amazing.

487
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,200
Get me some water.

488
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,500
I'm allergic to shrimp. Hurry!

489
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,220
Look, is my neck turning red?

490
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,310
Is it red?

491
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,160
It's red.

492
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,080
Anyway,

493
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,590
we still need to investigate this case.

494
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,320
There are two points now.

495
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,200
First,

496
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,000
what's Ying Youchang's

497
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,590
motive for murder?

498
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,400
Second,

499
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,720
can he actually

500
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,640
stand up or not?

501
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,000
Do you have any instant noodles here?

502
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,030
Hungry?

503
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,480
I'm hungry.

504
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,480
I haven't had dinner yet.

505
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,270
You dragged me here before I could eat.

506
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,200
How about this,

507
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,070
let's go to my place.

508
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,480
I'll make noodles for both of you.

509
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,200
Fierce Xu is quite hospitable, huh?

510
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,890
Are you sure

511
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,830
you want us to go to your place?

512
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,580
Yes, of course.

513
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,110
Have you been there?

514
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,070
No, I haven't.

515
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,160
But I know what it's like

516
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,790
even without going.

517
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,880
Let's go.

518
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,440
Come to my house together.

519
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,830
Let me be clear.

520
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,550
It's my first time visiting your home.

521
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,550
I don't know what to buy for you.

522
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,790
Let's see what you need, then I'll buy it for you.

523
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,240
You two wait outside for a moment.

524
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,200
I'll go in and tidy up a bit.

525
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,440
No need, no need.

526
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,350
Don't bother.

527
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,850
This Fierce Xu.

528
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,030
He's quite self-conscious, isn't he?

529
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,000
Hurry up.

530
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,840
Come on, come on.

531
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,720
Please come in, please come in.

532
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,440
Sorry for the intrusion.

533
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,190
What's there to tidy up here?

534
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,440
Come in.

535
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,150
No need to change your shoes.

536
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,110
Xu,

537
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,110
your home is a grand mansion, huh?

538
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,110
We don't have chairs at home.

539
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,990
Sit on this.

540
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,320
It's fine, quite eco-friendly.

541
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,750
Has he always been like this?

542
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,960
Yes, since he was young.

543
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,720
always like this.

544
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,880
This Fierce Xu's style

545
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,920
is quite unique.

546
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,070
Alright, alright.

547
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,920
Stop, stop bustling about.

548
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,720
Um, I'll take a look around, okay?

549
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,310
Sure.

550
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,600
Then I'll go prepare the food.

551
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,720
Thanks for the trouble.

552
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,240
It's no trouble.

553
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,550
He seems to love reading.

554
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,000
Xu,

555
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,880
just now, when you were alone

556
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,750
in the room.

557
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,830
did you throw out the useless furniture

558
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,240
through this window?

559
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,570
Xu,

560
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,550
you have this hobby, huh?

561
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,370
[Han Group]

562
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,920
Need help with that?

563
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,310
No need, I can manage.

564
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,270
Alright then.

565
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,750
Then I'll treat this place.

566
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,940
like my own home, okay?

567
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,680
This Fierce Xu.

568
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,000
Still so energetic.

569
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
There's another room here.

570
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,070
Chun,

571
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,830
Chun,

572
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,720
come.

573
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,510
Look.

574
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,510
This must be the old case of their family, right?

575
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,920
You've been asking me before.

576
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,160
why he cares so much about

577
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:22,920
who exactly died

578
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
in that case

579
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,880
That was the reason.

580
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,410
Tell me

581
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,240
about this case of their family.

582
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
What exactly happened?

583
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:36,880
Many years ago.

584
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,180
Tongsheng's parents,

585
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,160
due to a fire caused by an explosion.

586
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,480
died at home.

587
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,640
Tongsheng narrowly escaped.

588
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,470
That explosion

589
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,590
was ruled as an accident.

590
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,650
But Tongsheng never believed it.

591
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,720
Later.

592
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,720
he was sent to

593
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,920
the welfare home run by my mother.

594
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,070
So he and I

595
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,590
grew up together, you could say.

596
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,720
Later on,

597
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,880
he went to the fire academy

598
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:02,960
and studied fire investigation.

599
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,000
So this case,

600
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,110
he's never let it go.

601
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,730
He's been investigating it all this time,

602
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,400
but the case

603
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,960
hasn't made much progress.

604
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,440
However, a while ago,

605
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,120
he excitedly told me

606
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,640
that he finally found out

607
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,620
this case

608
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,270
is related to the Han Group,

609

[Han Group]

610
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,720
especially

611
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,350
to Han Kun and Han Pei.

612
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,750
If we could just crack Han Pei,

613
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,110
there would be a breakthrough in the case.

614
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,730
But Han Pei

615
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,650
is already dead.

616
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,590
Yes, that's right.

617
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,440
He must be very upset.

618
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,550
I just don't want to see him

619
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,440
so upset.

620
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,550
This matter

621
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,110
has been weighing on his mind

622
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,960
and has already caused him

623
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,240
to have some emotional issues.

624
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,440
So I've been trying to persuade him,

625
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,590
hoping he could let it go.

626
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,160
But with his personality,

627
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,880
you know how he is.

628
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,310
He definitely can't let it go.

629
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,680
If it were me,

630
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,920
I'd want to know the truth too.

If you try to give him anything,

657
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,490
he'll definitely refuse.

I do mind you.

indeed involves one deceased person

749
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,400
we won't file criminal charges.

750

00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,110
that my sister Yulan

954
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,679
has so much free time

955
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,449
with nothing to do.

956
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,030
So he put Yulan

957
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,070
in their workplace

958
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,530
to work as a cleaner.

959
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,540
One reason is to let her,

960
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,550
my sister Yulan herself,

961
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,280
earn some money,

962
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,150
and another is

963
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,480
to conveniently help him look after his children.

964
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,110
I see.

965
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,710
So, um...

966
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Ying Youchang and Zhang Yulan...

967
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,370
How's their relationship?

968
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,280
Is it because of these things

969
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,960
that they always argue?

970
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,699
No.

971
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,030
Her relationship with Ying

972
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:47,900
is actually quite good.

973
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,260
What's her story?

974
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,659
Hao Chengcai was two years old

975
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,690
when his father passed away, right?

976
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,400
Imagine a woman raising a child alone,

977
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,030
how difficult it must be.

978
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,880
Later, she met Ying.

979
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,140
Their relationship was quite good.

980
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,940
But,

981
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,180
Hao Chengcai and Ying didn't get along.

982
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,440
Every time they met, there was a fight.

983
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,580
Every single time.

984
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,510
Because of this,

985
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,510
my sister Yulan

986
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,590
and Ying

987
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,210
even separated for a while.

988
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,730
But somehow later,

989
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,150
when they got back together,

990
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,760
Ying's legs gave out.

991
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,230
You know,

992
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,210
Ying ended up

993
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,580
in a wheelchair.

994
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:18,650
Auntie,

995
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,190
have you seen Ying Youchang

996
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,190
stand up in recent years?

997
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,430
I've never seen him stand up.

998
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,150
His legs are problematic.

999
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,120
How could he stand up?

1000
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,480
Are you sure he can't stand up,

1001
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,130
right?

1002
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,800
He can't stand up, he can't stand up.

1003
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,500
He really can't stand up.

1004
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,470
But he takes care of the family.

1005
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,330
Let me tell you,

1006
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,150
Yulan and I,

1007
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:36,920
when we were young,

1008
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,400
we

1009
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,120
loved to make noise and play,

1010
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,500
loved to dance and eat candy.

1011
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,710
Later, Yulan got diabetes.

1012
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,640
To save on...

1013
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,190
Wait, Auntie.

1014
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,220
She has diabetes?

1015
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,160
Yes.

1016
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,400
To save on that...

1017
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,190
The one for injections.

1018
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,000
The money for insulin.

1019
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,190
She doesn't even eat sugar anymore.

1020
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:52,800
She just...

1021
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,470
Cake.

1022
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:53,960
Just...

1023
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,440
What?

1024
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,560
Cake.

1025
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,410
She...

1026
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,790
You, you listen to me.

1027
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,880
You... you don't suspect

1028
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,800
Ying, do you?

1029
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,280
No, no.

1030
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,110
Auntie, please continue.

1031
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,780
[Photo of the scene]

1032
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,490
Still reluctant to leave, huh?

1033
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,840
Really want to compete for my job?

1034
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,400
Go check

1035
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,360
Zhang Yulan's medical history.

1036
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,960
Among the evidence at the scene,

1037
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,480
burnt cake packaging was found.

1038
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,560
Zhang Yulan has diabetes.

1039
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,860
When Hao Chengcai was returning home,

1040
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,840
[Photo of the scene]

1041
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,620
he saw Zhang Yulan eating cake.

1042
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,190
After investigation,

1043
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,880
the cake was a regular full-sugar cake.

1044
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,320
They've been living together

1045
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,960
for so many years.

1046
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,230
He couldn't possibly not know

1047
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,230
that his mother has diabetes.

1048
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,590
Someone who sees

1049
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,510
his own mother's house on fire

1050
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,660
and turns away,

1051
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,150
what could he possibly care about?

1052
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,150
What does he care about?

1053
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,960
He cares about the death certificate.

1054
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,320
This morning,

1055
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,880
he came to me,

1056
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,440
all flustered,

1057
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,710
demanding a death certificate.

1058
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,790
Death certificate?

1059
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,700
Auntie Lin just said

1060
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,150
that Hao Chengcai and Zhang Yulan

1061
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,230
were in the same company.

1062
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,510
Let's go take a look.

1063
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,290
Let's go.

[Zhang Yulan] [Hao Chengcai]

1068
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,150
Hello.

1069
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,410
What's the matter?

1070
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,910
It's nothing, don't be nervous.

1071
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,070
We're here to gather some information.

1072
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,970
Is Zhang Yulan from here?

1073
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,690
Zhang Yulan?

1074
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,710
Who is Zhang Yulan?

1075
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Let me show you a photo.

1076
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,270
It's her.

1077
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,090
A cleaner here.

1078
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,800
She quit half a month ago.

1079
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:00,910
Think carefully.

1080
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,670
Oh, her.

1081
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,680
That woman.

1082
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,710
She just came to work,

1083
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,460
and left when it was time.

1084
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,290
What about her?

1085
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,360
Did she and your Director Hao

1086
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,310
not talk at all?

1087
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,370
Director Hao?

1088
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,820
Why are you asking about Director Hao?

1089
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,700
What would Director Hao have to say to her?

1090
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
Didn't Director Hao

1091
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,670
come today?

1092
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,440
He didn't.

1093
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,360
Wait, you didn't even check.

1094
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,320
How do you know he didn't come?

1095
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,400
I know who's here and who's not in our company.

1096
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,450
Don't I?

1097
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,250
Besides,

1098
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,000
Director Hao,

1099
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:25,960
his watches,

1100
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,320
shoes are never the same.

1101
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,840
His clothes are all tailor-made.

1102
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,860
Who wouldn't remember that?

1103
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,280
Your Director Hao

1104
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,440
seems to be quite well-off, huh?

1105
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,660
A three-bedroom apartment in Pinyi Community,

1106
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,470
plus two cars worth over 300,000 each.

1107
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,710
Oh, right.

1108
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,110
I heard the other day that their kid

1109
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,950
just transferred to Best International School.

1110
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,880
That's not

1111
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,330
a school you can get into just with money.

1112
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,960
Maybe not tycoon level,

1113
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,240
but it's pretty good, right?

1114
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,440
Wait, your salary and benefits here

1115
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,890
are quite good, aren't they?

1116
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Just for him as a director,

1117
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,290
he can earn this much in a year?

1118
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,280
These days,

1119
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,000
who lives on salary alone?

1120
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,030
Usually, Director Hao

1121
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,140
is so extravagant.

1122
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,530
He's clearly from a rich family.

1123
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,360
I heard his mother

1124
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,840
is retiring in New Zealand.

1125
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,630
Mom.

1126
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,380
I'm not criticizing you, but

1127
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,170
look at how you're dressed

1128
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,970
for going out.

1129
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,190
I've been a bit busy these past few days.

1130
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,480
I haven't had time to look for anything else.

1131
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,410
Busy, busy, busy.

1132
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,590
What are you so busy with?

1133
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,320
You've been busy with that old man again, haven't you?

1134
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,740
Stop calling him "old man" all the time.

1135
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,550
Would it be better if I took this off?

1136
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,000
How about this?

1137
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,810
Honey,

1138
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,730
come here quickly.

1139
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,320
I'll find someone to take a photo for us.

1140
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,640
Okay.

1141
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,110
Mom, come on.

1142
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:02,950
Let's go take a photo together.

1143
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,680
I'm not going.

1144
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,990
Come on, come on, let's go.

1145
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,760
Just come along since I called you, hurry up.

1146
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:07,320
Let's go, let's go.

1147
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't know how to take photos.

1148
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,480
Let's go.

1149
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,190
Ma'am,

1150
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,550
you can move a bit closer

1151
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,420
to your husband.

1152
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,770
Do you want your maid in the picture?

1153
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,550
If she's going to be in the photo,

1154
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,920
you'll need to move in a bit more.

1155
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,230
Well.

1156
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Alright, forget it.

1157
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,310
Let's take it ourselves.

1158
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,150
No, wait.

1159
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,110
I just remembered.

1160
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,260
I don't... I don't want to take photos anymore.

1161
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,190
I still have some things over there

1162
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:29,670
I haven't tidied them up yet.

1163
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,240
No...

1164
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,030
Grandma.

1165
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:31,630
You can tidy up later.

1166
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,030
Tianyou.

1167
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,510
Honey.

1168
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,510
I don't want to be in the photo. You can take it.

1169
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,400
Let's take one first.

1170
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,410
They're waiting for us.

1171
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,090
Thank you for your trouble.

1172
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,120
Smile a bit more happily.

1173
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,890
What a heartless beast.

1174
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,060
I've long suspected something was off about him.

1175
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,320
I can't believe he'd even

1176
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:07,840
disown his own mother.

1177
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,510
To have such a son,

1178
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,380
that mother must be terribly unlucky.

1179
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,550
He claimed to be from a wealthy family,

1180
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,840
saying his mother was retired in New Zealand.

1181
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,870
He's quite the storyteller, isn't he?

1182
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,410
So where did all that money come from?

1183
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,920
His salary certainly wouldn't cover his spending.

1184
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:17,880
He may have won the lottery?

1185
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,290
Speak.

1186
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:24,680
Captain Shen,

1187
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,710
before Hao Chengcai went home,

1188
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,670
he went to the insurance company again.

1189
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,830
Just a moment.

1190
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,440
check on him,

1191
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,520
what kind of insurance did he buy?

1192
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,150
I've checked. He hasn't bought any insurance.

1193
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,210
Check on Zhang Yulan again.

1194
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,260
Zhang Yulan?

1195
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,070
Please check on Zhang Yulan.

1196
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,000
Captain Shen,

1197
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,510
Zhang Yulan bought

1198
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,590
personal accident insurance for herself.

1199
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,230
Personal accident insurance?

1200
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,760
Okay, I got it.

1201
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,660
Yingying.

1202
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,230
This money needs to be paid back quickly.

1203
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,150
Alright, Zhao.

1204
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,710
I understand.

1205
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,000
Okay, in the next couple of days,

1206
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,880
I'll transfer it to you.

1207
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,380
I'm sorry about this.

1208
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:24,960
Thank you.

1209
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,570
Tianyou, have you changed yet?

1210
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,920
Why are you wearing this old thing again?

1211
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,360
Didn't I buy you new clothes?

1212
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,190
Wear this one.

1213
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,880
Look, this...

1214

just loves to hoard this junk.

1217
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,370
I'll throw it all away later.

1218
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,580
No, don't!

1219
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,800
Grandma has already

1220
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,270
embroidered a little tiger where it was torn.

1221
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,450
A little tiger?

1222
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,250
So, so...

1223
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,740
Is this it?

1224
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,720
Isn't it embarrassing to wear this outside?

1225
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,600
How many times have I told you?

1226
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,710
You can't wear these things

1230
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,230
I'm not afraid of being laughed at.

1231
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,520
I don't like the new school either.

1232
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,310
Wear this one.

1233
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,040

1238

Different types of fires

1239
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,680
require specific initial extinguishing methods.

1240
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:23,630
For instance, in the event of an electrical fire at home,

1241
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,350
the first step is to cut off the power supply before attempting to extinguish the fire.

1242
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,950
It is best to use a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher for this purpose.

1243
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:28,950
If one is not available,

1244
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,760
a dry powder extinguisher

1245
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,080
or a water mist extinguisher can also be used.

1246
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,630
In the case of a grease fire in a cooking pan,

1247
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,310
cover the pan with a lid or use a fire blanket to smother the flames.

1248
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,560
It is crucial never to pour water onto a grease fire.
