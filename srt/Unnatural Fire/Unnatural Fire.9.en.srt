Get up already!

00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,710
does that mean the world stops spinning?

53
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,090
Does that mean we don't have to pay the mortgage anymore?

54
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,430
Does that mean we don't need to pick up and drop off Tianyou anymore?

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,150
we can't rule out the possibility that Zhang Yulan

192
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,550
deliberately said things like going home to

193
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,240
take care of her grandson

194
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,480
to provoke Ying Youchang

195
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,750
into killing her.

196
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,630
Strangely,

197
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,950
in either scenario,

198
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,740
he wouldn't be able to claim the insurance money.

199
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,630
We can't rule out the possibility

200
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,880
that Ying Youchang might have

201
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,160
killed Zhang Yulan for some reason.

202
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,080
After all, he was

203
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,150
physically capable of committing the crime.

204
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,170
And the crime scene

205
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,720
also supports our

206
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,790
initial theory

207
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,670
that Ying Youchang

208
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,870
committed suicide

209
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,750
after killing Zhang Yulan.

210
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,730
I have a question.

211
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,510
The zip tie marks on Ying Youchang's hands

212
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,840
are very deep.

213
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,360
The human body has

214
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,560
an automatic protection mechanism.

215
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,680
If one is feeling pain,

216
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,200
he will try to alleviate it.

217
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,060
Yet, for the sake of dying together,

218
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,230
he strangled himself so tightly,

219
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,820
which proves

220
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,120
his love for Zhang Yulan

221
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,340
was very deep.

222
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,300
With such deep feelings for her,

223
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,020
I really can't imagine

224
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,730
that he'd bear to plunge the entire blade

225
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,320
into her heart.

226
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,310
Here's what we'll do.

227
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,340
Let's find another person to question

228
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,220
who knows Zhang Yulan well

229
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,640
and won't lie.

230
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,450
Tianyou,

231
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,160
in the school cafeteria.

232
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,630
The teacher will be waiting for you nearby.

233
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:44,720
Thank you.

234
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,670
Thank you, sister.

235
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,550
You're welcome.

236
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,730
Officer,

237
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,030
has something

238
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,910
happened to my grandma?

239
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,830
Grandma said

240
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,750
that lying is wrong.

241
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,440
Don't lie to me.

242
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,710
Why do you ask that, Tianyou?

243
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,470
No matter how tired Grandma is,

244
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,010
she always comes to take care of me.

245
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,920
But last weekend, when I was at home,

246
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,870
Grandma didn't even call me.

247
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,830
Because Grandma

248
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,620
is at home taking care of Grandpa Ying.

249
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,390
Do you know Grandpa Ying, Tianyou?

250
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,380
Has Grandma ever told you

251
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,200
what kind of person Grandpa  Ying is?

252
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,370
Grandpa Ying is a very nice grandpa.

253
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,750
Every time Grandma

254
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,870
talks to him on the phone,

255
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,090
she smiles.

256
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,690
I've talked to Grandpa Ying too.

257
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,260
His voice is very kind.

258
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,030
Has Grandma ever

259
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,960
told you

260
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,870
that taking care of Grandpa Ying

261
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,150
is hard work or anything like that?

262
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,660
She said

263
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,510
that it wasn't her taking care of Grandpa Ying,

264
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,040
but Grandpa Ying taking care of her.

265
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,030
She's only happy

266
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:03,980
when she's with Grandpa.

267
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,090
But Dad gets angry.

268
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,720
He says that Grandma taking care of Grandpa Ying

269
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,780
wastes time,

270
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,290
and he often argues with her about it.

271
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,640
Tianyou,

272
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,080
put on your slippers quickly.

273
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,720
The floor is cold.

274
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,240
Here, your schoolbag.

275
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,320
Go to your room and do your homework.

276
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,510
Grandma's going to buy groceries.

277
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,030
You're back, Mom.

278
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,370
You're home.

279
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,410
Are you going out again?

280
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,320
I'm going to buy groceries.

281
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,550
Are you

282
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,480
going to see that old man again?

283
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,040
I'll just check on him on my way to the market.

284
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,510
I'm really not trying to criticize you,

285
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,910
but how much longer

286
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,000
are you going to waste your time on him?

287
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,750
Who's more important,

288
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,790
he or your grandson?

289
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,750
It's almost dinner time.

290
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,400
Tianyou won't be able to eat on time again.

291
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,600
He's growing right now,

292
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,440
don't you know?

293
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,800
Then I'll hurry to buy groceries.

294
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,010
Don't go see him!

295
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,720
Go back to your room and do your homework!

296
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,310
Every day,

297
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,870
neither the old one nor the young one gives me any peace of mind.

298
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,330
Then how does your father...

299
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,340
treat your grandmother?

300
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,440
Mom.

301
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,200
It's so late.

302
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,030
Why aren't you in bed yet?

303
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,520
Tianyou's sweater

304
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,270
has a hole.

305
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,030
I'm sewing a little tiger onto it

306
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,330
to cover the hole.

307
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,600
I remember when you were little,

308
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,790
there was also a time

309
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,720
when your shirt had a hole.

310
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,080
I sewed a little tiger on it

311
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,080
to cover the hole.

312
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,020
You told me

313
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,570
that every time you saw the tiger,

314
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,850
it made you happy

315
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,280
all day long.

316
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,500
Enough, enough, stop sewing it.

317
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,990
Look how torn it is! What's the point?

318
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,120
Do you think I was happy?

319
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,610
I was just trying to make you happy.

320
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,080
Do you know

321
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,810
that when I wore that patched-up shirt to school,

322
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,480
all my classmates

323
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,240
laughed at me?

324
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,840
What were they laughing at?

325
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,210
What were they laughing at?

326
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,550
They laughed at me for wearing

327
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,290
a patched-up shirt to school!

328
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,960
They laughed at our family for being poor, for having no money!

329
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,180
Why didn't you tell me back then?

330
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,670
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

331
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,080
Besides,

332
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
would it have changed anything if I had told you?

333
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,480
Would we have stopped being poor?

334
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,510
I've worked so hard for all these years

335
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,790
just to make sure that Tianyou

336
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,260
won't go through what I did as a child,

337
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,250
being bullied,

338
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,360
laughed at,

339
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,390
and looked down upon!

340
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,360
And here you are...

341
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,510
What are you looking at?

342
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,390
Go to bed now.

343
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,200
Dad,

344
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,390
look at this sweater.

345
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,320
It actually looks pretty nice.

346
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,320
Nice?

347
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,050
You little brat, what do you know?

348
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,320
Go, go, go.

349
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,690
Uncle,

350
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,520
is my grandma

351
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,050
not coming back?

352
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,460
Can you show me

353
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,000
what you're touching?

354
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,540
Grandma said

355
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,850
she wanted me to grow up like a little tiger,

356
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,800
tall

357
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,640
and strong.

358
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,440
Uncle.

359
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,530
Are you drinking ice water?

360
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,590
Before,

361
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,710
whenever Grandma took me for ice cream,

362
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,390
she would only drink ice water.

363
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,180
She said

364
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,050
it was the best thing

365
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,670
to drink in the ice cream shop.

366
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,770
May I have a taste?

367
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,839
It doesn't taste good at all.

368
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,410
Grandma is a liar.

369
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,630
Uncle.

370
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,530
I miss Grandma so much.

371
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,500
Tianyou.

372
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,470
Remember this.

373
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,020
You had a grandmother

374
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,920
who loved you more than anyone else in the world.

375
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,690
[Police-School Joint Protection]

376
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,240
A son who despises

377
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,110
his own background

378
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,440
and a mother who dared

379
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
to sacrifice everything.

00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,190
My son has struggled so hard

757
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,550
to get where he is.

758
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,790
How could I...

759
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,990
Isn't it the natural order of things

760
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,630
for a son to pay for his mother's medical treatment?

761
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,800
I don't want to be a burden to him.

762
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,250
Since you don't want to burden him,

763
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,600
then I'll go sell my kidney.

764
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,630
Ying,

765
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,960
I want to ask you a question.

766
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:09,960
Go ahead.

767
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,320
Do you really want to help me?

768
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,150
Of course.

769
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,480
Is this truly from your heart?

770
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,420
Listen to me.

771
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,610
[Yibang & Da'an Joint Insurance Co., Ltd.]

00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,040
[What kind of treatment do disabled people receive in prison?]

773
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,040
People with disabilities

774
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,610
who accidentally kill someone

775
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,320
won't be sentenced to death.

776
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:31,890
Look.

777
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,540
I've also looked into

778
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,370
the conditions at the prison.

779
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,870
So, I want you to let me do this.

780
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,880
I can only buy personal accident insurance.

781
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,990
What are you talking about?

782
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,750
I don't need to sell your kidney,

783
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,520
and I won't let you raise money either.

784
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,640
I don't need any of that.

785
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,990
I just hope you

786
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,350
will do as I say.

787
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,360
That would be helping me.

788
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,070
Yulan.

789
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,080
Even though you have the heart to do this,

790
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,450
I can't bring myself to do such a cruel thing.

791
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,250
I'm terminally ill anyway.

792
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,980
I don't have long to live.

793
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,150
A human life is at stake.

794
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,030
You must think it through carefully.

795
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
I have no other choice but this.

796
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,270
Even so,

797
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,270
you still have a clear conscience?

798
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,520
Aren't you curious

799
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,050
about what your mother

800
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,720
experienced on the night of the incident

801
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,790
and how she really died?

802
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,050
She was stabbed to death by that old man.

803
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,510
I'm very clear about this.

804
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,630
You don't need to tell me.

805
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,530
Are you sure?

806
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,320
I am sure.

807
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:20,920
No,

808
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,070
you're not.

810
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,660

811

Come on, sit.

812
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,070
Have a drink with me.

813
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,500
It's good.

814
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,870
This baijiu...

815
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,600
is made from pure grain.

816

The seller said

817
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,210
it had been buried underground for many years.

818
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,540
In my entire life...

819
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:34,850
I've never had

820
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,630
such an exquisite cake.

821
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,170
You've suffered a lot these years.

822
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,750
Not suffering.

823
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,290
Sweet.

824
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,340
It's all my fault.

825
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,160
I should have

826
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,960
insisted on staying with you

827
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,320
back then.

828
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,510
Let's not talk about...

829
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,110
the past anymore.

830
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,250
No past stories.

831
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,830
Should we talk about the future?

832
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,010
Back then,

833
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,680
you often came to

834
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,480
where I worked to see me...

835
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,840
and brought me meals.

836
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,570
One day,

837
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,750
the sun was shining so brightly.

838
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,480
It shone on your head,

839
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,660
enveloping it in a radiant golden hue.

840
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,420
You were like a goddess descending from heaven,

841
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,760
extraordinarily beautiful.

842
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,860
You're always like this.

843
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,000
You always say how good others are,

844
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:09,960
how wonderful they are.

845
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,850
But you can't see the good in yourself.

846
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,390
It's because I'm not good enough

847
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,350
that I always lose you.

848
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,480
No, that's not true.

849
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,150
Come on.

850
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,760
Let's drink.
