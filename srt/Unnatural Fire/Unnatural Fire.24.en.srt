[Episode 24]

3
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,479
My father

4
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,520
and my mentor?

5
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,729
Shen Yi and Gu Nuo?

6
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,310
Yes.

7
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,860
If I'm not mistaken,

8
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,229
the two of them, one inside and one outside,

9
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,880
have been watching you closely

10
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,600
from home to work.

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,590
Chief Wu, that's impossible, isn't it?

12
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,320
I know this might be

13
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,710
difficult for you to accept,

14
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,389
but think about it carefully.

15
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,910
Isn't that how it is?

16
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,240
As I remember,

17
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,470
my father

18
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,680
only met my mentor a few times,

19
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,290
and it was all because of me.

20
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,210
I don't think so.

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,780
I believe you

22
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,840
don't have

23
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,460
the full picture of this situation.

24
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,000
You might be

25
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,390
the main target they're trying to deceive.

26
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,030
Why?

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,400
To know why,

28
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,430
that's the reason

29
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,410
I brought you here today.

30
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,390
I want you to think back

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,310
and see if there's anything

32
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,290
unusual

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,190
in your recent life

34
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,430
to see if you can provide us

35
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,329
with some clues.

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,740
At first,

37
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,910
we didn't want to tell you these things.

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,460
Firstly,

39
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,520
we're not sure if there's a problem

40
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,190
with Gu Nuo.

41
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,190
Secondly, you and Gu Nuo

42
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,570
are in a mentor-student relationship after all.

43
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,460
If we alert him,

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,320
whether you're aware of it or not,

45
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,130
it will bring difficulties

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,080
to our investigation work.

47
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,210
Also,

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,360
our investigation work

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,470
has reached a critical point now.

50
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,240
Aren't you also

51
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,320
confused about

52
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,630
many things now?

53
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,710
So we want

54
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,930
you to join us,

55
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,800
share information,

56
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,320
and work together

57
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,120
so we don't get stuck

58
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,030
in moving forward.

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,320
Take your time to think about it.

60
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,190
Thank you, Chief Chang.

61
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,030
Chief Chang,

62
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:03,960
Chief Wu,

63
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,100
I've been with my mentor

64
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,880
for so many years.

65
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,220
There are many details

66
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,520
that I can't recall

67
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,710
at the moment.

68
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,760
But there's one thing

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,279
I must tell you.

70
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,360
I just found out

71
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,630
about this matter recently.

72
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,210
Shen Yi

73
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,030
is not my biological father.

74
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,830
The identity of Shen Ye

75
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,800
was fabricated by him.

76
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,930
Are you sure?

77
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,990
Absolutely certain.

78
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,990
What exactly happened?

79
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,350
Twenty years ago,

80
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,100
in Binjiang University of Technology's

81
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:46,920
bomb case,

82
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,070
my biological father

83
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,060
was the victim.

84
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,780
His name is He Runian.

85
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,610
I was in charge of that case.

86
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,870
I'm saying you're using that case

87
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,820
to deceive me?

88
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,900
My name should be He Xi.

89
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,960
Two years

90
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,000
after my biological father passed away,

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,210
I experienced another

92
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,350
arson case.

93
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,300
I survived,

94
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,480
but I lost

95
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,870
all my memories

96
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,750
from before I was twelve.

97
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,430
It was Shen Yi

98
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,390
who took me away at that time.

99
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,960
All these years,

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,860
he has been hiding the truth from me.

101
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,340
There must be a reason.

102
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,420
And you just mentioned

103
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,070
that he and my mentor

104
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,740
have some unspeakable secret.

105
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,990
There must be something wrong with them.

106
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,390
Well,

107
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,970
so are you going to

108
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,070
continue living with him

109
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,040
in this current state?

110
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,270
My memory has just been restored.

111
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,570
He doesn't know about it yet.

112
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,490
I want to maintain the status quo,

113
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,409
stay by his side,

114
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,760
and continue the investigation.

115
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,620
We will keep this matter

116
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,870
strictly confidential.

117
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,350
If you need anything,

118
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,220
communicate directly with Chief Wu.

119
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,220
We can assist you.

120
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,510
Alright.

121
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,410
Chief Chang, Chief Wu,

122
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,360
there's one more thing.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,010
A few days ago,

124
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,390
Adviser Xu from the Fire Investigation Department

125
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,380
was attacked.

126
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,440
It's also very strange.

127
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,490
He was the first to know

128
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,070
that Shen Yi had forged my identity.

129
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,950
They had just had a direct confrontation,

130
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,600
and then he encountered danger.

131
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,500
Moreover,

132
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,130
the eyewitness at the time

133
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,030
retracted their statement midway.

134
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,910
Due to insufficient evidence,

135
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,950
the police closed the case as an accident.

136
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,670
I just received news

137
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,260
that the worker who injured Xu Tongsheng

138
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,200
[The worker Qin Shun had a heart attack. He died at home.]

139
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,380
named Qin Shun

140
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,390
had a sudden heart attack

141
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,070
and died at home.

142
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:43,600
A sudden heart attack?

143
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,800
Did he have a history of heart disease?

144
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,630
This seems too sudden.

145
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,950
Go investigate.

146
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:53,800
Okay.

147
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,850
This matter

148
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,190
is far more complicated

149
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,470
than we imagined.

150
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,930
Shen Ye,

151
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,710
the content of our conversation today

152
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,000
must be kept strictly confidential.

153
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,910
The fact that you've regained your memory

154
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,630
cannot be known by anyone.

155
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,750
Understood.

156
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,510
Bro, are you busy?

157
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,240
Well,

158
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,630
I saw online a couple of days ago

159
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,620
that this construction site

160
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,110
had an accident recently.

161
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,600
Yes, that's right.

162
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,750
One of my coworkers fell

163
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,880
and hit someone.

164
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,570
Is that person okay?

165
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,510
He died.

166
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,240
Who died?

167
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,270
Our coworker,

168
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:51,920
Qin Shun.

169
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,050
How did he die?

170
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,680
At home,

171
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,070
he died of a sudden heart attack.

172
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,430
Did he have heart disease?

173
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,240
Back when he was at home,

174
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,630
I never heard he had heart problems.

175
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,070
Well.

176
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,000
He had poor psychological resilience.

177
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,830
Maybe he was just scared to death

178
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,030
because of this incident.

179
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,950
Let's not talk about it anymore.

180
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,560
It's bad luck, bad luck.

181
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,920
-Let’s get to work.
-Let’s get to work.

182
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
Come on, let's go.

183
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,630
Come on.

184
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,920
[The Party is in My Heart; I Will Always Follow the Party]

185
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:35,919
Come in.

186
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,840
Deputy Chief Peng.

187
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,640
Xu.

188
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,350
Zhao Zhiyuan

189
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,320
has already gone to

190
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,010
turn himself in to the Discipline Inspection Commission.

191
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,720
He's suspected of dereliction of duty.

192
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,910
This matter

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,610
is being taken very seriously by the organization.

194
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,910
All relevant information

195
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,150

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,760
Okay.
Thank you.

386
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,720
With that chicken,

387
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
cook it together in a soup.

388
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,920
Okay.

389
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,960
Alright.

390
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,440
Thank you.

391
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,000
Take care.

392
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,720
Thank you.

393
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,480
Come again next time.

394
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,070
Alright.

395
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,590
Dad.

396
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,350
Alright.

397
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,240
Alright, let's go.

398
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,830
It's been taken care of.

399
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,640
How much?

400
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,480
Paid in full, let's go.

401
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,530
I've already paid.

402
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,500
Alright, let's go.

403
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,920
Take care.

404
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,540
Okay.

405
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,460
What's going on?

406
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,000
It's about the fire at He Lin's house?

407
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,320
Serves him right.

408
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,640
He brought it upon himself.

409
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,190
He disrupted the blessing ceremony.

410
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,340
It's a sin.

411
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,710
Let me tell you.

412
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,920
Among all people

413
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
in this Liu Village,

414
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,920
only He Lin

415
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,020
doesn't have an ounce of reverence

416
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,620
towards the Fire Goddess,

417
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200
You see, the Fire Goddess

418
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,510
has bestowed upon us the holy fire,

419
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,390
blessing our Liu Village.

420
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
Shouldn't we have some

421
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,680
gratitude?

422
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,640
Shouldn't we organize some

423
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,130
blessings, celebrations, and such

424
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,240
to show our loyalty?

425
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,630
Since our village

426
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,930
received this holy fire,

427
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,660
we've had quite a few tourists.

428
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,490
Some villagers have opened guesthouses,

429
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,730
some sell handmade crafts,

430
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,720
and souvenirs,

431
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,440
as well as our local

432
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,450
specialties.

433
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,200
But this He Lin doesn't fit in,

434
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,930
he goes against the villagers.

435
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,560
That's right.

436
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
He treasures those few cows of his,

437
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,010
saying that the tourists

438
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,750
disturb his cows' rest.

439
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,800
Early in the morning, he carries a speaker

440
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,070
and plays music for the cows.

441
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,370
The most infuriating thing is

442
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,240
in the middle of the night,

443
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,730
he throws firecrackers at the guesthouses

444
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,810
to drive away tourists.

445
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,070
Isn't that infuriating?

446
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,300
Is that something a decent person would do?

447
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,720
Control your emotions.

448
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:47,880
In our village,

449
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,240
who doesn't have a bad relationship with He Lin?

450
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,070
Who has a bad relationship with him?

451
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,480
Who could have a good relationship with him?

452
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,360
He affects everyone's ability to make money.

453
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,430
How can everyone

454
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,630
have a good relationship with him?

455
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,270
He's talking about me with his teeth bared.

456
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,920
He said

457
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,270
it was feudal superstition,

458
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,490
playing tricks with ghosts and spirits.

459
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,160
This...

460
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,790
Has anyone in this village

461
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,720
gone missing?

462
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,440
You suspect those bones

463
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,740
belong to someone who died in our village?

464
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,400
Yes.

465
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,160
Impossible.

466
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,960
-No! No!
-No way.

467
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,610
This morning,

468
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,330
by the time we arrived,

469
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,370
everyone in the village was here.

470
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,550
Everyone who could come did.

471
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,750
Are there any surveillance cameras in the village?

472
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,750
Yes, there are.

473
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,810
Quite a few, actually.

474
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,840
They were installed at the request

475
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,020
of our superiors.

476
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,190
Go and copy the surveillance footage.

477
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,560
I'll go find the owner of the cattle shed.

478
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,510
Alright.

479
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,240
Officer,

480
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,200
come, this way.

481
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,070
Over there.

482
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,660
He's the owner of the cattle shed.

483
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,790
You're He Lin?

484
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,960
What's your connection to the bones?

485
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,030
How would I know

486
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,160
what they have to do with me?

487
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,000
If they have nothing to do with you,

488
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,960
why are they in your cattle shed?

489
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,880
Officer,

490
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,480
my cattle shed was perfectly fine.

491
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't know who

492
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,360
burned it down like this.

493
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,010
And those human bones,

494
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,490
how terrifying!

495
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,160
You must investigate thoroughly.

496
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,450
Who exactly set the fire?

497
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,070
Who threw the bones

498
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,310
into our cattle pen?

499
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,160
Are you suggesting

500
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,200
someone deliberately set the fire,

501
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,980
killed someone,

502
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,200
and dumped the body at your place?

503
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,070
Do you have any suspects in mind?

504
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,660
Some people

505
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,790
can't stand that I raise cattle.

506
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,520
Those rotten, malicious bastards

507
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,100
did something bad and for convenience

508
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,300
threw it next door.

509
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,400
-He Lin.
-What kind of person is that?

510
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,270
What are you saying?

511
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,490
Am I talking about you?

512
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,420
Control your emotions.

513
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,750
He Lin,

514
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,260
you don't need to beat around the bush.

515
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,440
Just say it clearly.

516
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,920
Even if I say it clearly, it's still you.

517
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,440
You definitely burned

518
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,070
our cattle shed.

519
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,070
What evidence do you have to prove

520
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,430
that I burned your cattle shed?

521
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,200
Officer,

522
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,200
he's making false accusations.

523
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,550
This person never tells the truth.

524
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,020
You can ask around in the village.

525
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,290
He has conflicts with so many people.

526
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,130
He Lin,

527
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,520
just for throwing firecrackers

528
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,770
into our yard late at night,

529
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,610
and playing music early in the morning

530
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
to keep me from sleeping,

531
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,350
I knew

532
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,700
you'd get your comeuppance sooner or later.

533
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,690
Sure enough,

534
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,430
you deserve it.

535
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,710
What are you doing?

536
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,840
What are you doing?

537
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,680
The police are investigating.

538
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,880
What's your name?

539
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,920
Liu Bo.

540
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,030
So you're neighbors?

541
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,400
I must have done something terrible in my past life

542
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,340
to have such bad luck

543
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,900
being his neighbor.

544
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:07,790
It's irritating.

545
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,020
You think I enjoy being your neighbor?

546
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,800
Do you two have a conflict?

547
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,920
No conflict.

548
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,200
Don't even know him.

549
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,030
Karma.

550
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,450
This is karma.

551
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,310
The Fire Goddess has shown her power.

552
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,510
Tongsheng.

553
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,670
What's the situation on your end?

554
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,480
We didn't find

555
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,760
ignition source or combustion improver at the scene.

556
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,880
The place where the fire started

557
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,230
was where weeds were stored.

558
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,430
It's easy for a fire to start there.

559
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,860
We can't confirm the specifics yet.

560
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,110
Jiang Li found

561
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,590
some white powder at the scene.

562
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,650
We'll need to run tests

563
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,000
to determine its composition.

564
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:39,850
The remains on my end

565
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,060
are severely charred.

566
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,090
Initial assessment suggests

567
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,660
the victim wasn't burned alive.

568
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,150
It seems the body was dumped after death.

569
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,360
Based on how

570
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,600
scattered the bones are,

571
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,280
it's likely the body was dismembered.

572
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,330
Dismembered?

573
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,070
But the source and identity of the remains

574
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,730
haven't been confirmed yet.

575
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,480
However, He Lin has conflicts

576
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,630
with most people in the village.

577
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,140
Especially with that Liu Bo.

578
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,510
They're neighbors,

579
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,770
and their conflict is the most obvious.

580
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,890
Let's split up.

581
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,850
Even though Captain Shen isn't here,

582
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,920
our team is still functioning.

583
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,070

584
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,190

Let's go.

He added egg whites.

588
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,100
I thought so.

589
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,840
This looks really delicious.

590
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,130
That's easy to do.

591
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,060
I'll make some barbecue for you when I have time.

592
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,020
I know how to.

Hello, Chief Wu. Please go ahead.

598
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,190
It's like this.

599
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,480
There's a last-minute arrangement from above.

600
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,720
You need to go to the Party School for training.

601
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,560
The class is this afternoon.

602
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,970
Such short notice?

603
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,050
Yes.

604
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,660
Alright, I understand.

605
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
The team has arranged

606
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,130
for me to go to the Party School for training.

607
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,510
Now?

608
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,790
Didn't you already ask for leave?

609
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,450
It's a last-minute arrangement, isn't it?

610
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,980
Alright then.

611
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,020
Well, you have to go for the training.

612
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,770
Go ahead.

613
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,930
I'll be going then.

614
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,350
Go and come back soon.

615
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,350
Dad,

616
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,860
don't wait for me for dinner.

617
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,930
You're not coming back for dinner?

618
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,940
No.

619
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,650
Let's talk this through calmly.

620
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,240
Take it easy.

621
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,850
This guy is quite tight-lipped.

622
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,790
He just won't confess

623
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,670
where he hid the cattle.

624
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,390
Right.

625
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,460
In my opinion,

626
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,310
if he continues to disrupt

627
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,550
our blessing ceremony,

628
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,370
we should expel him from Liu Village.

629
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,250
Yes, expel him from Liu Village.

630
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,960
Are you all crazy?

631
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,020
Expel him from Liu Village.

632
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,520
Drive him out.

633
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,900

The ghost fire is coming.

Ghost fire.

Let's head back together.

646
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,790
What's going on?

647
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,010
You seem distracted.

648
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,530
After studying all afternoon,

649
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,510
how much have you absorbed?

650
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,610
In your class,

651
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,000
how could I dare to be distracted?

652
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,350
Of course, I've absorbed

653
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,160
as much as you've taught.

654
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,540
You're just smooth-talking.

655
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,400
Let me tell you,

656
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,160
it's rare to have

657
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,490
the opportunity to sit in a classroom.

658
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,640
Take it seriously

659
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,050
and improve yourself.

660
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,740
Don't worry, Mentor.

661
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,980
Don't embarrass your mentor.

662
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,370
To be honest with you,

663
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,170
among this group of young cadres,

664
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,250
I have high hopes for you.

665
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,080
Back then, I wanted to join the criminal investigation department,

666
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
but my dad wouldn't agree no matter what.

667
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,310
If it weren't for you, Mentor,

668
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,440
saying that I had the potential,

669
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,810
my dad still wouldn't agree even now.

670
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,290
I'm quite curious too.

671
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,770
You only met my father once.

672
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,930
How did he agree

673
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,550
for me to become a police officer?

674
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,570
You insisted on doing it yourself.

675
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Who could stop you?

676
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,580
Without you, Mentor,

677
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,550
I wouldn't be where I am today.

678
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,480
Tell me, are you

679
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,440
satisfied with being

680
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,180
a deputy captain?

681
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,340
No.

682
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,120
You are my role model.

683
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,440
I hope

684
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,990
to become someone like you.

685
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,100
What's the point of being like me?

686
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,160
In two more years,

687
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,200
I'll be stepping back from the front lines.

688
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,640
You're different.

689
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,020
Your potential

690
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,070
hasn't been fully realized yet.

691
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,680
Fully realize it?

692
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,270
My dad probably couldn't handle that.

693
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,920
Why?

694
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,160
Maybe he's afraid I'll die in the line of duty.

695
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,150
You're a police officer and you're still afraid of danger?

696
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,240
Actually, the greatest danger

697
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,680
isn't sacrificing oneself.

698
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,270
Then what is it?

699
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,310
Didn't you just say in class,

700
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,310
"Initial aspirations are easily lost.

701
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,920
Review the old to learn the new."

702
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:48,680
Without our initial aspirations,

703
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,160
we lose our principles.

704
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,500
The prerequisite for protecting the people

705
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,730
is to safeguard our own beliefs.

706
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,160
Belief is crucial.

707
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,400
You seemed distracted this afternoon.

708
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,160
I didn't expect you to actually take it in.

709
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,080
Are you showing off to me?

710
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,850
No.

711
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,190
I just had a lot of thoughts.

712
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,140
I feel that what you said

713
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,040
was particularly right.

714
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,690
I still have some things to do.

715
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,390
You go ahead.

716
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,160
Mentor, I'll wait for you.

717
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,070
No need.

718
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,260
You go on your way.

719
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,750
Sis,

720
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,170
burned to this degree,

721
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,130
I'm afraid this is probably

722
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:27,790
the limit of what human effort

723
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,750
can achieve in a body burning case.

724
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,400
Although it hasn't completely

725
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,900
turned to ashes,

726
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,030
there're only

727
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,330
these large pieces of bone left.

728
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,970
The flesh and organs

729
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,350
have basically all burned away.

730
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,750
This...

731
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,840
How are we supposed to investigate this?

732
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,290
I once heard

733
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,160
from an experienced employee

734
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,030
who had worked at a crematorium

735
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,880
for many years.

736
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,590
He said that people with terminal illnesses who take a lot of medication

737
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,920
or those who are obese,

738
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,360
when cremated,

739
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,350
produce a large amount of fat.

740
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,440
The blood seeps into the bones,

741
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,290
and after complete combustion,

742
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,440
there's a high probability

743
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,530
that their bones will appear red.

744
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,650
That's really true, Sis.

745
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,680
Look,

746
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,000
this piece of bone

747
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,880
that isn't as heavily charred,

748
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,960
its interior

749
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,740
is already faintly red.

750
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,500
I have a theory.

751
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,680
Later, take this piece of bone

752
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,480
and have it undergo

753
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,580
a metal cation test.

754
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,720
To estimate the time of death?

755
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:23,880
Alright.

756
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,230
Less than 90 degrees.

757
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,530
It's a male.

758
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,570
Okay, Sis.

759
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,920
I'll send it for testing now.

[East Village Entrance]

761
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,070
Chief Wu,

762
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,790
this surveillance camera

763
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,110
is the closest to the cattle shed.

764

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,160
As the body decomposes,

821
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,460
it produces phosphine.

822
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,110
Phosphine has an extremely low ignition point

823

that the phosphoric acid residue at the scene

953
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,040
Don't say I didn't warn you.

954
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,360
Believe in the Fire Goddess,

955
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,400
and you'll surely receive protection,

956
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,890
without a scratch.

957
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,630
What's the matter?

958
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,220
The guesthouse is closed?

959
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,660
No more shredded potatoes for sale?

960
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,710
All that hustle and bustle,

00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,830
the endless stream of customers,

962
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,310
and all those big bills,

963
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,270
you don't want them anymore?

964
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,080
Just letting it all flow away like spring water to the east?

965
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,150
Is that what you mean?

966
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,610
The white bones in He Lin's cattle shed,

967
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,550
that's a stark lesson,

968
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,650
that's the punishment for impulsiveness.

969
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:50,960

no one can know.

976
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,400
Not even I can.

977
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,150
Be more mindful.

978
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,150
Well.

What, what's going on, Officer?

980
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,590
You said in He Lin's cattle shed, there was a pile of white bones?

981
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,120
Yes, that's right.

982
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,710
How do you know it's a pile of white bones?

983
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,170
The fire was so intense.

984
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,190
We only knew after testing.

985

Well,

986
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,450
the Fire Goddess told me.

987
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,850
What Fire Goddess?

988
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,150
What retribution?

989
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,320
Lesson?

990
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,960
Those are all feudal superstitions.

As to what the specific situation is,

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,110
we still hope everyone

993
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,730
will cooperate with our investigation.

994

As for how you

knew

996
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,170

What are you doing?

1001

What are you messing with?

1002
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,840
You have no reverence at all.

Let's begin.

1006
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,880
How come she's being taken away?

1007
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,150
Isn't that a woman's embroidered shoe?

1008

Look.

1011
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,070
Just by looking at this soil,

1012
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,880
it's clear it's been recently dug up.

1013
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,800
Bai Zhi, we've found it.

1014
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,030
We've found it, Chun.

00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:43,510

Ghost Fire is actually phosphorus.

1021
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,050
When phosphorus reacts with water or alkali, it produces phosphine,

1022
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,180
a colorless gas that can spontaneously ignite.

1023
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,080
Phosphine has a low ignition point.

1024
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,570
When it burns,

1025
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,090
it produces a white flame with a bluish-green tint.

1026
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,160
The phosphine released into the air during the decomposition

1027
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,680
of human and animal corpses

1028
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,610
