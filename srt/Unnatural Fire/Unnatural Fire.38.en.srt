00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,840
He could be provoked very easily.

192
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,510
As long as someone mentioned our mother...

193
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,670
Who do you think you are?

194
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,130
He'd immediately go crazy.

195
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,060
Brother,

196
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,380
I saw everything you did today.

197
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,830
Given what you did,

198
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,340
you're gonna end up in juvenile prison.

199
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,280
They deserve to die.

200
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,190
Don't you want to go abroad?

201
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,520
I don't want to go abroad.

202
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,300
Even with a record,

203
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,820
it won't affect me.

204
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,320
How about this?

205
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,640
Later, you tell the police

206
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,550
that you are Han Pei.

207
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,200
Han Pei,

208
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,630
come here!

209
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,480
Did you hear that?

210
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,700
Dad made the same choice as I did.

211
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,560
Go now.

212
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,400
Oh, my foolish little brother.

213
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,340
He knew nothing.

214
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,900
He even thought

215
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,320
he owed me a huge favor.

216
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,960
What's your name?

217
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,020
Han Pei.

218
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,270
Come with us.

219
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,120
So the one in the detention center

220
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,050
was Han Jun.

221
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,280
The fingerprints were also his,

222
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,010
but the name was yours.

223
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,630
That's right.

224
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,910
Back then, you sent Jin Chun

225
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,230
to test me and see who I really am.

226
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,320
Honestly,

227
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,070
I found it

228
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
utterly ridiculous.

229
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,480
Back in school, the one rehearsing

230
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,030
and hosting on stage

231
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,240
was me.

232
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,210
And that

233
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,910
time capsule thing—

234
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,060
I knew all about it.

235
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,200
Later, Han Jun came back.

236
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,140
My father sent him abroad

237
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,820
to study law

238
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,270
at a prestigious school.

239
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,440
I thought that was the end of it,

240
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,410
but I didn't expect

241
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,910
my father was still the same.

242
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,310
The person

243
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,500
he cared about

244
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,120
was still Han Jun.

245
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,600
At that time, I thought

246
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,910
maybe I should do something big

247
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,200
to prove myself.

248
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,000
Coincidentally,

249
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,240
the fire department came to look for trouble.

250
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,670
I thought it was a perfect chance.

251
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,280
Last time,

252
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,690
the food processing factory

253
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,580
was shut down because of Xu Qingsong.

254
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,030
He pushed for a fire safety inspection,

255
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,080
and we haven't been able

256
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,850
to resume work since.

257
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,270
And now he's here again,

258
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
getting in my way.

259
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,350
If he keeps digging,

260
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,400
we'll really be in trouble.

261
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,870
He just wanted

262
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,600
a capable son.

263
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,000
I helped him solve

264
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,740
such a big problem.

265
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,500
I thought

266
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,440
he would come to his senses.

267
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,700
I killed someone for him,

268
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,030
but he cowered.

269
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,530
About our business in the basement,

270
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,620
I've decided to quit.

271
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,080
Mr. Han,

272
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,030
my technology is now mature.

273
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,240
We can scale up production anytime.

274
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,790
Why don't you reconsider?

275
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,010
If we stop now...

276
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,840
After all,

277
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,720
we've invested so much already.

278
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,080
Enough.

279
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,990
Stop talking.

280
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,270
Don't try to persuade me.

281
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,960
This is too dangerous.

282
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,490
I've made up my mind.

283
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,760
I'm old.

284
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,960
I just want to wait peacefully for Jun to come back

285
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,210
and hand the factory over to him.

286
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,600
I lived with frustration

287
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,790
for over a decade.

288
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,950
Until about a year and a half ago,

289
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,280
Shen Yi came to me.

290
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,490
He said this business was far more profitable,

291
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,480
and that factory

292
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,420
couldn't make much money.

293
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,510
That's right.

294
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,340
Even an idiot could see that.

295
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,650
So I decided

296
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,440
to get it done.

297
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,480
Do you have any idea

298
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,800
how risky this is?

299
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
But if you want to make money,

300
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,590
of course there will be risks.

301
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,390
You want to make more money,

302
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,100
so the risks will be

303
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,160
bigger, right?

304
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,770
I don't want to take such big risks anymore.

305
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,980
I already learned a lesson 18 years ago.

306
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,050
It must be even more difficult now.

307
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,960
We will find

308
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,400
an opportunity to make big money.

309
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,200
Your brother is doing well now.

310
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,660
When your brother

311
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,410
comes back and takes over the factory,

312
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,170
we can make big money

313
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,550
in a down-to-earth way.

314
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,630
Dad,

315
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,829
you always think about

316
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,599
giving the factory to him,

317
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,230
but you should at least ask him

318
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,680
if he wants it.

319
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,640
Shut up!

320
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,270
I'm telling you,

321
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,190
they're cracking down harder on drugs.

322
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,940
A batch of goods has already been seized.

323
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,970
Those people have been arrested.

324
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,310
I've made

325
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,450
my decision!

326
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,860
Don't think I don't know what

327
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,830
you two have been doing

328
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,370
behind my back all these years.

329
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,440
I'm warning you both.

330
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,590
If I ever catch you

331
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,590
involved in drugs again,

332
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,580
I'll make sure

333
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,710
you both pay dearly for it.

334
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,170
Han Jun can do it,

335
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,230
but I can't!

336
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,880
You know what?

337
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,390
If Han Jun brought this up today,

338
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,000
that old man would have agreed

339
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,100
without a second thought.

340
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,470
I think...

341
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,840
he's old.

342
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,370
He's not as bold as he was.

343
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,350
That's right.

344
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,200
What else can he do?

345
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,480
If he only relies on those factories,

346
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,270
he can't even earn enough to retire.

347
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,500
Calm down.

348
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,480
Try again.

349
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,360
There might still be a chance.

350
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,910
A chance?

351
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,640
Do you think I can persuade him?

352
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,350
Pei.

353
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,100
Brother.

354
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,590
This is what I think.

355
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,050
After all, you're family.

356
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,380
Parents always give in

357
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,630
to their children's soft words, not hard ones.

358
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,890
Take

359
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,980
the medicine to your father.

360
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,210
Say something nice.

361
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,750
It might work.

362
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,200
I can only try.

363
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,450
Don't get your hopes up.

364
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,050
How did it go?

365
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,360
Listen,

366
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,550
that old man has gone crazy.

367
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,160
He jumped up and nearly hit me.

368
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,240
Well... how come I'm always

369
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,310
not good enough in his eyes?

370
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,660
Calm down.

371
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,410
Let's wait until he cools off.

372
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,820
Then we'll figure something out.

373
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,640
Oh, right.

374
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,690
Fan Yi is ready.

375
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,170
But he can't do it alone.

376
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,770
We need to find him a helper.

377
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:01,850
Do you have

378
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,110
anyone in mind?

379
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,360
What's that sound?

380
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,380
Dad!

381
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,860
Dad, what's wrong?

382
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,290
Get up!

383
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,530
What's wrong?

384
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,560
Feeling unwell?

385
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,480
Hang in there!

386
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:23,900
Pei.

387
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,560
Pei, wait!

388
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,140
What are you doing?

389
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,880
Wait!

390
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,600
Please, wait a moment before making the call!

391
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,320
Please,

392
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,300
let me finish.

393
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,480
If you don't

394
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,690
make this call now,

395
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,320
our plan

396
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,700
can be carried out smoothly, right?

397
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,300
If he...

398
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,860
he just...

399
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,380
just dies like this,

400
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,790
no one will

401
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,910
stop you, right?

402
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,090
No one will

403
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,480
compare you to Han Jun anymore.

404
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,260
Right?

405
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,900
Moreover,

406
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,640
you can also

407
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,980
easily earn the money

408
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,730
you haven't been able to earn in over ten years.

409
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,720
Think about it.

410
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,540
It's up to you.

411
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,970
It's up to you.

412
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,480
It's up to you.

413
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,250
So you watched Han Kun die?

414
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,550
He got more cowardly as he got older.

415
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,160
He only loved Han Jun.

416
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,720
But to be fair,

417
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,750
I didn't kill my father.

418
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,270
Shen Yi instigated me to do it.

419
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,230
The split?

420
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,190
He had been using it

421
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,960
to threaten me ever since.

422
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,090
Let's go with a 30-70 split then.

423
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,790
You take 30%. I take 70%.

424
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,880
It's settled.

425
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,380
Well, Pei.

426
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,590
All the data and technology

427
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,160
were organized and developed by me.

428
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,690
The split...

429
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,160
is not really fair, right?

430
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,720
What?

431
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,510
You're still not satisfied?

432
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,550
You're just a dog we keep.

433
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,350
I'm being generous enough by giving you 30%.

434
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,400
Even if I won't give you a penny,

435
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,340
what can you do?

436
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,550
Who are you yelling at here?

437
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,480
Calm down, Pei.

438
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,830
I'm just trying to discuss with you.

439
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,910
Take a look at this first.

440
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,680
Then we'll talk.

441
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,320
50-50.

442
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,340
We split it evenly.

443
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,790
I thought about it again.

444
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,960
Actually, the split you mentioned earlier

445
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,160
is quite good.

446
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,160
I take 70%.

447
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,240
You take 30%.

448
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,480
I thought after my father died,

449
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,480
I could take control of everything.

450
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,750
But who would have thought

451
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,030
Shen Yi would use

452
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,890
such a dirty trick?

453
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,110
Listen,

454
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,270
what happened at the Ducheng Processing Factory

455
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,200
was all Shen Yi's doing.

456
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,830
I protected him.

457
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,440
I did everything I could

458
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,750
to clean up his mess.

459
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,720
Wei Kang has been taken care of.

460
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,660
However, the fire department is still investigating.

461
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,680
Okay. I got it.

462
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,750
Wang Xi, that idiot,

463
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,480
wanted to kill me.

464
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,960
He just

465
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,510
gave me a great gift.

466
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,890
Why are you here?

467
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,160
We might not be able

468
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,380
to cover up Wei Kang's death anymore.

469
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,550
His wife, who's a journalist,

470
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,440
has been investigating us.

471
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,590
Then get rid of her too.

472
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,630
When it's done, I'll arrange for you to go abroad.

473
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,990
Keep your promise.

474
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,600
Jun.

475
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,150
Yes, it's me.

476
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,130
Dad's death anniversary is coming up.

477
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,800
Aren't you coming back?

478
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,270
I've been very busy lately.

479
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,970
If you come back,

480
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,270
you can see Mom too, right?

481
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,450
Okay.

482
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,360
I'll make some arrangements.

483
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,240
Okay.

484
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,250
Let me know when you've made the arrangements.

485
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,630
I'll book a ticket for you.

486
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,660
After all these years,

487
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,810
mentioning Mom still works like a charm.

488
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,060
But Mom was good to me.

489
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,880
She gave me

490
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,070
a twin brother.

491
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,160
Thanks to him,

492
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,650
I could have a chance to start over

493
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,080
when people like you

494
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,990
pushed me to the brink.

495
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,550
Still the same, right?

496
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,600
Actually, I can stay at a hotel.

497
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,810
Why stay at a hotel?

498
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,250
You're already home.

499
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,320
Besides,

500
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,550
Mom always hoped

501
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,090
we could get along well, right?

502
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,380
Right.

503
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,640
Then I had him stay at home

504
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,050
and leave his fingerprints.

505
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,350
I'll go tidy up then.

506
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,880
Okay.

507
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:40,990
Jun,

508
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,950
I want to ask you something.

509
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,110
If one day,

510
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,480
someone wants to harm me,

511
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,720
and I need you,

512
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,240
a great lawyer, to save me,

513
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,090
would you save me?

514
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,590
We're brothers.

515
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,500
I need to avoid a conflict of interest.

516
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,360
If he could say one good word

517
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,240
or show even the slightest bit

518
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,070
of treating me

519
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,740
as his brother,

520
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,630
I wouldn't have done that.

521
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,390
But you see,

522
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,720
he was such

523
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,340
a selfish person.

524
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,440
So why should I

525
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,980
show him any mercy?

526
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,200
Stop the car!

527
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,210
Are you crazy?

528
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,520
Don't do this! Don't be impulsive!

529
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,830
Get off!

530
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,260
Get lost!

531
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,510
That bitch.

532
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,050
Does she want to die?

533
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,520
Jun,

534
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,860
my eyes feel uncomfortable.

535
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,640
You drive.

536
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,360
Okay.

537
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,240
It was easier to switch our positions.

538
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,110
I stopped the car

539
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,400
where there were no cameras

540
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,590
in the tunnel.

541
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,520
He didn't suspect me.

542
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,240
He was just thinking about how to bring

543
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,520
our mother back.

544
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,150
So I sent him

545
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,030
to reunite with our mother.

546
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,930
Stop the car!

547
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,950
Han Pei.

548
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,770
Help me.

549
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,050
Han Pei.

550
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,590
Han Pei.

551
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,700
After you switched your identities,

552
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,340
didn't Shen Yi ever suspect you?

553
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,310
He did.

554
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,970
That cunning man,

555
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,990
how could he not be suspicious?

556
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:17,790
Mr. Han,

557
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,680
this gentleman wants to see you.

558
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,240
Okay.

559
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,350
Hello.

560
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,000
Can I help you?

561
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,550
Han Jun?

562
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,590
Yes.

563
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,020
Don't you remember me?

564
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,840
When you were little,

565
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,430
I went to your place often.

566
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,240
Now that you mention it,

567
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,620
you do look a bit familiar.

568
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,270
But I can't be sure.

569
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,890
May I know your name?

570
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,840
Well...

571
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,100
why was it so coincidental?

572
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,750
Your brother was just about to get arrested,

573
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,000

00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,670
It's beautiful, right?

765
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,310
It's stunning.

766
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,670
What are your plans for the future?

767
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,240
No matter in the past or the future,

768
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,190
I will always

769
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,450
stand against crime

770
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,020
to be this world's

771
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,060
most steadfast guardian.

772
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,080
What about you?

773
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,480
Like I said,

774
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,140
anything done

775
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,420
will always leave a trace.

776
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,320
From now on,

777
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,590
I will continue to search for the truth

778
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,230
on the path of fire investigation.

779
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,920
I hope...

780
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,800
I can heal everyone

781
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,670
I meet

782
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,650
to make this world

783
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,840
a better place,

784
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,480
a much better place.

785
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,880
You know what?

786
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,330
The three of us

787
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,160
are destined to be best friends.

788
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,270
Because...

789
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,660
fire tries to burn wild grass up in vain.

790
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,170
They rise again when spring winds blow.

791
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,340
Fire tries to burn wild grass up in vain!

792
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,840
They rise again when spring winds blow!

793
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,020
Fire tries to burn wild grass up in vain!

794
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:19,080
They rise again when spring winds blow!

795
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,380
Fire tries to burn wild grass up in vain!

796
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,450
They rise again when spring winds blow!
