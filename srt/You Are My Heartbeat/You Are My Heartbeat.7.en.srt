Khun Kheetika,

186
00:13:40,543 --> 00:13:44,640
why did you cancel Khun Kansinee's lingerie production design?

187
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,665
Do you know that the new lingerie launch of the New Look website for this season

188
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:50,400
is within a week?

189
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,320
Now, I haven't brought the sample to Khun Sasa for approval.

190
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,823
If it gets to the factory too late, we won't make it to the launch.

191
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,640
Sorry.

192
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,060
But I have to check if it meets standards.

193
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,620
I'll have to cancel production if it doesn't meet standards.

194
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,420
But we've checked it.

195
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,140
We need to move forward on every task, but you canceled the production.

196
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,220
You know what? All departments are out of action.

197
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,170
But I can't let it go on.

198
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,480
What's going on?

199
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,540
Khun Kheetika asked Khun Kansinee to modify her design.

200
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,920
So, I can't give you the sample for approval and send it to the factory.

201
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,939
Why did you ask her to modify it?

202
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,120
Because it doesn't meet standards.

203
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,740
Its shape, the lace, everything is wrong.

204
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,320
And the concept's materials are wrong.

205
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,640
But all the lingerie was made according to the design.

206
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,460
It has been checked. And it was approved at the meeting.

207
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,780
But I didn't attend that meeting.

208
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,800
It is my responsibility to check it. I don't approve it.

209
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,280
Are you doing this out of duty, not out of personal reasons?

210
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,710
Because you were caught plagiarizing my design.

Hello, Khun Lom.

322
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,740
Wow, it can talk.

323
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,060
You are not Khun Lom. Who are you?

324
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,180
I'm his employee.

325
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,860
If you're his employee, why aren't you at his company?

326
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,920
Because Khun Sira asked me to live here.

327
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,340
Live here?

328
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,780
A woman living with a man.

329
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,440
That means you're Khun Lom's girlfriend.

330
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,912
I'm not his girlfriend.

331
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:36,288
Then you could be his lover.

332
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:39,200
- I'm not his lover. How do I shut it off?
- Here.

333
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,420
Not a lover?

334
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,660
Then, you're his wife.

335
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,280
I'm not his wife.

336
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,420
How to shut it down?

337
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,980
What's wrong with you?

338
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,080
What's wrong with you?

339
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,940
You─

340
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,780
Did you knock on my body scanner?

341
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,860
I didn't knock it.

342
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,980
I was looking for the switch.

343
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,860
Because this scanner misunderstood me.

344
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,700
Because Pretty said you were my wife?

345
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,340
My scanner misunderstood you.

346
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,100
But you didn't have to be angry and mess it up.

347
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,100
I said I was trying to shut it down.

348
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,460
Okay. If you're going to send it for repair,

349
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,720
I'll pay for the repairs.

350
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,420
Are you sure?

351
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,460
Yes.

352
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,940
It was bought from abroad.

353
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,900
It's ฿5 million ($155,000).

354
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,340
Five million?

355
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,020
If I want to repair it,

356
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,900
I need to send it back to its production country.

357
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,420
- And there are other charges─
- No. I'll apologize.

358
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,080
I'm genuinely sorry. I can't make that much money.

359
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,940
I'm willing to do whatever you ask me to do.

360
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,340
Are you sure?

361
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,300
Hello, Khun Lom.

362
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,820
You want me to scan your body, right?

363
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,880
Let's do it.

364
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
Come on.

365
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:55,500
Today, your body is a little weird.

366
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,820
What's wrong?

367
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,020
Your body, heart, and temperature are in good condition.

368
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,340
It's like a happy body.

369
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,140
A happy body?

370
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:17,920
If you're living here,

371
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,680
you should keep everything clean.

372
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,060
I can't hear you.

373
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,820
I'm already loud. Can't you hear me?

374
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,940
You must wash your clothes every day.

375
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,060
And don't scatter your clothes about the house because they can grow bacteria.

376
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,600
I can't hear you. Louder.

377
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,020
Don't fart in front of me.

378
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,820
Can you hear me?

379
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,480
Your shoes must be placed neatly.

380
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,640
The shoes should be in the same direction, with a spacing of about five centimeters.

381
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,680
- What kind of rule is that?
- I can't hear you!

382
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:56,560
Use alcohol every time you turn the lights on and off.

383
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,620
- Arms.
- They are sore.

384
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,880
- Arms.
- They are sore.

385
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,260
Khun Lom, you laughed.

386
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,040
That means you're really happy.

387
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,380
I've signed them all, haven't I?

388
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,260
Yes.

389
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,660
Khun Sasa just asked about Khun Kheetika.

390
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,020
But Khun Kheetika hasn't arrived at the office yet.

391
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,080
I called her, but she didn't answer.

392
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,620
Did she tell you where she was going

393
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,940
when you went out in the morning?

394
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,660
She should be late today.

395
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,920
She did a lot of work last night. I think she's tired.

396
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,660
Work? Tired?

397
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,140
I wanted to say─

398
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,900
I want to tell you that you can trust me.

399
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,200
You can talk to me about everything,

400
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,940
especially about Khun Kheetika.

401
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,220
What are you talking about?

402
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,260
Because Rossarin told me that Khun Kheetika doesn't live with her.

403
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,400
I know from your words

404
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,440
that you seem to know what time Khun Kheetika goes to bed,

405
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,600
what time she gets up, and her reasons for being late.

406
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,686
You've mentioned it more than once.

407
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,000
Khun Kheetika lives with you, doesn't she?

408
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,800
See?

409
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,180
I know. Here you go!

410
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,900
Your heart is beating so fast.

411
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,020
It indicates that you have sensed

412
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,060
that someone in this room is lying.

413
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,940
That's definitely not me.

414
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,540
Khun Kheetika lives with you, doesn't she?

415
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,740
It's all because of you, Maha.

416
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,280
Because that night, you left drunk Kheetika to me.

417
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,360
I had to carry her home.

418
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,060
Since that night, my life has been different from before.

419
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,260
I've never had a good night's sleep. Do you know why?

420
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:42,620
Don't tell me last night that Khun Kheetika and you...

421
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,040
did that?

422
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,060
What are you talking about, Maha?

423
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,240
Kheetika found an excuse to live in my house.

424
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,040
I do my thing. She does her thing.

425
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,140
Don't think that I would do that with that crazy woman.

426
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,840
It's impossible.

427
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,880
Because Kheetika is the most sloppy woman I've ever seen.

428
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,380
Really?

429
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,200
Yes.

430
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,820
I've never seen a woman so sloppy before.

431
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,100
I'm not talking about sloppiness.

432
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,580
Do you really have no feelings for Khun Kheetika?

433
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,380
You live in the same house with such a beautiful woman.

434
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,360
She's beautiful from every angle. And she's in good shape.

435
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,820
If you have no feelings for such a beautiful woman,

436
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,326
I think there must be something wrong with you.

437
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:33,023
At first, I wasn't convinced.

438
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:36,340
But now I am.

439
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,700
You think you have feelings for Khun Kheetika, do you?

440
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,500
I think I need to find a new secretary.

441
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,360
Oh, actually, it's not weird at all that you have no feelings for Khun Kheetika.

442
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,200
I work with Rossarin every day,

443
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,560
and I don't have feelings for her, either.

444
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,820
It's normal, Khun Sira.

445
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,220
I'll take the documents and put them away.

446
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,740
Disinfect.

447
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,060
And I hope you won't tell anyone about this.

448
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,980
If anyone knows that Kheetika and I live together,

449
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:11,100
you know what's going to happen to your career, Maha.

450
00:32:17,826 --> 00:32:19,531
I got it.

451
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,860
I'm sorry for bothering you. I will go out.

452
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,320
Stop, Rossarin.

453
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,000
You don't have to go out.

454
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,820
Does everyone around me think I'm abnormal?

455
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,940
Just tell me what happened.

456
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,960
Well, something big happened.

457
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,580
What is it?

458
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,140
Something went wrong with the lingerie sold on the New Look website.

459
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,180
Okay.

460
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:57,960
- We'll get back to you later.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

461
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,260
Excuse me. Please say it again.

462
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,160
Do you speak English?

463
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,800
Who's that?

464
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,540
It's the head of customer service.

465
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,700
She speaks quickly. I can't follow her.

466
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,540
She kept saying, "breats down".

467
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,820
What? Breats down?

468
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,680
It's weird.

469
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,180
Hello. What?

470
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,940
Summarize what the customers complained about.

471
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,620
Complaints?

472
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,260
What?

473
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,340
The customer service center called and said

474
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,520
that the customers have come to the mall to make a scene.

475
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,420
What should we do?

476
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,400
Sorry.

477
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,640
Khun Sira, the complaints against GU have become a trending topic on Twitter.

478
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,400
#GULingerieDeformation.

479
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,120
Aren't you going to say something, Khun Kansinee?

480
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,560
It's your design.

481
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,440
Khun Sira.

482
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,740
The shareholders want an explanation of the issue of the New Look website.

483
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,380
They are asking for a meeting now.

484
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:31,240
Khun Phuwit, call Sasa and ask him to hold the shareholders' meeting on my behalf.

485
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,220
I called Khun Sasa, but he won't answer my call.

486
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,980
Your lingerie doesn't fit at all.

487
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,860
I thought GU's products were of good quality.

488
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,820
Miss, please calm down.

489
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,070
Your fabric doesn't stretch.

490
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,780
I bought the right size. Why doesn't it fit?

491
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,120
It's obvious that your products are not up to standard.

492
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,380
The edges are hard and scratch the skin. What materials do you use?

493
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,620
My skin is bruised. Do you want to see it?

494
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,920
- Wait. Calm down. Sorry.
- Do you want to see it?

495
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,760
You don't have to show us.

496
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,560
We've received your feedback, and we are working on it.

497
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,120
Please believe that our GU Group is willing to do anything to make our customers happy.

498
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,880
I don't believe you.

499
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,560
I don't want to talk to you. Go and get your boss now.

500
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,940
I want to return it.

501
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,020
Please calm down. Wait a moment.

502
00:35:25,453 --> 00:35:27,810
Khun Sira, they're all here to return the products.

503
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,600
What should we do?

504
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,620
He's your boss, right?

505
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,780
How can you deceive customers?

506
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,600
I apologize for what happened.

507
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,980
But we can't return your money for now.

508
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,620
We need to investigate it first.

509
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,060
We must determine whether or not it was our mistake that caused the product problem.

510
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,160
Are you saying that because you don't want to be responsible?

511
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,180
I didn't say that.

512
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,760
I want to say, please wait a moment and calm down.

513
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,660
If there is a problem with the product, we are willing to take full responsibility.

514
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,320
Then, take your product and check it out.

515
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,700
- Oh, calm down.
- Take it.

516
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,440
- Calm down.
- Don't shoot.

517
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,200
- Khun Sira, you'd better leave here.
- Calm down.

518
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,340
Please wait for the news. Calm down. Breath.

519
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,820
- We'll investigate it.
- Please calm down.

520
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,200
- Let go.
- Calm down.

521
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,900
I browsed the New Look website.

522
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
The customers didn't just return their lingerie.

523
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,600
They also returned other products.

524
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,000
Look at Khun Sira. Why did all these bad things happen to him?

525
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,720
Where was Khun Kheetika, Khun Sira's special assistant?

526
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,160
I don't know. I didn't see her show up.

527
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,840
She let Khun Sira face it alone having to wear lingerie tossed to his face.

528
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,540
Do you know what the point is? It was lingerie that had been worn.

529
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,980
I was sleeping. Did you have to scold me in my dream?

530
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,500
It's 12:00!

531
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,240
It's 12:00. 12-12:00.

532
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,100
Did you get in touch with Kheetika and Sasa?

533
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,580
No.

534
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,940
Khun Sira, the directors are all here.

535
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,380
They are waiting for you in the conference room.

536
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,480
Hello, everyone.

537
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,740
- She's beautiful.
- Take a picture.

538
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,360
Thank you.

539
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,100
If you want something to eat today, feel free to order.

540
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,940
To thank you for your support, Nong Thatha will pay for it.

541
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,260
Wow, she's beautiful and kind.

542
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,960
- Right.
- Thank you.

543
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,860
It's just a small thing compared to your support.

544
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:37,240
No matter where I go to shoot or what I do, you come to cheer me on.

545
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
If you want something to eat, feel free to order.

546
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,460
- Feel free to order.
 - Okay.
- Thank you.

547
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,380
Thank you.

548
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,900
[Next time you want my treat, ask me first.]

549
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,100
- Are you tired?
- No.

550
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,840
[It's a small amount of money, Babe.]

551
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,993
Take a picture.

552
00:38:57,993 --> 00:39:01,210
[It's not your money. That's easy for you to say.]

553
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,400
[I'm the one who gets tired every time.]

554
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,080
Thatha.

555
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,420
I didn't expect to see you again.

556
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,680
I thought I had the wrong guy.

557
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,640
When we were abroad, you said you didn't want to go back to Thailand.

558
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,040
Why did you change your mind?

559
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,700
Is there something that draws you back?

560
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,360
Long time no see. Have you become a spokesperson for a well-known brand?

561
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,420
Are you surprised?

562
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,960
I've just come back. But I'm popular.

563
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,220
But no matter how famous I am,

564
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,420
I still feel the same way about you.

565
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,620
Nothing has changed.

566
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,960
What else are you endorsing besides this product?

567
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,131
If you want to know how many products I'm endorsing,

568
00:40:43,131 --> 00:40:45,925
you should have dinner with me.

569
00:40:45,925 --> 00:40:51,240
So I will have time to tell you one by one.

570
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:58,340
I just came back to help my grandma with the company.

571
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,840
I don't think I have time to eat with you.

572
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:07,413
But we met.

573
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,260
I want to talk to you.

574
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,160
Oh my, it's one 1:00.

575
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,060
Mr. Wet Wipes─

576
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,100
Isn't this the lingerie sold on the website?

577
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,040
What happened?

578
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,440
The customers wanted to return the products.
[Returned products]

579
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,560
They said there was a problem with the products.

580
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,720
Hundreds of calls came in this morning.

581
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,080
My ears were about to explode. Every customer was complaining.

582
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,360
I warned you.

583
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,080
How about it?

584
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,720
- It's not my fault.
- If it's not your fault, whose fault is it?

585
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,680
You designed the lingerie, didn't you?

586
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,840
Maybe it's your stepfather's factory.

587
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,000
They didn't meet sewing standards.

588
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,120
What are you doing here? Why didn't you come to work?

589
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,960
Isn't that Khun Thatha?

590
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,180
- She looks better than on TV.
- Yes.

591
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

592
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,820
Khun Thatha will come here often in the future.

593
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,100
I don't think it will affect your work, right? Khun Kheetika.

594
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,400
Khun Kheetika.

595
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,900
Khun Sasa is talking to you.

596
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,220
What's the matter?

597
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,640
Khun Sasa,

598
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,660
there's a problem with the lingerie produced by KKPP's factory.

599
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,080
All the customers returned their lingerie.

600
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,660
When did this happen?

601
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,660
You are both here. Khun Sasa. Khun Kheetika.

602
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,160
Khun Sasa, please go to the conference room now.

603
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,260
Khun Sira is in a meeting with shareholders.

604
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,360
As for you, Khun Kheetika, please wait for Khun Sira in the office.

605
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,180
Khun Sira was angry that you weren't here.

606
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,360
Come on, Khun Sasa. Let's go.

607
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,680
Let's go.

608
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,880
Please. Go there now.

609
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,180
Excuse me.

610
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,980
Sasa.

611
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,660
Good luck.

612
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,640
Wait!

613
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,280
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to solve the problem.

614
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,740
What about me?

615
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,620
Go back first.

616
00:44:28,072 --> 00:44:31,372
Please.

617
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:38,492
Wait.

618
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,380
I'll have someone take you to the reception room.

619
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,420
I'll come to you when I'm done.

620
00:44:51,173 --> 00:44:53,356
Something big has happened to the company.

621
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:56,120
But you went out with a girl.

622
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,480
I advised you to be careful in everything you do.

623
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,200
Aren't you going to ask me what happened?

624
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,880
Maybe it's not what you think.

625
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,700
It's not what you think or what you see doesn't matter, Din?

626
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,600
But according to others, it's definitely not a good thing.

627
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,620
Something has happened to the company. But all you do is hang out with a girl, right?

628
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,580
Din, you're going to be a director.

629
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,720
Do something that matches your status.

630
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,980
What do you want me to do?

631
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,580
Do you want me to live the same life as you?

632
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,960
All you care about is work. You live like a robot.

633
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,760
Din! I have warned you with good intentions.

634
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,040
Don't worry about me.

635
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,060
There's nothing between me and Thatha.

636
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,780
We just happened to run into each other.

637
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:47,260
You know the chairwoman doesn't like you messing with these women.

638
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,360
I think you should stop pestering her.

639
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,420
All right.

640
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,100
Speaking of which, how was the meeting

641
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,065
about the problem with the lingerie on the website?

642
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,880
We need to get to the source of the problem.

643
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,580
Actually,

644
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,686
I am responsible for this.

645
00:46:16,686 --> 00:46:18,780
Although Kheetika ordered to stop the production,

646
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,380
I ordered the production.

647
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,980
I'll take the responsibility for it.

648
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,800
It's not just your fault.

649
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:35,740
Others are also to blame for this.

650
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,620
Why should I be blamed for the lingerie matter?

651
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,520
It's Khun Kansinee's fault.

652
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,680
Keep in mind that you're responsible for the Design Department.

653
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,320
You're responsible for the design problem.

654
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,280
But I'm not wrong about that.

655
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,400
I did my part.

656
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,300
I told everyone there was a problem with that lingerie, but nobody listened to me.

657
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,180
But you didn't tell me.

658
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,300
You're my special assistant.

659
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,860
You should report any problems at work to me,

660
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,460
not hide them from me like this.

661
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,560
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

662
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,820
Even the boss didn't care.

663
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,260
What do you want me to do?

664
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:16,400
Do you think you care enough?

665
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,300
You knew he made the wrong decision, but you let it go.

666
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,480
You didn't think about how to solve the problem.

667
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,340
How do you know I didn't try to solve it?

668
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,460
If you want to work here,

669
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,540
you should care more about your work.

670
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,020
You should separate business and personal matters.

671
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,820
You shouldn't just think about winning or losing and avoid responsibility.

672
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:44,200
Working here might not be a good fit for you if you have that attitude.

673
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,280
Okay.

674
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,640
I'll solve it.

675
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,860
Rossarin, how is it going?

676
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,720
Did Khun Sira scold Khun Kheetika?

677
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,120
He yelled at her in the office.

678
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,820
Poor Khun Kheetika.

679
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,820
It's not her fault, but she was scolded.

680
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,300
The person who did the wrong thing is sitting there leisurely.

681
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,860
She's irresponsible.

682
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,860
And she doesn't want to admit her mistake.

683
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,420
Who are you talking about?

684
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,680
I think she's talking about you.

685
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,140
Why did you say it out?

686
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,140
Because she asked.

687
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,920
Gosh, you foreigner.

688
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,260
Why are you looking at me like that?

689
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,860
Do you want me to help you pack?

690
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,500
One mistake shouldn't get you fired.

691
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,900
When you first came here, I thought you had a strong backer.

692
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,920
But now you lost him, right?

693

Khun Sira wants to see you.

697
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,800
Poor thing.

698
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,900
I'll intercede with Khun Sira for you.

699
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,080
I'll beg him not to terminate your employment.

700
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,440
It's not necessary.

701

Thatha, I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

702

I'll take you to your favorite Italian food.

703
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,060
Then, let's go shopping. Okay?

704
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:31,280
Kheetika, you're coming with us.

705

Isn't it just the two of us?

706
00:50:36,098 --> 00:50:38,980
You and your girlfriend enjoy.

707
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,860
I'm not hungry.

708
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,020
I'm not inviting you to dinner.

709

We're going shopping after dinner.

710
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,740
Since you're a designer,

711
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,940
I want you to go and pick clothes for Thatha.

712
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:54,820
He hired me to work, not take care of others.

That's your job.

714

Thatha is a valued guest of GU. And you are an employee of GU.

It's your responsibility to serve her.

Thatha and I met abroad.

717
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,700
Why are you telling me that?

718
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,400
Because my life was a mess at the time.

719
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,780
Someone left me.

720
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,540
Luckily, I met Thatha.

721
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,300
She made my life happy...

722
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,020
and made me forget something.

723
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,480
