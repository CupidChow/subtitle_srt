163
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,450
Jae (Auntie), every step of his dance is accurate.

164
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,350
He must have practiced hard in front of a mirror every day.

165
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,490
Or his dream is to become a dancer.

166
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,983
Do you like to draw?

167
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:42,983
Yes. Phi, can you draw?

168
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:44,858
Yes, I can.

169
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:48,390
I'm good at drawing. Do you want me to show you?

170
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,610
- Look.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

171
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,350
I want to be as good as you at drawing.

172
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,730
Do you want me to teach you?

173
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,730
Yes.

174
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,730
Okay.

175
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:09,196
Let's start from here.

176
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,910
- Draw the face first. Here are the clothes.
- That's beautiful.

177
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,150
Dress.

178
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,370
Dress.

179
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,065
Hey, look.

180
00:17:55,276 --> 00:17:59,170
Sorry, the brooch must have became crooked when I was dancing.

181
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,430
I will pay more attention to it.

182
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,300
Did you smoke in the mall?

183
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
I've never smoked in the mall.

184
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,000
Because it's against the rules.

185
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,280
[Heart Rate]

186
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,860
God.

187
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,745
Did you change the clothes you wore at home or after you came?

188
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,613
After I came.

189
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:32,820
What time did you arrive at the mall?

190
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,613
At 9:00.

191
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,311
What time did you change your clothes?

192
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:39,040
9:10.

193
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,500
Where did you change your clothes?

194
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,400
In the locker room of the warehouse.

195
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,620
Can anyone testify for you?

196
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,325
Yes.

197
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,400
I came to you not only because your brooch was crooked...

198
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,320
but because I smell smoke next to you.

199
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,000
You said you changed clothes in the locker room of the warehouse.

200
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,400
It means you smoked in the locker room of the warehouse.

201
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,380
Khun Sira, I'm sorry.

202
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,193
Okay.

203
00:19:20,353 --> 00:19:22,153
You're fired.

204
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:30,500
He's fired?

205
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,040
Jae, did you hear that? He's fired.

206
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,580
Fired.

207
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,060
Khun Sira, please give me another chance.

208
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,260
Sir, calm down.

209
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,380
Calm down.

210
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,660
I just had a baby.

211
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,260
If I lose my job, my family will be in trouble.

212
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,920
Calm down.

213
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,900
Do you know why we have a rule against smoking indoors?

214
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,700
Because in this building,

215
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,300
you're not the only one with a family.

216
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,080
People can die because of your secondhand smoke.

217
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,220
What if it causes a fire?

218
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,520
Then you're not the only one in trouble.

219
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,320
People can die because of your irresponsibility.

220
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,220
Just go.

221
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,580
Please have mercy on me.

222
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,460
- Stop.
- Please give me another chance.

223
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,120
Khun Sira, please give me another chance.

224
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,251
Calm down. Slow down.

225
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:31,318
I… gave you the opportunity to admit it.

226
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:34,086
But you lied to me.

227
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:36,640
I only lied once.

228
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,100
You said you only lied once.

229
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,940
But for me,

230
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,540
just one thought

231
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,600
can have unforeseen consequences.

232
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,100
Please don't be so cruel to me.

233
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,520
- Let go of him.
- Let go of him.

234
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,900
- Calm down.
- Please have mercy on me.

235
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,060
Just calm down.

236
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,420
Keep calm and think clearly.

237
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:03,125
Listen up.

238
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,680
It is the liar

239
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,453
who is cruel.

240
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,560
Please help me.

241
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,080
No, don't do this.

242
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,760
Get him off me. Hey, you.

243
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,350
Okay.

244
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,620
Just go. Come on.

245
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,180
Hold this for me.

246
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,720
The three of us must stick together.

247
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,820
Maybe one day, I will be fired for no reason.

248
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,020
Jae, you're exaggerating.

249
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,460
The vice chairman won't fire a person for no reason, Jae.

250
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,520
He didn't fire those employees who couldn't improve their performance.

251
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,980
There's only one thing he can't accept,

252
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,820
and that's lying.

253
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,200
Yes, Nong Pimthong is right.

254
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,040
The vice chairman hates lying the most.

255
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,920
He must have some kind of psychological shadow.

256
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,510
I let you run the company not because I like you or because you're capable.

257
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,700
If you're not a member of the Kukitcharoen Family,

258
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,100
who will give you face?

259
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,533
Don't be carried away by power.

260
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:58,120
Because you don't have any real power at all.

261
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,380
I understand.

262
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,337
Lying may seem trivial to others,

263
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:10,370
but for me, trivial matters can cause big problems.

264
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,600
I want to apologize for my daughter's behavior.

265
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,100
I'm sorry she messed up your notebook.

266
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,440
It's all right. Actually, she didn't mess it up.

267
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,760
Such small things will not affect life.

268
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,320
When you sense that someone is lying,

269
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,953
do you still have a racing heart?

270
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,140
Yes.

271
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,020
You have been seeing Dr. Zhao for years.

272
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,953
Are you showing no signs of healing?

273
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,140
Excuse me.

274
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,100
Our staff can't find Khun Din.

275
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,420
Have you seen this man?

276
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,020
No.

277
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,120
Are you sure you haven't seen the man in the picture?

278
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,920
Yes. I haven't seen him.

279
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,840
Thank you.

280
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,544
Sure.

281
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:50,480
Are you okay? Are you okay?

282
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,220
I'm sorry.

283
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,905
Khun Sasa.

284
00:25:18,047 --> 00:25:19,852
Khun Sasa.

285
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,280
Wait.

286
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,620
Why can't you catch him?

287
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,560
Khun Sasa.

288
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,440
Officer, please arrest me.

289
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,080
- You didn't do anything wrong. Why should I arrest you?
- Just arrest me.

290
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,020
Khun Sasa. Let's go back to Khun Premyuda.

291
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,360
No.

292
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,980
Madam, may I borrow your electric mosquito swatter?

293
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,140
Arrest me for this.

294
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,300
Khun Sasa, calm down.

295
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,080
Stop.

296
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,180
- If you don't stop, I'll arrest you.
- Khun Sasa, please stop.

297
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,920
No.

298
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,500
Let's go. Go. Please.

299
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,240
How stupid were you to tell him you were coming back today?

300
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,620
He didn't get on the airplane, though.

301
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:06,100
I'm sorry. I've already sent someone to track down Din's current exact location.

302
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,920
Send people? All you know is sending people to do things.

303
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,240
What are you doing?

304
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,080
Enjoying the fresh air in the building?

305
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,980
No, Ms. Chairwoman.

306
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:23,120
I think… you're too comfortable.

307
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,753
I've exhausted my years of fame and ability

308
00:27:29,753 --> 00:27:33,760
to invite senior leaders and business elites to today's event.

309
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,120
But you're going to screw up the opening event because of negligence.

310
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,600
Or are you not looking for Din purposely?

311
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,986
You don't want Din to compete with you at the event. Right? Do you?

312
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:51,480
No.

313
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,100
Don't let me find out you're jealous of my grandson.

314
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,140
I was able to adopt you,

315
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,120
so I'm also capable of kicking you out again.

316
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

317
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,660
- Do you need to see a doctor?
- Go away.

318
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,440
Are you all right?

319
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,980
Let's go see a doctor.

320
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,960
I'm fine.

321
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,640
But your hands are cold.

322
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,440
- I've told you...

Could you please call a girl for me?

Maybe she'll come to me when she knows that I was arrested.

you're my mother?

345

It's because I know that I am worried about you.

346

I tried to reach you, but you blocked me.

I followed you to America,

348
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,200
but you moved to other countries until I didn't know where you were.

I'm just doing what you did.

You like to run away, don't you?

Don't say that in front of your father's ashes.

Why? Are you afraid my dad will be sad?

353

It's too late, Mom.

354
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,380
Because what happened to him was more than sadness.

355

Hey, Kanghan, when will you understand me?

356

Never, I think.

357
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,120
You want me to understand that you dumped your husband and daughter for another man

358
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,820
just because he was rich?

359
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,720
You're right.

360
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,980
I'm a bad mom.

361
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,000
I tried to control myself and work with your dad.

- But your dad…
- Giving up easily

363
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,960
hurts as much as never fighting at all.

364
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,640
You didn't care about me, right?

365
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,380
Do you think it didn't hurt for me to do that?

366
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,960
I'm human, too. I also have my own ideas.

367

I did everything I could.

I had to choose a good future for you and me.

Can you leave me out of this?

370

I was able to graduate thanks to my dad's insurance money.

All you left me with...

Daughter, your dad and I are divorced.

If you choose me, then you should stay with me.

Now that you have chosen to leave my life,

He left here ten minutes before you came.

How did he get out?

477
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,320
Khun Sasa contacted his lawyer to bail him out.

00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,653
But he disappeared.

489
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:36,576
We'd better cancel the event now.

490
00:42:36,576 --> 00:42:41,000
Are you going to personally apologize to the guests?

491
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,800
Okay, I'll arrange it.

492
00:42:57,545 --> 00:42:59,300
How's it going, Maha?

493
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,720
Hey, I've told you many times.

494
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,060
If you would rather not call me by my full name, call me by my nickname.

495
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,780
Don't omit my name as Maha.

496
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,340
I'm not a monk. It doesn't sound right.
(Maha is usually the prefix of a monk's name)

497
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:13,840
Call me again. Jeff.

498
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,000
- Jeff.
- Yes, Jeff.

499
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,480
- It's your nickname?
- Yes.

500
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,460
It's a cute name.

501
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,600
- Right? That's what my mom said.
- What is the origin of this name?

502
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,700
It doesn't have any special meaning. It's just Jeff.

503
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,540
Do you think I really want to know?

504
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:26,333
Seriously, do you think I really want to know?

505
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,600
Did the chairwoman see Khun Din? Answer me.

506
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,060
If the chairwoman had seen him,

507
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,520
she wouldn't have called to scold Khun Sira.

508
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:41,720
Did my boss go from a child no one loved to a doormat?

509
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,853
Of course.

510
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,580
I feel sorry for Khun Sira.

511
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,680
I understand that he's not her own grandson.

512
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,900
But Khun Sira does everything the chairwoman tells him to do.

513
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,780
Honestly, if the chairwoman doesn't love him,

514
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,418
she should at least be kind to him.

515
00:44:02,418 --> 00:44:05,020
The chairwoman is kind to Khun Sira.

516
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,820
It's just that she thought she would see Khun Din today.

517
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,040
But she didn't see him.

I'm Owen.

552
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:28,040
I'm here to deliver the jewelry Aa (Aunt) Parin ordered.

553
00:48:28,765 --> 00:48:30,124
Nice to meet you.

554
00:48:30,124 --> 00:48:31,911
Please examine it.

555
00:48:31,911 --> 00:48:33,936
See if you like it.

556
00:48:33,936 --> 00:48:38,391
It's okay. I'll bring it to my mom and let her examine it for herself.

557
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:42,898
But Khun Aa Parin selected this set of jewelry specially for you.

For me?

00:48:46,779 --> 00:48:48,255
Yes.

560
00:48:48,255 --> 00:48:52,700
At first, Khun Aa Parin wanted me to send you pictures.

561
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,713
But I think jewelry is like people.

562
00:48:56,713 --> 00:48:58,980
You can't just look at pictures.

563
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,180
Besides, there are so many editing programs for photos now.

564
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,680
They can make defective products look like genuine ones.

565
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,220
That's why I came here.

566
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,023
Look at it.

567
00:49:10,023 --> 00:49:12,051

00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,220
Sure.

570
00:49:28,452 --> 00:49:30,500
Do you like it?

571
00:49:32,113 --> 00:49:33,825
It's okay.

572
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:36,980
Just okay?

573
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:41,380
My mom said it was a 1-carat diamond.

Are you a jewelry store owner's son?

Thank you anyway.

00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,220
Reject what?

580
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,380
Reject me.

581
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:11,280
Your real goal is to see my brother, right?

582
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,840
What brother?

583
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,220
My brother is responsible for the jewelry business.

584
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,520
You can only get a little benefit from coming to see me.

585
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,060
You and your mom are smart.

586
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,940
What are you talking about?

587
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,600
I'm here to get my mom's stuff,

588
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,540
not to see you or your brother.

589
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,180
Your mother said you were here to see the jewelry,

590
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,740
but it's actually a blind date.

591
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:36,980
Do you think others can't tell that your mother is going to sell her daughter?

592
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,991
I apologize for being so direct.

593
00:50:43,991 --> 00:50:47,440
Anyway, you're pretty.

594
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,100

You came back from studying overseas.

596
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,160
But there's a small downside:

597
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,120
Your mom invested very little in jewelry,

598
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,786
but she coveted our family's property.

599
00:51:00,786 --> 00:51:04,820
I think she invested too little.

600
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,113
I don't know what my mom talked to you about.

601
00:51:20,113 --> 00:51:24,180
But I'm telling you that I don't know anything about this.

602
00:51:26,873 --> 00:51:28,420
Let go.

603
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,400

Are you out of your mind?

607

I wouldn't have seen it.

00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,420
Please pardon me.

650
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,380
Please, Hia (older brother).

651
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,720
You're not my dad's daughter.

652
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,060
But your dad said I was his daughter.

653
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,040
And he asked me to live in this house.

654
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,120
I have cardiomegaly.

655
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,740
The doctor said you had symptoms before but you didn't want treatment.

656
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,505
Because I don't know what to do if I'm cured.

657
00:55:16,505 --> 00:55:18,465
You can spend your money.

658
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:22,778
The money you dumped me and my dad for.

659
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,980
[Behind the scenes]
If something happens to me, there won't be a doctor to see her.

660
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,020
- Right?
- Yes.

661
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,820
Yes.

662
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,940
Khun Sira.

663
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,180
Tell me when you start.

664
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,655
Post it on YouTube.

665
00:55:45,655 --> 00:55:47,220
Please...

666
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,940
Cut.

667
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:09,520
OST: Jackie Jackrin - "Let's End This"

668
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:16,100
♫ I never loved anyone before ♫

669
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:23,960
♫ Until I met you, the one my heart was looking for ♫

670
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:31,340
♫ But Heaven must have made us meet, even though it was just a dream ♫

671
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:38,520
♫ After waking up, it all disappeared ♫

672
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,900
♫ If this love has to hurt ♫

673
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,360
♫ I will keep it all to myself ♫

674
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:52,660
♫ Since you deserve to be with that someone who is perfect for you ♫

675
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:56,500
♫ Let it be me who suffers ♫

676
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,860
♫ And be the one who ends this love ♫

677
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,940
♫ But it's all worth it ♫

678
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:12,300
♫ Because I have finally learned what it's like to love ♫
