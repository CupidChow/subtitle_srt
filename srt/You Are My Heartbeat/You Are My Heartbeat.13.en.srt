The wind blew dust into my eyes. That's why I'm crying.

82
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,500
Tears wash the dust out of your eyes.

83
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,520
They can also wash away the feelings of being hurt by someone you love.

You have a crush on Maha, right?

I'm sorry to be so blunt.

86

If you really love Maha,

87
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,780
I think you should tell him.

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
Forget it.

89
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,000
If he doesn't like me, he'll just make fun of me.

90
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,603
If he doesn't make fun of you after he knows it,

91
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:53,346
he might love you.

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,440
Will you regret it if you don't do it?

93
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,320
I think people's feelings can change.

94
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,780
Just because he has no feelings for you

95
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,560
doesn't mean you have to give up.

96
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,860
As long as he doesn't have a girlfriend,

97
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,340
you still have a chance to make him fall in love with you.

98
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,138
Whether you want to confess your feelings to him or not,

99
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,700
it depends on you.

100
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,020
But I want to ask you something.

101
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,520
Don't do anything that goes against your heart.

102
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,800
I'm not.

103
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,580
You asked Kirin out.

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,620
He doesn't feel that way about me.

105
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,700
We're friends.

106
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,052
But people's feelings can change, Khun Ross.

107
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:57,400
Maybe he doesn't love you right now,

108
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
but what if he falls in love with you later?

109
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,380
Khun Kirin is your friend.

110
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,840
If he knows that you're messing with him,

111
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,860
how sad would he be?

112
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,790
It's very painful

113
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,070
to be cheated and betrayed...

114
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,920
by someone you trust.

115
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,840
When you are unhappy and don't want to say anything,

116
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,180
vent it out by painting.

117
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,600
It will put you in a better mood.

118

Doctor.

119
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,380
If someone made you fall in love with her,

120
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,000
but you found out that she lied to you, what would you do?

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,680
In that case, I would be very upset.

122
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,620
I would cut her off.

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,720
Why did you ask me that?

124
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,760
Who are you tricking to fall in love with you?

125

You don't answer me.

Let me put it another way.

127
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,420
You said you were tricking someone to fall in love with you.

128
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,040
Do you mean you're tricking her to fall in love with you,

129
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,240
or are you tricking yourself?

130
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,740
You thought you didn't love her, but you're dating her.

131

You can't answer.

132

Doctor.

135

How did you know it was Kheetika?

136
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,560
Your recent questions are all about Khun Kheetika.

Why are you tricking her?

138

Why don't you admit how you feel?

139
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,020
Is it that difficult?

140
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,960
If it were that simple, would I still come to you for advice?

141
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,860
Are you blaming me?

142
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,140
Yes.

143
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,640
Hey, I remembered a word.

144
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,720
It's often said that where there is love, there is pain.

145
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,520
See, I'm in pain.

146
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,800
I really don't understand.

147
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,520
Just paint. Just vent it out.

148

150

I'm still full.

151
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,840
I must make it clear today. What is going on with him?

152
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,973
Is he suffering from manic depression?

153
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,860
It's 11:00 p.m., but he hasn't come home yet.

Dr. Zhao.

157

You can't solve the problem by hiding like this, Khun Sira.

00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,680
How long are you going to hide?

160
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,360
Khun Sira.

161
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,260
What are you doing here?

162
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,120
You came to Dr. Zhao's house. Are you sick?

163
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,560
I am not sick. I'm all right.

164
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,600
You're staying with the doctor, and you don't want to go home.

165
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
You call it normal?

166
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,260
What's the matter with you these days? It looks like you're avoiding me.

167
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,040
Are you angry with me?

168
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,840
You can tell me.

169
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,720
I'm not angry at you.

170
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,060
I just want to be alone.

171
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,740
You don't have to take care of me this time around.

172
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,020
Am I bothering you?

173
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,740
No.

174
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,160
I just like to be alone and think alone.

175
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,340
You can go back. I think I'll spend the night at Dr. Zhao's.

176
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,040
Oh, you're going to spend the night here?

177
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,560
Yes.

178
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,960
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

179
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,240
- What?
- Don't turn around.

180
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,080
I have something to tell you.

181
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,580
But I don't dare say it to your face.

182
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,500
I used to like being alone.

183
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,320
I thought I was going to cause trouble for others.

184
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,500
But since you've come into my life,

185
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,850
I've learned that it's good...

186
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,560
to have company.

187
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
But you just said you wanted to be alone.

188
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,420
Now you're saying it's good to have me around.

189
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,760
What exactly do you want?

190
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,850
If one day...

191
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,820
I make you angry or sad,

192
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,580
will you leave me?

193
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,760
If you know it will make me angry,

194
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,960
why would you do it?

195
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,340
Hey, you.

196
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,980
I used to be alone, too.

197
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,500
But it's not because I liked it.

198
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,960
It's because no one needed me.

199
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,140
People kicked me out of their lives.

200
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,580
But one day, I met you,

201
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,000
a good friend.

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,340
If you make me angry one day,

203
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,130
I may...

204
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,920
not kick you out,

205
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,040
because I don't want to lose a good friend like you.

206
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,420
Are you serious?

207
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,240
If that day comes,

208
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,180
you won't be angry at me?

209
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,820
If you have a good reason,

210
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,380
maybe I won't be angry at you.

211
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,460
Pinky swear.

212
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,740
Khun Sira, there's a budget document for the promotion that needs your signature.

213
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,313
Give it to me.

214
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:09,960
Maha, help me get some documents from Rossarin.

215
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,240
I'll tell Khun Kheetika to get them.

216
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,820
Can't you go and get them for me?

217
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,720
What? You can't help me because you're Sasa's assistant now?

218
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,700
No.

219
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,140
Are you still angry at Khun Rossarin?

220
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,080
You have been fighting a lot lately.

221
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,060
I didn't do anything.

222
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,480
I don't understand why Khun Rossarin keeps getting angry in front of me.

223
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,160
I didn't do anything to her.

224
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,740
Lately, she has always said mean things in front of me.

225
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,440
She's not cute at all.

226
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,780
You're not cute, either.

227
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,300
The other day, you embarrassed Khun Rossarin.

228
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,760
I was kidding.

229
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,260
But Khun Rossarin didn't seem to find it funny.

230
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,140
I don't know what's wrong between you and Khun Rossarin.

231
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,760
But I know Khun Rossarin has always cared about you.

232
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,120
No matter when you have a problem or when you are sad,

233
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,860
she has always been there for you.

234
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,000
She has never abandoned you.

235
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,560
I don't want you to lose a close friend like Khun Rossarin.

236
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,700
For GU's 30th anniversary, I created a sales theme for the New Look website.

237
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,940
About clothing and accessories,

238
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,220
we will focus on simple colors and incorporate fashion elements from the 1990s

239
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,520
to cater to customers aged 30 to 40.

240
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,420
This is our largest customer group.

241
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,500
But the report I gave you

242
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,440
shows that our shopping mall and website customers are mainly 20 to 30 years old.

243
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,260
It's true that the spending power of customers aged 30 to 40 is stronger.

244
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,260
But they spend less on average than customers aged 20 to 30.

245
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,520
It's just a report.

246
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,140
Everything can change.

247
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,400
But I think we should believe the surveyed reports.

248
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,960
Because it's better than taking a risk of doing something without any information.

249
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,880
Besides the survey that was done, what else does your sales group have in mind?

250
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,400
Nothing else.

251
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,200
Khun Pa. Khun Kirin.

252
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,160
Do you have anything to say?

253
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,700
Khun Pa and I thought of another idea. We think...

254
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,060
But your plan isn't perfect.

255
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,677
So I don't want you to say it. It's a waste of time.

256
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:39,566
It's not a waste of time.

257
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,491
We still have a lot of time.

258
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:45,339
Maybe we'll have new ideas.

259
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,200
Go ahead.

260
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,000
Excuse me, Khun Kheetika.

261
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,960
You are not the head of the Design Department.

262
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,800
It's up to me whether I want them to talk or not.

263
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,480
Do I have the right to decide

264
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,760
as the grandson of the chairman of GU?

265
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,540
We still have half an hour.

266
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,820
Khun Palida and Khun Kirin, if you have any plans, please present them to us.

267
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,860
Is that okay?

268
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,360
Thank you.

269
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,960
We want to target customers aged 20 to 30.

270
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,580
So, about the clothes, we want...

271
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,080
Khun Kheetika.

272
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,260
Thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to talk about our plan.

273
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,750
That's right.

274
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,600
You worked hard.

275
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,540
It would be a shame if you couldn't talk about your plan.

276
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,940
I'm so happy.

277
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,260
Khun Kansinee doesn't like to listen to our proposals.

278
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,080
She rejects our ideas directly and focuses on her own ideas.

279
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,399
It's true.

280
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:53,220
I really want you to come back and be our supervisor.

281
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,160
Can you come back to us?

282
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,205
I don't think she can.

283
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,260
As long as I'm working here,

284
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,020
there can only be one head of the Design Department.

285
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,740
Then please do your part as a leader.

286
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,600
Because it's all about teamwork.

287
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,160
It's not about you.

288
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,660
How I work is my own business.

289
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,500
Those who can do it, endure it; those who can't, resign.

290
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,480
Do you think you can do whatever you want with the chairwoman backing you?

291
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,100
That's right.

292
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,900
You should also be careful.

293
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,870
Don't think because Khun Sasa and Khun Sira are backing you,

294
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,820
I can't deal with you.

295
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,760
We'll see whether you will kick me out

296
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,080
or I will kick the chairwoman's people

297
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,960
out for a second time.

298
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,990
Madam, I wish you

299
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,360
good health and a long life.

300
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,740
Amitabha.

301
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,420
Time flies.

302
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,860
It's been over 20 years.

303
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,060
Your grandchildren have all grown up, haven't they?

304
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,900
They can help with your company.

305
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,240
Yes, Master.

306
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,620
I'm also exhausted.

307
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,440
I want to hand over the company to them.

308
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,300
Your two deceased sons should be relieved

309
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,620
to see their sons managing the company.

310
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:04,550
I hope you will let go of the past

311
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,460
in your later years.

312
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:13,220
Don't let the sins of the dead be shackles on the living.

313
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,860
You won't be happy that way.

314
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,140
If you choose to be with that woman, don't come back home.

315
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,000
Madam.

316
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,000
You will leave with nothing.

317
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,560
You can't get a baht from me.

318
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,651
I'd like to know if you have nothing,

319
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:40,440
whether that greedy woman will still love you.

320
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,726
Mom, don't worry.

321
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:48,860
All I want is not your money.

322
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,060
I just want a free life.

323
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,260
I want to choose what I want.

324
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,900
I want to work hard to get what I like.

325
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,800
That's all I want.

326
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,200
It's your decision.

327
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,140
Burn everything and all the pictures.

328
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,500
I won't allow this unfilial son to stay in my house.

329
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,780
Tell everyone not to mention his name again.

330
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,400
Khun Kheetika, do you have anything to do after work today?

331
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,840
No. What's the matter?

332
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,940
I want to invite you to the back of the mall to eat Som Tum (papaya salad).

333
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,440
I want to thank you for that day.

334
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,640
It's all right, you don't have to invite me to dinner.

335
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,440
Who's buying dinner? Can I come with you?

336
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,740
All right. We're going to eat Som Tum.

337
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,380
Do you want to come with us?

338
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,720
Okay. I'm hungry.

339
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,200
Why don't I treat you?

340
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,600
Why do you want to treat me?

341
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
I want to apologize to you.

342
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,940
Khun Rossarin, I'm sorry for going too far with my words,

343
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,380
and for being mean to you lately.

344
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,560
Please don't be angry at me.

345
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Let's make it up.

346
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,040
I swear I won't say anything to make you sad again.

347
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,880
I swear.

348
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:26,940
Brother, do you think Grandma asked us to dinner today to complain to us?

349
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,840
You think too much, Din.

350
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:35,340
Maybe the chairwoman just wants to have dinner with us.

351
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,160
We've been busy lately.

352
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,270
We didn't spend time with her.

353
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,960
Don't you remember? Grandma used to call us to dinner

354
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,300
because she must have something to scold us about.

355
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,240
She scolded us for more than an hour at a time.

356
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,840
How about this, Brother? Let's tell Grandma we have a meeting, and we can't go there.

357
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,020
Din, how about this? I think you should find some time to spend with Grandma.

358
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,240
She only has the two of us.

359
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:09,460
And you're her only grandson.

360
00:24:11,152 --> 00:24:14,100
I'm not Grandma's only grandson.

361
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,880
You're Grandma's grandson, too.

362
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,485
Khun Sira. Din.

363
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:25,139
- What is it?
- Maha and Khun Rossarin have reconciled.

364
00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:29,400
- Really?
- Yes. Just now, Maha apologized to Rossarin.

365
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:33,360
Now they're going to the back of the mall to eat Som Tum.

366
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,400
But why did Maha suddenly apologize to Khun Rossarin?

367
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,060
- Did something happen that we don't know about?
- Maybe...

368
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,120
Maha figured it out himself.

369
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,360
Maha is smart. He realized that he was too mean to joke about Khun Rossarin

370
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,760
and that Khun Rossarin was his friend. Maybe he doesn't want to lose a friend.

371
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,860
Since Maha and Khun Rossarin have reconciled, it means I did it.

372
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,360
You should deliver on your promise.

373
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:13,773
Din, I think you could ask her out another day.

374
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,760
It's too late.

375
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,760
I've already sent a message to Grandma. I told her I couldn't have dinner with her today.

376
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,860
It's only you who's going.

377
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:26,780
- Din.
- Brother, don't be mad at me.

378
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,560
I live with Grandmother. I can eat with her any day.

379
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,820
But it's difficult to eat with Kanghan.

380
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,660
I won't miss this opportunity.

381
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,320
You had a deal. She will agree to eat with you.

382
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,480
Ask her out another day.

383
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,300
I want to do it today.

384
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,220
I'll have another chance another day, Brother.

385
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:52,040
Please accompany Grandma to dinner today. Okay?

386
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,240
Didn't you promise to help me pursue Kanghan?

387
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,251
Come on, the two of them are waiting for us.

388
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:06,240
Let's go.

389
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,440
I messaged Khun Rossarin that we weren't going.

390
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,080
Why not? I promised them.

391
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,260
I want them to be alone. So they can talk about themselves.

392
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,520
As for us, we'll go somewhere else to eat.

393
00:26:26,172 --> 00:26:32,360
If you're photographed eating alone and it's sent to the chairman, you will have a problem.

394
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,080
Go another time. I'll go with you.

395
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,980
The chairwoman doesn't look busy.

396
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,880
She always has time to pick on me.

397
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,980
Hey, you. Please respect the chairwoman when you talk.

398
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,960
Why should I respect her? Did she ever think about respecting me?

399
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,740
She always thinks I want to pester her grandson.

400
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:53,100
I wonder what the chairwoman would do

401
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,480
if I went to dinner alone with Din.

402
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:58,427
Let's go, Din.

403
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,980
Let's go.

404
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,326
No need to set the table.

405
00:27:13,326 --> 00:27:16,780
Are you going out to dinner with Khun Din and Khun Lom today?

406
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,160
No. Din is busy, he can't come to dinner with me.

407
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,060
Call Lom and tell him not to come.

408
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,060
Yes, Madam.

[Hyatt Regency]

410
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,400
Is it lonely to eat alone?

411
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,920
Wine.

412
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,900
Is it delicious?

413
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,000
Yes. Everything is delicious when I eat with you.

414
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,140
Is it delicious?

415
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,420
Everything is delicious when I eat with you.

416
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Is it lonely to eat alone?

417
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,600
Brother, I'm so very happy today.

418
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,800
Which one do you prefer,

419

going to the movies with your boyfriend or girlfriend?

420
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,420
How about going to the movies with my friend?

421
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,860
You ruined the romantic atmosphere.

422
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,660
Won't you give me a chance to pursue you again?

423
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,085
No.

424
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,940
Spend your time trying to pursue me with work.

425
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,680
Pursuing you is happier than working hard.

426
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,180
I feel sorry for the employees of GU when I hear you say that.

427
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,760
They have a bad vice chairman.

428

Don't waste your time. Nothing's going to happen between us.

429
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,420
Is it because of you or because of my grandma?

430
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,280
Both of them.

431
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,412
Don't worry. I'm no longer a kid.

432
00:30:38,412 --> 00:30:40,720
I'll persuade my grandma.

433
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,720
I'm ready to give up everything for you.

434
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,638
Do you want to break your grandmother's heart?

435
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,720
Seriously, if you have to choose between me and your grandmother,

436
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,680
will you be able to decide to choose one of us?

437
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,860
What if I could choose both you and my grandma?

438
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,600
Is that possible?

439
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,180
It must be possible, I'll make it happen.

440
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:11,240
I'll prove to you that someone like me won't run away and give in again.

441
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:21,100
I won't let go of you this time.

442
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,533
If you don't want someone to leave, it's not enough to just hold the other person yourself.

443
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:32,480
Both parties should hold each other.

444
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,480
So you'll hold on tight and never let go.

445
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,760
I'm sure I won't let it go easily.

00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,660
"Go to a movie with my girlfriend."

481
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,240
[What's going on? Hold a press conference. When will you make it public?]

482
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,060
You're happy, aren't you?

483
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:15,200
Girlfriend, right?

484
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,440
You're happy, aren't you?

485
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,100
You're happy, aren't you?

486
00:35:30,305 --> 00:35:33,520
- Yes.
- Sorry to bother you.

487
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:40,160
I left my phone here when I was cleaning my room this evening.

488
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,978
Where did you put it?

489
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:45,650
I think it was near the dishwasher.

490
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,785
I remembered calling my daughter, and I put it there.

491
00:35:49,785 --> 00:35:51,230
Okay, I'll look for it for you.

492
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,523
Okay, thank you.

493
00:36:18,273 --> 00:36:19,800
Here you are.

494
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,532
- Thank you, Khun Sira.
- It's okay.

495
00:36:22,532 --> 00:36:25,418
I'll take out the trash for you.

496
00:36:25,418 --> 00:36:27,209
Thank you.

497
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:42,099
Are you going to stay up all night?

498
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,200
Where's the other shoe?

499
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:26,011
No way.

500
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,020
Thank you. Stop here.

501
00:37:54,498 --> 00:37:56,519
- Nannam.
- Are you back from work just now?

502
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:59,000
Yes, I just got back.

503
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:17,538
I'm sorry. I didn't know, I thought you didn't want it.

504
00:38:17,543 --> 00:38:19,668
I only saw one.

505
00:38:19,668 --> 00:38:21,220
I'm sorry.

506
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,660
It's all right, Madam.

507
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,720
Where did you throw the garbage bag?

508
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,480
The garbage disposal room.

509
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,080
I'll take you there.

510
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:36,820
Khun Sira, this way.

511
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,560
Okay.

512
00:38:57,472 --> 00:38:59,640
I threw your garbage bag here.

513
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,400
But I don't remember which bag.

514

[Garbage disposal room]

515
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,120
Madam, would you mind asking others to help me find it?

516
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,500
I want to hire them to help me find the shoe.

517
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,000
I think they've all gone home.

518
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,920
I'll help you. But we should hurry.

519
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,120
The garbage truck will be collecting garbage in half an hour.

[Kheetika: I'm home.]

521
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,800
Mom, I'm scared.

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,870
Mom, help me.

523
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,160
Khun Sira, what's wrong?

524
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,160
Help.

525
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,120
Come on, hurry.

526
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,480
- Come with me.
- What's wrong, Madam?

527
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,920
I don't know what's wrong with Khun Sira.

528
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,640
Khun Sira.

529

[Nannam]

Nannam.

531
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:18,460
What? What happened to Khun Sira?

532
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,230
Help me.

533
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:25,980
Khun Sira. Excuse me.

534
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,120
Khun Sira, what happened?

535
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,600
Mom, help me.

536
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,320
Help me.

537
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,320
Help me.

538
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:07,980
I think Khun Sira saw something

539
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,500
that reminded him of the past.

540
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,980
P'Sira must have had a bad past.

541
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,440
That's why he scratched his hands so hard that he hurt them.

542
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,400
Will Khun Sira be all right?

543
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,620
I gave him a sedative.

544
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,780
He should be all right when he wakes up.

545
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,580
Please keep an eye on him

546
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:32,880
and don't let him get near or touch anything dirty.

547
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,325
- Please take care of him.
- Okay.

548
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,080
Done.

549
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,880

Khun Sira.

551
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,900
Where are you going?

552
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,400
I...

553
00:43:44,306 --> 00:43:46,540
I'm going to get your shoe back.

554
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,260
No need. I found it.

555
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,780
I'm sorry.

556
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:55,040
I didn't mean to throw your shoe away.

557
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,480
It was an accident.

558
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,940
The janitor already told me.

559
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,080
Why don't you go and take a shower?

560
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,440
Then you can have your meal and take your medicine.

561
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:09,298
You're...

562
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,120
You're not mad at me, are you?

563
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,500
I'm not.

564
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:20,560
I should thank you for trying to find my shoe.

565
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,799
I'm sorry it made you like this.

566
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,720
Thank you.

567
00:44:33,193 --> 00:44:34,560
However...

568
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,380
Did you pull out the needle yourself?

569
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,700
It's bleeding.

570
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:56,000
I'll help you change the gauze when you're done eating.

571
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,420
It's all right.

572
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,340
I didn't wet it in the shower.

573
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,900
We don't have any meetings today.

574
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,820
Take a day off at home.

575
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,440
I'm all right now.

576
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,080
I'm fine. I can go to work.

577
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,940
Thank you for saving me last night.

578
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,000
But don't do it again.

579
00:45:30,925 --> 00:45:32,800
Because...

580
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:37,260
you love those shoes, don't you?

581
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,320
Din bought them for you.

582
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,280
If I lose my shoes, I can buy new ones.

583
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,120
What should I do if something happens to you?

584
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,600
Are you worried about me?

585
00:46:01,946 --> 00:46:03,679
Yes, I'm worried about you.

586
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,900
Because I don't know how to explain to people

587
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,600
that a GU executive died next to a garbage dump.

588
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:17,120
You don't have to tell the truth.

589
00:46:22,626 --> 00:46:24,400
I can't eat more.

590
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,599
Let me clean it up for you.

591
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,080
It's okay. I can do it myself. You can eat your meal.

592
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,090
It's okay. Let me do it.

593
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,660
It's all dirty.

594
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,360
Go wash your hands.

595
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,440
It's just porridge. What's the fuss?

596
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,920
Dr. Zhao asked me to keep an eye on you.

597
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,320
You're not allowed to touch dirty stuff. Otherwise, you will have a relapse.

598
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,080
I don't want you to be like last night.

599
00:46:58,992 --> 00:47:00,720
Give me your hand.

600
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,440
Okay, it's done.

601
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,980
I don't think it's clean.

602
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,700
If you want to wash my hands, follow the seven-step hand-washing method.

603
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,760
What if I relapse?

604
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,780
How do you do it?

605
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:27,895
First step, wash your hands like this.

00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,520
Come and eat with us.

620
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,240
Dad,

621
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,200
Khun Tongwon has agreed to renew the contract.

622
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,960
I'll send the renewed contract to him later.

623
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,627
If there's no problem, he will sign it.

624
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,320
Dear, I'm full. I'm going to work.

625
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,400
Wait.

626
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,100
It's still early. Eat some fruit.

627
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,200
I'll get it for you.

628
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,880
Dad, when will you stop being angry at me?

629
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,560
You've never been angry at me for so long.

630
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,020
I'm not angry at you.

631
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:32,600
If you're not angry at me, why won't you talk to me?

632
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,540
Because I feel guilty.

633
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:39,300
When I see your face, I think of your mother

634
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,500
and my vows to her.

635
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,900
I told her that I would take good care of you

636
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,820
and raise you to be a good person.

637
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,000
But eventually, I failed.

638
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,440
And I almost made you a murderer.

You're my only daughter.

00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,159
But I didn't take good care of you.

642
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,220
Is it because of Kanghan?

643
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,513
I didn't intend to drive into her and kill her.

644
00:50:10,513 --> 00:50:14,027
Why didn't you tell me about that?

645
00:50:25,552 --> 00:50:27,700
I didn't want to hide it from you.

646
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,240
I didn't know how to explain it.

647
00:50:32,618 --> 00:50:34,500
I understand.

648
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,580
Hom is your daughter.

649
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,080
It should be difficult for you to tell me about it.

650
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,180
It's my fault.

651
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,820
You should scold me.

652
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,245
It has nothing to do with my dad.

653
00:50:50,245 --> 00:50:55,700
Then tell me the truth.

654
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,520
Have you ever thought about hitting Kanghan?

655
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,000
I've never thought of it.

656
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,620
Then, why did you do that?

657
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:05,140
I just wanted to scare Kanghan.

658
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,060
I'm telling the truth.

659
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,280
Believe it or not.

660
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,120
I trust you.

661
00:51:12,788 --> 00:51:16,600
I chose to trust you because you're Papop's daughter.

662
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,703
Papop is a good person.

663
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,980
I'm sure he'll educate you to be a good person,

664
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,840
and he will not teach you to kill.

665
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,580
Khun Hom, you should come to your senses.

666
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:33,320
Your dad loves you and has high hopes for you.

667
00:51:34,245 --> 00:51:37,580
You should know what to do

668
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,300
so that your dad doesn't worry about you.

669
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,860
I hope this is the last time...

670
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,840
you want to hurt Kanghan.

671
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,920
If you want to hurt her again,

672
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,120
I won't let you go.

673
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,320
[Arrived at Hyatt Regency]

674
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:46,040
Hello, Khun Paa.

675
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,920
Hello.

676
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,900
What are you doing here?

677
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,300
I want to see Kanghan.

678
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,120
Do you live in the same apartment as Kanghan?

679
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:01,680
Ms. Kanghan lives in this apartment? I don't know.

680
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,760
Are you sure?

681
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,540
Yes.

682
00:53:10,906 --> 00:53:16,266
What did Kanghan ask you to hide for her?

683
00:53:28,853 --> 00:53:30,500
Mom.

684
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,460
Brother, are you going back?

685
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,472
What's wrong?

686
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:45,880
How can you drive home with injured hands?

687
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,480
I'll drive you home.

688
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,980
I can drive by myself.

689
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,100
It's okay.

690
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,520
It's all right, Brother.

691
00:53:56,305 --> 00:54:01,380
What? Don't you want me to drive you home because you have some secrets in your house?

692
00:54:02,513 --> 00:54:04,213
No.

693
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,680
[You Are My Heartbeat]

694
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:43,500
Do you want to compete with me for Kanghan? Let's see who Kanghan will choose.
[Next Episode]

695
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,360
At first glance, Khun Sira looks like a novice in love.

696
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,120
But to my surprise, he looked serious.

697
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:54,900
He didn't seem to pursue her for fun, as you thought.

698
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,400
I've warned you.

699
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,360
Are you really going to eat Japanese food?
[Behind the scenes]

700
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,600
- Really?
- It's only ฿500 per bite.

701
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,120
- Are we going to eat omakase?
- Yes.

702
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,300
(Nonsense Japanese)

703
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,500
Cut.

704
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,600
What were we talking about?

705
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,480
I'll leave.

OST: Jackie Jackrin - "Let's End This"

707
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:47,160
♫ I never loved anyone before ♫

708
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:55,020
♫ Until I met you, the one my heart was looking for ♫

709
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:01,640
♫ But Heaven must have made us meet, even though it was just a dream ♫

710
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:08,780
♫ After waking up, it all disappeared ♫

711
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:12,120
♫ If this love has to hurt ♫

712
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,620
♫ I will keep it all to myself ♫

713
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:23,020
♫ Since you deserve to be with that someone who is perfect for you ♫

714
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,660
♫ Let it be me who suffers ♫

715
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:31,280
♫ And be the one who ends this love ♫

716
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,300
♫ But it's all worth it ♫

717
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:43,220
♫ Because I have finally learned what it's like to love ♫
