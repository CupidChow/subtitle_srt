58
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:11,606
I am sending Kansinee to represent GU

59
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:14,086
in the design competition in New York.

60
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:21,353
I think Kheetika is more suitable to represent GU.

61
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,340
But Kansinee has more experience in competitions.

62
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,260
Kheetika hasn't been a designer for a long time.

63
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,380
Although she has worked in a brand company, she is only a novice.

64
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,580
Khun Kansinee had plagiarized Khun Kheetika's design.

65
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,520
Are you sure she won't plagiarize again for the competition?

66
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,106
Now that I've got this chance,

67
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,880
I won't gamble on my future, Khun Sasa.

68
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,513
I don't think design has anything to do with experience.

69
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:15,100
More importantly, Khun Kheetika's designs are better than Khun Kansinee's.

70
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,960
That should tell you who's better suited.

71
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,412
Kheetika, what do you think?

72
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,420
Are you fit to represent GU?

73
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,160
I believe my abilities are on par with Kansinee's.

74
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:55,720
What if I send you to the competition and you lose? How will you accept it?

75
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,480
Will you resign?

76

There's one week left.

77
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:14,980
I want to see your designs before I make the decision.

78
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:20,040
Then I'll decide who will represent GU in the competition.

79
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,160
Khun Kheetika, don't give in.

80
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,340
Go for it.

81
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,460

What can you do to help?

86
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,960
Only Khun Sira can take care of and help Khun Kheetika.

87
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,660
Because Khun Sira is Prince Charming.

88
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,580
No, no, no, no, no.

89
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,160
Only Khun Sasa can take care of and help Khun Kheetika.

90
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,600
Khun Sasa will take over this company in the future anyway.

91
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,680
That's why he's like the sun

92
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,840
shining brightly, sending Khun Kheetika a bright future.

93
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,980
But Khun Sira is ready to protect Khun Kheetika.

94
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,800
He dared to talk back to the chairwoman to protect Khun Kheetika.

95
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,460
He isn't concerned about his future.

96
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,820
And he doesn't worry that the chairwoman will get angry or hate him.

97
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,300
He's the real hero.

98
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,900
No, he's not.

99
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,140
Khun Kheetika, you have to trust me.

100
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,620
Choose Khun Sasa.

101
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,940
Because Khun Sasa is ready to protect and look after you.

102
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:49,180
Perhaps the chairwoman is going to cancel his inheritance.

103
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,260
That's why you'd better choose Khun Sasa.

104
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,030
He's like the sun, sending you a bright future.

105

Yes.

110
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,220
I want to switch sides.

He's perfect. I'm with you.

113
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,460
I will neither choose Khun Sira nor Khun Sasa.

114

Neither.

115
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,780
You don't need to pick sides.

116
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,480

I'll give you five seconds.

I'll fire all of you.

138

Khun Kheetika is going to see her mother.

139
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,520
You want me to see Kheetika's mother.

140
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,120
Won't she be confused about why I'm going to see her?

141
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,860
Go talk and tell her everything.

142
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,380
Tell her you're pursuing her daughter.

143
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:20,160
Do you think it's okay?

144
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,680
Yes.

145
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,320
Most importantly,

146
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,020
you should make a good impression on Khun Kheetika's mother.

147
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,980
You should make her believe that if she gives her daughter to you,

148
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,050
a good man who's soft

149
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,200
and will take care of her daughter for the rest of her life.

150
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,500
Currently, Maha and Rossarin are giving Khun Sira advice

to help him capture Khun Kheetika's mother's heart.

152
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,160
It's scary that Khun Sira is trying so hard.

153
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,200
That's right.

154

Khun Sasa, what are you going to do?

155
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,100
Okay.

156
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,740
Looks like I need a helper.

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,860
Who is it?

158
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,640
It shouldn't be you.

159
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,740
Well, it won't be you either.

160
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,020
[Agree to procurement]

161
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,440
It's your mother's birthday.

162
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,800
I want to go with you.

163
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,200
Why do you want to go?

164
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,960
I want to meet your mother and your family.

165
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,080
You want to get to know them?

166
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,220
Or did the chairwoman ask you to spy on them?

167
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,143
Why do you always think that I am following the chairwoman's arrangement?

168
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:10,298
Isn't it possible...

169
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:12,920
that I'm just...

170
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,373
following my heart?

171
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,185
Hello, Khun Sira.

172
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,833
Hello, Khun Thatha.

173
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,320
What do you want to see me about?

174
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,860
Nothing. I just missed you.

175
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,260
"Nothing. I just missed you."

176
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,580
Is Thatha here?

177
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,340
I just saw her go into my brother's office.

178
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,460
What's wrong? Are you jealous that she went to your brother and not you?

179
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,760
No, I'm not jealous.

180
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,740
I'm glad to have a woman come to see my brother.

181
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,140
My brother has been single for a long time.

182
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,900
I'm glad to see someone taking care of my brother.

183
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,460
You're keeping your head down.

184
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,480
Are you shy?

185
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,980
Where are you going?

186
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,360
I wanted to invite Khun Sira to dinner.

187
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,600
But he didn't want to go.

188
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,200
I think he dislikes me.

189
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,620
Brother, how could you do this to her?

190
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,620
Thatha is a big star.

191
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,900
If I were Thatha, I'd be very upset.

192
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,460
Stop it.

193
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,680
I don't dislike Thatha.

194
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,460
If you don't dislike me,

195
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,640
let's go to dinner together.

196
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,160
I'll go first.

197
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,380
Wait.

198
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,040
Are you going to celebrate your mother's birthday today?

199
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,740
How did you know that?

200
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,740
I have my way.

201
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,940
I'll go with you.

202
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,980
Great.

203
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,180
Din and Khun Kheetika go there.

204
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,520
And I'm going to dinner with Khun Sira.

205
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,080
Okay?

206
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,800
Okay?

207
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,160
Please let me go with you. Okay? Please.

208
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,340
Please? Please?

209
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,740
Do whatever you want.

210
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:54,326
Which restaurant should we go to?

211
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,940
It's your choice.

212
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,140
Let's eat on a cruise.

213
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,300
We'd better go to a regular restaurant.

214
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,260
All right.

215
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,160
Excuse me, Khun Sira.

216
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,460
We are looking for Maha.

217
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
Please take the next elevator.

218
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,280
- Khun Sira.
- Thank you. Sorry.

219
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,020
Move it. Khun Sira.

220
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,240
Khun Sira, this is a gift for Khun Kheetika's mother.

221
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,460
- I got it for you.  - Thank you, Maha.

222
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,480
Just go. I got you an elevator. This way.

223
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,080
Khun Sasa has gone with Khun Kheetika.

224
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:38,580
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Maha.

225
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,160
You're welcome.

226
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,440
Good luck.

227
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,220
- I'll take it for you.
- Okay.

228
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,440
Madam, happy birthday.

229
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,880
I hope you will be happy forever.

230
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,820
Thank you.

231
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,680
This way, please.

232
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,291
Hello.

233
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,880
Happy birthday, Khun Parin.

234
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,840
I wish you good health.

235
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,020
- Let me take it for you.
- Thank you.

236
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,140
Metta.

237
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,540
Oh, okay.

238
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,480
Khun Sasa and Khun Sira, thank you

239
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,360
for coming to celebrate my birthday.

240
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,760
I want to apologize to you that I only bought fruits.

241
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,580
If Kanghan had told me it was your birthday,

242
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,472
I would have prepared a gift that would be more suitable for you.

243
00:16:36,937 --> 00:16:39,700
It's very kind of you to do that.

244
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,300
If you two aren't doing anything today,

245
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,780
why don't you stay for dinner?

246
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,220
- Sure.
- Sure.

247
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:59,910
It's very nice of you two to come to celebrate my birthday. I find it very thoughtful.

248
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,020
Why don't you go and sit in the living room?

249
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,060
Kanghan and I will make dinner for you.

250
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,320
Let me help you.

251
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,920
I'd like to help cook dinner.

252
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,400
When I was abroad, I often helped Kanghan.

253
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,960
You didn't help. You ruined the kitchen.

254
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,500
You broke plenty of plates every time.

255
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,240
Should I wash this?

256
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,640
Let me help you.

257
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,160
Don't. You may relapse.

258
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,500
It's okay. It's simple.

259
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,320
Do you have gloves?

260
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,740
Gloves?

261
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,560
Sit down and eat with us, Khun Hom.

262
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,340
- This is my home. I eat or not─
- Hom. Hom, enough.

263
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,560
Sit down and eat with us.

264
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,120
Okay.

265
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,680
How's the food, Khun Sira and Khun Sasa? Do you like it?

266
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,700
Such a fragrant meal must be delicious.

267
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,680
I like it.

268
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,780
Come on.

269
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,089
Today is about you. You should eat first.

270
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:30,060
Thank you.

271
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,480
Madam, your stir-fried salted duck egg with squid is delicious.

272
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,410
If only I could eat such delicious food every day.

273
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,960
You sound like you're going to come to my house for dinner every day.

274
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,860
Madam, is it okay?

275
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,980
Din.

276
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,400
Be considerate of her. This is not our home.

277
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,760
Yes.

278
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,020
Don't mess around here.

279
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,880
If you're afraid I'm going to mess around,

280
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,140
you should keep an eye on me.

281
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,900
I heard you've hardly been home lately, right?

282
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,260
If I come here a lot,

283
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,060
you will come home often.

284
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,160
Khun Sasa, if you could bring Kanghan here every day,

285
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,200
I will cook for you every day.

286
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,280
Don't worry.

287
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,820
If I come here, I'll bring Kanghan with me.

288
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,920
With young managers like Khun Sasa and Khun Sira managing GU,

289
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,820
I believe GU will definitely scale up.

290
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,280
I hope so.

291
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,540
I hope

292
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,620
KKPP will be a part of it.

293
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:57,343
Are you trying hard to promote your company

294
00:19:57,343 --> 00:20:00,720
because you're afraid that the project won't sell?

295
00:20:01,445 --> 00:20:02,560
Why should I be afraid?

296
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,020
I have confidence in my project.

297
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,060
Most importantly,

298
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,280
I feel more at ease with Khun Sira running the company.

299
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,660
If someone else manages the company,

300
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,460
I wouldn't dare let my company take the risk.

301
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,940
If you're referring to me,

302
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,825
you can just say it straight.

303
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:25,020
Can you handle it if I say it straight?

304
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,680
Hom.

305
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,200
Why do you quarrel with Khun Sasa?

306
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,120
I quarrel with him?

307
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,660
- You saw it─
- Hom.

308
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,760
Khun Papop, Hom argues with me every time she sees me.

309
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,140
She likes to scold me, be angry with me, and pull a long face at me.

310
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,960
She's not cute at all.

311
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,540
Did I start it?

312
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,860
Yes, you did.

313
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,260
You're not cute at all.

314
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,828
Yes, I'm not cute.

315
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:56,720
Kanghan is the only one who's cute, right?

316
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,500
Khun Papop, I'm sorry.

317
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,300
I just wanted to make a joke with Hom.

318
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,240
I didn't expect her to get so angry.

319
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,480
Never mind.

320
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,780
Hom is a sensitive person.

321
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,439

You should give her some private time to spend with her mother.

I apologized for making fun of her today.

You haven't apologized to her before when you've argued.

Why do you want to apologize to her this time?

329
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,860
Because I'll be Kanghan's boyfriend.

And Hom will become my relative.

Why did GU stop the joint venture with us?

00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,060
They said we made a mistake in making lingerie last time

Do you know how much he expected from me on this project?

486
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,460
Only if I succeed will I be able to prove to him

487
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,520
that I can take care of the company.

488
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,160
Do you know what will happen if it fails?

489
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,240
I will lose everything.

490
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,714
Is there anyone listening to me?

491
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,640
Is there anyone listening to me?

492
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,420
Why didn't you listen to my explanation?

493
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,280
We finally made up.

494
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,560
It's all because of that nasty chairwoman.

495
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,900
I told you I didn't know.

496
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,365
I really don't know.

497
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:47,046
Why didn't you listen to me?

498
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:49,140
If you don't listen to me,

499
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,545
I'd better get out of here.

500
00:34:58,946 --> 00:35:01,366
I still can't reach Kanghan.

501
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,380
Nannam, I'll hang up.

502
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,800
What are you doing?

503
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,360
I'm roasting marshmallows.

504
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,560
Do you want to eat it? Wait a minute. It's not done yet.

505
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,880
Is it a fake candle?

506
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,280
It's a real candle.

507
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,960
I think you should come out and talk to me.

508
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,449
Come on.

509
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,097
No.

510
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,580
I don't want to talk. I don't want to see anyone.

511
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,423
I want to disappear from here.

512
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,520
Everybody is in trouble because of me.

513
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,620
I shouldn't have come back.

514
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,709
It's not like that.

515
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,810
Hom's life is ruined because of

516
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,360
me.

517
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,030
Khun Lung's company has a problem because of

518
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,980
me.

519
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,740
Din fought with the chairwoman because of

520
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,540
me.

521
00:36:54,540 --> 00:37:00,760
And you might be hated by the chairwoman because of me.

522
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,680
Maybe my parents separated...

523
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,700
because of me as well.

524
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,880
Nobody needs me.

525
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,740
Hey, you. Listen.

526
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,220
Don't be so pessimistic.

527
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,040
It's not good for you.

528
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,160
Bad things happen all the time.

529
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,800
Nothing good ever happened to me, you know?

530
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,006
If nothing good ever happened to you,

531
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:56,080
then why don't you think about the two of us?

532
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,960
In the past, I was abandoned.

533
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,842
I also thought that nobody needed me,

534
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:13,138
and I didn't need anybody else.

535
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,160
Until I met you.

536
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,600
You made me...

537
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:27,489
want to spend the rest of my life with you.

538
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:33,880
Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me?

539
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,480
Yes.

540
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,200
What about you?

541
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,700
Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me?

542
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,500
Before,

543
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,100
I was most afraid of dirty things.

544
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,900
But now,

545
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,500
I'm most afraid...

546
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,820
that you will disappear from my life.

Hello, Khun Papop.

562
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,700
Hello, Khun Sasa.

563
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,260
I'm here today as a GU representative.

564
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:20,780
I want to discuss the joint venture contract between GU and KKPP.

565
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,380
What contract?

566
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,520
Didn't your grandmother cancel the contract?

567
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,760
That was a misunderstanding.

568
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,540
I want to apologize to Khun Papop for that.

569
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,340
I apologize for making things chaotic.

570
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:38,440
Does Khun Premyuda know that you are here to sign the contract with us?

571
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,640
What did you say?

572
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,952
Din went to sign the contract with KKPP?

573
00:40:45,952 --> 00:40:49,900
Yes. Khun Sasa called a board meeting this morning

574
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,380
to draw up a contract.

575
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,140
He should have signed the contract with KKPP by now.

576
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:01,540
Din, do you have to fight me?

577
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,241
Do you want to wait until it hangs up automatically? The chairwoman is calling you.
[Grandma]

Yes, Maha.

579
00:41:07,687 --> 00:41:10,869
The chairwoman must be mad at you.

580
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,535
So what?

581
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:14,340
She did the wrong thing first.

582
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,060
She mixed personal feelings with work.

583
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,820
You turned against the chairman for Khun Kheetika.

584
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,260
You're much better than Khun Sira.

585
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,460
I didn't do it just for Kanghan.

586
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,806
Yesterday, Hom cried so hard.

587
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:36,120
I really sympathized with her.

588
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,500
If you want to help Kanghan, just say it. Don't use me as an excuse.

589
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,740
Are you worried people won't know you're a bad woman?

590
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,086
I hear you before I see you.

591
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,180
I'm serious.

592
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,702
I did this because I wanted to help you.

593
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,420
But I hit your beloved Kanghan yesterday.

594
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,300
And you helped me today.

595
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,980
I can distinguish between anger and sympathy.

596
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,260
I'm still mad at you for hitting Kanghan.

597
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,059
I hope you can apologize to Kanghan.

598
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,360
You did that because you wanted me to apologize to Kanghan.

599
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,966
I would rather not talk to you anymore. You don't understand me.

last night?
