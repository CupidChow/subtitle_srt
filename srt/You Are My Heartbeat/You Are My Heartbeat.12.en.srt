- I think...
- Brother, don't think too much.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,980
I said that because I wanted the word to get to Grandma.

91
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,200
So, Grandma will trust me.

92
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Do you think Grandma would be comfortable letting Kheetika follow you?

93
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,460
I know.

94
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,120
But if I don't do that,

95
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,860
Kheetika and I won't go back to the old days.

96
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,540
I don't think you should think about Kheetika and you.

97
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,820
Let's see how the chairwoman reacts.

98
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,460
See if she believes what you're doing.

99
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,520
I can't wait any longer, Brother.

100
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,720
It's up to you.

101
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,620
But I have a request.

102
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,300
Whatever you're going to do,

103
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,300
don't say I'm going to be the chairman.

104
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,780
Because Khun Premyuda is the only chairwoman here.

105
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,160
But I don't want to replace you as the vice chairman.

106
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,380
You've never stolen anything from me.

107
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,200
And I never wanted to betray you.

108
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,780
Are you sure?

109
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,580
Did Din really say that?

110
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,020
Keep an eye on him, and keep me posted.

111
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,600
What happened? You don't look good.

112
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,720
Din said at the meeting that he would be the vice chairman of GU.

113
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,220
That's a good thing.

114
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,220
Didn't you always want Khun Din to be the vice chairman?

115
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,420
But I think Din must be planning something.

116
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,260
Because he asked Kheetika to be his assistant.

117
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,560
I need to send someone to get rid of Kheetika before it's too late.

118
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,100
Did you not ask Khun Lom to deal with her?

119
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,240
You don't have to worry about it.

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,160
If it were before, I wouldn't worry.

121
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,540
But it's different now.

122
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,100
Did Khun Lom disobey your orders?

123
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,240
What happened?

124
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,820
The woman named Kheetika is the reason for it all.

125
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,340
There are many customers buying wedding rings this month.

126
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,220
This one sold very well.

127
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,580
Then, try it on.

128
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,640
I want to know why customers like it.

129

I can't take it off.

133

We are inspecting the work, Brother.

136
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,760

137

She couldn't take it off.

138

Can you please take it off for me?

139
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,805
Maybe it will come off.

140
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,940
Don't take it off.

141
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,680
I'll buy it for you.

142
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,260
No need.

143
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,140
Calm down. I think I can take it off in a while.

144
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,420
Your finger is red. Don't take it off.

145

Excuse me. You don't have to take it off.

Khun Sira, I'll take the ring off and give it back to you.

148

You don't have to.

149
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:27,160
It's a lady's ring, not a man's.

150
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,100
I can't wear it if you give it back to me.

151
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,360
But you bought it. It's yours.

152

I sold it to you.

153
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,100
I'll deduct it from your salary.

154
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,920
I have to stay at your place. And you want to deduct my salary.

155
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,760
I don't have that kind of money.

156

In that case, pay in installments.

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,500
You can pay one or two hundred a month.

158
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,120
One or two hundred per month?

159
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
Do you want me to be in debt for the rest of my life?

160
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,140
I don't want it.

161
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,200
I took it off.

162
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,540
I'll sell it and pay you back.

163
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,380
You can't sell it.

164
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,040
How about this?

165
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,900
Just keep the ring for me.

166
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,900
Keep it for you?

167
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,100
♫ I don't understand why my heart trembles when I see you ♫

168
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,920
♫ In my dreams, at night and during the day, why do I still long for you? ♫

169
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,520
♫ I can't stop my heart beating out of rhythm like a delirious person ♫

170
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,840
♫ I've really fallen in love with you. The more you try to flee, the more I want to find you ♫

171
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,540
♫ I've really fallen in love with you. The more you try to flee, the more I want to find you ♫

172
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,060
If I meet someone I like,

173
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,960
I'll ask you to return the ring and give it to her.

174
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,920
What's wrong with you?

175
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,620
You ask a woman to keep your ring and want to meet another woman.

176
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,480
So you have to take care of this ring.

177
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,720
Don't take it off. Don't lose it.

178
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,720
If you lose it, I'll hold you accountable.

179
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,520
No.

180
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,320
You can get out of my office.

181
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,100
I'm going to work.

182
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,580
But─

183
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,380
I may have to let you keep the ring for the rest of your life.

184
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:33,070
What? Khun Sasa took care of Khun Kheetika the whole time?

185
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,180
- Didn't he ask her to help with his work?
- Work is work.

186
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,580
It's not just Khun Sasa. Khun Sira is no different.

187
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,640
He bought a ring for Khun Kheetika.

188
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,300
Are you sure it's not fake news?

189
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,100
I'm sure.

190
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,540
Everyone at the mall is talking about it.

191
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,940
- Both of them like her?
- Let's eat together.

192
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,670
Put it here.

193
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,220
That's fine.

194
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,020
Is it okay?

195
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,546
What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?

196
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,000
Khun Sira, what are you going to do?

197
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,160
Employees at the mall are gossiping about you, Khun Sasa, and Khun Kheetika.

198
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,940
They all say that you and Khun Sasa are pursuing her.

199
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,180
Is it true?

200
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,426
Do you want to keep talking?

201
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:24,660
Sorry.

202
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,927
It's all rumors. The rumors will fade soon.

203
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:30,380
Rumors don't go away easily, Khun Sira.

204
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,380
If this reaches the chairwoman, she won't let it go.

205
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,580
Maybe she will fire Khun Kheetika.

206
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,180
Excuse me! Excuse me, wait.

207
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,420
Please let Nong Thatha go first. Thank you.

208
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,980
- Wow, she's beautiful.
- She's beautiful.

209
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,620
Hello, Khun Kheetika.

210
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

211
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,400
P'Hoymen, please call Khun Sira and tell him I'm here.

212
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,226
Okay.

213
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,820
I happened to be free.

214
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,520
So I wanted to invite Khun Sira to dinner.

215
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,960
Yes.

216
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,860
What are you doing?

217
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,220
Nothing.

218
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,860
Khun Thatha is here. She's chatting with Khun Sira.

219
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,980
- Do we have another project to work on with Khun Thatha?
- I don't know.

220
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,480
You're close to her. Didn't she tell you?

221
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,480
I have nothing to do with her. We're just friends.

222
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,380
Is it okay, Khun Sira?

223
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,340
Let me invite you to dinner

224
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,160
to thank you for making me your spokesperson.

225
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,500
If you really want to say thank you,

226
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,140
I think you should invite Mr. Sasa to dinner. Because he's responsible for that project.

227
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,560
Sasa wouldn't want to go with me.

228
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,320
We often eat together. We're kind of bored with it. Right?

229
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,460
Is it okay, Khun Sira?

230
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,360
You know what? What you said the other day

231
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,160
enlightened me and made me want to change.

232
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,760
Yes. If it weren't for Khun Sira,

233
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,360
Thatha wouldn't be so hot.

234
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,620
It's okay.

235
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,160
I have decided to attend dinner with you.

236
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,360
However, I would like to bring Khun Kheetika with me.

237
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,260
Because she has assisted me in enlightening you.

238
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,400
Okay.

239
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,720
Do I have to go?

240
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,340
The salmon here is delicious.

241
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,480
Khun Sira. Have a taste.

242
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,820
Khun Sira doesn't eat raw food.

243
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,440
This one. The roast beef here is also delicious.

244
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,600
I don't eat beef.

245
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,280
I'll take it.

246
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,280
Sorry. I don't know what you like or don't like.

247
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,760
I think we have to see each other more often to get to know each other.

248
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,100
Are you not talking because you hate me?

249
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,200
No.

250
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Then I'll take it as your agreement to let us get to know each other.

251
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,120
If you want to know about my brother, you can ask me.

252
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,880
I'd love to tell you everything.

253
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,020
Brother, why did you kick me?

254
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,840
Are you shy?

255
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,420
Thatha, if you want to pursue my brother, don't try too hard.

256
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,440
My brother hasn't...

257
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,120
Brother! It hurts.

258
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,320
Khun Sira, you've never had a girlfriend?

259
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,780
And you've never pursued a girl, right?

260
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,600
Yes.

261
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,580
That's because his specs are very high.

262
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,560
If you want to be my brother's girlfriend, you must be a lady, be cute, and quiet.

263
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,140
The most important thing is, you have to be clean.

264
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,660
Why did you kick me?

265
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,540
Sorry.

266
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,240
My shoe is wet.

267
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,620
Brother, do you know how hard it was to get these shoes?

268
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,440
It took me a lot of effort to get them.

269
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,980
I'll leave.

270
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,820
That's how women are.

271
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,900
We care about these things.

272
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,540
We value what our soulmates give us.

273
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,040
Don't go wrong.

274
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,360
Brother, why are you angry about something so small?

275
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,060
I did that for your good.

276
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,600
Did you do that for my good, or do you want to use me to reject Thatha?

277
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,420
Brother, don't think too much.

278
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,900
I just want to add some color to your life.

279
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,860
Actually, Thatha is cute.

280
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,180
Don't worry about me. I'll find a girlfriend myself.

281
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,180
Are you sure you can find a girlfriend?

282
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,500
You'd better let me help me.

283
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,800
Think of it as a reward for helping me pursue Kheetika.

284
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:48,360
Okay?

285
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,340
Brother.

286
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,200
Do you want to set me up, Mr. Wet Wipes?

287
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,943
P'Sira wants to set you up with Mr. Sasa?

288
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:08,320
Yes. When I found out, I wanted to choke him,

289
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,980
beat him up, throw him in a trash can,

290
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:16,300
then drag him out, and bury his head in there so he couldn't breathe.

291
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
I want to kill him.

292
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,380
I don't think P'Sira likes to meddle.

293
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,580
Why would he set you up?

294
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,720
- Because it's good for him.
- What do you mean?

295
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,020
If he successfully sets us up, he'll get a girlfriend.

296
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,420
I think he wants a model girlfriend. That's why he set us up.

297
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,913
If he wants to find a girlfriend, he doesn't have to disturb my life.

298
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,040
You ate a lot. Are you jealous of P'Sira?

299
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,380
Who would be jealous of Mr. Wet Wipes?

300
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,520
Sorry, I was wrong. I should say that you were angry because you were hungry.

301
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,900
That's so different.

302
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,160
Is Kheetika here?

303
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,720
She's eating Som Tam in there.
(Papaya salad)

304
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,140
I left my keycard at the office. So I can't go home.

305
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,500
When will you go back? I'll be waiting to open the door for you.

306
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,240
You don't have to wait for me.

307
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,800
I'm going to stay here a long time. If it's too late, I'll sleep here.

308
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,760
How can you sleep here? Aren't you embarrassed?

309
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,320
Why should I be embarrassed? I've slept in your house.

310
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,880
Why can't I sleep in Nannam's house?

311
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,860
I forbid you. Go home.

312
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,820
Hey! This is not your office.

313
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,060
- Why should I listen to you?
- You live and work with me.

314
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,420
You have to listen to me. Go.

315
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,280
Do I have to do everything you ask me?

316
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,000
Does it include you setting me up with Din?

317
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,900
How did you know that? Who told you?

318
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,300
P'Sira, you'd better go back first.

319
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,900
I'll take care of P'Kanghan.

320
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,780
This is between me and Kanghan.

321
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,120
You should stay out of it.

322
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,860
I have to meddle.

323
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,280
Things will get worse if you handle things emotionally.

324
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,380
You have a boyfriend in the office.

325
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,700
And you have another one at home.

326
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,900
Do you want to date both of them?

327
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,860
Khun Kheetika.

328
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,260
I called you many times, but you didn't answer.

329
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,480
Khun Rossarin, I'm sorry.

330
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,860
My phone is dead. What can I do for you?

331
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,800
The chairwoman is here.

332
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,760
She's waiting for you in the conference room.

333
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,700
Khun Premyuda?

334
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,980
Thank you.

335
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,320
You are just an employee. But you came later than the directors.

336
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,700
Can't the rules bind you, the person who came in through the back door?

337
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,100
Sorry, I'm late.

338
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,700
She was only late today. She usually comes early.

339
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,580
Ms. Chairwoman, what do you want to see me about?

340
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,540
You don't have to go to the Design Department.

341
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,580
Why are you suddenly firing Kheetika from the Design Department?

342
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,220
It's a transfer, not a firing.

343
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,580
Grandma, where are you going to transfer Kheetika?

344
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,740
She'll be Sira's assistant.

345
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,940
But Khun Sira already has me as an assistant, Ms. Chairwoman.

346
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,040
You don't have to be his assistant.

347
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,520
I'm transferring you to be Din's assistant.

348
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,740
But Mahakul has been my brother's assistant for a long time.

349
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,640
He knows every detail of his work.

350
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,740
He should stay and help my brother.

351
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,940
You're going to be the vice chairman.

352
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,640
So you need an assistant who's competent

353
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,800
and knows everything about the group.

354
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,700
Mahakul is the best person to assist you.

355
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,020
But we're working on a design project.

356
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,040
If you want Kheetika to leave the Design Department, we will have no project leader.

357
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,140
You don't have to worry about that. I've already found someone.

358
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,960
Parwit, call the new head of the Design Department in.

359
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,340
Hello, I'm Kansinee.

360
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,060
I'm the new head of the Design Department.

361
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:52,680
Ms. Chairwoman, please wait.

362
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,320
What's wrong?

363
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,920
You transferred me to work with Khun Sira.

364
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,780
I understand that you want Khun Sira to keep an eye on me

365
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,080
and keep me away from Din.

366
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,040
But I don't understand why you hired Kansinee.

367
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,880
Have you forgotten that Kansinee plagiarized my design before?

368
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,240
Like I said,

369
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,440
I want to give her a chance.

370
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,160
Can't I do it?

371
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,420
Really?

372
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,540
Do you want to use Kansinee to suppress me?

373
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,120
If it's what you think, what are you going to do?

374
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,420
I won't let others do dirty tricks to me.

375
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,060
I'll wait and see what you do.

376
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,080
Aren't you afraid?

377
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,380
What am I afraid of?

378
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,160
What you're doing could cost you everyone,

379
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,060
whether it's Khun Sira or Sasa.

380
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
Be careful.

381
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,820
The future would be scary with no one around.

382
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,580
Thank you for listening.

383
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:28,340
What? Are we going to work with Khun Kansinee again?

384
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,840
Oh, no.

385
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Phi's, can you please sign the internship report for me?

386
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,240
Otherwise, I won't be able to finish the internship smoothly.

387
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,840
Don't worry. Khun Sira won't stand by.

388
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,120
I wonder what Khun Kansinee said to the chairwoman to get her back to work.

389
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,540
Khun Kheetika, are you willing to change departments?

390
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,680
I don't understand why Grandma brought Khun Kansinee back to work.

391
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,120
It must have something to do with Kheetika.

392
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,020
Because Grandma knows about their problems.

393
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,150
Maybe Grandma may be planning to use Kansinee to get rid of Kheetika.

394
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,620
What are you going to do if Grandma really wants to do that?

395
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,560
This time, I won't let Grandma or anyone else stop me and Kanghan.

396
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:32,490
If Kheetika doesn't want to fight against the chairwoman and give in again,

397
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,240
what are you going to do?

398
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,280
I'm afraid I need someone to help me and Kanghan.

399
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,260
I won't give in easily.

400
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,960
Who can help you?

401
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,340
Kheetika,

402
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,240
Khun Sira's itinerary is on this tablet.

403
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,000
These are all of Khun Sira's work folders.

404
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,860
As for this, it's a clean kit.

405
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,240
I named it.

406
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,940
It contains all the sanitizing tools Khun Sira needs.

407
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,620
Here.

408
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,860
Oh, Maha, don't think too much.

409
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:36,040
Khun Kheetika. I'll leave Khun Sira to you.

410
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,920
Please take care of him.

411
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,820
Don't let him get hurt. Don't make him sick.

412
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,620
Is this a transfer speech or is this a last word?

413
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,960
P'Kirin!

414
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,660
Maha! Maha, wait.

415
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,720
Why did you come back?

416
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,300
What's wrong?

417
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,340
Can't I come back?

418
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,600
Are you afraid of me?

419
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,880
I don't have to be afraid of you.

420
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,320
Good. This makes the game even more interesting.

421
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,700
You ruined my life.

422
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,060
Prepare for your retribution.

423
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,800
It's you who ruined your life.

424
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,140
- It's none of my business.
- You are behind it.

425
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,120
You stole everything from me.

426
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,020
What did I steal?

427
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,000
Khun Hom once said that you like to steal other people's things.

428
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,140
I didn't believe it until I saw it with my own eyes.

429
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,120
But I'm lucky.

430
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,200
Khun Hom was so unlucky that she lost everything.

431
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,140
What's wrong with Hom?

432
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,860
Don't you know?

433
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,940
Khun Hom was removed from the manager position by her father.

434
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,572
It was all because of you.

435
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,820
Khun Sasa, what do you want to see me about?

436
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,700
I want to talk to you about Kanghan.

437
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,480
Madam, I think you know that I like Kanghan.

438
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Kind of.

439
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,000
When we were studying abroad, we almost got together.

440
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,020
But something went wrong.

441
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,260
My grandma didn't like Kanghan.

442
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,420
Why? Can you tell me?

443
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,240
Did it have something to do with me?

444
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,160
Just tell me. I won't be angry.

445
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,710
Part of the reason

446
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,540
my grandma didn't like Kanghan is because you married Khun Papop.

447
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,380
My grandma might think that you married him because─

448
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,160
I wanted money. I wanted to rely on a rich man.

449
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,820
So your grandmother thought Kanghan wanted

450
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,760
to find a rich man like I did. Right?

451
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,560
My grandma misunderstood you.

452
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,040
I will try my best to explain and prove to my grandma

453
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,180
that you and Kanghan are not what she thought.

454
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,560
Madam, please trust me.

455
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,860
If Kanghan and I get together, I won't do anything that worries you.

456
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,800
I won't let my grandma and the others say that about Kheetika again.

457
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,900
Thank you.

458
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,440
Why did you want to tell me this?

459
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,260
I'm telling you because I want you to believe me.

460
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,660
If Kanghan wants to give up one day,

461
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:21,080
I want you to encourage her.

462
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,980
I'll be blunt.

463
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,580
It's challenging to change one's mind.

464
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:34,160
I've been trying for over a decade to change someone's mind,

465
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,800
but I haven't been able to.

466
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,720
Madam, please trust me. I can do it.

467
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,920
If you can really do it,

468
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,510
I'll be happy for Kanghan to have a good man

469
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,860
like you to take care of her.

470
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,080
Okay.

471
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,480
Did Din talk to Khun Parin about pursuing Kheetika?

472
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
That's all, Metta.

473
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,780
- Hello, Mr. Papop.
- Hello.

474
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,360
I've been waiting for you for a long time. Come. Sit down.

475
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,900
Let's have a talk.

476
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,720
What are you doing here?

477
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,340
Hom! Let go of Kanghan.

478
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,340
Get out of this company. Now!

479
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,940
Stop it, Hom.

480
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,960
It doesn't help that you are angry.

481
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,640
I don't want to listen to you.

482
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,240
If you don't want to listen to her, get out.

483
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,060
Dad.

484
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,800
Let Hom stay.

485
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,420
I'm here today because of Hom.

486
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,020
Because of me? What is it?

487
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,720
Kansinee told me that you were removed from your position.

488
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,220
Mr. Papop, Hom didn't do anything wrong with Kansinee.

489
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,040
Kansinee is cunning.

490
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,500
She knew Hom hated me.

491
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,600
I think Hom was used by her.

492
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,540
Now that she knows that she is being used and knows the truth,

493
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,360
she should correct it instead of getting by.

494
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,780
You're right.

495
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,980
But you shouldn't have removed her.

496
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,000
Because Hom is your daughter.

497
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,160
I did that because she's my daughter.

498
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,620
If you want to take over the company, you must be rational, moral,

499
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,240
and smarter than you are now. So that you can take care of your employees.

500
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,960
And you shouldn't blame others when you do something wrong.

501
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,766
All right.

502
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:44,200
I am good for nothing.

503
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,700
I'm not like your stepdaughter, who does everything well.

504
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,120
If you think she's nice, and you love her, just give her everything.

505
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,900
If you're still like this,

506
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,940
I will give everything to Kanghan.

507
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,360
- Mr. Papop.
- I started this company with my own hands.

508
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,220
I won't let you ruin it.

509
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,860
I─ Let's go outside and talk.

510
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:14,100
If I had known this, I should have run over you

511
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,460
so you wouldn't have come and taken everything from me.

512
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,220
Run over her? What does that mean?

513
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,060
The day you removed me,

514
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,520
you asked me to apologize to Kanghan.

515
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,120
I went to her. But I didn't apologize to her.

516
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,140
I went to hit her.

517
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,390
Mr. Papop. Mr. Papop, calm down!

518
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,780
She didn't hit me that day.

519
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,620
Hom said that because she was angry.

520
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,320
You want to do better than Kanghan, and you want to beat her.

521
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,700
But you'll never make it.

522
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,060
You can't even be a good person.

523
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,900
My dad doesn't love me.

524
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,640
[Kanghan]

525
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,640
Beauty, can I dance with you?

526
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,970
Stop getting closer.

527
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,360
Do you want to have fun?

528
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,800
Let go of me!

529
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,140
She doesn't want to be with you. You shouldn't mess with her.

530
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,400
What happened?

531
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,820
He hit me first.

532
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,280
And he messed with my woman.

533
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,440
I wanted to relax.

534
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,340
How could I encounter this?

535
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,980
Hom, what's wrong? Do you want to throw up?

536
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,640
Don't throw up yet.

537
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,800
Hello, this behavior is not allowed.

538
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,280
She's throwing up.

539
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,180
Hom, get up first.

540
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,000
Hom.

541
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,740
I didn't see her throw up.

542
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,420
Well...

543
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,780
Can't you see it?

544
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,240
Sorry. The bathroom is over there.

545
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,320
Please.

546
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,705
Hom.

547
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,900
Poor Khun Hom.

548
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:16,600
Metta, if Khun Papop comes back, don't tell him Khun Hom is drunk.

549
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,000
Why? Do you want to exaggerate it and tell him yourself?

550
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,720
If you want Khun Papop to scold Khun Hom, just tell him.

551
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,080
Wow.

552
00:40:42,198 --> 00:40:44,520
Wow.

553
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,380
Khun Sasa, your pants will be dry in five minutes.

554
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,050
Thank you.

555
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,340
By the way, do you know what happened to Hom?

556
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,840
Why is she drunk?

557
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,480
I don't know either.

558
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,440
I think she went to drink because she was upset about her fight with her dad.

559
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,300
Why are they fighting?

560
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,800
Does it have anything to do with Kanghan?

561
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,380
I don't know either.

562
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,760
I'll go downstairs and check on your pants.

563
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,640
Thank you.

564
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,580
Hom, you drunkard. You stink.

565
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,540
What have I done to deserve this?

566
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,300
Are you feeling hot?

567
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,540
Do you feel better?

568
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,020
When will you stop fighting with Kanghan?

569
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,320
Why can't you live your own life?

570
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,520
Mom. Mom, come to me.

571
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,420
I'm not your mother.

572
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,640
- I miss you.
- Let go.

573
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,540
- I miss you, Mom.
- Hom.

574
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,640
- Mom. I miss you, Mom.
- Stop! My bath towel is coming off.

575
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,040
- Mom, hug me.
- My bath towel is coming off.

576
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,760
- Mom.
- Hom, stop.

577
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,920
- Hom, stop.
- Mom.

578
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,380
- Mom, you smell good.
- Stop.

579
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,720
Hom, calm down.

580
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,100
Good morning.

581
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,440
I bought you porridge.

582
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,960
Do you wear the ring all the time?

583
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,840
Do you want me to return it? I'll take it off later.

584
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,480
No need.

585
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,600
You can wear it.

586
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,700
Khun Sira, I think you already know whom to help.

587
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,820
If you have decided,

588
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:55,880
I believe your decision was well-thought-out.

589
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:01,120
Maybe sometimes pain is the best ending.

590
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,520
There's porridge on your lips.

591
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,840
We should go to work in my car together.

592
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,765
What?

593
00:44:25,765 --> 00:44:31,740
Aren't you worried that others will see it and misunderstand it?

594
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,800
I don't care who misunderstands.

595
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:53,800
Maha, yesterday, did Khun Sira work until he was so tired that he went crazy or something?

596
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,220
I'm not Khun Sira's assistant anymore.

597
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,140
I don't know what Khun Sira did.

598
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,620
Are you still angry?

599
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,200
Maha.

600
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,820
Hey, don't be such a baby.

601
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,260
Khun Kheetika has been coaxing you for a long time.

602
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,020
You are not cute if you're angry all the time.

603
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,300
You will become annoying.

604
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:27,380
Don't talk to me if you think I'm annoying. I'm not an important person.

605
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,700
If you keep doing this, you will become an unimportant person.

606
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,480
Oh, wait. Calm down. You'd better talk it over calmly.

607
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,300
I can't calm down, Khun Kheetika.

608
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,220
Are you a man? Why are you so mean?

609
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:42,280
It is because you are unreasonable that you lost your love and career.

610
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,820
Nobody loves you and wants you.

611
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,400
I'm not cute! I'm not good!

612
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,420
You don't have to care or love me!

613
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,340
Okay. All right!

614
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,660
I won't care about you anymore.

615
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,300
Just leave!

616
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,120
- Ah.
- Oh.

617
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,640
Khun Sira.

618
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,620
I have a favor to ask you.

619
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,240
What is it?

620
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,980
Khun Mahakul and Khun Rossarin are angry at each other because of me.

621
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,860
You've been working with them for a long time.

622
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:26,200
Do you know any way to get them back together?

623
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,180
I think you'd better spend your time at work.

624
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,320
You don't need to be concerned about them.

625
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,100
But I'm the cause, and I'm responsible for that.

626
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,520
Okay? Please help me.

627
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,240
Please. Please. Help me.

628
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,980
Kanghan, here you are.

629
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,600
Please help me with my wound. I hurt the corner of my mouth.

630
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,600
What did you do?

631
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,360
I went out with my friends last night and helped a drunk woman. I was beaten because of her.

632
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,980
Ask someone else to help you. I don't have time.

633
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,800
No, come and help me.

634
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,100
Come on.

635
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:19,100
If you don't help me, I'll pester you like this.

636
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,140
Come on.

637
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,100
- Why are you smiling?
- Because I'm happy.

638
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,500
You're happy, are you?

639
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,820
Come on.

640
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,220
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

641
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,960
You're so cruel.

642
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,400
I'll take care of him.

643
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,020
You... Go and figure out how to reconcile Rossarin and Mahakul.

644
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,300
Brother, why are you interrupting us?

645
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,960
I─

646
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:19,470
I'm worried that someone will see you with Kheetika and report it to the chairwoman.

647
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:22,760
What should we do then? She was transferred last time.

648
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,160
Maybe she will get fired this time.

649
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,400
I heard everything.

650
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,860
Speaking of that... Why do you want to find a way to reconcile Rossarin and Maha?

651
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,660
Because they are fighting.

652
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,540
I want them to make up.

653
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,920
Can you think of a way?

654
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,020
If you want me to help, you have to make a trade.

655
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,940
I will help you if you go to a movie with me.

656
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,160
- Brother, it hurts.
- Sorry.

657
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,080
If you can help them reconcile,

658
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,320
I'll do anything with you.

659
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,540
Really?

660
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,960
Swear it.

661
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,120
I swear.

662
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,860
Three heads are better than one.

663
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:39,300
Excuse me.

664
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,960
Sit here, Mahakul.

665
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:49,060
Nong Pim, why have you been clinging to Maha lately?

666
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,720
Can't I?

667
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,560
I just found out that P'Mahakul is single.

668
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,140
I'm afraid he's lonely, so I want to spend more time with him.

669
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,780
Nong Pimthong, you are cute.

670
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,200
You are caring and kind.

671
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:11,340
You're not mean, ruthless, and not cute like someone here.

672
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,180
Hey, Maha.

673
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:17,400
You found a new girlfriend less than a month after your breakup.

674
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,820
P'Pa, please don't say that. I'm shy.

675
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:28,020
Pa, we women have to keep our eyes open when we're looking for a boyfriend.

676
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:32,020
For example, Kirin. He's a good guy.

677
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:39,620
He's simple, straightforward, not nosy, reasonable, and obedient.

678
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,620
She must be someone very lucky to be your girlfriend.

679
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:47,840
Since you say so, you should pursue Kirin.

680
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,040
Kirin, if you want to have a good life,

681
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,500
don't get a girlfriend like her.

682
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:58,140
Not every woman in this room is cute.

683
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,100
Kirin, let's date.

684
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,800
What?

685
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,460
Khun Rossarin, are you sure?

686
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,500
I'm a straightforward person.

687
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,460
If I like someone, I'll be straightforward.

688
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,400
It's annoying to think too much.

689
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,600
Why hasn't Din read the message?

690
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,600
Din went to talk to an investor. I think they're still talking.

691
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,900
- What do you want?
- I just wanted to ask him if he had any ideas.

692
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,020
I have a headache because of them.

693
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,940
I don't understand why Khun Maha and Khun Rossarin are angry with each other.

694
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:39,100
Khun Rossarin just asked Khun Kirin out.

695
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,380
Khun Rossarin is angry with Maha, isn't she?

696
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,820
They've been working together for so long.

697
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,660
They fight with each other because they are worried about each other.

698
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,100
I know.

699
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:54,760
After Maha broke up, Khun Rossarin comforted him and took care of him.

700
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,640
She never left him alone.

701
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,260
And she scolds him and taunts him.

702
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:06,020
Could it be that Khun Rossarin has a crush on Maha?

703
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,740
Khun Rossarin has a crush on Maha?

704
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:13,580
Yes! But Khun Rossarin doesn't know her feelings.

705
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:19,340
Do we not know how we feel if we have a crush on someone?

706
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,180
There are such people.

707
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,380
You think it's a habit.

708
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,860
You spend a lot of time with each other,

709
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,940
so you will feel that the other person is your friend.

710
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,720
You make it sound like you've been there.

711
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,280
Have you ever had a crush on someone and you didn't know it?

712
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,120
No.

713
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,680
Really?

714
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,380
Or... do you have a crush on me,

715
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,640
and you don't know it?

716
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,120
Are you crazy?

717
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,000
Answer me.

718
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,560
Look at me in the eye.

719
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,140
I...

720
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:34,380
Do you have a crush on me?

721
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,340
Hey, you.

722
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,000
I have never liked you.

723
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,560
Don't you ever do that to me again.

724
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,580
Did you buy the ring for Kheetika?

725
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,920
Yes.

726
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,000
I...
- Do you think you can buy her love?

727
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,900
You said she was a gold digger and she liked rich men.

728
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,740
So, I wanted to try her to see if it was true.

729
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:27,000
Ms. Chairwoman, what's your plan about Kansinee?

730
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,820
She's just a backup.

731
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:34,340
If you do it wrong, I'll handle it my way.

732
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,160
[You Are My Heartbeat]

733
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,080
It's very painful
[Preview]

734
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:56,300
to be cheated and betrayed by someone you trust.

735
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,660
P'Sira must have had a bad past life.

736
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,340
That's why he scratched his hands so hard that he hurt them.

737
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,980
Is Khun Sira going to be all right?

738
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:11,500
I hope this is the last time you want to hurt Kanghan.

739
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,900
If you want to hurt her again,

740
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,240
I won't let you go.

741
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,600
Brother, I'll get a chair and put it here.
[Behind the scenes]

742
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,400
Otherwise, it's troublesome to sit.

743
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,940
Don't improvise.

744
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,340
Let him finish it.

745
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,900
Cut!

746
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,350
I'll get you a chair later, Khun Sasa.
