I just pretended to fart yesterday, and he freaked out.

158
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,860
If I had farted, he'd probably be in the ICU by now.

159
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,420
So many rules.

160
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,000
He's so neat.

161
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,840
Why is there only himself in all the photos?

162
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,440
Why did he leave so much empty space?

163
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,260
Did he push people out of the picture because he thought it would be dirty?

164
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,620
Mr. Wipes.

165
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
He reads books.

166
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,840
We're not a couple.

167
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,860
I am Din's brother,

168
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,120
but I'm not his biological brother.

169
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,400
Here you are.

170
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,020
Thank you.

171
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,513
Why did you hit my hand?

172
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:41,450
Why won't you eat vegetables?

173
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,360
Because I don't like onions and carrots.

174
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,250
Don't you know that foods that taste bad must be good for you?

175
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,640
Onions and carrots are good for your health.

176
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,360
Onions are high in vitamin C,

177
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,420
which can block cancer cells from growing.

178
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,840
It also improves sleep.

179
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,880
As for carrots,

180
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,010
they improve our bone health and lower cholesterol.

181
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,920
Kanghan.

182
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,030
You must have been sent by my brother, right?

183
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,840
What? No one sent me.

184
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,480
I don't buy it. You must have been sent by my brother to keep an eye on me.

185
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,060
You said the same thing, "Foods that taste bad must be good for you."

186
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,473
And you both explained it to me.

187
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:30,390
See? You don't eat vegetables, so you're stupid.

188
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,667
You have a brother?

189
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:39,730
He's not my biological brother, but I love him.

190
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,520
He was adopted by my grandmother to accompany me.

191
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,040
He and I have a good relationship.

192
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,070
I think that's because we are both orphans.

193
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,520
Don't try to trick me.

194
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,130
Here. Eat it.

195
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,670
No.

196
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,580
Eat it.

197
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,770
Come on, eat it.

198
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,440
That's weird. I usually feel sick when I eat onions and carrots.

199
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,250
But they taste sweet today.

200
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,120
Feed me again.

201
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,830
Eat vegetables.

202
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,013
Hello, Khun Kheetika.

203
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:38,053
Khun Sira asked you to sign a labor contract with GU Center, right?

204
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:39,393
Yes.

205
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,018
Khun Sira is busy,

206
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,520
but he asked me to handle the signing.

207
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,030
Please sign the contract in the room.

208
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,310
Please.

209
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,710
Khun Kheetika, you don't have a problem with the contract. Right?

210
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,240
I do not.

211
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,159
Where is Khun Sira?

212
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:23,773
He's on his way here.

213
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:28,590
If there's no problem, you can sign the contract.

214
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:12,700
[Khun Kheetika has signed it.]

215
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,700
- Hi, Kirin.
- Hi.

216
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,240
I have a new Thai word to teach you.

217
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,520
Do you know buffalo?

218
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
Yes, buffalo.

219
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,420
In Thai, it is pronounced as 'buffalo'. Repeat after me. ('Buffalo' in Thai is slang for 'stupid'.)

220
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,350
Buffalo.

221
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,000
Buffalo.

222
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,100
Your pronunciation is clear.

223
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,620
I feel bad for you.

224
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,280
Good. Your pronunciation is correct. Okay?

225
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,380
It's okay, you've learned the word.

226
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,140
This style is so cute and sexy. I love it.

227
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,460
Who designed it?

228
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,420
It was designed by Khun Kansinee.

229
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,140
You should have known it. Because everyone says you're a gossiper.

230
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,140
Gossiper?

231
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,940
Kirin.

232
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,080
Why did you insult me?

233
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,920
When did I insult you?

234
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,370
You just call me a 'gossiper'.

235
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,440
Is that a curse word?

236
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,440
I really didn't know.

237
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,766
Actually, I wanted to say that you're clever.

238
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:23,080
Do you know clever?

239
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,440
'Clever' in Thai is pronounced as 'chalat.''

240
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,740
not 'gossiper'.

241
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,400
Oh, really?

242
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,470
Who taught you that?

243
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,280
Nana, why did you teach him that?

244
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,840
No, I went to Khun Mahakul the other day.

245
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,400
Khun Mahakul taught me that.

246
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,112
Kirin, you were tricked by Mahakul.

247
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:52,460
You know what? Listen to me.

248
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,400
Don't trust people so easily.

249
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,900
Nowadays, people dress well and look knowledgeable,

250
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,918
but they may trick you.

251
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:05,180
Am I right, Khun Kansinee?

252
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,730
Hi, everyone, I'd like to introduce you to a new colleague.

253
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,410
Please come in.

254
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,600
Hello, everyone. My name is Kheetika.

255
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,860
Isn't she Khun Kheetika, who copied Khun Kansinee's design?

256
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,232
Really?

257
00:21:48,232 --> 00:21:50,620
I'm the person in the news.

258
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,420
Is there someone who copied my design?

259
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,180
What are you doing here?

260
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,046
Khun Kheetika is Khun Sira's special assistant.

261
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:06,680
Excuse me.

262
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,860
What are the responsibilities of Khun Sira's special assistant?

263
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,140
The special assistant will handle some special tasks.

264
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:19,380
When there are transnational criminals, Khun Kheetika will wear armor and carry a gun─

265
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,900
That's Special Forces, not special assistants.

266
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,120
- You messed up my hair. Don't be so serious.
- Yes.

267
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,630
Here's the thing, everyone.

268
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,420
From now on, Khun Kheetika is Khun Sira's special assistant.

269
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,680
She'll follow Khun Sira's orders.

270
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,445
And she'll be responsible for the Design Department.

271
00:22:36,445 --> 00:22:39,540
What do you mean by that?

272
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,540
It means I'll be the head of the Design Department.

273
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh, here comes Khun Sira.

274
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,140
- Khun Sira, I have something to ask you.
- Sorry, Khun Kansinee.

275
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,960
I'd like to introduce you to the person who will manage all departments

276
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,158
related to the New Look website on my behalf. Khun Sasa.

277
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,000
Hello, everyone.

278
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,086
Hello.

279
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,600
From now on, Khun Sasa will manage this department.

280
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,640
If I'm not important,

281
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,019
why did you, a man of position, offer me the job?

282
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,800
The reason I offered you the job─

283
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,500
Don't say that you wanted me to prove myself.

284
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,800
Because I've thought about it

285
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,060
Even if I prove that I didn't plagiarize, you won't have any trouble. Right?

286
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:17,200
But you will have trouble

287
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,980
if you offer me, who has a history of plagiarizing, the job.

288
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:24,180
- Well...
- You are a businessman.

289
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,260
You weigh the pros and cons before you make decisions.

290
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,960
You won't make money-losing decisions.

291
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,880
Don't tell me that you offered me the job because I'm a good designer.

292
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,120
There's no doubt that GU would find a better designer than me.

293
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,760
I don't know what you want.

294
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,240
But you must want something from me.

295
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:58,686
It's an honor to work with you, Khun Sasa.

296
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:00,340
It's a great honor.

297
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,140
I just started working here, and there's a new director.

298
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,200
Excuse me, Khun Sira. I have a question.

299
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,560
I don't know if I understood it correctly.

300
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:18,466
Khun Mahakul said that Khun Kheetika is going to work with us.

301
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,660
Is that true?

302
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,170
Of course, it's true.

303
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,750
I invited Khun Kheetika to work here.

304
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,460
Is there a problem, Khun Kansinee?

305
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:35,800
No. But we need to be careful.

306
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,790
Our designs can be plagiarized.

307
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,586
Then you should be more careful.

308
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,480
Khun Kheetika, there's a department head meeting today.

309
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,000
Please attend the meeting.

310
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,920
So we can introduce you to the department heads as Khun Sira's assistant.

311
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,780
- Okay.
- Please.

312
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,773
Brother, why are you letting Kheetika work here?

313
00:26:30,773 --> 00:26:33,920
You know there's news that she plagiarized our design.

314
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,158
Why can't I let her work here?

315
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:49,860
Actually, I wanted to ask you a question

316
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,305
when you pulled Kheetika from the competition.

317
00:26:52,305 --> 00:26:57,013
Did you know Kheetika before?

318
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:00,700
Yes.

319
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,867
I used to know her, but now I don't.

320
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:06,399
And I don't want her to work here.

321
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:12,226
But she has signed a labor contract with us.

322
00:27:12,226 --> 00:27:13,840
- But, Brother, you─
- Din,

323
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,139
if you don't want people to think

324
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:20,266
that you became the manager because of our grandma,

325
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:24,846
you have to separate work from personal matters.

326
00:27:24,846 --> 00:27:26,806
Brother, haven't you thought about it?

327
00:27:26,806 --> 00:27:29,986
She could be KKPP's spy.

328
00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:31,450
You...

329
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:36,390
Don't you know that Kheetika is the adopted daughter of KKPP's chairman?

330
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,340
I know. That's why I hired her.

331
00:27:41,313 --> 00:27:43,633
Because I want to find out the truth.

332
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:47,666
I don't believe it without proof.

333
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,580
What about you?

334
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,713
Do you believe that she copied someone else's design?

335
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,080
Who are we going to listen to? Khun Kansinee─

336
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,900
- Here.
- Khun Pa.

337
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,820
- Yes.
- This lingerie design can be sent to the factory.

338
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,680
All meetings have approved it.

339
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,600
Send it to the factory?

340
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,340
- It's done, right?
- Right.

341
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,160
Okay, I'll take care of it.

342
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,912
But I haven't seen it yet.

343
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,600
Why do I need you to approve my design?

344
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,820
Because I'm your superior.

345
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,100
I have enough authority to check whether it passes or fails.

346
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,025
Let's see.

347
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,220
The cup shape is narrow. There is too much lace.

348
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,580
The underwire can't support the coaster well.

349
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,400
It's not up to par. You should modify it.

350
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,778
Showing off your abilities on the first day of work?

351
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,210
I'm capable.

352
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,760
You don't think I'm capable?

353
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,480
You saw my design when we met on the plane, didn't you?

354
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,020
Have Khun Kheetika and Khun Kansinee met before?

355
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,060
I don't know.

356
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,340
What do you know?

357
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,480
Modify it. Let me check when you're done.

358
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,880
Why should I do what you say?

359
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,040
It was approved at the meeting.

360
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,500
Because I didn't approve of it.

361
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,000
I don't approve of it.

362
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:57,940
Keep in mind that I designed this bra, not you.

363
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,600
Kheetika has become Khun Sira's special assistant?

364
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,020
Do you know who recruited her?

365
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,660
Khun Sira.

366
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,900
Are you sure it was Khun Sira, not Sasa?

367
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,420
Yes. Khun Sira recruited her. And he gave her a lot of power.

368
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,120
She thinks she is Khun Sira's person.

369
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,640
Do they seem to be on good terms?

370
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,120
Yes, they do. Khun Sira seems to take good care of her.

371
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,800
Like I just said, he gave Kheetika a lot of power.

372
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,820
Then, keep an eye on them.

373
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,460
If there is anything, report it to me.

374
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,380
I won't let Kheetika stay here long.

375
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,900
I'll find a way to get her out of GU.

376
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,820
Thank you for coming back to see your mom.

377
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,900
I didn't come back to see my mom.

378
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,780
I... I'm back to get the housing registration form to apply for new cards.

379
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,740
Do you know I'm worried about you?

380
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,720
I haven't been able to reach you.

381
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,400
Mom, I lost my phone. So I didn't contact you.

382
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,340
You don't have to worry about me. I can take care of myself.

383
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,460
What about you?

384
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,040
Did you rest well and take your medication as prescribed?

385
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,320
Mom, please don't do that. Okay?

386
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,520
It won't bring me back.

387
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,080
Instead, it will make him more tired.

388
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,900
I don't feel tired...

389
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,620
taking care of your mom.

390
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,820
Where do you live now? Is there anything I can help you?

391
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,940
I live with a friend.

392
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,840
Where does your friend live?

393
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,540
Tell me your address. Maybe I'll stop by and visit you someday.

394
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,760
Mom, please don't.

395
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,020
My friend...

396
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,780
doesn't like to deal with people.

397
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,860
And he doesn't like people to go to his place.

398
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,380
Then I'll leave.

399
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,440
Wait, my child.

400
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,280
Since you're here, can you stay for dinner with me?

401
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,420
Eat more, my child.

402
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,060
You just agreed to eat with your mom.

403
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,500
Look at her. How happy she is.

404
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,040
Well, did you find a job?

405
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,580
If you need my help, just tell me.

406
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:16,780
It's okay. I got a job.

407
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,580
You're great. You can get a job anywhere.

408
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,850
Well, where do you work?

409
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,425
It's a small company.

410
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:32,273
Is GU small?

411
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:36,200
Why don't you dare tell my dad that you work at GU?

412
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,020
You work at GU?

413
00:33:39,753 --> 00:33:41,353
Yes.

414
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,800
I need to prove something.

415
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,260
You're ungrateful.

416
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,780
What did you say?

417
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,480
Wait, wait, wait.

418
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,220
Actually, it's not bad for Kanghan to work at GU.

419
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,100
Speaking of which, we would like to work with them.

420
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:03,960
Maybe it's good for our company that she works at GU.

421
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,680
If Kanghan really wanted to help our company,

422
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,300
would she plagiarize someone else's design and embarrass the company, Dad?

423
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,220
She left us a mess.

424
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,620
Then she went to work for another company.

425
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,200
People say that selfish people

426
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,680
only want to get free stuff.

427
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,220
That's enough, Hom.

428
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,820
About the plagiarism, I've got people searching for evidence.

429
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,680
I won't make any decisions until I get evidence.

430
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:38,320
Dad, you can't protect Kanghan like this in everything.

431
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,020
Okay.

432
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,820
Listen. Kanghan got the job at GU

433
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:51,960
not because of her ability but because she made a deal.

434
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,020
Since you mentioned it, let's make it clear.

435
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,620
What deal did I make?

436
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:04,180
It's not necessary. I know who you're trying to insinuate.

437
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,180
And I don't want to hear it anymore.

438
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,120
If you think you're better than Kanghan,

439
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,060
prove it with your achievement. Okay?

440
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,260
What do you mean?

441
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,040
Now that Kanghan works at GU,

442
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,280
she's our competitor.

443
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,980
You can compete with her at work.

444
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,440
Do you think you can beat GU?

445
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,480
Let me take you to your friend's house.

446
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,100
Don't bother.

447
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,260
Get some good rest here.

448
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,086
I can go back by myself. Don't worry.

449
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,580
Wait.

450
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:09,440
I'm proud to have such a wonderful daughter as you.

451
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,986
If...

452
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:33,220
If you need anything, just call me. Okay?

453
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,460
Mom, don't worry about me. I can take care of myself.

454
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,780
Everything's fine where I live.

455
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,180
The owner of the house is very nice.

456
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,220
[Hyatt Regency]

457
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:06,547
Is it delicious?

458
00:37:06,547 --> 00:37:08,940
Yes.

459
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,740
Thanks for buying it for me.

460
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,140
It's a reward for helping me that day.

461
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:19,320
If it weren't for you, I would be living with stray dogs.

462
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,980
Thank you.

463
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,660
So, have you talked it over with P'Sira?

464
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,905
Did you make up with each other?

465
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:32,460
Yes, we did. He's like a docile cat now.

466
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,800
Sloppy woman.

467
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:31,820
You sneezed. You must be sick.

468
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,980
Maybe someone cursed me behind my back.

469
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,297
What are you doing?

470
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,560
Didn't I tell you?

471
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,960
If you want to live in my house, you have to follow my rules.

472
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,160
You have so many rules. I don't have time to remember them.

473
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,600
Okay. Okay, I'll try to follow your rules.

474
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,440
But I'm very sleepy today. I'm going to bed first.

475
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,520
You are not qualified to go to sleep!

476
00:39:28,286 --> 00:39:31,860
You must clean up your things.

477
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:36,546
And then clean all the rooms.

478
00:39:36,546 --> 00:39:39,758
Clean all the rooms?

479
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:42,500
Why don't you get a housekeeper?

480
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,260
Why?

481
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,730
You messed up my house.

482
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,200
You must take responsibility for it.

483
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,740
You put your luggage in the middle of my room.

484
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,260
You threw the bath towel on the TV. You threw your clothes on the couch.

485
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,480
And your shoes. Who allowed you to put them in the middle of the room?

486
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,625
And those unwashed dishes.

487
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,220
Go there. Go there. Go there.

488
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,600
Restore my room to its original state now.

489
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,200
What if I don't do it?

490
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,600
Then I will let you move out.

491
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,860
I warned you. If you're going to live here,

492
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,500
you have to follow my rules.

493
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,220
If I move out,

494
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,160
who will help you bring your brother back to work?

495
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,860
I don't understand what you're talking about.

496
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,760
Come on.

497
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,720
Mr. Vice Chairman, you really don't understand?

498
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,400
I know what you are up to.

499
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,300
You sent someone to look into me and Din.

500
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,000
When you learned that Din liked me,

501
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,320
you wanted to use me to lure Din back to work.

502
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,180
Okay. I admit it.

503
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,860
That's what I planned at the beginning.

504
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,526
But Din talked to me today.

505
00:41:29,526 --> 00:41:32,893
He told me that you rejected him.

506
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:36,360
So, you have nothing to do with Din.

507
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,100
Am I right?

508
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,960
- But─
- Whether you work for GU or not,

509
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,545
it doesn't make any difference to Din.

510
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,980
Now, clean up my room properly.

511
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,700
Do you think I'm afraid of your threats?

512
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,480
Let me see.

513
00:42:23,346 --> 00:42:25,580
- There are stains.
- What?

514
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,420
Re-wash it.

515
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,460
What stains?

516
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,940
Clean it up.

517
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,620
Okay. I'll clean it up.

518
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,860
If I wash it again, I can buy a lottery ticket.

519
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,133
Do you know the winning numbers?

520
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:16,340
- Pass.
- Pass?

521
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,080
Yes! I passed.

522
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,220
Hooray!

523
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,460
I passed.

524
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,150
Yes.

525
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,080
My body is sore.

526
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,080
Hey, you.

527
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,620
How can you lie on the couch like that?

528
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,240
You're all sweaty.

529
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,240
And your slippers are dirty.

530
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,640
Clean everything up again.

531
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,260
Now.

532
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,680
Clean everything up again.

533
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,960
No, I'm tired.

534
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,940
I'll check it out later.

535
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,040
You cleaned it up.

536
00:45:01,313 --> 00:45:04,040
What happened, P'Kanghan?

537
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,620
What's wrong with you?

538
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,520
I just finished cleaning.

539
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,820
My boyfriend is very clean.

540
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,260
He asked me to clean alone.

541
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,938
Alone?

542
00:45:20,313 --> 00:45:23,033
Why are you so cruel to P'Kanghan?

543
00:45:27,939 --> 00:45:29,639
What?

544
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,740
She messed it up. She should be responsible for it.

545
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,720
Don't use responsibility as an excuse.

546
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,580
I think you should take good care of P'Kanghan

547
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,380
and do your duty as her boyfriend

548
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,540
instead of bossing her like this.

549
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,160
Nannam, it's okay. I can stand it.

550
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,720
I can do anything.

551
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,340
As long as he's happy, I can bear it.

552
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,860
Hey, you. You're exaggerating.

553
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,540
I'm sorry. Don't be mad at me.

554
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,046
Get your hands off me.

555
00:45:59,046 --> 00:46:00,846
Your hands are dirty.

556
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,026
P'Kanghan,

557
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:07,827
I'll take out the garbage for you now.

558
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,980
Thank you so much.

559
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,180
You're good at unleashing charm.

560
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,480
Watch yourself.

561
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,020
Don't be fascinated by me.

562
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,260
Thank you so much.

563
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,960
No worries.

564
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,570
It's tiring to do housework.

565
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,480
Would you like some milk?

566
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,620
Thank you. But I...

567
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,080
I don't like milk.

568
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:32,470
I want to order a pizza. Do you want to eat it?

569
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,773
No.

570
00:47:33,773 --> 00:47:35,373
Okay.

571
00:47:37,073 --> 00:47:39,113
Can I use your phone?

572
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,300
Haven't you bought a phone yet?

573
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,280
I don't have the money to buy it.

574

My credit and bank cards aren't ready yet.

575
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,460
If you eat pizza and mess up my room,

576
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,740
If you eat pizza and mess up my room,

577
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:01,100
you must clean it again. All the rooms.

578
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,800
It's all right. I won't eat it.

579
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,620
You're not allowed to make noise.

580
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,380
Do you understand?

581
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,220
If I had known, I would have ordered a pizza.

582
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,990
I'm so hungry.

583
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,660
I'm so hungry.

584
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,000
I think it's clean.

585
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,460
Is that okay?

586
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,140
This is my home.

587
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,760
I set the standard for cleanliness, not you.

588
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,600
But your cleanliness standard

589
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,060
is non-human.

590
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,220
If my cleanliness standard is non-human,

591
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:12,760
then your dirtiness is also non-human.

592
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,460
You're a woman,

593
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,820
but you are untidy.

594
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:20,720
What? I have my own way of cleanliness.

595
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,380
You're the one who's not normal.

596
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,920
You have a cleanliness issue and a lying issue.

597
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,860
Do you know how miserable the people around you are?

598
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,660
You made my house so dirty.

599
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,320
Who are you to lecture me?

600
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,240
You are dirty outside.

601
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,480
Are you also dirty inside?

602
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,820
Hey, you!

603
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,360
Do you think it's right for you to have a cleanliness issue?

604
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,860
Seriously, you must have a psychological problem.

605
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,880
That's why you're more afraid of getting dirty than others.

606
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,300
Do you want to see a doctor?

607
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,360
Check to see if there's anything wrong with you.

608
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,060
I've only been living with you for one day,

609
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,960
and you're driving me crazy.

610

It's good that you live alone.

If you lived with your parents,

612

they'd be driven crazy by you like I am.

Yes.

00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,140
♫ I want to have you ♫

647
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,040
♫ Only you ♫

648
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,460
♫ My inner voice says I love you with all my heart ♫

649
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:37,340
♫ My inner voice says I love you with all my heart ♫

650
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:40,020
♫ The more I force myself not to waver,  ♫

651
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,100
♫ The more I lose to you in every way ♫

652
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:47,860
♫ Can I have you by my side? ♫

653
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:53,320
♫ Just wanna be with you ♫
