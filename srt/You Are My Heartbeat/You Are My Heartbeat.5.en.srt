You took her home and put her to sleep.

It's much better than letting her sleep on the side of the road.

But if she stays in the water like this all night,

she may get pneumonia, get a virus, or get a fever.

Why didn't you make it clear at the beginning?

159
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,400
Then we wouldn't have these problems.

160
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,739
You're still asking "why?"

161
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:16,740
Now that you know you're wrong,

162
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,740
is it that hard for you to apologize?

163
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,380
Why are you talking about something else?

164
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,810
Sorry.

165
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,150
Is that it?

166
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,940
You missed a word.

167
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,960
What word?

168
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,570
What should you say when someone helps you?

169
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,120
Thank... you.

170
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,450
What?

171
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,580
Thank you.

172
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,698
Where are my clothes?

173
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:03,180
I asked the housekeeper to wash them.

174
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,400
There. Your suitcase is there.

175
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,700
Get dressed and meet me in the living room.

176
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,560
I have something important to talk to you.

177
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,300
Put my belts away. They're expensive.

178
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,030
What's wrong with you?

179
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,930
Is that the important thing you wanted to talk to me about?

180
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,490
Yes.

181
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,220
Isn't that important?

182
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,540
GU Center is a famous mall for others. Everybody wants to work there.

183
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,500
But for me,

184
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,190
it's just a normal mall.

185
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,460
I don't think so.

186
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,100
You also want to work at GU.

187
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,540
You turned down my offer because you were afraid.

188
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,306
What am I afraid of?

189
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:02,130
There's nothing in GU I can be afraid of.

190
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,080
May I ask you something?

191
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,460
Do you know what my relationship is...

192
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,070
with Din?

193
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,243
I'm sorry. Din and I are not close enough

194
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:24,000
to know who he was a couple with.

195
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,180
We're not a couple.

196
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,840
I am Din's brother.

197
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,709
But I'm not his biological brother.

198
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:39,010
I know how Din feels about you.

199
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,512
I don't care how he feels about me.

200
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:46,040
As far as I know, I have nothing to do with him.

201
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,820
If there's nothing between you and him, come to work for GU.

202
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,650
No.

203
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,040
I don't want people to point their fingers at me and say,

204
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,020
"She says she doesn't care about it, but she still follows rich people."

205
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,420
That's all you want to talk to me about?

206
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,810
Are you talking about the chairwoman?

207
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,186
If you don't want the chairwoman to look down on you,

208
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:17,150
you shouldn't run away again.

209
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,040
You should let her know that you're not pestering Din.

210
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:26,640
Because you are very capable,

211
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,650
you don't need to rely on anyone.

212
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,440
This is your chance to prove yourself

213
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,730
and to prove that you didn't plagiarize someone else's design.

214
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,460
If I can prove I didn't plagiarize her design...

215
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,460
but she copied mine,

216
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,820
will you put aside your pride and fire her?

217
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,860
If there's something bad,

218
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,250
I'll clear it in time.

219
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,830
Really, Khun Hom?

220
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,140
You!

221
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,910
- Sorry.
- Be careful. My clothes are─

222
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,940
It's you.

223
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,500
A small part of your clothes is dirty.

224
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,510
As a designer, you must have a solution.

225
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,220
I don't think you know how to solve it, right? Because you copied someone else's design.

226
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,260
What a small world!

227
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,540
There are many coffee shops, but I ran into you at this one.

228
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,100
No, it's not because it's a small world.

229
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,530
It's because you will pay for what you did to me.

230
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,780
Well, I'll call you back.

231
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,000
You don't have to hang up.

232
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,430
I know you're talking to Hom.

233
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,100
Where are you going─

234
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,360
with your suitcase?

235
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,260
Are you going back to wander abroad?

236
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,140
You'll be very anxious if I go back abroad.

237
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,193
If I'm not here, whose design are you going to plagiarize ?

238
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:21,380
You're stupid. I don't think you can design it yourself.

239
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:25,560
If I'm stupid, you're more stupid,

240
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,799
because you gave me the chance to plagiarize your design.

241
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,910
You finally admitted it, didn't you?

242
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,770
What did I just say?

243
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,600
Those are empty words. They're useless.

244
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,380
It's not like what you did.

245
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,980
You copied my design. And I have proof.

246
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,340
Empty words can't hurt me.

247
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,240
Are you sure you want to provoke me like this?

248
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,940
You have no idea how many people I've met worse than you.

249
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,180
Are you going to do something to me?

250
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,480
I can't tell you.

251
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,600
Just wait and see.

252
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,100
You'd better tell your relatives what you like to eat.

253
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,350
So that they can bring them to your grave.

254
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,630
I'll leave.

255
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,970
Coward.

256
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,240
That will be ฿180 ($5.60).

257
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,710
Okay.

258
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,360
Wait a second.

259
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,880
Okay.

260
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,693
Hello.

261
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:11,380
Khun.

262
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
How did you call here?

263
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,980
I called the mall and asked them to transfer it to you.

264
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,720
Don't ask any questions, okay?

265
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,180
I borrowed a waiter's phone to call you.

266
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,540
Last night, did you see my wallet, phone, and passport?

267
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,380
I saw nothing but you covered in germs.

268
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,600
That's it. I have to go back to work.

269
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,940
By the way, remember to consider my advice.

270
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,880
Thank you.

271
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,040
You're welcome. It's my pleasure.

272
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,340
No one found any wallets last night.

273
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,920
Did anyone see that?

274
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,460
Please think it over.

275
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,680
Think where you left it.

276
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,880
Could it be...

[Postcode: 10260]

278
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,280
Khun Kheetika, are you okay?

279
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,980
Oh, your stuff is all over the place.

280
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,980
Help.

281
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,520
- My suitcase got hit by a car and flew here.
- Wait.

282
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,780
My suitcase is dead!

283
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,740
It's here. Here.

284
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,700
Passport.

285
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:01,140
Where is it?

286
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:06,200
Where is my wallet, bank card, and credit card?

287
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,220
Is God testing me?

288
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,420
Come on. Test me! I won't give up.

289
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,500
I've been through worse.

290
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,243
It's just a little problem.

291
00:24:27,243 --> 00:24:29,500
I'll find a way out.

293
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,960
Sorry. My son was swinging the toy bag

294

- and it accidentally slipped out of his hand.
- It's all right.

295
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,340
- Son, apologize to the young lady.
- Sorry.

296
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,760
Hold it tight, son. So you don't swing it and hit someone else's head again.

297
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,980
Okay. Let's go.

00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,480
Yes, Khun Sira.

302
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,560
Make me another cup of coffee.

303
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,300
More coffee?

304
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,540
You've had three cups of coffee since the meeting.

305
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,680
I think you're tired.

306

I don't think you slept well last night.

307

Let's postpone the meeting to this afternoon.

308

We'll have the meeting this afternoon.

309
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,260
Okay.

310
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,040
We'll come back for the meeting at 1:00 p.m.

Okay.

314
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,920
You really don't know what Khun Sira did last night?

315
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,840
He looks so tired.

316
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,160
And he was late in the morning. He came just before the meeting.

317
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,260
And he didn't check if the employees were properly dressed.

318
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,680
I called him last night, and he didn't answer.

319
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,120
It couldn't be that he fell asleep and didn't hear the phone ring.

320
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,520
Maybe he was doing something and couldn't answer the phone.

321
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,860
What was he doing?

322
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,060
What would Khun Sira do?

323
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,300
He's a bachelor, isn't he?

324
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,700
What if he was not alone?

325
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,100
He was with a drunk person.

326
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,180
A drunk person? Who?

327
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,280
Who was drunk?

328
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,440
Could it be...

329
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,180
That's not true!

330
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,440
- No way!
- What?

331
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,380
What? What's wrong?

332
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,980
Maha.

333
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,660
Come back and clarify it.

334
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,660
I want to know.

335
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,500
Who was drunk?

336
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,320
Khun Sira.

337
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,460
Khun Sira.

338
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,340
Khun Sira!

339
00:27:42,873 --> 00:27:48,387
Well, Khun Sira, which hotel did you drop Khun Kheetika off at last night?

340
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,100
It's great that you mentioned it. So I can make it clear to you.

341
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,460
You left me last night.

342
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,260
Do you know what happened next?

343
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,780
What happened?

344
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,280
You left that woman with me.

345
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,140
I didn't sleep all night.

346
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,100
You didn't sleep all night?

347
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,120
Gosh.

348
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,100
My whole body is sore.

349
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,860
I had to do something that I had never done to other women.

350
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,920
Do you know how tired I was?

351
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:29,140
Don't tell me that Khun Kheetika and you slept together or something...

352
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,540
last night.

353
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,340
Maha!

354
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,080
I'm telling you. I didn't do the things you said.

355
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,900
You can stop thinking.

356
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,240
What did you do then?

357
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,620
You are tired. Your body is sore.

358
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,000
And you did something you had never done with other women.

359
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:57,940
I'm tired because I didn't sleep last night.

360
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,260
I had to take care of Kheetika.

361
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,780
I did something I had never done with other women because I had...

362
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,140
to wipe her face and take care of her.

363
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:21,325
Really?

364
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,560
I never lie.

365
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,359
Hold on. I'll answer the phone for you.

366
00:29:35,713 --> 00:29:37,173
Hello.

367
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:39,680
What?

368
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,160
Who wants to see Khun Sira?

369
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,780
Khun Kheetika, Khun Sira wants you to wait here for a moment.

370
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,640
He's coming down.

371
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,280
Thank you.

372
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:09,103
Pimthong, is she the woman who copied our company's design?

373
00:30:09,103 --> 00:30:12,600
Yes, it's her. She's Kheetika.

374
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,180
Keep an eye on her.

375
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,820
We can't let her into our mall office.

376
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,200
In case she will plagiarize our designs again.

377
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,220
What do you want to see me about?

378
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,940
You make it sound like we're strangers.

379
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,918
We stayed together all night. Aren't we close enough?

380
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,540
All night.

381
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,066
Please watch your language before you speak.

382
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:09,840
Your words could get me in trouble.

383
00:31:09,846 --> 00:31:12,813
I'm just kidding.

384
00:31:12,813 --> 00:31:14,973
Do you have to be so serious?

385
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,060
I came to talk about your offer.

386
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,600
Are you serious about that?

387
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,820
Assistant of the Design Department? Isn't this position too low, Mr. Vice Chairman?

388
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,040
What position do you want?

389
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,714
Head of the Design Department of the New Look website.

390
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:46,999
The Design Department is a core department of the website.

391
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,977
It's crucial.

392
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:53,693
I'm not sure about putting you in such an important position.

393
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:57,632
So, I can't offer you that position.

394
00:31:58,346 --> 00:32:02,080
Then I will refuse your offer.

395
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,800
But an assistant in the Design Department

396
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,720
is no different from the head of the Design Department.

397
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,040
Because you will have the right to decide on all GU's designs.

398
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,285
It's a special position.

399
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,780
What do you mean by that?

400
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,480
In addition to being an assistant in the Design Department,

401
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,000
you will also be my assistant.

402
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,680
Can you hear them?

403
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,480
No.

404
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,160
It's too far.

405
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,306
I can't see them either.

406
00:32:34,306 --> 00:32:36,151
What are they talking about?

407
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:08,280
Rossarin,

408
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,253
your eyes...

409
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,940
Do you like them?

410
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:16,860
You have some sleep crust in your eyes.

411
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,160
Maha

412
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,240
What's wrong with you?

413
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,910
I told you that you have sleep crust. Just wipe it off.

414
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,680
What's wrong with you?

415
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,660
Don't you want to see it, Rossarin?

416
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,626
No.

417
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,380
Do you need any help?

418
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,885
No!

419
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,380
What?

420
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,960
You look hesitant.

421
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,700
Are you afraid to work with me?

422
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,960
I'm not afraid.

423
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,160
I'm just wondering

424
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,100
how much I should ask for to be your assistant.

425
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,700
After all, I'll work with you, a strange guy.

426
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,960
You always talk about money.

427
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,760
Of course.

428
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,160
Because it's something important to me.

429
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,680
Okay. How much salary do you want?

430
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,900
If it's acceptable, you can sign the contract tomorrow.

431
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,700
But if you plagiarize someone else's design or lie while working here,

432
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,300
I will fire you immediately.

433
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,620
And you won't get severance pay.

434
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,940
Okay, Mr. Vice Chairman.

435
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,260
You may leave.

436
00:34:34,392 --> 00:34:35,712
Wait.

437
00:34:35,712 --> 00:34:37,985
There's something I need to talk to you about.

438
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,980
That's...

439
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,080
The day I got drunk, and you took me home,

440
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,820
you collected my stuff. Right?

441
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,000
Yes.

442
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,140
Because all your stuff fell out.

443
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,860
Then you must be responsible for me.

444
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,160
You lost my wallet.

445
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,220
You lost my credit card and bank card.

446
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,760
I have no money now.

447
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,940
You were drunk, and you lost them yourself.

448
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,980
But you collected my stuff.

449
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,610
Okay.

450
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,280
I can give you a chance to make it up.

451
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,880
You lost my wallet.

452
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,600
You can advance to me a month's salary.

453
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,800
You haven't started working yet.

454
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,020
Are you asking me to give you an advance on your salary?

455
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,700
Because I have no money.

456
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,560
And it takes time to apply for new cards.

457
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,140
And I'm going to work here.

458
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,400
I need to pay for transportation, food, and rent.

459
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,420
How do I know you won't run away with the money?

460
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm not unfaithful.

461
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,820
But ever since I met you, you've been lying.

462
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,360
I'm not wrong to think so.

463
00:35:54,898 --> 00:35:57,858
Okay. All right.

464
00:35:57,858 --> 00:36:00,500
If you don't give me an advance,

465
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,220
then I'll stay in your office.

466
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,640
It's not bad. I don't need to pay for transportation or rent.

467
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,780
And I'll eat in your office.

468
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,260
No. Get up.

469
00:36:18,112 --> 00:36:22,680
Then give me an advance.

470
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:29,147
Okay. If you want an advance,

471
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,800
I'll lend you my money.

472
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:34,846
As for accommodation,

473
00:36:34,846 --> 00:36:38,400
you must live in the place I arrange for you.

474
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,085
Why?

475
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,020
To prove that you won't run away with my money.

476
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:50,692
Okay. Deal.

477
00:36:51,965 --> 00:36:53,465
Get up.

478
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,673
What's wrong with you?

479
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,740
Khun Kheetika, please come in.

480
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,100
My room is a bit small.

481
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,606
Khun Kheetika, you are okay with it. Right?

482
00:37:47,606 --> 00:37:49,640
It's okay.

483
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,560
[Salary]

484
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,820
I'm forgetful. So, I need to write things down.

485
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,700
You may see notes everywhere.
[Don't forget to turn off the lights]
[Don't eat spicy food more than twice a day]

486
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,300
Khun Kheetika, don't worry about it.
[Don't forget to turn off the water.]

487
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,440
[No more than two spoonfuls of sugar a day.]
[Order the meal on the 12th floor.]

488
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,780
Just call me Kanghan.

489
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,020
My nickname is Kanghan.

490
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,780
It's a lovely name.

491
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,420
Khun Kanghan.

492
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,140
Just call me Kanghan.

493
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,240
No.

494
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,300
You're Khun Sira's personal assistant.

495
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,780
He had never hired a personal assistant so easily.

496
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,700
It proves that you're good and capable.

497
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,660
Maybe I should call you Khun Kheetika like I used to.

498
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:40,560
Okay. Whatever you like.

499
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,140
Thank you for letting me stay here.

500
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:49,133
I've called my friends in Italy and asked them to help with my credit card.

501
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:50,593
Because...

502
00:38:50,593 --> 00:38:52,160
Because I just came back.

503
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,240
My bank cards were issued by banks in Italy.

504
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,260
I'll try not to trouble you.

505
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,640
It's okay.

506
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,100
Khun Kheetika, make yourself at home.

507
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,180
My room is a bit small.

508
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,480
It may be stuffy.

509
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,420
But the advantage of a small room is that it cools quickly and saves energy.

510
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,380
Okay.

511
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,620
You can put your clothes in the closet.

512
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,820
I'll free up the left side of the closet for you later.

513
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,560
But we might have to share a bed.

514
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,420
Khun Kheetika, you don't mind. Right?

515
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,700
Khun Rossarin, you sleep on the bed.

516
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,580
I'll sleep on the couch.

517
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,120
No.

518
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,060
Khun Kheetika, we'd better share the bed. That's the perfect solution.

519
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,300
If you want to eat anything or want to use anything,

520
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,500
help yourself.

521
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,260
I'm not worried, and I don't mind.

522
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,300
Okay.

523
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,780
[No sodas. Only drink coffee in the company.]
[No more than two spoonfuls of sugar a day.]

524
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,100
Khun Rossarin, are you sure

525
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,700
it won't be a problem for you if I live with you?

526
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,140
Because I'm trying to lose weight, I am dieting.

527
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,640
It has nothing to do with expenses.

528
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,960
Khun Kheetika, don't worry. Just stay here.

529
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,660
You living with me is not a problem for me.

530
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,700
I'll be in trouble if you don't live with me.

531
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,420
Do you want Khun Kheetika to live in my house?

532
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,500
Yes.

533
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,500
I want you to keep an eye on Kheetika for me.

534
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:29,858
Why do you want me to keep an eye on her?

535
00:40:31,006 --> 00:40:32,931
Could it be

536
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:38,040
that the rumor between you and Khun Kheetika is true?

537
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,990
I feel like I'm falling out of love.

538
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,900
You're exaggerating, Khun Rossarin.

539
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,180
Are you kidding me, Rossarin?

540
00:40:44,946 --> 00:40:46,210
No.

541
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,480
Well, Maha told me that. And I believed him.

542
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,500
But I already told Maha

543
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,738
that Khun Sira wouldn't have an affair with someone who copied GU's design.

544
00:40:55,738 --> 00:40:58,525
Rossarin, it's nice of you to think so.

545
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:01,380
Kheetika is fighting a plagiarism lawsuit.

546
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,192
That's why I want you to keep an eye on her.

547
00:41:04,192 --> 00:41:07,060
I want to know her true self.

548
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,220
What do you mean by that?

549
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,253
Nothing. Are you hungry?

550
00:41:14,253 --> 00:41:15,500
No.

551
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,060
I'll make some sandwiches.

552
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,060
Khun Kheetika, why don't you take a shower first?

553
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,120
You can eat it after you take a shower.

554
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,220
There is shampoo and a soap with a bear pattern in the bathroom.

555
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
You can use them.

556
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,360
You can use as much as you want.

557
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,420
Okay.

558
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,958
Sandwich.

559
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,180
[No perfume after bathing.]
[Go to the perfume department before work.]

560
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,900
[Go to the bathroom before going home.]
[Bring the cleanser to the office to wash face.]

561
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,500
[Save water.]
[Don't go to the bathroom unless you have to.]

562
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:42,340
So far, I haven't noticed any unusual behavior.

563
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,820
But don't worry, Mr. Vice Chairman.

564
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,680
I promise to do this job well.

565
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,280
I'll keep an eye on Khun Kheetika.

566
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,470
Then I'll report back to you.

567
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,419
Okay.

568
00:42:55,419 --> 00:42:57,240
Bye.

569
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,760
Done.

570
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,100
Khun Kheetika, how long have you been standing there?

571
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,820
We need to talk, Khun Rossarin.

572
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,060
Okay.

573
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,639
You're back, Boss.

574
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,505
What are you doing here?

575
00:43:33,505 --> 00:43:35,153
I came to live with you.

576
00:43:35,153 --> 00:43:37,505
How can you live with me? I asked you to live with Rossarin.

577
00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:40,080
It's a waste of time to live with Rossarin.

578
00:43:42,113 --> 00:43:44,516
You want to know my true self, don't you?

579
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:47,820
- Who told you that?
- It doesn't matter.

580
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,160
I'm right, am I?

581
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,200
I'd like to live with you.

582
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,180
So you can see me from the time you get up to the time you go to sleep.

583
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,580
So you can see every detail of my life.

584
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,320
You don't have to let Khun Rossarin keep an eye on me.

585
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,340
What are you going to do?

586
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,000
- Back off.
- No.

587
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,220
- I'm going in.
- Let Go!

588
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,940
- No.
- Get out.

589
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,780
- Get out of my house.
- No. No.

590
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,580
No.

591
00:44:25,493 --> 00:44:28,500
- You're not going out, are you?
- No.

592
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,400
My clothes.

593
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,360
I've never seen a crazy woman like her.

594
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,560
It would be embarrassing if I went back to Khun Rossarin now.

595
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,660
What should I do?

596
00:46:25,347 --> 00:46:27,167
Excuse me.

597
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,040
Can I help you?

598
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,640
It's you. Ms. Drunkard.

599
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,620
Ms. Drunkard?

600
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,940
I think you got the wrong person.

601
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,940
No, I didn't.

602
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,720
I saw you and P'Sira last night, right?

603
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,800
You were really drunk, and you took off your...

604
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,780
What?

605
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,980
You took off your...

606
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,040
You took off your shoes and threw them around.

607
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,220
Speaking of that, why are you sitting here and not going in?

608
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,060
Well...

609
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,740
Is your boyfriend, P'Sira, not back yet?

610
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,920
So you can't get in.

611
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,600
Boyfriend?

612
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,500
Oh, yes.

613
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,840
He's back.

614
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,180
But he's mad at me. So he

615
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,400
kicked me out.

616
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,780
Did you have a fight?

617
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,380
Yes.

618
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,140
I don't understand why he's angry.

619
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,440
I tried to ask, but he wouldn't say.

620
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,660
Is he angry because you were drunk last night?

621
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,900
He's angry about that?

622
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,740
I really don't know.

623
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,700
Sloppy woman.

624
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,660
What can I do for you?

625
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:24,140
It's not about me.

626
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,920
It's about your girlfriend.

627
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,020
She wants to explain herself to you.

628
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,900
My girlfriend?

629
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,580
Hi.

630
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,560
What are you doing?

631
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,260
You should talk it over.

632
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:44,720
Your girlfriend won't be safe if you kick her out.

633
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,940
I think you got this wrong.

634
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,200
- She's not─
- Sorry. I was drunk last night.

635
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,960
I didn't mean it. I was really unhappy, so I went to drink.

636
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,440
You don't have to make excuses.

637
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,000
I wasn't as drunk as you when I wasn't happy.

638
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,580
Everyone has a different way of dealing with problems.

639
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,420
Okay. It's not good to drink.

640
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,140
But you should talk it over.

641
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,000
I don't think it's a good solution

642
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,400
to kick your girlfriend out at night.

643
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,620
I think... I think you got this wrong.

644
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,165
There's nothing between me and her.

645
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,900
If there's nothing between us,

646
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,860
why did you bring me here last night?

647
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:41,200
Do you think I'm an easy girl that you can bring here whenever you want?

648
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,300
What are you talking about?

649
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,380
Don't worry, Miss.

650
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:50,120
If he doesn't want to talk it over with you or kick you out again,

651
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,460
I'll testify for you that he brought you here last night.

652
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:59,360
Thank you for helping me maintain my dignity as a woman.

653
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,960
It's all right.

654
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,620
What are you going to do?

655
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,000
Are we going to talk it over tonight?

656
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,680
What kind of woman are you?

657
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,900
You lied to him and said you were my girlfriend.

658
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,100
I didn't say that.

659
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,680
You didn't say that?

660
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,480
Then why did he think you were my girlfriend?

661
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,980
Right.

662
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,940
How could he think that?

663
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:45,160
I carried you in because you were drunk.

664
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,160
You should explain it to him.

665
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,220
It's all right. Let him think so.

666
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:55,020
Anyway, I'm going to live with you for a while.

667
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,680
Who agreed to let you live here?

668
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,460
I asked you to live with Rossarin.

669
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,820
You want to know me, don't you?

670
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,640
You're afraid I'll run away and not go to work.

671
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,000
So, I'm moving in with you.

672
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,580
So you can see me all the time.

673
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,180
What are you talking about? Are you thinking too much?

674
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:19,180
You're a woman.

675
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:23,500
- How can you live with a man?
- Don't worry about it.

676
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,480
When I was abroad, I lived with my male friends. I was safe.

677
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:32,330
Not to mention that I'm going to live with you.

678
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,200
You have nothing to be afraid of.

679
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,180
It's very contemptuous of you...

680
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:45,520
to say that.

681
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,360
See?

682
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:59,400
It's so easy to deal with a man like you.

683
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,820
Sloppy.

684
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,840
There's no way I'll let you live here.

685
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:09,060
You. You'd better let me live here.

686
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,860
Otherwise,

687
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,880
I won't work for you.

688
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,260
You're talking like you think you are someone important.

689
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,420
Khun Kheetika.

690
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,580
If I'm not relevant,

691
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:28,960
why did you, a man of position, offer me the job?

692
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,820
The reason I offered you the job─

693
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,500
Don't say that you wanted me to prove myself.

694
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,780
Because I've thought about it.

695
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:41,920
Even if I can prove whether I plagiarized or not, it won't bother you. Right?

696
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:47,460
But you will have trouble...

697
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,740
if you offer me, who has a history of plagiarism, the job.

698
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,080
Well.

699
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,100
You are a businessman.

700
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,180
You weigh the pros and cons before you make decisions.

701
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,860
You won't make money-losing decisions.

702
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,860
Don't tell me that you offered me the job because I'm a good designer.

703
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:09,060
There's no doubt that GU would find a better designer than me.

704
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,700
I don't know what you want.

705
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:20,340
But you must want something from me.

706
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,820
So,

707
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,400
you'd better let me live here.

708
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,420
Otherwise, I'm not going to work at GU Center.

[You Are My Heartbeat]

710
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:46,740
[Preview]
From now on, Khun Kheetika is Khun Sira's special assistant.

711
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,980
She will be responsible for the Design Department.

712
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,500
What does that mean?

713
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,540
It means I'll be the head of the Design Department.

714
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,040
Where do you live now?

715
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,780
I live with a friend.

716
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,980
Tell me your address. Maybe I'll stop by and visit you someday.

717
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,860
I've only been living with you for one day,

718
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,720
and you're driving me crazy.

719
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,500
It's good that you live alone.

720
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,040
If you lived with your parents,

721
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,111
they'd have been driven crazy by you like I am.

[Behind the scenes]

723
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,780
Help.

724
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,380
Stop!

725
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,100
Let go! Let go of me.

726
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,500
Mine's gone.

727
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,800
Cut!

728
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,280
And he was late in the morning.

729
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,900
He went to the conference room as soon as he came.

730
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,980
And he didn't check...

731
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,740
It's all right.

OST: Jackie Jackrin - "Let's End This"

733
00:54:54,080 --> 00:55:01,360
♫ I never loved anyone before ♫

734
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:09,420
♫ Until I met you, the one my heart was looking for ♫

735
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:15,900
♫ But Heaven must have made us meet, even though it was just a dream ♫

♫ After waking up, it all disappeared ♫

♫ If this love has to hurt ♫

738
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,920
♫ I will keep it all to myself ♫

739
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:37,220
♫ Since you deserve to be with that someone who is perfect for you ♫

740
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:40,960
♫ Let it be me who suffers ♫

741

♫ And be the one who ends this love ♫

742

♫ But it's all worth it ♫

♫ Because I have finally learned what it's like to love ♫
