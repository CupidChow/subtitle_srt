I will never let you hurt me again.

160
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,220
If you hurt my family,

161
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,560
I'll ruin everything you have

162
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,420
and let you live a miserable life.

163
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,020
- Maha.
- Yes?

164
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,460
Get the key to open the door.

165
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,560
Okay.

166
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,480
What can you do to hurt me?

167
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,120
Tell me. What can you do to me?

168
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,460
What do you want to do?

169
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:44,990
I want you to know what it's like...

170
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,410
to be misunderstood.

171
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,380
Here's the key, Khun Sira.

172
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,080
Open the door.

173
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,120
It's opened. It's opened.

174
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,070
Okay.

175
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,810
Go. Hurry.

176
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,960
Go.

177
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,040
Grandma, when will you stop hurting Kanghan?

178
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,080
I didn't do anything.

179
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,820
Look at Kanghan. How can you deny doing anything?

180
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,660
Enough, Din.

181
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,658
She really didn't hurt me.

182
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,380
You don't have to speak for my grandma.

183
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,640
I believe what I see.

184
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Let's go, Kanghan.

185
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,980
Din,

186
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,540
I can't go with you.

187
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,932
Otherwise, the chairwoman will be angry with me again.

188
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,840
I don't want this to happen again.

189
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,893
The chairwoman didn't do anything to you, did she?

190
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,959
Do you believe what the chairwoman said?

191
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,500
Yes.

192
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,580
I know the chairwoman well. She's straightforward.

193
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,760
If she did, she would admit it.

194
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,460
I just wanted her to know

195
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,850
that I wouldn't sit back if she hurt my mom.

196
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,471
What did the chairwoman do to your mother?

197
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,520
If you want to know, go and ask her.

198
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,225
If the chairwoman did something to your mom,

199
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,360
I apologize for the chairwoman.

200
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,900
Please forgive her.

201
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,320
If I went to the chairwoman

202
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,800
and said something that irritated her and she almost died,

203
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,640
would you forgive me?

204
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,240
Kanghan.

205
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,440
Your apology is useless.

206
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,160
I don't want to hear it from other people.

207
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,038
I want to hear it from the person who hurt my mom.

208
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,560
Hello, P'Sira.

209

Nannam,

210
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,380
is Kanghan back?

211
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,460
P'Kanghan went to stay at her mother's house.

212
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,500
Because her mother is sick.

213
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,600
She had a heart attack.

214
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,750
[How's your mother?]

215
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,370
[If you need my help, just tell me.]

[Sorry for making you unhappy today.]

217
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,410
Did you create problems for Khun Premyuda

218
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,418
when you went back to work this afternoon?

219
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,940
I didn't.

220
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,200
I listened to you.

221
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,260
What about Khun Sira and Khun Sasa?

222
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,360
I didn't.

223
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,900
Good.

224
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,000
Since Khun Premyuda cares about her grandsons,

225
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,480
we should stay away from them.

226
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
Okay.

227
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,360
Are you going to resign?

228
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,060
If... If you want to resign and go abroad,

229
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,560
Papop will help you find a job.

230
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,760
You can work in his friend's costume studio in New York.

231
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,240
I need some time to process my resignation.

232
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,300
I still have work to do.

233
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,340
What do you have to do?

234
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:29,740
I will represent GU in a design competition.

235
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,060
I don't want them to say I'm irresponsible behind my back.

- Aren't you answering your phone?
- It's okay.

238
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,820
It's okay, Mom.

239
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,160
In that case,

240
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,920
I'm going to bed.

241
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,220
Okay.

242
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,720
The person you dialed cannot be connected.

243
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,560
She turned it off.

244
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,360
Dear.

245
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,800
Why didn't you ask Metta to do it?

246
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,640
I'm fine. My blood pressure is a little high.

247
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,440
Sit down.

248
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,380
Well. Won't Kanghan eat with us?

249
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,640
I didn't ask about her because I was worried about her.

250
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,240
I just wanted to laugh about Khun Premyuda.

251
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,440
Kanghan went to work early in the morning, Khun Hom.

252
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,038
What about her resignation?

253
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,380
How's it going? What did Kanghan say?

254
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,460
She said she needed some time to deal with something.

255
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,040
Let me be frank.

256
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,580
I don't understand why Khun Premyuda is so worried about her grandsons.

257
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,700
She's been like that since her sons were alive.

258
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,560
Dad, do you know about her family?

259
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,020
Yes, a bit.

260
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,480
Khun Premyuda had two sons.

261
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,460
Her eldest son was kicked out of the house

262
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,860
and investigated and removed from the position of chairman.

263
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,920
Because he was dating a woman whom Khun Premyuda didn't like.

264
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,040
Khun Premyuda has been so mean since she was young?

265
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,380
If that's the case,

266
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,120

Here is a list of some of the people who have worked at GU and their resumes.

269
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:55,620
The range is from the time before the company changed its name from the Sunshine Group to GU.

I don't know what I'm going to talk to you about.

324
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:09,040
You don't know? Or do you not want to tell me?

325
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,820
You've picked up the lying habit from me.

326
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,420
Don't say I like to lie as much as you do.

327
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,220
We're different.

328
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,060
Brother, what happened?

329
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,359
Why did you transfer Kanghan?

330
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,800
Where were you yesterday? What's the reason for your late arrival at the office?

331
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,460
Don't change the subject to me.

332
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,040
Tell me what happened first.

333
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,433
I just wanted to solve the problem.

334
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:56,940
I would rather not have the chairwoman staring at us while Kanghan's around us.

335
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,940
As long as Kanghan is working here,

336
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,860
I think Grandma will never stop finding fault with Kanghan.

337
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,960
It's better than nothing.

338
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,060
Does Kanghan agree?

339
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,100
She looks all right.

340
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,640
Did you ask Kanghan what happened yesterday?

341
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,809
I asked her. But she didn't reply to my messages.

342
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,680
Yesterday, Maha told me...

343
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,880
that the chairwoman ran into Khun Parin.

344
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,380
When Khun Parin went home,

345
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,440
she had a heart attack.

346
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,540
Do you mean Grandma said something irritating to Paa Parin?

347
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,420
So she had a heart attack.

348
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,640
Did Kanghan tell you what Grandma said?

349
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,840
I don't know.

350
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,000
Why didn't you ask her?

351
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,120
Who should I ask about this?

352
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,860
What are you doing here?

353
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,300
- Do you have a moment?
- No. I'm working.

354
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,760
Hurry and finish your work. I want to talk to you.

355
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,020
But I don't want to talk to you.

356
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,500
It's over between us.

357
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,420
I'm not here to talk about us.

358
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,420
I want to talk to you about Kanghan.

359
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,840
Get out of my way.

360
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,079
No. Do you want to sit down and talk to me, or do you want me to force you?

361
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,320
Don't scare me.

362
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,180
I'm not.

363
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,793
Just sign the documents so you can talk to me.

364
00:27:26,793 --> 00:27:29,340
What are you doing?

365
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,620
I'm sitting on your lap and not letting you get up.

366
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,780
Are you crazy? Don't be such a baby.

367
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,480
Let's switch.

368
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,760
Sign them.

369
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,200
Do you want to work sitting on my lap?

370
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,620
Just sign them.

371
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,480
Hom,

372
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,800
do you know that Khun Parin ran into my grandmother?

373
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,540
I know.

374
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,860
Do you know what happened?

375
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,640
What did they talk about?

376
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,060
Your grandmother praised Khun Parin

377
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,640
and said that she educated me and Kanghan well.

378
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,258
Did my grandma praise her?

379
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:17,640
What did she say?

380
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,580
She said Khun Parin taught me how to hold on to a man.

381
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,840
Your grandmother looks down on people.

382
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,640
I don't think my grandmother did it on purpose.

383
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,620
- It's just─
- Just what?

384
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,060
I don't know.

385
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,740
But I promise my grandma didn't do it on purpose.

386
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,420
Whatever you think.

387
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,460
It's none of my business. I'm leaving.

388
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,400
Wait, Hom.

389
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,260
Well... Can I come to your house?

390
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,380
My house?

391
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,960
Why?

392
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,440
I want to apologize to Khun Paa Parin for my grandma.

393
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,620
No need.

394
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,640
If your grandmother finds out,

395
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,260
she will call me a cheeky woman

396
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,860
trying to seduce her grandson.

397
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,660
I won't let my grandma call you that.

398
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,860
You couldn't stop your grandmother from scolding your beloved Kanghan.

399
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,300
Who am I?

400
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,300
Will you speak for me?

401
00:29:25,135 --> 00:29:26,148
P'Kanghan.

402
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:28,660
Nannam.

403
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,626
Are you here to buy something?

404
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,860
I want to visit your mother today.

405
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,260
Okay.

406
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,060
But you don't have to take a gift.

407
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,560
It's okay.

408
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,340
[Sira: Thank you very much, Nannam.]

409
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,200
[Do you want me to tell P'Kanghan that you bought the gift?]

410
00:30:15,366 --> 00:30:17,180
- Let's go.
- Okay.

411
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,920
I... I want to apologize to you.

412
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,740
It's all because of me.

413
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,006
If I had explained Kanghan's matter to my grandmother,

414
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:38,673
things wouldn't have gotten to where they are today.

415
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:42,093
I don't want our two families to have a misunderstanding.

416
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:47,080
I think, actually,

417
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,860
our two families don't need to be friends.

418
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,640
But we're collaborating.

419
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,260
We are related, aren't we?

420
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,340
Do you mean that if you work with a company,

421
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,340
you have to be involved with his family? Or what?

422
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:10,540
Enough, Hom. Don't mix business and private matters.

423
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,180
I think it's enough for us to have friendly relations in terms of cooperation.

424
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,780
Yes.

425
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,900
- Are you all right?
- I'm sorry.

426
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,100
I got your clothes dirty.

427
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,840
It's okay.

428
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,506
What are you doing here, Dude?

429
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:31,840
His name is not Dude. His name is Nannam.

430
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,923
What are you doing here?

431
00:31:33,923 --> 00:31:40,580
Khun Sasa brought a bouquet of jasmine to apologize for his grandmother.

432
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,140
Why didn't she come and apologize in person?

433
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,220
My grandmother doesn't know about this.

434
00:31:46,132 --> 00:31:48,860
I wanted to apologize myself.

435
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,440
Kanghan, who is your companion?

436
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,060
This is Nannam. He's my friend.

437
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,760
Nannam, this is Khun Papop.

438
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,560
Nice to meet you.

439
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,440
I'm sorry. I got your clothes dirty.

440
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,020
No worries. It's okay.

441
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,660
Khun Paa, I heard you're not feeling well.

442
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,760
So I got you some fruit.

443
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,280
I hope you get well soon.

444
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,820
Mom, Nannam will stay for dinner.

445
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,220
I also want to stay for dinner.

446
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,620
I apologize for being rude, Khun Sasa.

447
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,600
Please go back.

448
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,580
I don't want your grandmother to bother my daughter and scold her again.

449
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,860
I'm truly sorry.

450
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:44,020
Khun Premyuda had two sons.

451
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,820
Khun Bonthai was her eldest son.

452
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,720
He was our chairman at the time.

453
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,300
But something happened to him.

454
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,340
What? What happened?

455
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:01,740
Khun Bonthai fell in love with a salesperson in the mall.

456
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,293
Khun Premyuda was angry.

457
00:33:04,293 --> 00:33:08,420
Because she thought Khun Bonthai had been tricked by that woman.

458
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,080
She ordered them to break up. Khun Bonthai was reluctant.

459
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,540
In the end, they eloped.

460
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,840
Then... do you know that woman's name?

461
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,840
I don't know.

462
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,700
But they said the woman had a child with Khun Bonthai.

463
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,840
They even had a child?

464
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,580
Was it a boy or a girl?

465
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:37,140
I don't know. That's what I've heard.

466
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,060
How long are you going to stay at home?

467
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,880
I'm going to stay two or three days to see how my mom is doing.

468
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,140
My dad said your mother asked you to quit. Is it true?

469
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,240
It's not bad.

470
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,660
So you can end this.

471
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,460
Don't worry. I won't let Khun Premyuda create problems for KKPP.

472
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,460
I'm not worried about KKPP.

473
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,760
I'm worried about you.

474
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,320
Because...

475
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:46,430
I'm afraid you'll go back abroad.

476
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,138
Oh. Okay.

477
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,140
You'd better not mess with Khun Premyuda's people.

478
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,980
Otherwise, your life will be ruined.

479
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,540
Didn't you go out with Din?

480
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,140
Did you see what happened?

481
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,140
Do you not care?

482
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,280
Are you jealous?

483
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,680
Speaking of that, you've been on good terms with Din lately.

484
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,620
I see you two hanging out a lot.

485
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,840
Yes, but... Din came to me because he wanted to get close to you.

486
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,140
No. No, it's not.

487
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:30,430
If Din likes someone, he doesn't use a middleman.

488
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,840
Are you going to tell Din how you feel about him?

489
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,040
It's not necessary.

490
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,140
Because I won't feel that way about him.

491
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,060
Let me ask you something.

492
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,040
Who do you love? Din and Khun Sira?

493
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,250
Din and I are friends.

494
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,570
I never wanted to be anything besides his friend.

495
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,840
What about Khun Sira?

496
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,660
- It's so delicious.
- It's very delicious.

497
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,260
- I love it.
- Yes.

498
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,360
- It's so delicious.
- It's delicious.

499
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,460
Hello, Ms. Chairwoman.

500
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:30,020
She scared me.

501
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:35,180
The chairwoman is working in the company these days.

502
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,430
Do you think the atmosphere in the company...

503
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,940
is creepy?

504
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,140
It gives you goosebumps.

505
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:51,500
It's like we are in a room where the ghosts live.

506
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,480
I got goosebumps.

507
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,320
P'Pa! Did compare the chairwoman to a ghost?

508
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,440
Oh, gosh.

509
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,320
I didn't say that.

510
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,573
But seriously...

511
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:07,380
It really feels depressing.

512
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,260
That's right. I think the chairwoman is here

513
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:17,140
to keep an eye on Khun Kheetika, Khun Sira, and Khun Sasa.

514
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,020
I don't know whom to sympathize with.

515
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,020
Sympathize with yourself.

516
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,740
I'm not happy at all at work now.

517
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:29,120
Look at Khun Sira. He doesn't look as cheerful as before.

518
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,553
All he does is work.

519
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:35,660
And Khun Sasa, he avoids the chairwoman when she is here.

520
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,663
The whole department is suffering.

521
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:40,100
How long do we have to be like this?

522
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,520
As long as Kheetika doesn't stop seducing the chairwoman's grandson,

523
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,620
you will have to continue to endure.

524
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,720
My stomach hurts. Khun Kheetika,

525
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,960
- could you do me a favor?
- Yes.

526
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,060
My... My stomach hurts.

527
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,840
Could you put the coffee and this on a tray

528
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,780
and take them to Khun Sira?

529
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,180
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

530
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,840
Thank you. I have to go.

531
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,840
Hello, Khun Sira.

532
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,300
Hello, Khun Thatha.

533
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,940
I got your message inviting me to dinner.

534
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,498
I came as soon as I took care of my work.

535
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,840
Did Khun Sira ask you to come?

536
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,173
Do you want to see the message that Khun Sira sent me?

537
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,500
Aren't we supposed to have dinner, Khun Thatha? Why are you here so early?

538
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,900
I missed you so much.

539
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,060
Now that you're here, let's go and have lunch.

540
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,160
Okay. I am hungry.

541
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
Okay.

542
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,080
Tell Maha I'm going to have dinner with Thatha.

543
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,580
Let's go.

544
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,240
Please.

545
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,820
Khun Kheetika, what happened?

546
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,121
Why did Khun Sira go out with Khun Thatha?

547
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:23,000
I don't know.

548
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,840
Where are we going for dinner tonight?

549
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,180
We ate lunch together.

550
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,000
I want to handle work at night.

551
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,780
But I can wait for you.

552
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,080
You're not going to work all night, are you?

553
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,000
You! What are you doing?

554
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,540
Disinfecting the area.

555
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,140
Kanghan, what are you doing here?

556
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,520
I came to ask you to a meeting.

557
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,680
Wait.

558
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,060
Can't you see Khun Sira is eating with me?

559
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,020
You want someone to eat with you.

560
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,180
I've got you covered.

561
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,480
Maha. Rossarin. Come here.

562
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,360
I've found people to eat with you.

563
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

564
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,540
As for you, come to the meeting with me.

565
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,180
Go.

566
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,940
You know that if you don't want to go, I'll do plenty of crazy things.

567
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,140
Khun Sira!

568
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,940
Khun Sira, where are you going?

569
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,640
Khun Thatha, have a seat.

570
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,733
What else did the chairwoman ask you to do?

571
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,420
No one asked me to do anything.

572
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,180
Are you sure?

573
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,340
You went to lunch with Thatha.

574
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,800
Wasn't it because of the chairwoman?

575
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,960
Tell me.

576
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,140
Otherwise, I'll see you as a liar.

577
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,960
Tell me the truth.

578
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,020
Why have you behaved so strangely lately?

579
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,240
Because I don't want to be near you.

580
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,640
- You don't want to be near me?
- Yes.

581
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,820
When I am near you, my life is nothing but trouble.

582
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,320
I think...

583
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,060
you should stay away from me.

584
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,020
Are you driving me away?

585
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,840
Don't come in.

586
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:44,500
I think we should go our separate ways.

587
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,900
This is the second time you've driven me out.

588
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,180
♫ I never loved anyone before ♫

589
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,040
Are you sure you want us to go our separate ways?

590
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,700
Have I ever lied to you?

591
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:02,040
♫ The one my heart was looking for ♫

592
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:08,580
♫ But Heaven must have made us meet, even though it was just a dream ♫

593
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:15,960
♫ After waking up, it all disappeared ♫

594
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,040
♫ If this love has to hurt ♫

595
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,600
♫ I will keep it all to myself ♫

596
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:30,000
♫ Since you deserve to be with that someone who is perfect for you ♫

597
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,640
♫ Let it be me who suffers ♫

598
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,100
♫ And be the one who ends this love ♫

599
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,180
♫ But it's all worth it ♫

600
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:49,140
♫ Because I have finally learned what it's like to love ♫

601
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,040
Kanghan, what's wrong with you?

602
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,660
Why are you crying? What happened?

603
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,820
Nothing. I'm not crying.

604
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,640
It was windy. My tears just came out.

605
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,640
Was it windy? If the wind blew, the leaves would fall.

606
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,060
I don't see any leaves.

607
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,760
Here. Wipe your tears.

608
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,380
The wind was strong.

609
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,244
It was too strong and didn't care about other people's feelings.

610
00:45:35,244 --> 00:45:41,360
Are you talking about the real wind or my brother Lom?

611
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,740
Real wind.

612
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,740
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

613
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:53,420
Every time you lie, your face bulges up, your pupils dilate, and your nose grows longer.

614
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,200
Hey. I'm not Pinocchio, whose nose grows when he lies.

615
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,880
Are you crazy?

616
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,100
If not, then tell me the truth.

617
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,300
Did you have a fight with my brother?

618
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,260
If you had a fight, you should clarify it.

619
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,740
It's not necessary.

620
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,620
I'm not that important to him.

621
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,540
But my brother is important to you, isn't he?

622
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,540
No.

623
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,140
He's not important.

624
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,960
What are you doing?

625
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,740
Your mouth is not tough.

626
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,998
Why are you saying things that you don't mean?

627
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,040
Hey. I mean what I say.

628
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,320
Look at you. You're being stubborn.

629
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,240
I know. You like my brother.

630
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,040
No.

631
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,320
Who said that?

632
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,860
No one told me.

633
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:56,580
I can tell from your words and actions that you like my brother.

634
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,780
What did I do?

635
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,260
What did I do? Tell me.

636
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,840
Don't you remember that night?

637
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,920
What you did when you were drunk?

638
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,060
Do you know?

639
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,460
You know. Tell me. What did I do?

640
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,480
You can't tell what people think.

641
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,160
If you want to know, ask my brother yourself.

642
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,220
Does he know too?

643
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,360
My brother knows everything.

644
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,680
Is it that depressing to come home for dinner?

645
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,880
You're so quiet.

646
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,640
No.

647
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:54,040
Grandma, do you want a happy atmosphere? Let me arrange it for you.

648
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,640
Brother,

649
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,360
are you going to quit competing with me for Kanghan?

650
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,100
That's why you went out with Thatha. Right?

651
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,620
Din, is it the right time to talk about that?

652
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,540
I'm asking you if you're quitting.

653
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,680
What happened?

654
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,650
I think someone forced you.

655
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,160
Don't mention that woman.

656
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,660
You're sick.

657
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,940
You take pleasure in others' pain.

658
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,540
Stop thinking that people will be happy with you.

659
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,200
You are the hell of their lives.

660
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,180
Let's go.

661
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:59,560
Brother, can you talk to me about Kanghan first?

662
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,460
I don't have anything to talk about.

663
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,880
But I do. I have countless things to talk about.

664
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:10,140
Kanghan told me you drove her away and went out with Thatha.

665
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,340
What do you want to do?

666
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,840
Did someone force you to do that?

667
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,930
No one forced me.

668
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,060
I don't know what the point of competing with you for Kanghan is.

669
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,320
She doesn't care about me.

670
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,380
Are you sure Kanghan doesn't care about you?

671
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,900
I think you know how Kanghan feels about you.

672
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,700
You don't like being lied to. But you're lying to yourself.

673
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,340
You still have the right to love. You have the right to do everything for Kanghan.

674
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,380
You're not like me. I was ruled out by Kanghan.

675
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,960
Did Kanghan tell you that?

676
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,340
No, but I can tell.

677
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:50,520
If Grandma had anything to do with what happened today, you can't give in.

678
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,120
Because it's your life.

679
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,190
It's not just my life.

680
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:03,240
If I make decisions based on my feelings,

681
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,400
I may destroy others' lives.

682
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,300
How do you know if you will destroy their lives or improve their lives?

683
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,640
You haven't tried it yet.

684
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,890
[GU]

685
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,940
About Kanghan, you should follow your heart.

686
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,060
You should be selfish when it comes to love.

687
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,540
No one will judge you.

688
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,860
For yourself and for Kanghan,

689
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,320
tell her how you feel.

690
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:47,130
Let's try to find a red fabric.

691
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,860
What is Khun Sira doing?

692
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,660
Yes.

693
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,340
What are you doing, Khun Sira?

694
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,540
You're practicing Latin dancing, aren't you?

695
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,960
I just saw it. Forward. Backward.

696
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,060
Backward.

697
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,440
It's all because of you.

698
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,560
- Where do I enter the password, Darling?
- Here, Darling.

699
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,100
- I'm going to enter it.
- Enter it.

700
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,840
Khun Sira.

701
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,160
- Maha.
- Let's go on.

702
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,140
- Yes.
- Is Khun Lom in there?

703
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:39,480
Yes. Khun Kheetika.

704
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,320
Khun Sira, what's wrong with you?

705
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,600
Are you suffering from bipolar disorder? Occasionally, you're cute and nice.

706
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:53,200
Randomly, you pull a long face at me as if I'm a murderer.

707
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,120
What do you want?

708
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,980
I'm sorry.

709
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,500
I don't want to justify...

710
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,860
what I said to you at the elevator the other day.

711
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,720
It's all my fault.

712
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,320
I'm sorry, Kanghan.

713
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,740
I'm sorry.

714
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,740
- I'm truly sorry.
- Okay.

715
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:31,080
If you do that again, you'll never see me again in your life.

716
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,540
I swear I won't do that again.

717
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:38,660
I swear on Mahakul's head. And Din's head.

718
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:59,660
What happened when I got drunk that night?

719
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:04,380
Are you not telling me because I've done something serious?

720
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,540
Actually,

721
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,940
- it was not that serious.
- What did I do?

722
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,560
You hid under the table like this.

723
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:26,260
In this atmosphere, with a cloth covered like this,

724
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,160
try to think about what you did that day.

725
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,260

It's not a rumor, Maha. The chairwoman has called to inform me that she is going to fire me.
