The chairwoman fired Khun Sira from the position of vice chairman.

I'm not her biological grandson.

P'Sira doesn't like to lie.

85

He must have had a reason for lying.

86
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,990
His reason might be...

87
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,940
that he wanted to protect Khun Premyuda.

88
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,560

Don't assume the worst.

he wouldn't be so worried about you.

Before I went out with him,

139

you threw money at me and asked me to stop pestering Din.

140

I hope you won't use the same plan again.

141
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,920
It's a waste of money if I use the same plan.

142
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,578
I don't think you'll break up with Lom easily.

143

Your work or private affairs.

Lom is remarkable.

158
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,680
He won't have a problem.

159
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,465
I said it because I'm worried about Lom.

160
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:45,620
I want him to take life seriously

161
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,040
and think things through.

162
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,114
Don't waste too much time...

163
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,232
on stupid things.

164
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,917
Otherwise, you will ruin your prosperous future.

165
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,380
I never do things for fun.

166
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,700
I take everything seriously.

167
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,757
And I give it my all in everything I do.

168
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
You should follow your brother's example.

169
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,906
He listens to me and never disobeys my orders.

170
00:14:20,906 --> 00:14:26,251
He deserves to be the GU chairman.

171
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:27,900
You spoke highly of him.

172
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,760
I wonder what he did...

173
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:35,899
to deserve the reward of being the GU chairman.

174
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:40,748
You should ask him about it.

175
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:44,200
You should let him say it, not me.

176
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,800
How can you blame me?

177
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,560
Your progress is slow.

178
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,940
But you blamed me for the design problems.

179
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,360
Your design was not approved.

180
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,760
How do you know that? You haven't even checked my design.

181
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,080
Why are you derelict in your duties?

182
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,040
I'm the manager. What I want to do is my business.

183
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,980
You're just my subordinates.

184
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,980
You are still not self-aware.

185
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,900
You're really snobbish.

186
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,040
Who are you scolding?

187
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,540
You, of course.

188
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,540
Don't think you'll be fine with the chairwoman backing you.

189
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,040
Khun Sira will be the new chairman of GU.

190
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,740
You'll lose your backer.

191
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,253
Be careful of losing everything.

192
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:35,407
You have a smart mouth.

193
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:36,880
Come on.

194
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,740
I won't put up with you this time.

195
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,760
Are you trying to provoke me?

196
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,560
- Calm down.
- Come on.

197
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,600
- Calm down.
- Out of my way.

198
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,940
Stop it!

199
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:51,128
What are you doing?

200
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:54,233
Khun Kansinee's work is slow, but she blamed Khun Pa for it.

201
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:57,980
I warned you to stay out of trouble.

202
00:15:58,744 --> 00:16:00,842
Do you want to challenge me?

203
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:02,267
No.

204
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:04,880
Solve your problem.

205
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:08,800
Don't make any more trouble.

206
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,739
Hello, Paa Wa.

207
00:16:21,992 --> 00:16:26,312
You found a photo of Khun Premyuda's eldest daughter-in-law?

208
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:27,513
Okay.

209
00:16:27,513 --> 00:16:29,553
I'll be right there.

210
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,820
It's not that easy, Khun Premyuda.

211
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,360
To get rid of me.

212
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,900
You asked me in the office

213
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,558
if I was hiding something from you...

214
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:18,120
about the chairwoman promoting me to be GU's chairman.

215
00:17:18,693 --> 00:17:21,240
She asked me to pursue you.

216
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:26,020
She asked you to pursue me.

217
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,773
Why?

218
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:30,010
She wanted you to like me...

219
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,880
so you would stop disturbing Din's life.

220
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:44,313
Did the chairwoman ask you...

221
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,740
to say you love me?

222
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,880
No one asked me or forced me to say I love you.

223
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:06,672
I said I loved you...

224
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,004
because I really like you and I love you.

225
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:15,094
I fell in love with you before the chairwoman asked me to pursue you.

226
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,057
How do I know you're not lying to me?

227
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,460
You never told me the truth about it.

228
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:33,439
I'm sincere with you, and I believe you are sincere.

229
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,720
But you're lying to me.

230
00:18:38,513 --> 00:18:42,073
I don't know if I can trust you anymore.

231
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,360
Because if I trust you,

232
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,086
it would make me look like an idiot.

233
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,580
♫ If this love has to hurt, ♫

234
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,040
♫ I will keep it all to myself ♫

235
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,440
♫ Since you deserve to be with that someone who is perfect for you ♫

236
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,080
♫ Let it be me who suffers ♫

237
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,680
♫ And be the one who ends this love ♫

238
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,700
♫ But it's all worth it because I have finally learned what it's like to love ♫

239
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:41,148
♫ But it's all worth it because I have finally learned what it's like to love ♫

240
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:49,880
Didn't I warn you?

241
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,145
If you pestered the men from the Kukitcharoen Family, you would get hurt.

242
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:58,924
Because I'd stop you at any cost.

243
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:04,552
I won't let women like you enter the Kukitcharoen Family.

244
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:10,190
I hope this time you'll remember the pain.

245
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:25,679
I told you...

246
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,540
that one day I would bring my important one to see you.

247
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,258
I don't think he will make it.

248
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,040
- My name is Lom.
[Nithi Tinlathaworn - Born in 1967 and died in 2010]

249
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:37,040
I like your daughter.

250
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,350
I'd like to ask your permission to pursue your daughter.

251
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:49,700
I promise I will take care of your daughter.

252
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,056
Hey. Why are you so upset?

253
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:15,008
Your brow is furrowed.

254
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:19,191
It's about my brother, Kanghan, and my grandma.

255
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:24,261
They talked strangely during lunch.

256
00:23:24,261 --> 00:23:25,861
Looks like something went wrong.

257
00:23:25,861 --> 00:23:29,760
If you want to know, why don't you ask Khun Sira and Kanghan?

258
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,086
I called and asked them. But they didn't tell me.

259
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:39,615
I think my grandma must be up to something.

260
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:43,100
If your grandmother makes trouble with me,

261
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,270
I'm telling you, I won't put up with her.

262
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,453
Calm down.

263
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:51,547
We've only been dating for less than two days. Are you breaking up with me already?

264
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:53,834
What are you talking about?

265
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:57,000
I mean your grandmother.

266
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,233
If she makes trouble with me, I'll do the same back.

267
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,540
But don't go too far.

268
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,813
After all, she's my grandma.

269
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:10,652
Come here.

270
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,640
How long have you been together?

271
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,328
Two days.

272
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,113
Khun Sasa, I'll ask you straight.

273
00:24:26,113 --> 00:24:30,540
Who do you love more, Kanghan or Hom?

274
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,040
Dad, why would you ask that?

275
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,459
You and Kanghan are my daughters.

276
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:43,783
One day, a man who once loved Kanghan

277
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:47,400
changed his mind and fell in love with you.

278
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,820
Do you think I would let such a man

279
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,700
approach my daughter?

280
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,680
As a father, I have to make sure that the man

281
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,416
who will take care of my daughter in the future

282
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:12,359
will be able to take care of her.

283
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,340
What do you think?

284
00:25:18,107 --> 00:25:23,047
Kanghan and I have a lot in common.

285
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:25,100
Kanghan...

286
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,447
ran into life problems and went abroad.

287
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:38,080
And I've been facing pressure from my grandma.

288
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,763
We have a common goal, which is to be free.

289
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:46,839
Kanghan and I helped each other and took care of each other.

290
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,786
And we worry about each other.

291
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:54,020
To this day, I still love her, and I want the best for her.

292
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,513
Are you still in love with Kanghan?

293
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,633
Yes.

294
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:13,883
But I love her as a friend. I want to help her.

295
00:26:14,893 --> 00:26:19,480
But I love you as a man.

296
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,746
I want to be responsible for you and take care of you.

297
00:26:24,106 --> 00:26:29,091
I can answer who I love more.

298
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,240
I want to prove it with action. Okay?

299
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,953
I will prove how much I love Hom.

300
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,061
Khun Sasa, remember your words.

301
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:46,517
I'll only give you one chance.

302
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:49,713
Don't make Hom upset.

303
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:51,540
Okay.

304
00:26:56,979 --> 00:27:01,112
Didn't Kanghan tell you what problems she had?

305
00:27:01,112 --> 00:27:03,547
She didn't say anything.

306
00:27:03,547 --> 00:27:06,991
She cried the whole time.

307
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:10,640
I didn't know how to ask her.

308
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,980
Honey, don't think too much. Otherwise, you will have another heart attack.

309
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:20,259
I've never seen Kanghan cry so sadly.

310
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:25,284
I think she was crying

311
00:27:25,284 --> 00:27:28,886
because she was losing something she loved.

312
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:36,325
Do you mean she was upset because she lost something she loved?

313
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:39,481
That may be the case.

314
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:42,484
She changed her mind and wanted to go abroad.

315
00:27:42,484 --> 00:27:45,013
Is Kanghan going abroad?

316
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:50,813
Din, where are you?

317
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:53,188
I'm going to my brother's apartment. What's wrong?

318
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:56,607
Good. Ask your brother what happened.

319
00:27:56,607 --> 00:28:01,473
Why did Kanghan resign from GU and want to move back to live abroad?

320
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,603
P'Kanghan has moved out of my place.

321
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,359
She moved out?

322
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:10,213
Where did she move to?

323
00:28:10,213 --> 00:28:13,206
Brother, what happened?

324
00:28:13,206 --> 00:28:15,597
Why did Kanghan suddenly resign and want to move back to live abroad?

325
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:18,977
Who told you Kanghan resigned and wants to move back to live abroad?

326
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:20,530
Hom told me.

327
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,280
Didn't─ Brother, didn't you know about it?

328
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:37,273
P'Kanghan asked me to return this to you.

329
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,633
Hey.

330
00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:35,206
What happened?

331
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:41,120
Don't tell me you're going to flee abroad because of Khun Premyuda.

332
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,867
Does Khun Sira know?

333
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:50,286
What did he do?

334
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:54,360
Aren't you going to answer?

335
00:30:05,746 --> 00:30:07,846
Are you here?

336
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:14,559
Okay.

337
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,243
If you don't want to say it, I'll ask him myself.

338
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,439
Khun Sira, what are you going to do about Kanghan?

339
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:47,342
Hom, let them figure it out on their own. It's between them.

340
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:51,558
It happened because we left them to figure it out.

341
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,886
Let's go.

342
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,160
I submitted my resignation letter to HR.

343
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,497
Remember to sign it when you go to work tomorrow.

344
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,473
I won't sign it.

345
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,639
I don't agree with your resignation.

346
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:21,852
Khun Sira, it's over.

347
00:31:21,852 --> 00:31:25,810
Cut everything off. Don't waste time.

348
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,630
Kanghan.

349
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:36,439
I'm begging you.

350
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:41,559
Please give me a chance to prove my love to you.

351
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:46,039
I didn't pursue you because the chairwoman asked me to.

352
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,553
If you want to prove your love to me,

353
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:55,437
don't be GU's chairman.

354
00:31:56,973 --> 00:31:59,073
Okay.

355
00:31:59,073 --> 00:32:01,713
I won't be GU's chairman.

356
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:04,652
And you have to

357
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:09,020
leave the Kukitcharoen Family.

358
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,780
If I'm going to get back together with you,

359
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:26,440
I don't want to worry about whether anyone will trick me again.

360
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,787
Do you want him to end our relationship?

361
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:34,511
Do you want my brother to dump me and my grandma?

362
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:39,550
It's between them. We'd better leave it to them.

363
00:32:44,366 --> 00:32:49,480
You must choose between Khun Premyuda and me.

364
00:33:11,132 --> 00:33:14,232
Are you going to dump Khun Sira? Don't you feel sorry for him?

365
00:33:14,232 --> 00:33:17,056
You gave him hope that you would get back together with him.

366
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,737
But you're going to leave him eventually.

367
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:23,160
He won't choose me.

368
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:27,172
His whole life is connected with repaying merits.

369
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,606
He can't cut them off.

370
00:33:29,606 --> 00:33:32,526
But it's not Khun Sira's fault.

371
00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:35,726
That's why I chose to leave him.

372
00:33:35,726 --> 00:33:38,520
If he chooses to be with me,

373
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
he won't be happy.

374
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:46,073
I can't stand to see him unhappy.

375
00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:48,653
Do you think...

376
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:53,893
he will be happy without you?

377
00:33:56,599 --> 00:34:01,319
He was happy without me before.

378
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,760
What about you?

379
00:34:09,553 --> 00:34:14,493
Will you be happy without him?

380
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,880
I said that...

381
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:23,726
because I don't want you...

382
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:29,012
to make the same bad decision as I did.

383
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:36,346
If I hadn't...

384
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,999
let you go that day,

385
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:46,566
we wouldn't be arguing every day now.

386
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,246
It's not your fault.

387
00:34:53,193 --> 00:34:56,413
Lung Papop told me everything.

388
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:07,466
Actually, if your mother could find you when you went abroad,

389
00:35:07,466 --> 00:35:13,700
I'm sure she would have stayed with you, not me.

390
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:22,200
I'm sure your mother would have chosen you over me.

391
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,586
Now that we are talking about it, let's open up and talk.

392
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:33,806
Your mother has been suffering from heart disease for a long time.

393
00:35:33,806 --> 00:35:37,600
But she wouldn't let me tell anyone.

394
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,826
Do you remember the day you went to your mother?

395
00:35:41,826 --> 00:35:44,686
You saw your mother with me.

396
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,709
What's wrong with you?

397
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:49,869
It hurts.

398
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:51,633
I'll call an ambulance for you.

399
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:53,966
Come on. Get up.

400
00:36:09,746 --> 00:36:11,700
Kanghan, where are you going?

401
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,200
Be careful.

402
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,254
How are you doing? Your condition is starting to deteriorate.

403
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:19,000
Exhale slowly. Inhale.

404
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,263
I can't. I have to go after her.

405
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:24,574
Otherwise, my daughter will misunderstand me. My daughter will misunderstand me.

406
00:36:24,574 --> 00:36:26,140
It's okay.

407
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,180
Forget Kanghan for now. You can explain later.

408
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,340
You're in a bad situation.

409
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,080
As for your debt, I'll settle it for you.

410
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:39,480
How can you help me with that?

411
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,733
I have so much debt. I can't let you settle it.

412
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,879
I don't care how much debt you have.

413
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:47,845
Your life is more important.

414
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:52,373
Girl, your dad and I are divorced. Live with me.

415
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:54,330
Who do you love?

416
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,918
Me or him?

417
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:59,174
Kanghan, I'm begging you.

418
00:36:59,174 --> 00:37:01,540
I want to live with my dad.

419
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,360
If you choose me, you have to live with me.

420
00:37:08,451 --> 00:37:10,251
Kanghan.

421
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:13,219
Kanghan.

422
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,080
Dear, sorry.

423
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:31,406
Dear.

424
00:37:32,073 --> 00:37:33,267
Dear.

425
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:35,997
Forget it. Let's go.

426
00:37:35,997 --> 00:37:38,033
- Kanghan.
- Let's go.

427
00:37:38,033 --> 00:37:40,233
Be careful.

428
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:42,540
Go to the hospital.

429
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,627
You divorced my dad because you couldn't stand him anymore.

430
00:37:46,627 --> 00:37:50,017
He had a problem with alcohol and gambling.

431
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,873
And he owed a lot of debt.

432
00:37:51,873 --> 00:37:56,693
If it weren't for Lung Papop's money, I wouldn't even have a home.

433
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,752
I'm sorry I broke your heart.

434
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,060
- I'm truly sorry.
- Oh, girl.

435
00:38:13,826 --> 00:38:16,166
I'm sorry, Mom.

436
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,166
Khun Kheetika, please turn off the lights when you're done.

437
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,025
- Okay.
- Thank you.

438
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,973
Did Khun Sira leave?

439
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:44,206
Khun Sira? He left in the afternoon.

440
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:46,426
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

441
00:39:07,486 --> 00:39:14,780
♫ I never loved anyone before ♫

442
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:21,980

464
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,703
Kanghan has been sighing like this for two weeks.

465
00:41:51,703 --> 00:41:55,906
My brother is like an emotionless work machine.

466
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:07,920
Is there really no way to make them love each other unconditionally?

467
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,620
If P'Sira can't make the decision,

468
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,217
I think it's best to let P'Kanghan go abroad.

469
00:42:13,217 --> 00:42:17,453
If we force them to be together, both of them will get hurt.

470
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:20,914
Are you saying that because you want to replace my brother?

471
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:23,219
I'm saying that because I'm worried about them.

472
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:26,313
Why are you here, Dude?

473
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,845
I called Nannam to come.

474
00:42:29,845 --> 00:42:32,460
Why did you ask him to come?

475
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,900
It's easier to think about it together.

476
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,360
With just the two of us, my head's about to explode.

477
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:45,183
Hello, Khun Rossarin.

478
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:46,700
What?

479
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,980
Okay, I'll be right there.

480
00:42:50,553 --> 00:42:51,737
What happened, Din?

481
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:56,024
My grandma signed Kanghan's resignation and asked HR to issue a notice.

482
00:42:56,024 --> 00:42:59,540
My brother was angry when he saw the notice. He went home to my grandma.

483
00:43:01,148 --> 00:43:03,420
Why didn't my grandma discuss it before she did it?

484
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,420
Hello, Dad.

485
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:12,859
What?

486
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:17,987
Kanghan is going abroad today?

487
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:21,188
Why didn't anyone tell me she was leaving today?

488
00:43:21,188 --> 00:43:24,308
Okay, Dad. I'll quickly go back.

489
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,890
Ms. Chairwoman, about Kheetika's resignation,

490
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:41,719
didn't I tell you I wouldn't let her resign?

491
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,413
When did you tell me that? I don't remember.

492
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,420
I'll ask HR to withdraw Kanghan's resignation.

493
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:58,573
Do you think you can let her stay with you...

494
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,318
by not signing her resignation?

495
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:04,508
Whether I can get her to stay or not is my business, it has nothing to do with you.

496
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:06,220
Lom.

497
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,500
Khun Lom, please calm down.

498
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,900
She did that because she was worried about you.

499
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,960
I don't need her...

500
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,306
to hurt other people's feelings to protect me.

501
00:44:20,306 --> 00:44:23,067
I worked hard to nurture you.

502
00:44:23,067 --> 00:44:27,066
I gave you the best things. Am I hurting you?

503
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,420
Brother, come with me.

504
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,860
I'm not going anywhere.

505
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,219
Today, I must make it clear to the chairwoman.

506
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:39,357
You can talk to Grandma whenever you want.

507
00:44:39,357 --> 00:44:41,680
You must go to Kanghan now.

508
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:44,150
What's wrong with her?

509
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:48,490
She is going abroad. You have to stop her.

510
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,333
Stop right now!

511
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:56,734
If you walk out of this house today,

512
00:44:56,734 --> 00:45:00,146
I'm not your grandma anymore.

513
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,386
Didn't you say we were family?

514
00:45:11,386 --> 00:45:12,530
Why are you doing this?

515
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:16,061
I asked my mom and Lung Papop not to tell you about this.

516
00:45:16,061 --> 00:45:19,280
Do you hate me so much that you want to get away from me?

517
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,880
I never hated you, Hom.

518
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,630
On the contrary,

519
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:28,620
I'm glad you accepted me and my mom as your family.

520
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,550
If we are really a family,

521
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:35,300
can you please not leave?

522
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:40,603
Grandma, let my brother go.

523
00:45:40,603 --> 00:45:45,490
If he doesn't stop Kanghan now, he may never see Kanghan again.

524
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,900
That would be the best.

525
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,286
So we can end this.

526
00:45:50,286 --> 00:45:55,880
Why do you want to waste your future on that woman?

527
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,780
Because I love Kanghan.

528
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,180
Love?

529
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,710
Do you think she loves you, too?

530
00:46:05,713 --> 00:46:08,620
She doesn't even trust you.

531
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,240
Are you doing this...

532
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,720
because you love me...

533
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,440
or love yourself?

534
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:28,160
And what you have today is it not due to my love for you?

535
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,300
If you love me,

536
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,950
why do you want to ruin my life by doing this?

537
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,507
Are you blaming me?

538
00:46:37,507 --> 00:46:40,786
Are you blaming me for ruining your life?

539
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,416
Hom.

540
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:55,463
Nannam, call Din and say that Kanghan wants to talk to Khun Lom.

541
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,260
I've listened to you since I was a child.

542
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,732
I've never disobeyed your orders.

543
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,980
And I've never asked you for anything.

544
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:14,579
But today, I just want to love a woman.

545
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:16,733
Why won't you allow me?

546
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:23,632
As long as you're a member of the Kukitcharoen Family,

547
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:30,293
you can only fall in love with a woman who's a suitable match.

548
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,860
Don't call him, Nannam.

549
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,480
I never wanted to stop you from going abroad.

550
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,920
But you should tell P'Sira.

551
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,160
So he won't be struggling with whom to choose.

552
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:03,746
Are you saying that if I wasn't a member of the Kukitcharoen Family

553
00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:06,760
I could love Kanghan?

554
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,545
In that case,

555
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,113
I request...

556
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:23,226
not to be a member of the Kukitcharoen Family anymore.

557

Okay! Go wherever you want!

00:48:36,052 --> 00:48:39,750
If you think that woman

559
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:44,886
is more important than your grandma who raised you,

560
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,466
then go!

561
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,300
