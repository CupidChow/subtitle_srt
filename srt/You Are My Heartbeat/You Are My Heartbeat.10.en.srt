317
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,020
So I thought we'd better hold a press conference.

318
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,500
We will clarify it once and for all. So my fans won't misunderstand me.

319
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,340
What are you going to say?

320
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,760
He's not my boyfriend.

321
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,420
We are just working together.

322
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,860
What are you doing?

323
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,960
Maha, what is going on with Khun Sira and Khun Thatha? What's the truth?

324
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,440
Why did reporters make fun of them like that?

325
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,600
Yes.

326
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,800
I told you I don't know. Don't ask me. I don't know.

327
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,520
Sit down. You can't go anywhere.

328
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,180
Don't lie to me.

329
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,280
You know everything about Khun Sira.

330
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,920
- This must be a drop in the bucket. How could you not know?
- Exactly.

331
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,540
I'm not lying. I really don't know.

332
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,580
You've said it many times that you don't know.

333
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,360
If you want to know so much─

334
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,500
Khun Kheetika, are you feeling better?

335
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,559
I'm much better.

336
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,640
Khun Kheetika,

337
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,980
did you see the news about Khun Sira and Khun Thatha?

338
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,880
I did.

339
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,820
Khun Kheetika, are they seeing each other?

340
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,880
Get up. Come here.

341
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,380
Really? Can't I ask her?

342
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,520
I don't know. But it would be nice if they are seeing each other.

343
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,840
It will make our work smoother.

344
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,872
Hello, Khun Sira.

345
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,279
Yes.

346
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,760
Okay.

347
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,780
Okay.

348
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,300
Khun Sira asks everyone in the Design Department to an emergency meeting.

349
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,545
What happened?

350
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:34,640
Khun Thatha wants to talk about the co-design lingerie project.

351
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,653
Oh, gosh.

352
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:43,140
Originally, we were going to announce Khun Thatha as our spokesperson on the New Look website

353
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:49,460
before announcing that she would co-design lingerie with GU.

354
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,520
Who will collaborate with me on the design of lingerie?

355
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,820
Khun Kansinee.

356
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,820
Khun Kansinee will listen to your ideas in the design.

357
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:06,520
If you have any design ideas, you can also talk to me.

358
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,000
Will you be my advisor or supervisor?

359
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,680
I won't supervise you, but I'll help you.

360
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,640
But I think Khun Kansinee alone is enough.

361
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,791
You don't have to work on the project.

362
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,240
How could you say that, Nong Thatha?

363
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,320
Khun Kheetika is a great designer.

364
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,498
She studied fashion design abroad.

365
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,933
But I heard...

366
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:38,952
that she had plagiarized other people's designs before.

367
00:27:38,952 --> 00:27:42,985
I'm worried about the repercussions.

368
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,420
What are you talking about, Thatha?

369
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,980
I'm talking about the truth.

370
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,780
I just don't want things to go wrong at work.

371
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,052
What did Khun Sira do? Why didn't he protect Khun Kheetika?

372
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:07,260
There is no proof that Khun Kheetika copied the design.

373
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,760
He supported her.

374
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,280
But he couldn't say too much because Khun Thatha is the spokesperson of our mall.

375
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,920
If he favors Khun Kheetika and upsets Khun Thatha, the consequences will be terrible.

376
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,066
Yes.

377
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:23,740
Honestly, I really sympathize with Khun Kheetika.

378
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,020
Think about it. She took over Khun Thatha's project.

379
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,130
Then, she was hospitalized.

380
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:34,140
She was humiliated in the conference room today, too.

381
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,640
If I were her, I would have quit.

382
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,900
What do you want to see me about?

383
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,360
I hired you as our spokesperson, and that's all you have to do.

384
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,680
You shouldn't harass my employees.

385
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,040
What have I done to harass your employees?

386
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,860
Kheetika is my employee, not yours.

387
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,900
You are not entitled to judge her.

388
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:07,200
You are defending her not as her boss.

389
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,812
It has nothing to do with you.

390
00:29:09,812 --> 00:29:13,706
I want you to remember that if you want to be our spokesperson,

391
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:16,920
you should stop harassing my employees.

392
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,320
Khun Kheetika, Khun Thatha is here.

393
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,960
She's talking to Khun Kansinee in the conference room now.

394
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,500
I think they're discussing the design.

395
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,380
No, I don't think so.

396
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,912
She asked to see Khun Sira as soon as she arrived.

397
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,286
Why didn't you tell me that Khun Thatha was here?

398
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,580
Khun Thatha just dropped by to see my design.

399
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,686
I didn't call you because I thought it had nothing to do with you.

400
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,020
Why didn't you come out together after the discussion?

401
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,500
Khun Thatha is talking to Khun Sira.

402
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,340
It seems to be a private matter.

403
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,360
Private matter? What's that?

404
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,540
Khun Pa, we're discussing the summer collection at our afternoon meeting.

405
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,780
Have you finished your design?

406
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,320
I'll finish it now.

407
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,660
Does Khun Thatha like your design?

408
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,578
She likes them.

409
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,500
I don't think you need to check.

410
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,520
Khun Thatha would be unhappy if she knew you were meddling in her work.

411
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,780
I don't want any trouble.

412
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,940
Hello, Khun Kansinee. What's the matter?

413
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:37,840
Khun Pa, I left my design for Khun Thatha on the desk.

414
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,860
Can you please help me put them in the drawer?

415
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,240
The key is in the box on the table.

416
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,220
Please don't tell others about it.

417
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:50,070
Khun Thatha is dissatisfied with the news that our department is suspected of plagiarism.

418
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,820
Oh, okay, I'll do it now.

419
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,640
File on the desk.

420
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,480
File.

421
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,060
Where are they?

422
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,740
Are you looking for Khun Kansinee's design?

423
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,603
Yes.

424
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:14,132
Here it is.

425
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,573
Thank you.

426
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,160
Kheetika made enemies everywhere.

427
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,740
She's annoying everywhere.

428
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,860
If Khun Thatha keeps targeting Kheetika like this,

429
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,560
I think this project...

430
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:47,400
Maybe we don't have to do it ourselves to get rid of Kheetika.

431
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,798
Do you want to use Thatha to get rid of Kheetika?

432
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:52,600
It's not that simple.

433
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,940
Don't forget that Kheetika has Khun Sira and Khun Sasa as her backers.

434
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:01,040
She won't be fired just because the spokesperson doesn't like her.

435
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,920
But if Kheetika makes another mistake

436
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,460
and destroys the reputation of GU and the spokesperson,

437
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,860
I think she will get fired.

438
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,080
The stagehands said the stage, lights, and equipment would be ready before 8:00 p.m.

439
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,860
We can rehearse until the mall closes.

440
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:28,016
Design Department, can you finish the modifications before then?

441
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,540
We will finish it by tonight.

442
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,920
You can wear them tomorrow.

443
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,860
It's okay if you can't make it. We still have time.

444
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,740
Tomorrow is just a rehearsal.

445
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,960
- I don't want you to rush into bad designs.
- Okay.

446
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,740
Sasa, is tomorrow's live broadcast on the New Look website ready? How's it going?

447
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,380
It's going well, Brother.

448
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,560
Anyway, I'm counting on you.

449
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,840
This is my first project after managing New Look.

450
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,940
I hope you give it your all.

451
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,980
Don't damage New Look and GU's reputation again,

452
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,420
like in the international lingerie design competition.

453
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,180
If you make another mistake,

454
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:13,260
I won't be so nice and give you a second chance.

455
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,000
Khun Sira, I'm here.

456
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,680
I apologize for being late.

457
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,700
I noticed that you rehearsed late.

458
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,680
So I bought some food in case the staff got hungry.

459
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,040
Guys, Nong Thatha bought food for you.

460
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,640
Come and get some to eat.

461
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,160
Put one here and put one there.

462
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,300
This is for you.

463
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,180
It's delicious.

464
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,080
If you like it, I'll invite you to the restaurant next time.

465
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,232
Didn't you say you didn't like Khun Thatha?

466
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,918
If you take it, I'll leave.

467
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:10,880
I am quitting.

468
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,073
Khun Sira.

469
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,520
- Khun Sira.
- Yes.

470
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,226
Here's your dessert.

471
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:31,859
Thank you. But I don't eat dessert much these days.

472
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:34,420
I'll take it for him.

473
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,820
Thank you very much.

474
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,400
I'll bring you something else next time.

475
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,710

Take Khun Thatha to get ready.

478

Okay.

Please. This way.

You don't have to buy dessert for a while.

483
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,860
Why?

484
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,420
Because you like to buy it and ask me to eat with you.

485
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,060
I don't want dessert these days. Just now,

486
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,840
Khun Thatha bought me a dessert.

487
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,380
But I didn't take it.

488
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,840
Why are you telling me that?

489
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,460
Do you want to brag about having a woman buy you food?

490
00:37:39,306 --> 00:37:41,646
It's not like that.

491
00:37:41,646 --> 00:37:45,413
I'm telling you because I don't want you to misunderstand.

492
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:49,560
You misunderstood me and Khun Thatha last time.

493
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,680
You saw Khun Thatha bring me food.

494
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,580
I don't want you to misunderstand me. I don't want to explain.

495
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,860
- Is that all you want to say?
- Yes.

496

Remember it so you won't

497
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,990
misunderstand me again.

- Nana.
- Yes?

499
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,900
Please watch the door for me.

500
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,200
Don't let anyone in.

501
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,980
Watch the door? Why?

502
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,491
Because I'm going to add something to my design.

503
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:34,240
It's a secret.

504

Maha, bring up the models wearing the designs.

510

Khun Sira,

511
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,380
I thought we agreed at the meeting yesterday

512
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,160
that this was a casual rehearsal and we wouldn't show the designs.

513
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,160
And the Design Department has wrapped the designs.

514
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,980
If we take them out and show them, they may get dirty.

515
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,965
I changed my mind.

516
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:24,640
I wanted everyone to rehearse as if they were on stage.

517
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,540
Because I want to see the overall effect.

518
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,880
Is there a problem, Khun Kansinee?

519
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,436
No problem.

520
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,380
- Maha.
- Okay.

Why are the two models wearing the same lingerie?

527
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,540
Shouldn't they be different?

Actually, this lingerie was designed by Khun Thatha.

00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,640
That one is designed by Khun Kheetika.

531
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
I didn't design this.

532
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,980
What happened?

533
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,300
Why is my design the same as someone else's?

534
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,900
Khun Kansinee, I want an answer to it.

535
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,260
I don't know why Khun Kheetika's design is the same as yours.

536
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,600
Did you copy my design?

537
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,666
I said I didn't.

538
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:50,040
The proof is here. Are you still going to deny it?

539
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,040
No, Thatha. X is full of buzz-worthy posts

I'm truly sorry.

00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,900
But I don't know how the design got out.

556
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,400
I didn't show my design to others.

557
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,220
Are you sure no one has seen it?

558

- Khun Pa.
- What is it?

00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:06,860
Nothing happened when you put away my design. Right?

561
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,820
Right. After you hung up,

562
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,540
I put your file where you asked me to.

563
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,820
I remember. Khun Kheetika said she wanted to see the file.

564
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:23,780
After she saw it, I put the file back.

565
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,140
You peeked at my design?

566
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,640
How could you do that?

567
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,080
What's wrong?

568
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,820
I looked at your design to make sure you wouldn't make a mistake again.

569
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,960
- I didn't want to copy your design.
- You didn't?

570
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,878
Then, how do you explain this?

571
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,500
Do you have a witness to prove you didn't copy my design?

572
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,220
Yes, I have.

573
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:06,320
Can you prove that Kheetika did not copy?

574
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,880
Yes.

575
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,760
The one who's been framing Kheetika,

576
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,520
is you, Khun Kansinee.

577
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,120
When you came here for an interview,

578
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,740
you said you designed this lingerie.

579
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,040
And you said Kheetika copied your design.

580
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,793
I compared the pictures on your phone with Kheetika's drawings.

581
00:43:59,793 --> 00:44:03,140
The results show the pictures on your phone

582
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,480
are the same as Kheetika's drawings.

583
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,065
It's all right if you would rather not explain.

584
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:19,980
Then, I'll send your drawings and Kheetika's drawings

585
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,960
to the police for identification to see who the copycat is.

586
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,092
Do you hate me that much?

587
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:29,940
What is the reason you keep doing this?

588
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:34,340
You should ask yourself why you're so annoying.

589
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,640
You made two mistakes.

590
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,380
I can't let you work here anymore.

591
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,900

592
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,540
Then I quit.

593
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,540
I hope you don't do it again after you quit.

594
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,540
If you still do that, I will bring you to justice.

595
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,180
By the way, don't forget to delete Thatha's videos.

I've been watching Khun Kansinee's every move.

600
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,112
Every move?

601
00:45:17,112 --> 00:45:18,860
Yes.

- Yes.

Don't tell anyone that I asked you to keep an eye on her.

Do you understand?

606
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,280
That's how I found out that Khun Kansinee

607
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,220
had changed P'Kheetika's design to the same as Khun Thatha's.

608
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,780
Did you help her?

609
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,740
I helped her a little.

610
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,185
The plan wouldn't have gone as planned if I hadn't helped her out.

611

P'Kheetika, you won't be upset with me, will you?

613
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:55,500

614
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,960

Did you see it?

616
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,032
If you act on your feelings,

617
00:46:16,032 --> 00:46:18,892
your life will be messy.

618
00:46:18,892 --> 00:46:23,898
Maybe you will hurt the people you care about.

619
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,972
Does it hurt?

620
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,400
Yes.

621
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,160
It's like being bitten by ants.

622

00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,120
I need to come back here for work.

640
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,720
What happened?

641
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,392
Khun Sira found out about my framing of Kheetika and Khun Thatha.

642
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,820
So what?

643
00:48:14,407 --> 00:48:16,867
Why should I keep you working here?

644
00:48:16,867 --> 00:48:19,087
You're a part of it.

645
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,100
You should take responsibility for it.

646
00:48:27,747 --> 00:48:33,385
Otherwise, I'll spread the word that you're the one who framed Kheetika.

647
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,606
Frame Kheetika? You did it all alone.

648
00:48:38,606 --> 00:48:41,065
I didn't order you.

649
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,320
- Khun Jum.
- Yes, Khun Hom?

650
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,100
- Call security.
- Okay.

651
00:48:49,505 --> 00:48:51,640
You can't ditch me.

652
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,700
Why not?

653
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,500
You ditched KKPP and went to GU.

654
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:03,260
Then I'll tell everyone...

655
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,278
that you planned everything.

656
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,500
You asked me to frame Kheetika.

657
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,558
Is the security guard here?

658
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:17,660
Security guard, throw this woman out. Don't let her come in here again.

659
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,840
Okay.

660
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,980
- Come with me.
- Let go of me!

661
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,360
You can't do this to me.

662
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,840
Throw this woman out! Don't let her come in here again.

663

- Let's go.
- Let go of me!

664
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,260
- Come out with me.
- I told you to leave!

665
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,740
- Khun Hom.
- Get out!

666
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,220
Stop.

667
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,029
What do you want Hom to do for you?

668
00:49:40,029 --> 00:49:43,760
My request is simple.

669
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,860
I would like to work here again.

670
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,580
I'm afraid I can't promise you that.

671
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:54,260
I didn't expect you to love your company more than your daughter.

672
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:01,240
It would be interesting...

673
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,280
if everyone knew

674
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,332
that the daughter of the KKPP boss was jealous...

675
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,926
and ruined her stepsister's future.

676
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:17,520
If you're going to gamble with your future, give it a try.

677
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,860
Kanghan was my employee when you copied her design.

678
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:27,927
It's okay if you want me to call the police.

679
00:50:27,927 --> 00:50:29,840
Do you want to take a guess?

Whose future will be destroyed first,

681
00:50:32,773 --> 00:50:37,053
yours or Hom's?

682
00:50:37,053 --> 00:50:38,960
Are you threatening me?

683
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,660
This is not a threat.

00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,840
I do what I say.

685

The only thing I can do

is give you some money to end this.

Dad, you know I don't like Kanghan.

Just because we hate someone,

690
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,838
doesn't mean we're going to ruin their life.

691
00:51:16,838 --> 00:51:20,480
I'll hold you accountable for everything you do.

692
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,420
I will remove you as the head of the Marketing Department.

693
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,920
I want you to admit your mistake and apologize to Kanghan.

694
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,349

695
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:46,666
Are you all right?

- What's wrong?
- My heel!

698

Is it that funny?

699
00:52:11,067 --> 00:52:15,740
It's the first time you've smiled at me since we came back.

700
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:22,080
It wouldn't be like that if you didn't do nasty things.

701
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,780
Sorry.

702
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,740
I'm sorry about everything.

Can we talk about everything like we used to?

If it's about work, of course we can.

But if it's personal, we can't.

What's the matter, Rossarin? Is there a meeting in the morning?

00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,320
It's an emergency meeting. The chairwoman called the meeting.
