When you were a kid,

you secretly raised a cat in this room without telling me.

One day, the cat bit you.

So I took you to a doctor.

Were you so happy that you didn't want to answer the phone, Din?

If you're going out next time,

99
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,440
you should tell me. So I don't have to worry about you.

It would be nice if no one pursued you.

125

then I wouldn't have a competitor.

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,260
Yes.

163
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,000
But I loved you like a friend.

164
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,340
Good friend.

165
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,530
But we can't be more than friends.

166
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,960
Because friends are the longest-lasting relationships.

167
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:13,520
[Din: I don't want a wall between us.]

168
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,960
[Din: I want to fix what happened.]

169
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,540
[Hom: I've already forgotten about it.]

170
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,840
[Hom: You don't need to fix anything.]

171
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,200
[Hom: From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.]

172
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,840
You've forgotten about it?

173
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,360
Is it so easy to forget?

174
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,940
I have to make you remember, Kanghan.

175
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
What are you doing, Brother?

176
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,720
Why are you back at this time, Din?

177
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,040
Have you finished your work?

178
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,660
I don't have a meeting today.

179
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,020
So I wanted to go back to sleep.

180
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,020
It's beautiful. Nice.

181
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,460
A tent. It's cute.

182
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,960
Are we having a party?

183
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,300
You should ask my brother.

184
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,940
Why did you ask me to come back?

185
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,100
Don't tell me you want me to clean.

186
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,040
No.

187
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,260
Then what do you want?

188
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,020
You─

189
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,460
Look.

190
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,920
What?

191
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,600
It's cute.

192
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,560
Who else did you call, Brother?

193
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,500
No one.

194
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,020
- The chairwoman is here.
- What should we do?

195
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,920
Kanghan, put away your stuff. Hide in the room.

196
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,640
Okay.

197
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,000
Why is there such a childish thing?

198
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,960
Khun Lom, your room is a mess.

199
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,490
Won't you have a relapse?

200
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,100
It's Dr. Zhao's new treatment.

201
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,380
Dr. Zhao said that since my brother was afraid of dirty things,

202
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,940
he asked him to try to live with dirty things.

203
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,420
But... Grandma, Paa Patthama, what are you doing here?

204
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,200
I'm here to bring you home.

205
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm not going back.

206
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,400
Don't disobey me.

207
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,580
Go pack Din's clothes.

208
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,760
Grandma, aren't you going to let me do something I want to do?

209
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,980
I let you sign the contract with KKPP. Isn't it enough?

210
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,660
From now on, I won't let you do whatever you want anymore.

211
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:00,000
I think Din is right about signing the contract with KKPP.

212
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,200
He's wrong.

213
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,660
Because it has something to do with Kheetika.

214
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,300
Here we go again. It's because of Kanghan again?

215
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,320
When will you wake up?

216
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,372
When you stop thinking that Kanghan is a gold digger.

217
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:18,700
She works here because she wants to help her stepfather, doesn't she?

218
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,500
She is a gold digger.

219
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,140
Ms. Chairwoman, the contract has nothing to do with Kheetika.

220
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,140
I can assure you.

221
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,680
You can go back.

222
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,080
I'm not going back anyway.

223
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,960
If you don't come back with me,

224
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,540
from now on, you're not my grandson.

225
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,040
Grandma.

226
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,400
Ms. Chairwoman.

227
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,120
You, too.

228
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,800
If you want to side with Kheetika,

229
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,640
I don't need you anymore.

230
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,540
If you two think Kheetika is more important than me,

231
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,460
I don't have to keep you anymore.

232
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,340
You chose to be hard on Khun Din and Khun Lom.

233
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,680
What will you do if they won't listen to you?

234
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,880
I also want to know, between me and Kheetika,

235
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,580
who they will choose.

236
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,620
Let's go for a barbecue.

237
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,080
I don't want to eat now.

238
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,640
Haven't you heard of it?

239
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,620
Only when you are full can you fight.

240
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,900
You need to eat barbecue to help your brain work.

241
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,780
- Where did you learn that?
- Never mind.

242
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,920
You can't think of a solution by staying at home like this.

243
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,570
Let's go out and eat barbecue.

244
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,100
After eating, I'll help you think of a solution.

245
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,300
The barbecue here is delicious.

246
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,680
P'Kanghan, your squid is done.

247
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,110
Thank you.

248
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,220
I'm the happiest person in the world.

249
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,300
Open your mouth.

250
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,780
Okay.

251
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,320
You don't have to worry.

252
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,820
I've come up with a solution.

253
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,540
What's the solution? Say it now.

254
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,960
Let's eat now. We'll talk about it later.

255
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:44,420
Now, can you please stop pulling that long face at the barbecue pork, squid and shrimp?

256
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,940
Can we rest assured?

257
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,740
Why are you so upset?

258
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,640
We're out for dinner anyway.

259
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,340
- Let's take a photo as a souvenir.
- Souvenir?

260
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,380
- Yes.
- Yes.

261
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,960
One, two, three.

262
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,300
I'm so stuffed and sleepy.

263
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,000
Kanghan, you can't sleep.

264
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,460
You smell like barbecue.

265
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,460
No, I'm sleepy.

266
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,260
Go and take a shower.

267
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,680
Okay.

268
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,120
Didn't you say you would tell us the solution when we returned?

269
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,900
Tell us. What's the solution?

270
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,600
It's simple.

271
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,900
The whole thing happened because of me.

272
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,920
I'll take care of it.

273
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,060
I'm moving out of here tomorrow.

274
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,860
No, Kanghan.

275
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,340
You can't move out of here. Where are you going to live when you move out?

276
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,100
Don't worry about that. I can find a place to stay.

277
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,260
Just stay here.

278
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,340
As for my grandma, let her do what she wants.

279
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,540
It's her business to renounce me. I don't care.

280
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,620
I care.

281
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,240
Even though she hurt me, she raised you.

282
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,240
I don't want you to be unfilial.

283
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,180
When I move out of here, you move back in with your grandmother. Okay?

284
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,560
Khun Lom.

285
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,820
Thank you for taking care of me the whole time.

286
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,140
I made this decision because I didn't want people...

287
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:53,170
who were kind to me to live unhappy lives.

288
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,660
I won't agree with that.

289
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,940
I don't want to lose you again.

290
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,560
Din.

291
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,580
You can let go of Kanghan, Din.

292
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,420
Let Kanghan solve it in her own way.

293
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,340
Brother, do you have to be so cruel?

294
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:22,120
It's more cruel to keep Kanghan here to suffer.

295
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,020
I'm sorry, Kanghan, that we put you in a difficult position.

296
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,380
I also want to apologize for not being able...

297
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,920
to protect you.

298
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,120
Well. Then...

299
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,420
I'll go and pack my stuff.

300
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,840
If you really love Kanghan,

301
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,733
you should do something to make her feel comfortable.

302
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,000
You can't sleep, right, Brother?

303
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,280
Are we going to endure this miserable life under Grandma's oppression?

304
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,000
Don't we have the right to choose who we love?

305
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
Where are you going?

306
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,800
I'm going back to jail.

307
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,920
Din is back, isn't he?

308
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,120
Yes, Madam.

309
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,440
Nannam.

310
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,340
Why are you standing there?

311
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,820
I'm waiting for you.

312
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,860
I'll give you a ride.

313
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,780
Well. P'Kanghan, where are you going to live?

314
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,160
I don't know.

315
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,940
I'll look for a short-term rental.

316
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,800
Then I'll find an apartment.

317
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,020
It would be a headache if you can't find a place to stay, right?

318
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,880
How about this?

319
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,940
Stay with me while you're looking for an apartment.

320
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,040
- No need.
- Don't be shy.

321
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,340
I won't be home much these days for my exams.

322
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,480
Just stay here.

323
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,060
You can move out when you find an apartment.

324
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,900
Come on. Nannam.

325
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,280
No need. I can find a place to live.

326
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,120
Don't be shy. It's all right.

327
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,160
Do you want some cherry tomatoes? They are good for your health.

328
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,060
I'll put them in.

329
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,560
What are you looking at?

330
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,600
It's hot.

331
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,440
Why didn't you blow it first?

332
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,020
I did, but it's still hot.

333
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,400
Nannam.

334
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,740
What can I do for you, P'Sira?

335
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,600
Kanghan is moving out of my place.

336
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,860
Well...

337
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,520
I'm worried about her.

338
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,300
So I thought if she could live with someone she trusted,

339
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,440
she would be taken good care of.

340
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:37,500
I won't worry about Kanghan if she moves in with you.

341
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,100
If you're so worried about her,

342
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,420
you should let her know how worried you are about her.

343

[A son of a rich businessman died of illness]

346

Hello, Khun Phuwit.

347
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,580
Hello.

348
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,180
Khun Phuwit,

349
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,280
did the chairwoman have two sons?

350
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,120
How did you know that?

351
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,800
I just found out on the news.

352
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,980
I happened to see the news of the chairwoman's son's death.

353
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,980
If you still want to work here,

354
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,180
stop prying into the chairwoman

355
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,880
and stop talking about the chairwoman's son.

356
00:30:56,853 --> 00:30:57,800
Why?

357
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,780
Why do you want to keep the matter of the chairwoman's eldest son a secret?

358
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,260
Although you are the chairwoman's person,

359
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,980
if the chairwoman finds out that you are asking about it,

360
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,080
you may never be able to work here again.

361
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:21,000
How long are you going to fight me by playing games in here?

362
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,180
Why don't you spend your time at work?

363
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,920
Because I don't know what to do.

364
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,580
The future is uncertain.

365
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,860
I don't know when Grandma will let me lose everything.

366
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,500
The chairwoman won't do that.

367
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,000
She just wanted to scare you. She wanted you to go back home.

368
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,760
Where did Kanghan move to?

369
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,440
Nannam's place.

370
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,800
That guy's place?

371
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,120
How could you let her go there?

372
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,040
He has a name. Call him by his name.

373
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,420
Nannam. He just treats Kanghan as a friend.

374
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,600
It should be fine.

375
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,240
It's fine now. But things might change.

376
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,450
If a person wants to change, he will not notify you, Brother.

377
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,680
He will change quickly.

378

Khun Lom,

379
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,100
KKPP's marketing staff has arrived.

380
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,200
Is Hom here?

381
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,900
Yes.

382
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,980
We're going to talk about sending them products.

383
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,380
Where is Hom now?

384
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,780
She's in the conference room.

385
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,420
As for the tailoring session,

386
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,220
as soon as KKPP receives GU's designs,

387
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,540
we'll make samples and send them to GU for inspection.

388
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,380
We request no more than two revisions.

389
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,000
Then, we'll start tailoring.

390
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,500
Can we make it three times?

391
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,100
Four times. Five times is fine.

392
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,740
I don't think it will work. Because it will delay the tailoring.

393
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,360
I'm willing to delay.

394
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,080
I think that only by talking more can there be no misunderstanding.

395
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,560
But more talking means more problems.

396
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,180
I think we don't need to talk.

397
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,500
So we can finish the tailoring earlier.

398
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,540
It will be difficult to end if we don't talk.

399
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,460
Khun Sasa, that's what you think.

400
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:23,780
But for me, it would be nice if we talked less or didn't talk at all.

401
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:32,080
Tell me. They are talking about work, aren't they?

402
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,200
I'm not sure.

403
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,300
Why did you get in my car?

404
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,000
- I want to make things clear.
- Clear what?

405
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,960
Didn't I say there was nothing to be cleared between us?

406
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,680
Get out of my car.

407
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,780
No.

408
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,580
You can drive.

409
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,100
Get out of my car now.

410
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,380
Drive.

411
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,280
Do you want to talk here?

412
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,900
- So I can tell everyone that you and me─
- Shut up.

413
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,840
I'll give you five minutes.

414
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,480
Just say it.

415
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,460
I didn't think about it the other day.

416
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,080
I'm sorry.

417
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,780
I don't know what to tell you.

418
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,480
I was confused.

419
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,180
I never thought I'd do that with you.

420
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,500
If it were Kanghan,

421
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,000
you wouldn't be confused, would you?

422
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,720
It shouldn't have happened with anyone.

423
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,800
If you want me to take responsibility for that or compensate you,

424
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,680
just tell me.

425
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,980
If you want to be responsible,

426
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,340
it's easy.

427
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,880
Just leave me alone.

428
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,600
Why?

429
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,620
It reminds me of that awful thing when I see you.

430
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,020
All right.

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,560
- Where is Din?
- He is out of the office.

446

I called him. But he said he wouldn't come back.

About who's going to represent GU in the competition,

449
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,080
I prefer Kheetika's design.

I admit that you're brilliant.

As for Kansinee's design, I think it's ordinary.

I'm sorry that I let you down.

454
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,980
Since you like Kheetika's design,

455
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,400
we will let Kheetika represent GU.

456
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,360
I like her design, but I don't like her.

457
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,540
I'll let Kansinee represent GU...

458
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,420
and compete with Kheetika's design.

Ms. Chairwoman, you can't do that.

460
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:30,640
You said if you like my design, you would let me represent GU.

461
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,660
I choose your design. I like your design.

I can't believe it.

You're a well-known chairwoman.

465

But your mind is so narrow.

466

You don't deserve to be a respected elder.

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,940
is going to turn their back on justice like my mother,

489
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,380
I may have to do something.

490
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,150
Because I don't want the people I love

491
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,200
to regret their actions in the future.

492
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,080
I warned you.

493
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,220
If you choose Kheetika, you will lose everything.

494
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,080
I'm ready to face it.

495
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,900
Ms. Chairwoman, are you okay?

496
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,600
I'm okay.

497
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,960
Did you have a long day?

498
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,400
You look anxious.

499
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,580
Yes.

500
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,040
I'm so tired.

501
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,800
Please bring me a glass of wine.

502
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,920
Hom.

503
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,000
Kanghan.

504
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,020
Are you alone?

505
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,010
Yes.

506
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,860
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

507
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,840
About the contract,

508
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,880
you said I ruined your life.

509
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,260
It could be true.

510
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,940
I'm sorry.

511
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,800
I don't think about it anymore.

512
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,380
It's over.

513
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,900
Then why did you apologize?

514
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,680
I wanted to apologize for hitting you.

515
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,500
I wanted to apologize for being irrational.

516
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,400
Never mind. I understand.

517
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,180
You are always controlled by emotions.

518
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,520
Are you scolding me?

519
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,060
Calm down.

520
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,280
You'd better stop arguing.

521
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,200
You seem upset enough.

522
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,960
Don't make yourself more upset.

523
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:05,080
I think we should relax and talk to get rid of our troubles.

524
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,240
Okay.

525
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,880
Then...

526
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,280
It's my treat today.

527
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,320
- Consider this an apology.
- No.

528
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,140
It's my treat.

529
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,360
I said it's my treat.

530
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,120
I won't let you.

531
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,860
I don't want to owe you.

532
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,080
It's okay. Let me pay for the bill.

533
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,740
I'll pay for the bill.

534
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,580
- No.
- Don't argue.

535
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,020
I'll pay for the bill.

536
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,660
You can order whatever you want.

537
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,960
Why did you come here to get drunk?

538
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,700
Are you upset?

539
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,660
You don't know whether to choose Khun Sira or Khun Sasa. Right?

540
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,180
I'm not upset about that.

541
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,780
Because I never meant to pester the brothers of that family.

542
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,220
I don't want a chaotic and messy life.

543
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,880
I'm unlucky.

544
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,380
About Din.

545
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,340
You can rest assured.

546
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,340
I won't fight you over him.

547
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,839
You don't need to give him to me.

548
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:14,840
I don't want him either.

549
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,660
I don't want to bother either.

550
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,260
I'm tired.

551
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,600
It's tiring enough to look at the future before you start.

552
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,580
Grandma, if there's anything you want to tell me, just tell me.

553
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,400
Is it so depressing to sit with me?

554
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,100
I am not suppressed.

555
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:59,260
You asked me to talk about something, but you haven't said a word.

556
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,480
Hello, Khun Premyuda.

557
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,700
Hello.

558
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,780
- Have a seat, please.
- Thank you.

559
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,600
Serve her a snack.

560
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,220
Okay.

561
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,100
Thank you, P'Sasa.

562
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,240
Hom, wait.

563
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:52,020
[Inspire me - MODC]

564
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,840
Hom, help me.

565
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,280
Why should I help you?

566
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,580
I helped you with the contract.

567
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,160
You should repay me.

568
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,640
- Are you urging me to repay the favor?
- You can think of it that way.

569
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,780
Just help me.

570
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,200
I was tricked here by my grandma.

571
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,080
Okay.

572
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,680
But I'm going to help you in my way.

573
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,280
Hello, Khun Premyuda.

574
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,720
What do you want to see me about?

575
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,400
It's nothing serious.

576
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,280
I want to borrow Din from you.

577
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,560
Where are you going?

578
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,880
We scheduled an appointment for dinner, to watch a movie, and to listen to music.

579
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,000
And... I don't have to say what we are going to do at night. Right?

580
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,340
What's your relationship with Khun Din?

581
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,580
If you want to talk about our relationship,

582
00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:00,040
you'd better let Din tell you about it.

583
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,280
P'Din, do you have a girlfriend?

584
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,040
Let's go, Din.

585
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,840
Otherwise, we'll be late for the dinner and the movie.

586
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,220
See you, Khun Premyuda.

587
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,140
I won't say goodbye to you. I'm sure we'll never see each other again.

588
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,340
Let's go.

589
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,080
Where are you going?

590
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,420
I'm going back to work.

591
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,900
What about our dinner, movie, and music?

592
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,080
Why should I go?

593
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,380
Because... you said we had an appointment, didn't you?

594
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,300
I said that to irritate your grandmother.

595
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,960
You're good at it.

596
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,580
Wait.

597
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,200
Do you want me to bear it alone?

598
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,300
You should be responsible for it.

599
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,480
Why am I responsible?

600
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,500
Do you think my grandma will believe you?

601
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,980
You should make it real.

602
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,500
But we agreed that all I had to do was get you out of there.

603
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,660
Since you've helped me,

604
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,440
could you please help me escape forever?

605
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,320
No.

606
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,860
My head hurts.

607
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,560
Drink it to refresh yourself.

608
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,940
Careful, it's hot.

609
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,040
Thank you.

610
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:13,860
I submitted your name as a GU representative.

611
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,620
Why did you submit my name?

612
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,100
Didn't the chairwoman want Khun Kansinee to go there?

613
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,600
Yes. I submitted both of your names.

614
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,780
Why didn't you think about it before you did it?

615
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,660
I thought about it.

616
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,660
I did it...

617
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,140
because I thought of you.

618
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,520
You...

619
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,880
Don't talk that kind of nonsense in the office.

620
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,580
People will misunderstand us.

621
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,840
When it comes to design, who else should I think of but you?

622
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,440
When it comes to design...

623
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,080
Okay.

624
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,880
Yes.

625
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,000
As for my heart, I'm also thinking of you.

Kind of.

Hello, Khun Parin.

638
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,120
You're great.

639
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,880
You raised your daughter and stepdaughter well.

640
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,880
I'm not great.

641
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:12,080
Khun Hom and Kanghan are both great women.

642
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,400
I think it's because of your education.

643
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,100
You set an example for them.

644

If you want to live a happy and rich life,

645

"Judge an elephant by its tail."

651
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,600
"Judge a woman by her mother."

652
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,500
You chose a comfortable way,

653
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,180
which is to marry a rich man.

654
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,400
I guess you taught it to your daughters.

655
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,440
Can you be reasonable, Khun Premyuda?

656
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:07,380
I didn't teach Kanghan and Khun Hom that.

657
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,860
Are you sure?

658
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,980
I warn you.

659
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:17,840
If someone dares to use dirty tricks against my people,

660
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,980
I'll fight him at any cost.

661
00:53:25,193 --> 00:53:27,157
Kanghan,

662
00:53:27,157 --> 00:53:32,680
has Khun Premyuda been pestering you lately?

663
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,940
Well...

664
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:40,100
She occasionally harasses me because she's worried about her grandson.

665
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,600
Kanghan, can you please do me a favor?

666
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,000
Mom, what is it?

667
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,800
I want to ask you...

668
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,940
Kanghan.

669
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,190
Mom.

670
00:54:03,888 --> 00:54:05,600
Hello, Mom.

671
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,880
Hello?

672
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,400
Mom?

673
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,540

[Preview]
What do you want to do?

675
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,710
I want you to know what it's like...

676
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,440
to be misunderstood.

677
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,240
Remember.

678
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,360
If you don't do what I say,

679
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:57,020
you will be the one who ruined Kheetika's life.

680
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,880
Are you sure you want us to go our separate ways?

681
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,960
Have I ever lied to you?

682
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,900
[Behind the scenes]
- Do you want to eat here?
- We have so many shumais.

683
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,360
- They fell out.
- Don't worry.

684
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,140
Remember to update it.

685
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,560
Cut.

686
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,100

- Go on.

687
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:22,000

- Are you going back?
