It suits you well.

72

But I think the chest area is too tight.

What do you think?

74
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,860
I think this dress suits you well.

75
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,340
You are tall. And your waist is narrow.

76
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,700
But it's a pity you're too conservative.

77

You may not fit this dress.

78
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,440

Do you want to stay away from me?

You must be ashamed of what happened today.

88

Why should I be ashamed? I didn't do anything wrong.

89
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,340
That's right. Then why didn't you go home?

90
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,000
Why are you sitting here?

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,580
Because I would rather not see your face.

92
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,400
You're a bad boss. You're unfair and biased.

I'll terminate your employment. Pack your things and get out of my house.

I'm not leaving. I didn't do anything wrong.

You're the wrong one.

97

Don't point fingers at me.

115
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,940
Well, did you quarrel with P'Sira again?

116
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,640
So you got drunk and took it out on the tree.

117
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,543
If you're upset, just let it out.

118
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:28,460
You can think of me as that tree.

119
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,120
I had a fight with Mr. Wet Wipes because he said I was irresponsible

120
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,600
and didn't admit I was wrong.

121
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,220
But actually, I'm not wrong about that at all.

122
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,700
But he is preconditioned to think that it was my fault,

123
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,540
that I was irresponsible, and that I wasn't concerned about my job.

124
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,460
- He thinks I'm good for nothing.
- That's not true.

125
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,600
If you were good for nothing, P'Sira wouldn't like you that much.

126
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,040
Do you think...

127
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,220
P'Sira likes me?

128
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,420
Yes.

129
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,180
Think about it. P'Sira is a very clean person.

130
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,340
He wants everything to be clean and disinfected.

131
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,980
But in my opinion, you don't look─

132
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,220
You are unconventional. But he accepts that you live with him.

133
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,420
Which means he likes you.

134
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,240
Maybe he's waiting for you to explain it to you.

135
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,880
I'm afraid I can't let you think about it anymore.

136
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,960
I'm sorry.

137

For what?

138
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,800
Well. Actually,

139
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,160
P'Sira and I...

140
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,400
are not dating.

141
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,780
We have a boss and employee relationship.

142
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,560
Don't be angry. Sorry, but if─

143
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,300
If I hadn't told you so that day,

144
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,260
you wouldn't have helped me into his house.

145
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,620
I didn't mean to.

146
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,920
Don't be upset at me. I'm truly sorry.

147
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,180
All right. So you and P'Sira are not lovers.

148
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,460
No. Certainly not.

149
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,640

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,880
I'm kidding.

157
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,780
Come on.

158
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Have you figured out a solution to your work?

159
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,720
What are you going to do?

160
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,820
All I can think of now is to redeem the website's reputation.

161
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,280
It's pretty hard.

162
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
From what you said,

163
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,980
everyone thinks the New Look website sells fakes.

164
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,380
If you want to lure your regular customers back,

165
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,300
you need to find someone famous to help you.

166
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,120
Someone famous?

167
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,400
You can find a brand ambassador or a spokesperson or something

168
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,200
to help you redeem your reputation.

169
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,600
A spokesperson.

170
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,740
That's right. Why didn't I think of it?

171
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,720
You're the cutest.

172
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,880
Thank you so much. I owe you this time.

173
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,320
If this works, I promise

174
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,700
I'll do one thing you want me to do.

175
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,540
I promise.

176
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,080
Thank you so much.

177
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,960
[Hyatt Regency]

178
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,352
Where have you been? Why did you come back so late?

179
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,680
And you didn't answer my call.

180
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,140
My phone was muted.

181
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,980
It was late when I saw it. So I didn't call you back.

182
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,160
Where have you been?

183
00:13:51,273 --> 00:13:53,787
What does it have to do with you?

184
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,140
- I bought some food.
- Who were you with?

185
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,800
Do I have to tell you everything?

186
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,140
Since you're living with me, you have to tell me.

187
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,680
In case you get into any trouble.

188
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,320
You must think I'm a troublemaker. Right?

189
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,560
She turned the room into a dump.

190
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:23,100
- Do you like it?
- It's delicious but a little salty.

191
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,400
Add some sugar, then.

192
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Hom. Eat something.

193
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,320
No, I can't eat.

194
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,360
Wait a minute, Hom.

195
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,860
I have something to ask you.

196
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,060
Did GU find out the cause of the problem with their lingerie?

197
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,360
What happened?

198
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
It's because of Kheetika.

199
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,460
She's the new head of the Design Department.

200
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,800
Your beloved daughter.

201
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,580
Kanghan?

202
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,480
Are you sure, Khun Hom?

203
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,780
My people say the root of the problem is Kheetika.

204
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,660
She released the problematic products and was irresponsible.

205
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,660
They should have thought of that

206
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,480
when they hired her, an incapable copycat.

207
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,300
Did Kansinee tell you that?

208
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,140
Yes.

209
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,620
In that case, it's not believable.

210
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,020
Why? Why is it not believable?

211
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:35,140
Kansinee is like a two-headed bird that sells news to GU and us.

212
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,680
Do you think she is trustworthy?

213
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,880
Hom, I think you should cut Kansinee off.

214
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble.

215
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,680
Don't worry about me. I know what I'm doing.

216
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,140
You'd better worry about your beloved daughter. GU will throw her out.

217
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
Hello, Ms. Chairwoman.

218
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,380
Why didn't you tell me about the matter of the New Look website yesterday?

219
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,160
Because the truth is not yet clear.

220
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,420
And you're busy with that investment thing.

221
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,000
So I would rather not bother you.

222
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,380
You don't have to worry about me.

223
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,640
What about now? Do you know who caused the problem?

224
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,340
It's still under investigation.

225
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,440
Khun Sira, I need to talk to you.

226
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,200
Who is that?

227
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Why is she so rude?

228
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,980
Why didn't she knock before she came in?

229
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,100
You have a client? Sorry.

230
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,140
Go out first.

231
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,680
Wait. Don't go.

232
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,580
Sira, who is that woman?

233
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,420
The chairwoman?

234
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,510
Didn't you hear me?

235
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,470
It's a new designer in the Design Department.

236
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,040
What's her name?

237
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,530
My name is Yuenyong.

238
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,560
Your voice sounds familiar.

239
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,160
Let me see your face.

240
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,660
What should I do?

241
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,820
Should I let her see me?

242
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,720
Can't you hear me? Let me see your face.

243
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,820
I'm sorry.

244
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,120
I have an upset stomach.

245
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,440
I'm deeply sorry.

246
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,700
I apologize for her.

247
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,400
She went straight in. There must be something between them.

248
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,180
No, it's not─

249
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,705
Come into my office. I want to talk to you.

250
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,200
Is there anything I can do for you?

251
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,440
What did you do earlier?

252
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,540
Fart.

253
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,180
Just a fake one. I did that to save us.

254
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,593
We can't let her know I'm working here.

255
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:09,773
Do you know how angry the chairwoman was with you?

256
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:12,085
She wanted me to fire you.

257
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,840
If you fire me,

258
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,250
I'm telling you, you'll regret it.

259
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,020
I regret hiring you.

260
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,380
What did you barge in here for?

261
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,300
Read it and hold a meeting.

262
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,640
What meeting?

263
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,490
It's a plan to solve the problem of the New Look website.

264
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,560
Can you do things according to the rules?

265
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,338
If you want a meeting, you have to schedule an appointment.

266
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,360
Okay. I will inform you now.

267
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,700
Khun Sira, please read it. We'll have a meeting in ten minutes.

268
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,820
Everyone is waiting for you.

269
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,300
Thank you.

270
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,393
Kheetika. Kheetika!

271
00:22:17,065 --> 00:22:19,920
The problem with the New Look lingerie launch

272
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,880
is that the lingerie didn't meet the standards,

273
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,500
which resulted in many customers being dissatisfied and returning the products.

274
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,040
Although we were able to take responsibility through refunds,

275
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,320
it had a negative impact on other New Look products

276
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,798
and the situation is still getting worse.

277
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:40,031
This resulted in a 60% drop in New Look's sales.

278
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:42,558
Because customers think

279
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,803
New Look is a brand that deceives consumers and sells substandard products.

280
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:51,859
So what we're going to do now

281
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:56,320
is to redeem the reputation of New Look.

282
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:01,478
I think we all know what to do.

283
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:06,700
Does everyone know what to do next?

284
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,900
I have discussed this with the website team.

285
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,460
I don't think they have a solution for this.

286
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,653
Right,

287
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:21,453
Manager of New Look?

288
00:23:28,226 --> 00:23:30,867
I called this meeting

289
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,772
because I'm going to present a promotion plan

290
00:23:32,772 --> 00:23:36,072
to redeem the reputation of New Look.

291
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:38,940
Here's my plan.

292
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,240
This is Khun Thatha, a famous model.

293
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,440
I think she is very suitable to be the spokesperson for New Look.

294
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,080
No. I don't agree with Thatha as our spokesperson.

295
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,280
Why?

296
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,680
Why can't she?

297
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,480
You don't have to know why.

298
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,460
I disagree.

299
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,700
Why do you think that making Thatha our spokesperson

300
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,360
can redeem the reputation of New Look?

301
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,200
From the information I've gathered,

302
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,600
Khun Thatha is a very popular model.

303
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,360
She is especially popular with people over the age of 25.

304
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,960
That's also our target audience.

305
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,400
She is among the top five in the country in terms of Instagram follower numbers.

306
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,440
We can take advantage of that.

307
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,000
As far as I know,

308
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,980
Khun Thatha doesn't take endorsements easily.

309
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,560
That's even better.

310
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,780
If we can make her our spokesperson,

311
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,960
it will help New Look redeem its reputation.

312
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,760
In addition to the endorsement,

313
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,680
I'll have the Design Department design a new collection of lingerie for her to wear in the photoshoot.

314
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:02,180
So we can lure the disappointed customers back.

315
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,880
I think it's a good plan.

316
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,420
But why are you so sure that we can make Thatha our spokesperson?

317
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,720
I'm sure I can do it.

318
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,320
Brother.

319
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,080
Brother.

320
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,080
Don't ask Thatha to be our spokesperson.

321
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,780
You asked me to cut Thatha off.

322
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,665
Then why do you want her to be our spokesperson?

323
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,960
What do you want me to do?

324
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,145
Everyone agreed with Kheetika at the meeting.

325
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:47,900
We can find another model. As long as it's not Thatha.

326
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,300
Since you don't want Thatha, go and find a better model.

327
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,880
I'll convince everyone for you.

328
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,520
Where am I going to find one?

329
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,740
That's your business.

330
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,800
You hold the position of manager at New Look. Just find a way.

331
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,420
Prove to me how capable you are.

332
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,180
Okay. I'll find a more famous model than Thatha.

333
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,945
You should convince everyone for me, then.

334
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,620
Okay.

335
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,560
That's it.

336
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,840
You are letting Khun Sasa handle this?

337
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,240
I'm afraid there will be problems.

338
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,280
If there's a problem, Din will get an opportunity to learn.

339
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,740
He will be the chairman.

340
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,326
He has to understand how to work and solve problems when he encounters them.

341
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:41,720
It means you asked Khun Kheetika to contact Khun Thatha

342
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,340
because you want to push Khun Sasa to work.

343
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:51,200
Other than that, I want to get Kheetika out of Din's life.

344
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,600
What does that mean?

345
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,000
Since Din can't let go of Kheetika,

346
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,800
I hope Din can work with Kheetika as a friend.

347
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,140
I also want Din to understand

348
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,640
that love is not about possession.

349
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,480
If you want stable and beautiful love,

350
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,720
you don't have to be lovers;

351
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,340
you can also be friends.

352
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,119
If Din can do it,

353
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm sure Kheetika will be Din's good friend.

354
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,440
You could be a leading man.

355
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,640
You are very handsome.

356
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,658
Are you kidding me, Maha?

357
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,200
Look, Khun Kheetika.

358
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,580
Here's Khun Thatha's agent's number.

359
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,400
- Thank you.
- Go for it.

360
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,420
Please make Khun Thatha our model.

361
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,040
Go for it.

362
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,720
Even if she could reach her, the plan might not work.

363
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,120
It's a waste of time.

364
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,640
Anyway, she's better

365
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,860
than someone who does nothing but make trouble.

366
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:08,800
Who are you talking about?

367
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,500
I think she's talking about you.

368
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,200
You don't have to say it.

369
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,540
Then, I will contact Thatha's agent.

370
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,560
Go for it.

371
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,240
Good luck.

372
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,900
You're the best.

373
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,680
Khun Kansinee,

374
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,360
I know you may still resent Khun Kheetika for plagiarizing your design.

375
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,180
But the past is the past.

376
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,120
Just let it go.

377
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,400
We should work together to get the job done.

378
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,020
Why would I do that?

379
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,920
If you don't do that, you might get fired.

380
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,280
Everyone knows who Khun Kheetika belongs to.

381
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,620
Khun Sasa said he didn't want Khun Thatha at the meeting.

382
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,840
But Khun Sira didn't listen to him.

383
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
That's right.

384
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,760
Don't cause problems and work hard.

385
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,600
Don't make any more mistakes that will cause the company trouble.

386
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,180
Do you understand, Khun Kansinee?

387
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,960
Here is Khun Kansinee's profile and designs.

388
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,820
Why are you looking at Khun Kheetika's and Khun Kansinee's designs?

389
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,080
The lines of these three models are similar.

390
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,940
It's not weird that they're similar.

391
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,180
They might draw similarly.

392
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
Most designers

393
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,740
have a unique way of drawing lines to express their personal characteristics.

394
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,980
The drawings would not be so similar.

395
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,020
Unless they are from the same person.

396
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,080
- Hello.
- Hello, Kheetika,

397
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,095
- have a seat.
- Thank you.

398
00:31:15,095 --> 00:31:17,180
Was it difficult to locate this location?

399
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,100
A little.

400
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,300
Thatha loves this restaurant. It's quiet and private.

401
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,780
Have you ever been to this restaurant?

402
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,400
I'm not familiar with this area.

403
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,540
I appreciate you taking the time to meet me.

404
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,520
Actually, I have a very busy schedule.

405
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,760
I changed my schedule so I could meet you.

406
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,740
I need to attend runway shows, take pictures, and make films.

407
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,420
Yes, it's a very busy schedule.

408
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,220
It's really very busy.

409
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,660
Do you have time to be our spokesperson?

410
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,480
I found it challenging to find time at first.

411
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,640
But it's Din's company.

412
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
I was worried that he'd be unhappy.

413
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,640
So, I asked him to schedule it.

414
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,640
Yes. It's all done.

415
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,520
That's great.

416
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,780
It's no wonder that you'll be GU's granddaughter-in-law.

417
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,800
We'll see how it goes.

418
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,200
Then let's talk about something else.

419
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,720
Let's talk about the endorsement.

420
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,220
Now, New Look is making a change.

421
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,140
We want our image and reputation to keep up with the trend

422
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,200
and go international.

423
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,100
So, we want to find a model who's pretty, smart, and powerful.

424
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,260
For example, Khun Thatha, you.

425
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:45,640
Thatha fits everything you just said.

426
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,320
She's the perfect model for you.

427
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,040
Isn't she the perfect fit?

428
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,240
Of course.

429
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,800
Khun Thatha, I hope you will attract more female customers to continue shopping.

430
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,860
It aligns with our slogan,

431
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,060
"If you want to be as beautiful as Thatha, just come to GU."

432
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,960
That's spectacular!

433
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,960
I'm interested in it.

434
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,810
In addition to having you as our spokesperson,

435
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,880
we would like to have a joint project with,

436
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,160
to design a new collection of lingerie.

437
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,000
Okay?

438
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,040
- Din called.
- Answer the phone.

439
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,440
Hello?

440
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,660
Where are you?

441
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,840
I'm eating. I'm with Khun Kheetika.

442
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,600
Where are you?

443
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,345
I'm nearby.

444
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,560
Surprise.

445
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,560
How did you know I was here?

446
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,398
Did you follow me?

447
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,900
I have an appointment.

448
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,820
Khun Kheetika, what are you doing with Thatha?

449
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,320
We're talking about the spokesperson.

450
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,313
Spokesperson?

451
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:11,180
You─ Are you asking Thatha to be our spokesperson?

452
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,740
What? Didn't you know I was going to be your spokesperson?

453
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,760
As far as I know, Kheetika wants to put you on standby

454
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,640
in case she can't find another model.

455
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,966
Sasa.

456
00:34:25,966 --> 00:34:28,640
I told you, didn't I? I disagree.

457
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,380
What are you talking about?

458
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,940
I'm not a third-rate model. What's wrong with you?

459
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,600
Why do you want to put me on standby?

460
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,400
It's not what you think.

461
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,520
You think too little of me. I'm not taking this job.

462
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,033
You─

463
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,300
Thatha. Thatha.

464
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,540
Do you have to do this?

465
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,520
I already told you. But you didn't listen to me.

466
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,900
Congratulations!

467
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,380
Khun Thatha has decided to be our spokesperson. Right?

468
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,480
Khun Kheetika, what happened?

469
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,260
You look awful.

470
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,660
Khun Kheetika.

471
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:17,140
She's silent. Is Khun Kheetika deaf?

472
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,840
Maha, I told you one salute is enough.

473
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,640
But you used two. Now she's deaf.

474
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,680
- Maybe─
- Is she deaf? Khun Kheetika!

475
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:26,600
I can hear you.

476
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,240
See, she's not deaf.

477
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,180
What happened? You look unhappy.

478
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,120
I'm sorry I let you down.

479
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,500
Khun Thatha...

480
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,100
won't be our spokesperson.

481
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,920
What?

482
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,760
What happened?

483
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,100
Guys, I bought you coffee. Here.

484
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,340
Here. How is it going, Kheetika?

485
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,373
You talked it over with Khun Thatha. Right?

486
00:37:03,373 --> 00:37:07,920
Ms. Big Shot, you went there in person.

487
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,460
You must have succeeded. Right?

488
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,380
Here's your favorite Americano.

489
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
What are you doing?

490
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,950
I want you to sober up.

491
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,020
You'll grow up when you're sober.

492
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,560
This is your job.

493
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,280
♫ If this love has to hurt ♫

494
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,720
♫ I will keep it all to myself ♫

495
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:18,220
♫ Since you deserve to be with that someone who is perfect for you ♫

496
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,840
♫ Let it be me who suffers ♫

497
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,380
♫ And be the one who ends this love ♫

498
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,920
♫ But it's all worth it ♫

499
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,460
Khun Sira, something's wrong.

500
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,400
I don't know if Khun Kheetika was angry with Khun Sasa or what.

501
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,860
She suddenly poured a cup of coffee on Khun Sasa's head, and it looked like she was crying.

502
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,080
Where is Kheetika now?

503
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,340
She left. I don't know where she went.

504
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,220
Khun Sasa─

505
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,620
Is he rushing to find Khun Sasa or Khun Kheetika?

506
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,820
Kheetika poured coffee on Khun Sasa's head. What happened?

507
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:57,420
Here's the thing. We were talking to Khun Kheetika

508
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,040
about Khun Thatha not wanting to be our spokesperson.

509
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,220
Suddenly, Khun Sasa walked in.

510
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:10,540
Khun Kheetika grabbed a cup of coffee and poured it on his head.

511
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,940
Yes. Like this.

512
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,820
I'm sorry.

513
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,940
Khun Thatha doesn't want to be our spokesperson. Right?

514
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,800
Yes. Could it be that she was still angry?

515
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,660
Just then, Khun Sasa walked in.

516
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,940
His words hurt her. So she poured coffee on him.

517
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,960
It must be so. Right, Kirin?

518
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,100
I don't like to get into other people's business.

519
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,710
You don't like to get into other people's business?

520
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,040
Is he talking about me?

521
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:47,400
Nana, tell me. What does that foreigner mean?

522
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,660
It's so obvious, Phi.

523
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,700
Was he judging me?

524
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,400
Oh, my god. It's worse than being judged by Thais.

525
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,700
Kheetika.

526
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,200
Kheetika.

527
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,500
Hey. Are you crazy?

528
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,560
If you were going to help me, why did you pull your hand back?

529
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,000
Well, I wanted to help you.

530
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,960
But... you're dirty.

531
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,840
Is that your reason?

532
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,800
I heard Khun Thatha doesn't want to be our spokesperson.

533
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,740
Tell me. What happened?

534
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,660
Nothing. I told her our plan, but she didn't like it.

535
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,460
So she would rather not cooperate with us, that's all.

536
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,620
It won't hurt you to tell the truth once in a while.

537
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,580
Don't make lying a habit.

538
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,860
Is it about Din?

539
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,680
No.

540
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,360
No? Then why did you pour coffee on him?

541
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,100
Didn't you say you love your job?

542
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,120
But there's something wrong with your job. Are you still going to hide it from me?

543
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,770
I was with Khun Thatha.

544
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,520
Din came in and told Khun Thatha that I had contacted her because I wanted to put her on standby

545
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,800
in case I couldn't find another model.

546
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,940
Then Khun Thatha was angry at me.

547
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,320
Why didn't you tell Khun Thatha the truth?

548
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,540
I did. But she didn't believe me.

549
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,380
Then, you should try your best to explain it to Khun Thatha and let her know you were not lying.

550
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,880
Even if I explained it a hundred times, she wouldn't believe me.

551
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,880
With their relationship, who do you think she will believe?

552
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,180
Are you so angry because you're jealous of Din?

553
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,900
Why would I be jealous of him?

554
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,400
There's nothing between him and me.

555
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,160
You got that look again.

556
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,180
You want to see if I'm lying, right?

557
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,480
Come on. Look.

558
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,140
♫ I don't understand why my heart trembles when I see you ♫

559
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,880
♫ In my dreams, at night and during the day, why do I still long for you? ♫

560
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,720
♫ I can't stop my heart beating out of rhythm like a delirious person ♫

561
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,080
♫ I've really fallen in love with you ♫

562
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,260
♫ The more you try to flee, the more I want to find you ♫

563
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,240
Then find a new model.

564
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,560
No. New Look's model must be Khun Thatha.

565
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,600
What are you going to do next?

566
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,740
I don't know. But I won't give up.

567
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:25,220
I'll make Khun Thatha our spokesperson no matter what.

568
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:55,380
Do you want me to deliver these clothes to your home or your office after washing them?

569
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,700
Throw them away.

570
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,160
Okay.

571
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,400
You asked me to find models' resumes. Here you are.

572
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,920
I don't need it anymore.

573
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,920
Why?

574
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,860
I changed my plan.

575
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,640
If there's nothing else, you can leave. I have something to do.

576
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,220
Get Kheetika for me.

577
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,320
Yes, Khun Sasa.

578
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,600
Is it fun to mess with others?

579
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,960
Who did I mess with?

580
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,800
You asked me to find a model, and I did that.

581
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,420
Do you know how many people I begged for these resumes?

582
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:45,360
I had to leave my own office work for you!

583
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,400
Do you want to take credit?

584
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,940
Go to my mall and get anything you want.

585
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:54,200
Take whatever clothes or bags you want and ask the staff to charge them to my account.

586
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,660
Think of it as compensation for wasting your time.

587
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,280
Hom!

588
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,260
Why didn't you watch where you were going?

589
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,080
You almost got hit by a car.

590
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,220
It has nothing to do with you.

591
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:57,430
I don't want to have anything to do with you.

592
00:45:58,132 --> 00:46:00,180
I just don't want to watch you die

593
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,200
before I take away your property and your family.

594
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,000
Stop dreaming.

595
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,460
I won't give you my stuff.

596
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,280
Then, take care of yourself.

597
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,680
Don't cry in the street like a loser.

598
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,160
I've never lost.

599
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,700
Really?

600
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,800
You came here to work to make Din fall in love with you. Right?

601
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,840
You and your mother are the same.

602
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,180
When you see a rich man, you get close to him.

603
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,960
My mom and I are great, aren't we?

604
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,780
We never failed.

605
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:45,060
Maybe you should ask me how to capture Din's heart.

606
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,351
Don't worry about me.

607
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:48,060
You should worry about yourself.

608
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,940
If Din's grandmother knew you were working here,

609
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,480
you're done.

610
00:46:55,233 --> 00:46:57,240
Do you want to tell on me?

611
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,340
If you want to tell on me, just do it.

612
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,520
But don't do it obviously,

613
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,680
in case Din finds out.

614
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,060
The woman in the photo is called Kheetika.

615
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,640
She's my stepmother's daughter.

616
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,460
They like to deceive rich men.

617
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,720
I told you that because I don't want Din to be deceived like my dad.

618
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,380
Hom.

619
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,690
Din.

620
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,360
When did you get back? Why didn't you tell me?

621
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,400
Why did you betray me?

622
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,700
What are you talking about?

623
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,180
You told my grandma about Kanghan and me?

624
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,740
Why did you do that?

625
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,000
Because I'm worried about you.

626
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,940
I don't want you to be deceived by Kanghan.

627
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,740
Kanghan and her mother are the same.

628
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:02,580
They like to pursue rich men like my dad.

629
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,100
Kanghan has never lied to me.

630
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,460
Trust me.

631
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,320
Stop hanging out with that woman.

632
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,580
No.

633
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,540
By the way, I'm warning you to stay out of my business with Kanghan.

634
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:28,800
Otherwise, we won't be friends anymore.

635
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,520
[Hello my cup]

636
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,200
Who can help me with Khun Thatha?

637
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:03,919
Can I help you?

638
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,580
Nannam.

639
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,280
Yes.

640
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:19,000
Every time I meet you, you're in trouble.

641
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,820
I don't want that either.

642
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:25,160
I also want to work comfortably and easily,

What happened?

645
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,480
Can you tell me?

646
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,880
Well...

647
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:46,980
I had a misunderstanding with the model spokesperson.

648
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,140
She refused to cooperate with us.

649
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:54,260
You should tell her the truth since it was a misunderstanding.

650
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,620
She won't listen to it.

651
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:02,420
I'm sure she doesn't like me anymore.

652
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,500
Why did you stop me with your hand? Aren't you afraid of pain?

653
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,300
It's all right.

654
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,900
As long as I can protect you, I'm not afraid of pain.

Come on.

Does it hurt?

657
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,040
I'm sorry. I went too far.

658
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,540
Let's see. Does it hurt?

659
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,640
I'm kidding.

660
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,240
Are you getting back at me?

661
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,780
I'm not.

662
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:39,100
This is called "As long as someone is worried about you, it doesn't hurt."

663
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:43,480
It makes me feel important.

What?

666
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,640
Everyone wants to be an important person.

667
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,560
Well. Don't you want to be an important person in someone's heart?

668
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,880
Important person?

669
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,800
Important person...

00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,860
Everyone wants to be important, right?

672
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:17,720
The more famous a person is, the more he wants to be valued.
