00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,360
Do you know Khun Lom's parents?

157
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,299
What's wrong?

158
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:16,520
What if I have to pay a visit?

159
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,100
As far as I know,

160
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,080
he once told me that his father died when he was a child.

161
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,432
So he used to live with his mother.

162
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:30,400
His mother left him in an orphanage and disappeared.

163
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,339
Do you have any other relatives besides him?

164
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:36,107
No. I'm my grandma's only grandson.

165
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:40,348
Then... does your grandmother only have one son, your father?

166
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,797
She has two sons.

167
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:44,586
My dad and Uncle Bonthai.

168
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:48,160
But Uncle Bonthai died before I was born.

169
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,280
Anyway, why are you asking that?

170
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,663
It's nothing.

171
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:59,720
It's just that I want to find her weakness and quarrel with her.

172
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,200
With all that going on,

173
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,360
why don't you tell Khun Lom the truth?

174
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,104
Do you want me to tell him that I'm his real grandmother

175
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:33,200
and I killed his parents?

176
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,980
Do you think...

177
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,397
a person like Lom will forgive me?

178
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:43,091
Khun Lom is reasonable.

179
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,500
If you explain it to him,

180
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,660
I think he will forgive you.

181
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,920
He left me for Kheetika.

182
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,380
If he knew the whole truth, he would hate me.

183
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,000
Are you upset because of Khun Lom, Khun Premyuda?

184
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,260
Why should I be upset?

185
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,540
It's normal.

186
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,160
When our descendants were young,

187
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,563
they had no one around but us.

188
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:30,960
When they grow up and meet someone they love,

189
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,460
it's normal for them to think that their loved ones

190
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,660
are more important than us.

191
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,240
Why are you telling me this?

192
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,340
I want you to know it so you can let Khun Lom go.

193
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,180
Why should I let him go?

194
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,160
Lom is my grandson. He has to stay with me.

195
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,401
Do you want to keep him with you even if he's unhappy for the rest of his life?

196
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:55,240
Khun Premyuda,

197
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,060
don't you want your grandson to live a happy life?

198
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,200
Do you want to see his life ruined or do you want him to die before you?

199
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,660
I remember Khun Lom was smiling so much when I took this picture...

00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,100
I'll take a picture for you.

Good.

I haven't seen Khun Lom smile so happily in a long time.

212
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:27,060
He smiled so happily when he woke up

213
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,560
and saw Khun Kheetika last night.

214

Don't you want to see Khun Lom smile like this again?

you've been serving Khun Premyuda since Din's father was alive. Right?

Yes.

245
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,260
Then you must know Khun Lom's father, Khun Bonthai.

246
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,680
I heard the conversation between Kansinee and Khun Premyuda yesterday.

247
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,340
Khun Patthama, can you tell me about it? What happened?

248
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:01,440
I'm not doing this because I want to be a granddaughter-in-law of this family.

249

I'm doing this because I want Khun Lom and Khun Premyuda to understand each other.

I feel sorry for Khun Lom.

As an orphan, not having parents...

252
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,439
is like a stigma and his problem.

253

Khun Bonthai was Khun Premyuda's eldest son. She loved him.

Give me another two months, Brother.

262
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:57,960
The chairwoman had high hopes for Khun Bonthai.

263
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,060
She wanted him to marry a girl of his status.

264
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,880
But Khun Bonthai fell in love with a salesperson in the mall.

Mom, listen to me.

268
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,680
No. Didn't I ask you to break up with her?

269
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,780
She is Khun Lom's mother.

270
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,640
Khun Bonthai took good care of Khun Lom's mother.

271
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,440
He gave her money and bought her a house.

272
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,480
Khun Premyuda was furious when she found out.

273
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,310
She thought Khun Bonthai was deceived.

274
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,847
Then she asked them to break up.

275
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:41,920
But Khun Bonthai wouldn't listen to her.

276
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,860
So he went to Khun Lom's mother.

277
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,940
How did Khun Premyuda find Khun Lom?

278
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,320
After Khun Bonthai disappeared,

279
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,993
the chairwoman sent detectives to look for him.

280
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:00,953
Then she learned...

281
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,360
that Khun Bonthai was killed in a car accident.

282
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,900
Khun Lom wasn't born then.

283
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,560
The chairwoman wanted to take back Khun Lom.

284
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,180
But Khun Lom's mother wouldn't let her. So she ran away with Khun Lom.

285
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:28,400
Then, one day, she contacted the chairwoman.

286
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,610
She was very sick. She said...

287
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,760
she put Khun Lom in an orphanage.

288
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,700
So the chairwoman went to bring Khun Lom back.

289
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,900
Lom doesn't know anything about it.

290
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,580
The chairwoman doesn't have to be angry with him.

291
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,898
Actually, the chairwoman loves Khun Lom.

292
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,720
Maha, we'll end today's meeting in five hours.

293
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,240
And postpone the meeting with Mr. Zhang.

294
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,965
Okay.

295
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,640
Khun Premyuda, I want to talk to you about Khun Lom.

296
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,360
You want to talk to me about Lom. Say what you would like to say.

297
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:36,020
I want to ask you to tell Lom the truth.

298
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,260
What truth?

299
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,840
Tell him he's your real grandson,

300
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,840
and he's the son of your eldest son, Khun Bonthai.

301
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,520
Tell him the truth.

302
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,680
If he knew you were his real grandmother, he would be so happy.

303
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,360
Maybe he'll change his mind and not go abroad.

304
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,400
If he loved me, he wouldn't have chosen you.

305
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,440
He chose me because he doesn't know who you are.

306
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,470
You know how much he wants to call you grandma...

307
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,680
and how much he wants to hug you as your grandson.

308
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,660
Don't you want it?

309
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:29,080
Don't you want to hug him as your real grandson?

310
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,600
Every time I see him, I want to tell him the truth.

311
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,760
But I dare not because I'm scared.

312
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:47,160
I'm afraid to let him know he lost his parents because of me.

313
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,020
I don't want him to hate me.

314
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,160
Aren't you sad?

315
00:25:03,214 --> 00:25:05,940
He's leaving you.

316
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,120
Even if he leaves me,

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,220
at least he won't hate me.

318
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,880
Is my brother your real grandson, Grandma?

319
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,140
The doctor is allowing me to go home.

320
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,280
Now?

321
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,880
Can you leave the hospital tomorrow?

322
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,940
I want to go home.

323
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,840
You know I don't like hospitals.

324
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,080
I'll go change.

325
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,580
[Hyatt Regency]

326
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,760
Kanghan,

327
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,180
I talked to a friend in Italy today.

328
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:16,540
He said he could help me find a job if I went there.

329
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,380
I was thinking we should go next week.

330
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,620
Isn't it kind of hasty?

331
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:31,700
Do you have anything to do here?

332
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,406
No, but─

333
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,200
Don't you need to go to GU for a handover?

334
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,780
No.

335
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,960
Aren't you going to say goodbye to the chairwoman?

336
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,940
Maybe she wants to see you.

337
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,520
Do you want me to go with you?

338
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,860
How is my grandma?

339
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,280
She's still anxious about Khun Lom.

340
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,980
Are you willing to let Khun Lom leave?

341
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,430
Brother.

342
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,780
Brother, can you not go abroad?

343
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,440
If you leave, who will take care of Grandma and the company?

344
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,120
You.

345
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,240
I think you can handle everything alone.

346
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,120
If you stay with me and Grandma,

347
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:22,160
I promise I'll work hard and make no more trouble.

348
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,900
I'm sorry, Din.

349
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,060
I've made up my mind.

350
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,160
Brother, do you remember this man?

351
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,500
This is Uncle Bonthai.

352
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,100
He is Grandma's eldest son.

353
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,960
Uncle Bonthai ran off with a woman, got married, and had a baby.

354
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,320
Grandma looked everywhere for them.

355
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,419
Then, she learned that Uncle Bonthai had died in a car accident.

356
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:08,940
Later, his wife was very ill and passed away.

357
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,260
But before she died,

358
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:19,700
she told Grandma that she had put her child in an orphanage.

359
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,240
An orphanage?

360
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,393
When Grandma found out, she immediately went to get her eldest grandson back.

361
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,960
That eldest grandson...

362
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,520
is standing in front of me.

363
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,360
Can you please stop trying to persuade me?

364
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,920
Everything is too late to fix.

365
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,900
Accept the truth and tell it.

366
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,660
It's never too late.

367
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,360
Everything can be corrected.

368
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,520
Khun Premyuda, just tell Khun Lom the truth.

369
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,547
Okay?

370
00:30:23,106 --> 00:30:27,143
Really? I am your real grandson?

371
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,200
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

372
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,359
I'm sorry.

373
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,079
You know what?

374
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:43,500
I've had to deal with being alone all this time.

375
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,480
No one wanted me.

376
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,130
I had no family. Do you know how bad it was to be an orphan abandoned by his own mother?

377
00:30:56,552 --> 00:30:58,925
- I didn't mean to─
- Do you hate me?

378
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:02,284
Is that why you didn't want to tell me the truth?

379
00:31:02,284 --> 00:31:04,940
I've never hated you, Lom.

380
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,320
Then why didn't you tell me the truth?

381
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,780
Because I was afraid.

382
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:18,090
I was afraid that if you knew...

383
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,873
that I was responsible for the death of your parents...

384
00:31:23,873 --> 00:31:28,100
and making you an orphan,

385
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,890
you'd hate me and not accept me.

386
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,120
I'm sorry.

387
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,460
I'm so sorry, Lom.

388
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,900
I'm selfish.

389
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,800
I hid the truth from you.

390
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,420
I didn't consider your feelings.

391
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,739
Khun Lom!

392
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,193
Sit down.

393
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,889
How is Lom?

394
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:15,107
He locked himself in his room and won't talk to anyone.

395
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,271
I'm sorry.

396
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,437
I looked down on you,

397
00:33:29,437 --> 00:33:32,420
and used to say you were not what you were.

398
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,750
I'm sorry I despised you and your mother.

399
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:42,280
I'm glad to hear you say that.

400
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,640
But i figured it out...

401
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,270
too late.

402
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,770
I lost plenty of things.

403
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,746
As for Lom, I can only entrust him to you.

404
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,480
You─

405
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,120
Are you really giving up on him?

406
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,090
If he wants to live a new life,

407
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,280
I'll let him go.

408
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,580
Thank you for loving Lom.

409
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:25,960
I hope you'll always be there for him.

410
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,510
The chairwoman was here.

411
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,820
What did she want?

412
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,260
She came to apologize to me...

413
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,460
for the bad things she had done.

414
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,930
And she asked me...

415
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,420
to take good care of you.

416
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,470
I have a question.

417
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,750
Were you angry at her...

418
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,500
when you learned that you were her real grandson?

419
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,377
No.

420
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:36,430
- Then why were you─
- Although I was not angry,

421
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,210
I still couldn't...

422
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,940
forgive her.

423
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,720
Why?

424
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,850
Because she never told me the truth.

425
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,460
She made my life...

426
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,120
into a lie all this time.

427
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:44,777
Grandma, Hom is going to eat with us today.

428
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,200
Hello.

429
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,520
Before you want to kick me out,

430
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,957
I'm telling you, I won't leave.

431
00:37:54,957 --> 00:37:56,940
Din said you wouldn't eat anything.

432
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,600
He was worried about you.

433
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,580
He went to all your favorite shops and bought a lot of food.

434
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,660
Just eat some.

435
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,410
Think of this as the strength to fight with me.

436
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,280
Your grandmother looked much better.

437
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,050
But she still looked a little anxious.

438
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,360
She misses my brother.

439
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,660
My brother is leaving in two days.

440
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,107
Khun Sira is really hardhearted.

441
00:38:48,107 --> 00:38:50,934
I want my grandma and brother to meet before he leaves.

442
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:54,880
I want them to forgive each other before they leave each other.

443
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,860
Do you think they'll be willing to meet

444
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,520
and come to an understanding?

445
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,370
I don't know.

446
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,740
But I want to give it a try.

447
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,440
- Do you want to throw a farewell party for me and Khun Lom?
- Yes.

448
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,693
You're leaving in a few days.

449
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:18,980
We should throw you a party.

450
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,681
Yes.

451
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:30,794
Then... Nannam, join the party.

452
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:32,920
I have an exam tomorrow, and it's a major course exam.

453
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,400
I can't skip it.

454
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,700
I'm accumulating credits.

455
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,143
What a pity. I thought we could hang together.

456
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:42,661
It's okay. How about this?

457
00:39:42,661 --> 00:39:44,437
- You're going to Italy, right?
- Yes.

458
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:46,873
I'll go to you when school is out.

459
00:39:46,873 --> 00:39:48,750
That's a deal.

460
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,313
You're so cute.

461
00:39:51,313 --> 00:39:53,450
Nannam,

462
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:56,370
thank you for everything you've done.

463
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,070
I want to thank you, too.

464
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:08,500
Thank you for enlightening me and helping me.

465
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,580
It's my pleasure.

469
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:17,200
Are you sure you won't regret it if you leave like this?

470
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,730
How have you been?

471
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,833
Good.

472
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:45,240
Have you taken care of everything before going abroad?

473
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,140
Everything has been prepared, Ms. Chairwoman.

474
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,070
Are you still calling me "Chairwoman"?

475
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:04,960
Before you do anything next time, you should get everything ready.

476
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,900
I was afraid the plan would be ruined.

477
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,930
Are you sure they'll make up?

478
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,140
If they can't make up,

479
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,390
I'll lock them in a room until they make up.

as a grandchild,

482
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:41,060
had you ever thought about telling me the truth

483
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,669
that I was your real grandson?

484
00:42:42,669 --> 00:42:44,690
I had.

485
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,340
But I was afraid to tell you.

486
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,850
I've never hated you...

487
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,680
since I learned the truth.

488
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,780
I'm angry at you...

489
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,800
because you...

490
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,550
you kept me living a lie this whole time.

491
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,490
After today,

492
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,360
we...

493
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,610
we may never see each other again.

494
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,090
Take care, Ms. Chairwoman.

495
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,490
I'm sorry. (She literally says, "Grandma is sorry.")

496
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,640
In the past,

497
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,760
I kept you living a lie.

498
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,280
It's not too late for me

499
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,830
to tell you the truth now, is it?

500
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,400
You are my real grandson.

501
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:28,820
You can always call me Grandma, my child.

502
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:32,160
You have a grandmother and family.

503
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,520
You're not an orphan, Lom.

504
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,140
Thank you...

505
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:46,220
for telling me the truth.

506
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:51,040
There's one more thing I want to tell you.

507
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,340
Your mother never hated you.

508
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:02,140
She cared for you, loved you,

509
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,761
and was there for you.

510
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,540
[Lom, my beloved baby. I love you.]

511
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,520
If you don't hate me,

512
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,081
can you stay with me?

513
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:55,311
I want to be someone you love.

514
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,740
Give me a chance, Lom.

515
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,780
Can you...

516
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:31,370
Can you tell me...

517
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,293
about my dad, Grandma?

518
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,393
Sure, Lom. Of course.

519
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,480
Thank you.

520
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,920
Do you want me to inspect the mall with you?

521
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,060
In what capacity?

522
00:47:40,093 --> 00:47:42,000
My girlfriend.

523
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:50,947
What about you? Are you ready to walk together with me?

524
00:47:50,947 --> 00:47:53,613
Yes. Mr. Chairman.

525
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,860
I also have a girlfriend. But my darling─

526
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,360
Khun Rossarin is at the entrance waiting for you.

527
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,198
- Let's go.
- Oh.

528
00:48:07,198 --> 00:48:09,360
You didn't quarrel, right?

529
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,560
You are all in pairs.

Stop!

535
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,686
Is this dance difficult?

536
00:48:33,686 --> 00:48:36,285
Because we have new employees,

537
00:48:36,285 --> 00:48:40,100
and some of the old employees didn't dance perfectly.

538
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,209
In that case,

539
00:48:42,209 --> 00:48:46,544
I'll let the vice chairman show you how to dance.

540
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,621
No, Brother. I don't want to dance.

541
00:48:51,621 --> 00:48:55,366
Honestly, I wanted to cancel this rhythmic activity a long time ago.

542
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:57,224
It's a happy dance.

543
00:48:57,224 --> 00:48:59,154
Not a rhythmic activity.

544
00:48:59,154 --> 00:49:03,720
It's an activity that brings executives and employees closer together.

545
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,158
I think you should dance.

546
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:06,926
No.

547
00:49:06,926 --> 00:49:10,346
It's not hard. You got this. Give it a try.

548
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,080
I'm sure you can do it.

549
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,819
Me, too.

550
00:49:15,513 --> 00:49:18,053

"Gossip:

563
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,940
The two brothers of the Kukitcharoen Family,

564
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:33,960
Khun Sira and Khun Sasa purchased diamond rings one after another.

565
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,900
Maybe they'll announce their marriages soon."

566
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,463
It's all your fault.

567
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,168
You asked me to hit on Khun Sira.

568
00:50:40,168 --> 00:50:42,080
Great. They both have girlfriends.

569
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,200
Just because they bought diamond rings

570
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,300
doesn't mean they're going to get married.

571
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:52,880
P'Hoymen, even kids know what it means to buy a diamond ring.

572
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,660
All right.

573
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,180
There are many good men.

574
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,987
I'll set you up on dates.

575
00:51:00,987 --> 00:51:04,900
No need. I'm tired of men.

576
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,820
Ouch, what's wrong with you?

577
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,720
It's okay.

578
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,400
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

579
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,119
- Nong Thatha─
- Ouch.

580
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:17,832
Does your arm hurt?

581
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,300
I'm in a hurry.

582
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,720
Then...

583
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,580
P'Hoymen.

584
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,120
Can you please give me your contact information?

585
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,220
I'll take her to the hospital, so I can tell you about her condition.

586
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,580
Okay, I'll give you a business card.

587
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,480
Okay.

588
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,700
Remember to contact me.

589
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,373
I will be responsible for it.

590
00:51:42,373 --> 00:51:44,073
Okay.

592
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,780

593
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,592
I'm pretty. I have priority when choosing a boyfriend.

No.

601
00:52:47,688 --> 00:52:49,600
Just one kiss.

No.

- What's wrong?
- It's morning.

606
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:25,620
It's time to get up, Khun Lom and Khun Kanghan.

607
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,060
You've been sleeping and wasting time.

608
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,588
We were already awake, Pretty.

609
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:35,613
You have a lot of health check-up items today,

610
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:38,859
including examinations of heart, blood, blood sugar, blood lipids,

611
00:53:38,859 --> 00:53:42,151
lung, abdomen, liver, and kidney.

612
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,340
Why do I need a physical examination? I am healthy.

613
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,480
Khun Lom, it's not for you. It's for Khun Kanghan.

614
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:58,347
- Why?
- Because Khun Kanghan is going to have a baby.

615
00:53:58,366 --> 00:54:03,556
Little Kanghan. Little Lom. Hee-hee.

616
00:54:06,906 --> 00:54:08,806
It knows a lot.

617
00:54:14,799 --> 00:54:16,990
- Pretty.
- Get out.

618
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:20,260
- Get out.
- Get out.

619
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,820
Close your eyes.

620
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,940
If you peek, you'll get a stye.

621
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,040
Perfect ending.

622
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,640

♫ Pretending to be cool ♫

643
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:10,340
♫ Even though my heart is lonely ♫

644
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:15,280
♫ Wanting that someone to be by my side ♫

645
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,320
♫ My heart wants to open the door ♫

646
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,320
♫ And let you in ♫

647
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:27,280
♫ I want you to understand and for you to know ♫

648
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,360
♫ I want to have only you ♫

649
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,360
♫ Just only you ♫

650
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,640
♫ My inner voice ♫

651
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,620
♫ Says I love you with all my heart ♫

652
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:43,340
♫ The more I force myself not to waver ♫

653
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:46,380
♫ The more I lose to you in every way ♫

654
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:51,080
♫ Can I have you by my side? ♫

655
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:58,780
♫ Just wanna be with you ♫
