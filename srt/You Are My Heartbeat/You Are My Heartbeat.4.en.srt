00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,380
Okay.

156
00:12:48,838 --> 00:12:51,380
Why did Khun Sira call you?

157
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:58,000
Khun Sira asked me to investigate the background of the copycat.

158
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:01,252
Why is Khun Sira interested in investigating this matter?

159
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:03,433
Does he want to involve the police?

160
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,520
I think Khun Sira might want to─

161
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,540
See! I know.

162
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,380
- Good for you. You're getting better.
- My eyes are sharp.

163
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,820
- I can see what you're thinking.
- Good. You're great.

164
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,540
Don't let me catch you.

165
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,220
Ms. Chairwoman, do you know her?

166
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,900
Din was once tricked by her.

167
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,240
I don't want to know such a dirty woman.

168
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,593
You...

169
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:54,280
I'm sorry I turned down your proposal.

170
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,780
That moment. I cannot forget.

171
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,980
Din liked her.

172
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,820
[Mom]

173
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
[Mom]

174
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,900
[Mom]

175
00:15:30,193 --> 00:15:31,990
Dear.

176
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:34,640
Drink some warm milk.

177
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,120
You were up all night.

178
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,680
Maybe it will make you feel better.

179
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,200
Thank you.

180
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,980
But I can't drink anything. I'm worried about Kanghan.

181
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,980
She has been gone all night and can't be reached.

182
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,760
I don't know where she has gone.

183
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:53,300
Dad.

184
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,166
Why did you put out the word that Kanghan didn't do it?

185
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,333
Because I don't believe Kanghan plagiarized it.

186
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,660
I must correct the news.

187
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,780
But what you're doing is like a slap in my face.

188
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,880
I've made my decision, Dad.

189
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,000
And why did you make such a decision?

190
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,940
You said Kanghan plagiarized someone else's design.

191
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,920
Is that based on evidence or out of prejudice against her?

192
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,731
You're a manager now.

193
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:19,200
You should use your head.

194
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,466
You know what? What happened yesterday was a disgrace to our company.

195
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,603
Are you blaming me?

196
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:29,493
I didn't do anything wrong.

197
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:32,000
When you said that in front of the reporters,

198
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,759
you were not only admitting that Kanghan plagiarized it

199
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,660
but also admitting that KKPP was wrong.

200
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:43,473
Haven't you thought about it?

201
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:46,413
It could be that GU plagiarized our design.

202
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:48,238
GU plagiarized our design?

203
00:16:48,238 --> 00:16:49,357
Yes.

204
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:53,880
As you know, Kansinee used to be one of us.

205
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,645
And you worked with her.

206
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:58,558
Don't you know what kind of person she is?

207
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:01,578
Well...

208
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:06,180
I didn't know what to do.

209
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,360
You just need to trust our people.

210
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,622
You want me to trust Kanghan?

211
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:13,729
Yes!

212
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:15,435
Just like I trust her.

213
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,740
Kanghan has self-respect.

214
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,832
She would never do such a demeaning thing.

215
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:23,600
She has self-respect, huh?

216
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,160
If she really had self-respect,

217
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,280
she and her mom wouldn't be hanging on to us.

218
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,876
You paid her tuition.

219
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:33,765
You paid her to go abroad.

220
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:36,040
- Hom─
- Dear.

221
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,209
Khun Hom, after Kanghan's father died,

222
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:45,646
she paid for her tuition with her father's insurance money.

223
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:49,500
As for the cost of studying abroad, she used the money she earned.

224
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,460
She never used your money.

225
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,627
I beg of you, Khun Hom.

226
00:17:54,627 --> 00:17:57,207
Please stop bullying Kanghan for once.

227
00:17:57,207 --> 00:18:02,020
Please give us a chance to live together. Okay?

228
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,520
What if I say no?

229
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,020
I don't want you or your daughter to stay here.

230
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:14,344
You don't have to drive us out.

231
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,740
I'm leaving anyway.

232
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,057
Kanghan.

233
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:22,620
Kanghan, I told you that you don't need to go anywhere.

234
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,260
I know you care about me.

235
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,040
But please let me stay somewhere else.

236
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,220
I'm not leaving because I'm afraid of you.

237
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,787
It's that I don't want to make trouble for your dad.

238
00:18:34,787 --> 00:18:38,520
It's a headache for him to have you,

239
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,258
who's thinking about his properties all the time.

240
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:44,180
As for yesterday,

241
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,320
I was wrong, too.

242
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,880
I left without explaining myself or proving my innocence.

243
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,640
I caused damage to KKPP.

244
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:57,492
Please let me take responsibility for my mistakes.

245
00:18:57,492 --> 00:18:59,900
I request to resign.

246
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:03,340
Kanghan.

247
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,520
Kanghan, my child!

248
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,400
Kanghan!

249
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,900
Kanghan, where are you going?

250
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,673
I would rather not stay here. It's depressing living here.

251
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:43,590
I'm sorry to say that.

252
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,083
I understand.

253
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,630
But about your resignation,

254
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,450
- I think─
- Please let me resign.

255
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:55,080
I don't want KKPP to suffer another loss because of me.

256
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:58,005
About plagiarizing,

257
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:02,158
I promise I'll find evidence that I didn't do it.

258
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,868
Kanghan! I won't let you go.

259
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:14,486
We finally have a chance to live together.

260
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:17,723
You also know that I may not be with you for long.

261
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:19,923
Please, don't abandon me.

262
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:22,817
If you want to live with me,

263
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,850
then let's move out from here.

264
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,603
Move out from here?

265
00:20:34,603 --> 00:20:37,316
Where can we go?

266
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:38,730
Just stay here.

267
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,550
I don't want you to get into trouble again.

268
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:45,676
You don't want me to get into trouble,

269
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,302
or you don't want to get yourself into trouble?

270
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:59,690
If you really want to be with me,

271
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,183
let's move out from here.

272
00:21:04,183 --> 00:21:06,223
Can you do it?

273
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,670
♫ Pretending to be cool ♫

274
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,711
Kanghan.

275
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:42,250
Take good care of yourself.

276
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,690
Remember to call me.

277
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,970
♫ Wanting that someone to be by my side ♫

289
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,433
Students are not permitted to enter, Nong.

290
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:40,208
But my dad is in there.

291
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,957
- I'm looking for my dad.
- No. You can't go in there.

292
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,210
- What?
- Please get out!
- No.

293
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,370
- Just go.
- I want to drink!

294
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,845
That's my dad.

295
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,862
- What?
- Dad.

296
00:22:54,862 --> 00:22:57,032
- Let go!
- Dad.

297
00:22:57,032 --> 00:22:58,751
- Dad! Dad.
- Let go!

298
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:01,283
If you want to continue to drink, be quiet.

299
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:02,728
The other customers were annoyed.

300
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:04,773
What I want to do is my business.

301
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:07,270
I like to shout. I have money to pay.

302
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,790
- Dad.
- Then keep your money.

303
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,810
Hey, you can't do this to me!

304
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,170
- You can't do this.
- Let's go home, Dad.

305
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,943
Let's go home.

306
00:23:15,943 --> 00:23:19,523
Kanghan, let's go to your mom. Okay?

307
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,150
Come to your senses, Dad.

308
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,020
A woman like her only loves money.

309
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,770
She won't come back to us.

310
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,910
Kanghan, how could you say that?

311
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,290
Anyway, she's your mom.

312
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,670
I didn't abandon my mom.

313
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,990
My mom died a long time ago.

314
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:53,798
Kanghan.

315
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:57,850
I'm sorry, girl.

316
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,570
Sorry.

317
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,410
Sorry.

318
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,380
Sorry.

319
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,390
Dad.

320
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,990
I miss you.

321
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,910
The woman who plagiarized our design is called Khun Kheetika.

322
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:38,130
She's the daughter of Khun Parin, the new wife of Khun Papop, Chairman of KKPP.

323
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,470
Khun Kheetika graduated from a university in Thailand.

324
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,970
Then, she went to Milan to study Fashion Design.

325
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,090
She has worked with many well-known designers and brands.

326
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,810
When did Kheetika and Din meet?

327
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,070
What did you say, Khun Sira?

328
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:05,330
She graduated abroad and has worked with well-known designers.

329
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,110
It proves that she has talent.

330
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,670
But she plagiarized the design of an ordinary designer.

331
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,110
Yeah.

332
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,850
Her resume says she specializes in Fashion Design in Milan.

333
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,630
And she has won several awards in costume design competitions.

334
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,790
Many well-known brands offered her jobs.

335
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,350
But there is no information on where she will work.

336
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,990
It means she might not be lying.

337
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,270
Why didn't she explain herself or prove herself innocent that day?

338
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,610
Yes.

339
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,530
Why did she choose to run away?

340
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,330
So what are you going to do about it?

341
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,050
Do you want to sue her?

342
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,470
I won't do that kind of meaningless thing.

343
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Then why did you ask me to check her background?

344
00:25:54,965 --> 00:25:57,690
I want Kheetika to work here.

345
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,030
I don't know what I did in my last life...

346
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,210
to make this life so hard.

347
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,650
Have I ever had a good time?

348
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,990
When will I have good luck?

349
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,410
Khun Sira.

350
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,210
Do you want Khun Kheetika to work with us?

351
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,650
Is there something wrong with my voice or your ears, Rossarin?

352
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,810
You made it very clear. And my ears are good.

353
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,030
I'm just not so sure.

354
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,630
Yes, I thought

355
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,070
you didn't like Khun Kheetika.

356
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,270
I don't like her.

357
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,250
But someone likes her.

358
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,210
Okay, call me if there's anything new.

359
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,090
Okay. Thank you.

360
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,430
Khun Sira, I've looked into it.

361
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,150
Khun Kheetika doesn't live with Khun Parin anymore.

362
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,830
She doesn't have any close friends.

363
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,030
Her friends from school barely contact her anymore.

364
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,790
So, we don't know where Khun Kheetika is now.

365
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:58,150
Khun Sira, what are you thinking?

366
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:04,250
I'm thinking if my man isn't good enough.

367
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,810
He couldn't find Din.

368
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:12,170
And he couldn't find that sloppy girl.

369
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,510
Have you ever found anyone?

370
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,810
We can go.

371
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:30,310
- Maha, did you hit someone?
- No, someone is in the way.

372
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,050
Ghost! Ghost!

373
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,690
It's wrapped around my neck, Khun Sira!

374
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,410
Maha, it's not a ghost!

375
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,810
Calm down! It's the seatbelt.

376
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,030
Sorry.

377
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:03,070
Sorry.

378
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,350
Hey, Khun Sira.

379
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,870
It's Khun Kheetika. She's there!

380
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,430
- Catch up with her, Maha.
- Yes.

381
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,436
Let me move the car first, Khun Sira. People here are driving fast.

382
00:29:34,192 --> 00:29:36,805
She disappeared so quickly, Khun Sira.

383
00:29:36,805 --> 00:29:38,630
Khun Kheetika!

384
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,610
I saw her around here, but she's already disappeared.

385
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,590
She's drunk.

386
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,350
She shouldn't have disappeared so quickly.

387
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,830
Help...

388
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,330
I thought I heard someone calling for help.

389
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,070
I heard it. The sound is nearby, Khun Sira.

390
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,370
Help.

391
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,390
Help.

392
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,010
Khun Sira, there she is. It's Khun Kheetika.

393
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,510
Help.

394
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,307
Wow.

395
00:30:12,307 --> 00:30:15,316
How could she be like this? Maha,

396
00:30:15,316 --> 00:30:17,410
go deal with her.

397
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,550
Yes. Khun Kheetika, are you okay?

398
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,370
Oh, your stuff is all over the place.

399
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,470
Help.

400
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,630
My suitcase got hit by a car and flew here.

401
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,690
- Okay.
- Then I asked if it was hurt.

402
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,710
- But it didn't answer.
- Okay.

403
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,710
It's just lying here.

404
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,390
- And I can't close it.
- Yes.

405
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,010
It didn't answer? Wait.

406
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,410
My suitcase is dead!

407
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,910
- I'll check it.
- My suitcase is dead.

408
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,930
It's still alive, Khun Kheetika.

409
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,050
Calm down. I'll take care of it.

410
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,490
That's right.

411
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,390
I'll give it CPR.

412
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,590
- CPR.
- CPR. Press.

413
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,250
Press.

414
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:04,400
- Rescue breathing.
- Okay.

415
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,170
Okay. Blow.

416
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,770
Don't leave me.

417
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,950
Its pulse started to beat.

418
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:13,150
I'll move it out first.

419
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,150
My suitcase!

420
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,830
Don't take my suitcase away.

421
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,750
No, I'm just moving it out.

422
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,850
No, don't take my suitcase away.

423
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,450
Okay.

424
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:31,050
She looks very drunk.

425
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,810
What should we do?

426
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,630
My suitcase is awake.

427
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,370
Look at her.

428
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,810
Let's do something to sober her up.

429
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:55,170
He's not bad looking. How could he let his girlfriend sleep there?

430
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,690
She's not my girlfriend.

431
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,930
Khun Sira. I got some water.

432
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,830
- Help her wash her face.
- Okay.

433
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:13,198
Khun Kheetika, wipe your face with the wet towel, and you'll be sober.

434
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,090
Here.

435
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,730
Leave me alone. I want to sleep.

436
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,370
Wipe your face with the wet towel, and you'll be sober, Khun Kheetika.

437
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,050
Be good.

438
00:32:27,643 --> 00:32:29,150
- Maha.
- Yes.

439
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,830
Give me the water.

440
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:53,030
Why did you pour water on my head?

441
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,030
So that you will sober up.

442
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,890
You're so drunk.

443
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,130
How could you let yourself get so drunk?

444
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,150
Aren't you scared at all?

445
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,310
You're a woman.

446
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:18,834
What would you do if someone were to do something bad to you?

447
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:26,170
Mr. Wipes.

448
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,310
What did you call me?

449
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,150
Mr. Wipes, of course.

450
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,750
You use wipes every time we meet.

451
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,990
What are you doing here?

452
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,750
What are you doing here?

453
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,810
You're drunk. And you threw up everywhere.

454
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,010
Khun Sira and I helped you up.

455
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,470
Thank you.

456
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,030
Be careful.

457
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,330
Khun Sira, are you okay? Are you okay?

458
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,610
I'm okay.

459
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,810
I want to talk to you.

460
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:08,170
You're caught up in a plagiarism scandal.

461
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:13,030
I don't think any company will hire you.

462
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:17,110
So I'm here to offer you an opportunity.

463
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:25,970
People from the Kukitcharoen Family may think they are great.

464
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,430
That's why you look down on others,

465
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:35,030
throw money at others, and throw food at others.

466
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:40,870
Do you think I don't have a place to work?

467
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,890
I'm telling you, I don't need your sympathy!

468
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:46,050
I hate you guys the most!

469
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,430
I hate you!

470
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,310
I hate you!

471
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,870
I hate you.

472
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,970
I hate you...

473
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,770
That's it?

474
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,930
Oh, she's so drunk she passed out again.

475
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,410
She's like a wet wipe.

476
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,950
If it were snowing,

477
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,370
I'd be like a man carrying a woman on his back in a Korean drama.

478
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,890
Khun Kheetika, are you okay?

479
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,610
Sorry.

480
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,010
Go low, Khun Kheetika.

481
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:40,390
Where are we taking Khun Kheetika, Khun Sira?

482
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,050
Her home.

483
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,270
She's so drunk.

484
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,111
Her parents will scold her.

485
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,590
Then...

486
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,230
Drive her to a hotel.

487
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,810
Okay.

488
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,590
Excuse me, Khun Sira.

489
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,450
Hello, Darling.

490
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,810
I'm thirsty.

491
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,930
I'm with Khun Sira.

492
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,270
I'm thirsty.

493
00:36:12,685 --> 00:36:14,470
What are you talking about?

494
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,450
I said I was thirsty. Can't you hear me?

495
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,990
Let go of my clothes. Let go.

496
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:30,003
Maha!

497
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,150
It's hot.

498
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,910
What are you doing?

499
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,590
Don't take off your clothes.

500
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,850
- I'm really with Khun Sira.
- It's hot.

501
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,350
It's hot.

502
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,230
No. That's indecent.

503
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,490
What are you doing?

504
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,070
What do you want to do?

505
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,230
Do you want to insult me?!

506
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,950
- Help!
- Do you want to insult me?

507
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,290
- Hey, you─
- Help. He's insulting me!

508
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,290
Do you want to insult me?

509
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,750
Dear, I'm not insulting anyone.

510
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,930
- I have to go, Dear. I'm not insulting anyone.
- Let go.

511
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,570
- Hello, Dear. I...
- Help!

512
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:14,570
We're in trouble again. You'll kill my boss.

513
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,801
Khun Sira, come out first.

514
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:18,250
Be careful.

515
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,930
What is going on?

516
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,910
Are you all right, Khun Sira?

517
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,870
Get that sloppy girl out of my car now.

518
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,670
I... I may not be able to stay and help you.

519
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,290
I have to explain it to my girlfriend.

520
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,150
Because she misunderstood me, Khun Sira.

521
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,990
Maha, you can't leave me like this.

522
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:50,430
If I don't leave you now, my girlfriend will leave me.

523
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,884
I'm sorry.

524
00:37:51,884 --> 00:37:54,470
- I have to go.
- Maha.

525
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:57,130
I'm sure you can take care of it. See you tomorrow.

526
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,790
Maha!

527
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,050
Hey.

528
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:58,010
- Wuhu!
- Be quiet, okay?

529
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,330
Train. Wuhu!

530
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,610
Your feet.

531
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,250
Train.

532
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,810
I'm not going in there.

533
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,510
Put your feet down.

534
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,710
Behave, okay?

535
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,970
Put your foot down.

536
00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:19,290
If you don't put your feet down, I'll chop them off and throw them away.

537
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:35,120
No.

538
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,970
Can I help you?

539
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,470
Thank you.

540
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:47,010
You grab her feet. And I'll push her in.

541
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,743
Thank you.

542
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,250
Feet.

543
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,890
Kheetika.

544
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,590
No.

545
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,210
Which floor?

546
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,870
25th floor.

547
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:15,010
I also live on the 25th floor. I just moved in.

548
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,420
My name is Nannam.

549
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,576
- I'm Sira.
- Okay.

550
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,490
Hey, be quiet. Okay?

551
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,590
I'm trying to sleep.

552
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,990
It's so hot.

553
00:41:36,616 --> 00:41:38,250
What's wrong with you?

554
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:48,870
I feel more comfortable.

555
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:19,090
Is it right or wrong to let you into my room?

556
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:29,050
You are so sloppy.

557
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,430
You don't look like a woman at all.

558
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,190
How could Din like her?

559
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,930
Good. I ducked.

560
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,690
What did I do wrong?

561
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:14,470
Why did everyone forget about me?

562
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:18,890
I don't know who forgot you,

563
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,870
but I will never forget you.

564
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,310
Are you going to throw up? No.

565
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,170
The table is expensive.

566
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,810
Not on the sofa.

567
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,350
No.

568
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,270
I'm flying.

569
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,850
Hey, you.

570
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:58,510
Come on.

571
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,850
Feel free to throw up if you want to.

572
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,091
But don't throw up on my bathroom floor.

573
00:44:03,091 --> 00:44:06,110
Otherwise, I'll throw you out of the room.

574
00:44:08,942 --> 00:44:10,571
Throw up.

575
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,316
Dad, Don't abandon me.

576
00:44:19,316 --> 00:44:21,828
I miss you.

577
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,770
Are you crying?

578
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,090
I am lonely.

579
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:45,330
Please help me.

580
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,173
Din, get up now.

581
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:10,206
Okay, Grandma.

582
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:16,530
Paa Pat, I thought I heard my grandma just now.

583
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:20,150
- Is it this voice?
- Din, get up now.

584
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,670
Did you trick me with this again?

585
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,910
It has been working well for you since you were a kid.

586
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:31,290
Come on, get up. You can go and take a shower.

587
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,410
Go. Go.

588
00:45:36,423 --> 00:45:39,090
Well, how did I get here?

589
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:42,410
Ms. Chairwoman asked them to check your credit card records.

590
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:45,510
That's how they found out that you were at the club.

591
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,590
Couldn't she just let me do whatever I want for once?

592
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:51,290
You have to obey her once in a while.

593
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,690
She has been waiting for your help for years.

594
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,150
Now you've graduated. Go and help her manage the company.

595
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,370
She's old. Let her rest.

596
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,990
Brother is taking care of the company.

597
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,210
You know, I don't want to manage the company.

598
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:10,270
You also know that I like...

599
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,970
What do you like?

600
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,392
I like...

601
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,330
This.

602
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:27,030
I know. You like music.

603
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,910
You want to own your own studio and write your own songs.

604
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:35,590
But now, you need to do your duty first.

605
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:38,390
After you've done your duty,

606
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:42,890
you can do what you like.

607
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,110
Do you think she wants to be so strict with you?

608
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,390
No.

609
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:52,270
She knows the harder she is strict with you,

610
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:57,130
the more you will resist.

611
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,070
But she has to do it.

612
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,170
It's all for your future.

613
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:04,190
So, get up and take a shower.

614
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,850
Just go.

615
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:10,270
Khun Din.

616
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:13,570
Come on. Get up.

617
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,230
Go take a shower. Go.

618
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,130
Help me undress.

619
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,690
Khun Din, you've grown into a handsome man.

620
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,190
You're no longer a 3-year-old.

621
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,910
Look at you.

622
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:27,530
All right.

623
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:31,530
Go take a shower after this.

624
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:36,190
Take a shower. I'll get you a bath towel.

625
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,125
Here. Go take a shower.

626
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:42,210
Go take a shower. Go.

627
00:47:43,312 --> 00:47:45,730
Where's my grandma now?

628
00:48:07,736 --> 00:48:10,156
Where are you going?

629
00:48:10,156 --> 00:48:11,823
Back off.

630
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,790
I said back off.

631
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,750
Where are you going, Khun Din?

632
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:24,530
You said my grandma was out of the country for a couple of weeks.

633
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,070
Then what am I doing at home?

634
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,120
That's right. She's not home.

635
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:33,990
But that doesn't mean you can go wherever you want.

636
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:37,430
Are you going to control me instead of my grandma?

637
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,350
Don't call it "control."

638
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:42,550
Call it "accompany."

639
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:46,805
Okay?

640
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:55,050
Khun Din. Khun Din, what's wrong?

641
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,550
My stomach hurts, Paa.

642
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:59,470
Hold on. What kind of pain do you feel?

643
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:02,690
Diarrhea? Bloating? Constipation? Or hiccups?

644
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,730
What's wrong? Tell me so I can find the right medicine for you.

645
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:08,910
I don't know. My stomach has been hurting since this morning.

646
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:11,630
- I think it's because I didn't eat on time.
- Exactly.

647
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:16,590
I don't feel better after eating, and the pain is getting worse.

648
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:19,620
Right. Appendix.

Out of the way!

651

Yes. Get out of the way. I need to go to the hospital.

652

No, Khun Din. I didn't ask the bodyguards to make way for you

but asked them to make way for Dr. Zhao.

Hello, Doctor.

Everyone's here.

You don't have to do that. We are friends.

Did you call him?

660
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:05,150
Yeah. I did it in case you suddenly got appendicitis,

661
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:09,810
headache, dizziness, scapulohumeral periarthritis, or loss of appetite due to gastritis.

00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,050
Khun Din, you can get any disease,

00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,390
because the doctor will be with us all day.

664
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:18,010
Right. I'm off today.

665

Just say what you want me to check. I'll do my best.

Paa Pat, do you have to do this to me?

671
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,570
Khun Din,

672
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,990
don't be mad at me.

No, Khun Din.

You are mad at me, aren't you?

678
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:06,830
You see me as a ruthless person.

679
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:19,290
Khun Din, I know you want to go out.

680
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,390
I give up.

681

I'll let you go to a place.
