Why did you let this woman work here?

I hired Kheetika because she was capable.

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,300
But as far as I know, all she's capable of is making trouble.

In particular, when it comes to plagiarism of our company's design.

The plagiarism thing was a misunderstanding.

42
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:51,326
We've found out the truth. Kheetika didn't copy anyone's design.

Here are the sales and growth in the overall market and the New Look website.

we've seen a 20% increase in sales.

But Kheetika is not the only one who's doing great.

I want an explanation. Why are you terminating my employment?

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,380
I won't allow you to get close to Din.

50

Do you think I will pester Din because I'm close to him?

51
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:36,910
Din and Kheetika have a boss and employee relationship.

52
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,920
Are you sure they are just a boss and his employee?

53
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,720
Then... did the man you sent to spy on Din and Kheetika

54

say that they are seeing each other?

Enough.

Grandma, if you want to fire Kheetika, just do it.

57
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,060
It's not bad. So I won't be watched.

58
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,720
Then, if we want to meet,

we can meet outside.

So you don't have to worry about someone telling on us.

I'll have HR compensate Kheetika for three months' salary.

Din, come back and make it clear.

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,668
Din, did you ask the chairwoman to fire Kheetika

67
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:02,008
because you don't want to follow her lead?

68
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:03,800
That's right.

69
00:05:04,393 --> 00:05:06,500
Grandma told us that she would come back next week.

70
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,700
But she suddenly appeared in the company.

71
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,848
If you ask me, Grandma must have planned it in advance.

72
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:13,960
She wanted to catch us off guard.

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,640
If I'm right,

74
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,140
Grandma might think we'll beg her to not fire Kheetika.

75
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,332
So she could force us to listen to her.

76
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:25,474
So you made the first move and ruined her plan.

77
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:26,920
Yes.

78
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,263

You heard what Din said.

87
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,686
Do you think you can stop me by terminating my employment?

88
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:23,366
We're not laying her off.

89
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,071
Ms. Chairwoman, if we fire Kheetika,

90
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:34,080
we don't know how she will entice Din.

91
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,008
So what do you want? Will you fire me or not?

92
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:39,540
And I want to make it clear that I never enticed Din.

93
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,480
What is it?

94
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,176
You just agreed with me about terminating her employment.

95
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:49,472
Sorry, Ms. Chairwoman. It was my mistake to be thoughtless.

96
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:52,112
But then I thought about it.

97
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,720
Din is about to become the chairman.

98
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,100
If we keep Kheetika in sight, we can control Din.

99
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:06,160
At least we can use Kheetika to lure Din back to work.

100
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,638
Just like I'm doing now.

101
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,480
Are you sure you can take care of everything?

102
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,140
I'm sure.

103
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,740
She has nothing, was abandoned by her mother, and was homeless.

104
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,873
I don't think it's difficult to control her.

I think I want to start over with Kheetika again.

111

112
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,500

He's not in the cafeteria.

summonsed Khun Sira, Khun Din, and Khun Kheetika.

122

You don't care why Maha is not there. But you care about an unimportant thing.

123

No, this is important.

What happened? How did this happen?

148
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,934
His girlfriend wanted to break up with him.

149
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:27,166
Why?

150
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,666
It's all because of Khun Sira.

151
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:34,250
I broke up with my girlfriend because of Khun Sira.

152
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,733
It's all Khun Sira's fault that my girlfriend dumped me.

153
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:44,280
Maha, what do I have to do with you breaking up with your girlfriend?

154
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,730
It's your fault.

155
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,650
Because you order me around all the time.

156
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,500
You call me in the early hours of the morning.

157
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,100
If you hurt somewhere, you ask me to take care of you.

158
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,320
You ask me to talk and eat with you.

159
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,540
I don't have time for my girlfriend.

160
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,500
So she dumped me.

161
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:08,872
It's all your fault. You are responsible for him.

162
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,300
What should I do?

163
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,020
Maha's girlfriend dumped him because you always boss him around.

164
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,760
You have to explain it to his girlfriend.

165
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,000
What do you want me to explain?

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,480
I didn't do anything wrong.

167
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,558
You're the one responsible for his girlfriend breaking up with him.

168
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:29,060
You're a bad boss. Are you self-aware?

169
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,920
You never think about others.

170
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
You only care about yourself.

171
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,760
You are so selfish.

172
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,040
- You're ruthless.
- Hey, you!

173
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,680
Excuse me.

174
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,400
I asked you here to help, not fight.

175
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,020
Oh, where is Maha?

176
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Maha? Maha!

177
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,980
- Let go.
- No.

178
00:11:58,226 --> 00:11:59,500
Let it go.

179
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,080
- Maha!
- Let go!

180
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,860
Maha, what are you doing? Give the flowers back to her.

181
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,703
Let go.

182
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:07,540
Trust me. If you don't want to be like me, just break up.

183
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,680
Everyone's love is different.

184
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,520
- Not every relationship is destined to break up.
- Yes.

185
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,440
It's all the same. You will break up, no matter how much you love each other.

186
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,620
Just like us.

187
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,800
Like Khun Kheetika and Khun Sasa.

188
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,360
Every couple will break up in the end.

189
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,980
Maha! Stop talking nonsense.

190
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,280
Give the flowers back.

191
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:32,718
All right.

192
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,200
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

193
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,780
Bye-bye.

194
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,600
- Maha!
- Maha!

195
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,660
What are you going to do?

196
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:07,352
Maha!

197
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,920
Khun Sira!

198
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,720
Are you done, Maha?

199
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,480
Look. Khun Sira is all wet because of you.

200
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:34,900
I'm sorry, Khun Sira.

201
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,580
I did that because I was drunk and lost my mind.

202
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,760
I hope you learned your lesson.

203
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,200
You should remember what you did while drunk.

204
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,520
Regarding your girlfriend, I'm sorry to you.

205
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,760
I'm sorry I caused you to break up.

206
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,380
If you want me to explain to her, just tell me.

207
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,637
I'll explain to her.

208
00:13:53,637 --> 00:13:55,740
Forget it, Khun Sira.

209
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,380
You don't have to explain.

210
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,900
She went abroad with her new boyfriend.

211
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:06,612
Did she have a new boyfriend just after you broke up?

212
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,946
They started dating before we broke up.

213
00:14:09,946 --> 00:14:11,990
I didn't have time for her.

214
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,466
So she went out with another man.

215
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:18,433
After I found out, she broke up with me.

216
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,060
For a woman who dated two men at the same time,

217
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,827
you shouldn't be sad or sorry.

218
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:27,040
Why didn't you tell me that you wanted to spend more time with your girlfriend?

219
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,048
Because I'm worried about you. I don't want you to be alone

220
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:35,360
when you are sick and when you are in trouble. You are always alone.

221
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:40,073
You don't need to worry about me.

222
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:42,486
I'm used to being alone.

223
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:45,240
No one will be used to living alone.

224
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,060
I don't know how to make it up to you.

225
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,329
I'll give you some time off.

226
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:02,132
You can come back to work when you feel better.

227
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:03,435
No.

228
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,600
What will you do if I take some time off?

229
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,880
How will you handle your work and life?

230
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,360
It's all right, Maha. Don't worry.

231
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,860
I can take care of myself.

232
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,180
Even if I rest, I can't feel at ease.

233
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,773
- Are you yelling at me?
- I'm not.

234
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:21,380
- But─
- Stop arguing. I'll take care of Khun Sira for you.

235
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:28,500
What's wrong?

236
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,992
Do you think I can't take care of him?

237
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,532
I made you some porridge.

238
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,708
Remember to take the medicine after eating the porridge.

239
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:54,740
I've got you some cold medicine, fever medicine, allergy medicine,

240
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,220
and anti-diarrheal medicine.

241
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,207
Wait.

242
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,040
Why did you get me anti-diarrheal medicine? I don't have diarrhea.

243
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,080
Just...

244
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,200
in case you get diarrhea from my porridge.

245
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,445
If something goes wrong, Maha won't leave me alone.

246
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,080
Since you know you can't take care of me, why did you promise Maha?

247
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,760
Because I'm worried Maha won't rest because he's worried about you.

248
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,660
Let me ask you something.

249
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,040
When you jumped into the water,

250
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,739
weren't you afraid that the water would be dirty?

251
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,906
At that time,

252
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:37,180
I didn't think about it.

253
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,880
All I wanted was to save Maha.

254
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,080
Because Maha is not only my secretary

255
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,080
but also my friend, brother,

256
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,200
and the person I can talk to.

257
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,840
You seem to like Maha.

258
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,100
When I came here to work, I changed ten secretaries.

259
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,020
None of them could bear or accept my strange disease.

260
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,372
Everyone said I was weird.

261
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:13,020
Only Maha could accept me.

262
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,960
He said that I was no different from ordinary people,

263
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,560
and I was just sick and needed someone to look after me.

264
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,840
So, Maha became the person who took care of me.

265
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,232
That's why I trust him the most.

266
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,552
From now on, you'll not only have Maha,

267
00:17:29,552 --> 00:17:30,860
but you will also have me.

268
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,520
♫ I have been keeping something to myself ♫

269
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,440
♫ Not wanting to tell you ♫

270
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,860
I promised Maha...

271
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,080
that you could come to me

272
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,986
when you have any trouble in the future.

273
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:48,560
I'm ready to listen to everything.

274
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,760
I promise I will be a good listener.

275
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:55,088
- Really?
- Yes.

276
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,480
♫ Pretending to be cool ♫

277
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,500
♫ Even though my heart is lonely ♫

278
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,360
♫ Wanting that someone to be by my side ♫

279
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,320
♫ My heart wants to open the door ♫

280
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,560
♫ And let you in ♫

281
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,340

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,040
♫ Can I have you by my side? ♫

289
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,560
Paa Patthama, what are we eating this morning?

290
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:48,086
Fish porridge.

291
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,620
My favorite again.

292
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,500
You know me well.

293
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,360
Grandma, are you going to the company today?

294
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,499
Why?

295
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:59,500
Are you worried that I'm going to do something to Kheetika?

296
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,440
What are you going to do?

297
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,040
Just because I agreed to let her stay at the company

298
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,220
doesn't mean I agreed with you dating her.

299
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,660
If she doesn't pester you,

300
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,276
I won't trouble her.

301
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:15,880
If she pesters you,

302
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,220
I will not leave her alone.

303
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,939
Grandma, you don't have to worry.

304
00:19:20,939 --> 00:19:22,960
She won't pester me.

305
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,598
She lost interest in me when you threw money at her.

306
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,543
She looks at me like I'm a ghost.

307
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:30,038
I'm nothing to her.

308
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,520
[GU]

309
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:44,840
Don't move it.

310
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:51,680
You have a meeting with the head of the Clothing Department at 10:00,

311
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,020
a video meeting with an investor from Singapore at 11:30,

312
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,040
and a meeting with the Marketing Department at 15:00.

313
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,440
Maha was heartbroken?

314
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,380
Hey, keep your voice down. Otherwise, everyone will hear it.

315
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,380
Excuse us.

316
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,600
What does it have to do with Khun Kheetika being Khun Sira's secretary?

317
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,760
Because Khun Sira felt guilty

318
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,980
that he caused Maha to break up with her girlfriend,

319
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,280
he gave Maha some time off.

320
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,280
But Maha disagreed because he was worried that no one would take care of Khun Sira.

321
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,000
So, Khun Kheetika volunteered to take care of Khun Sira for him.

322
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,165
Did she want to take care of him or go public about their relationship?

323
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:34,460
What do you mean by that?

324
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,880
Look.

325
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,060
Ever since we have worked here,

326
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,660
no woman has ever been so close to Khun Sira.

327
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,140
What's going on now?

328
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,620
Khun Kheetika has been working for less than a month,

329
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,580
and she's taking care of him closely.

330
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,550
That means they are together.

331
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,920
Don't gossip about it too much. Okay?

332
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,420
Otherwise, Khun Kheetika's reputation will be tarnished.

333
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,200
No.

334
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,520
We won't gossip too much.

335
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,420
Ask the team to summarize all market plans and submit them by Friday.

336
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,080
Okay, Brother. I'll summarize them and give them to you.

337
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,140
Can I borrow your secretary?

338
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,386
Are you satisfied?

339
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,300
Yes.

340
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,878
Hello.

341
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:33,709
It's ready?

342
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,700
Okay.

343
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,120
Okay, I'll get it right away.

344
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,837
If there's nothing else, I'll leave.

345
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,600
You and Din don't seem to be arguing much lately.

346
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:56,600
Because he doesn't make any trouble.

347
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,980
I don't know why we should fight.

348
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Here's your sandwich and coffee, Boss.

349
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,405
I'm going to a party later.

350
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:15,510
You're... coming with me.

351
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,518
Do I have to go?

352
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:18,588
Yes.

353
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:21,920
Because you're taking Maha's place. So you have to go.

354
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,480
- What time is the party?
- Now.

355
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,170
Now?

356
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,410
I'll give you...

357
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:33,030
15 minutes to get changed.

358
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,010
Fifteen minutes?

359
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,420
The chairwoman knows Khun Kheetika works at our mall.

360
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,860
Exactly.

361
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,100
The chairwoman called Khun Sira, Khun Sasa, and Khun Kheetika to a meeting.

362
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,689
It was a long meeting.

363
00:22:45,689 --> 00:22:49,340
After the meeting, everyone looked upset, especially Khun Kheetika.

364
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,940
Khun Kheetika was so anxious that she took a half day off.

365
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,160
Oh, no.

366
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,660
I just disappeared for a moment and missed such a big event.

367
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,885
Did the chairwoman decide to fire Khun Kheetika?

368
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:03,698
No.

369
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,140
- Maha.
- What?

370
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,033
You missed more than one thing.

371
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,513
There's one more thing you're missing.

372
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,639
What is it?

373
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:15,700
Khun Kheetika and Khun Sasa used to date.

374
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,888
How do you know that? Are you sure?

375
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:19,746
I'm sure. You told me that.

376
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:20,814
No way.

377
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:22,533
- I have witnesses.
- Who are they?

378
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:25,220
Khun Kheetika and Khun Sira.

379
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,280
You said it in front of them.

380
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,260
- Really?
- Yes.

381
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,240
Rossarin, can you promise me one thing?

382
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,040
Please don't tell anyone about this.

383
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,220
You can't let anyone else know about it.

384
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,740
Why?

385
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,880
If you don't want to get fired, you should keep it a secret.

386
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,100
Is the matter between Khun Kheetika and Khun Sasa so serious?

387
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,379
Very serious.

388
00:24:11,344 --> 00:24:16,152
♫ I don't understand why my heart trembles when I see you ♫

389
00:24:16,152 --> 00:24:20,976
♫ In my dreams, at night and during the day, why do I still long for you? ♫

390
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:27,484
♫ I can't stop my heart beating out of rhythm like a delirious person ♫

391
00:24:27,484 --> 00:24:29,872
♫ I've really fallen in love with you. The more you try to flee, the more I want to find you ♫

392
00:24:29,872 --> 00:24:34,052
♫ I've really fallen in love with you. The more you try to flee, the more I want to find you ♫

393
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:39,180
♫ Not being suspicious, not being careful, suddenly it's stuck in my mind ♫

394
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,720
♫ Are you the one my heart is searching for? ♫

395
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,740
♫ Not wanting to remember, but I can't forget because I miss you ♫

396
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,462
♫ So I have to find you to devote myself to you ♫

397
00:24:51,462 --> 00:24:54,600
Am I beautiful enough to go to the party with you?

398
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:57,573
No.

399
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,760
You're too beautiful for that.

400
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,460
♫ I don't understand why my heart trembles when I see you ♫

401

♫ In my dreams, at night and during the day, why do I still long for you? ♫

♫ I've finally found you, I won't let you go ♫

406
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,500
♫ Because you're a gift from heaven ♫

407
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,560
♫ You have enlightened me ♫

408
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,900
♫ If you like me then I would be grateful ♫

409
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:42,500
♫ I wonder if you could love someone like me? ♫

415
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,900
Congratulations on GU's upcoming expansion into the European market.

416
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,483
Thank you.

417
00:26:15,483 --> 00:26:17,370
I envy you, Khun Premyuda,

418
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,348
to have a grandson like Khun Sira.

419
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:24,165
He managed the mall into the number one mall in Asia.

420
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:28,300
Khun Sira is really like Khun Bonthai.

421
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,980
They are both hardworking and excellent.

422
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,300
Exactly.

423
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,186
I don't think so.

424
00:26:33,186 --> 00:26:36,260
Sira and Bonthai are different.

425
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,628
Hello.

426
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:40,500
Khun Sira is here.

427
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,920
He brought a girl with him.

428
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,260
She's beautiful.

429
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,726
Who invited you?

430
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:18,843
Khun Sira asked me to come.

431
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:21,693
Maha is taking some days off. So I took his place.

432
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:25,640
Since you're taking Maha's place as secretary,

433
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,550
you should remember your duties.

434
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,400
Don't do anything out of line.

435
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,600
What do you mean by "out of line"?

436
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,308
Don't try to be a social climber.

437
00:27:34,308 --> 00:27:38,360
Don't think you can make a move on others just because you miss Din.

438
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,973
Who says I missed him?

439
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,580
I haven't even started yet.

440
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,940
What do you mean by that?

441
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,940
I don't know...

442
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,600
whether I should choose the older brother or the younger brother.

443
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,020
Hello, Khun Premyuda.

444
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,360
Hello, Khun Vilai.

445
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,840
How are you?

446
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,492
I'm good.

447
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:12,252
Do you want a snack?

448
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,520
What did the chairwoman say to you?

449
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:18,953
We stopped by to say hello.

450
00:28:18,953 --> 00:28:22,180
Are you sure my grandma just said hello?

451
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,100
I'm sure.

452
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,553
What?

453
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,400
Do you want to taste it?

454
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,780
It's delicious.

455
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,406
You don't believe me?

456
00:28:39,446 --> 00:28:42,503
- Do you want to eat it?
- I think it's delicious,

457
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:45,580
because you've got it on your lips.

458
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,241
Where? Is it dirty?

459
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:48,700
Yes. There.

460
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:50,919
- There.
- Here?

461
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:52,550
Kheetika.

462
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,810
Act like a lady. Okay?

463
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,320
You are here as my secretary.

464
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,520
I'll take both of them.

465
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,300
In case I'll stain my face again.

466
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,980
What are you doing in front of the ladies' room?

467
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,560
Kanghan, come with me.

468
00:29:55,406 --> 00:29:57,913
What?

469
00:29:57,913 --> 00:29:59,986
What is it?

470
00:29:59,986 --> 00:30:01,640
This is for you.

471
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,300
Take a look.

472
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,043
What is it?

473
00:30:10,043 --> 00:30:11,506
Open it.

474
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,080
Where did you find it?

475
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:26,286
Thank you.

476
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,980
Is this authentic?

477
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,580
It is authentic.

478
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
I bought the wrong size.

479
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,760
I haven't worn it.

480
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,120
The warranty card is in the box.

481
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,420
You can check it.

482
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,352
Do you like it?

483
00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:52,520
Of course.

484
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,820
You have to wait in line for a year to get one.

485
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,540
And it's expensive.

486
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,280
I almost gave up.

487
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,286
But I didn't give up.

488
00:31:06,286 --> 00:31:08,160
No matter how expensive it is, I will buy it.

489
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,620
You still don't think about anything before you buy things.

490
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,860
How do you know I didn't think about anything?

491
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,818
I thought I wanted to buy it for you.

492
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:45,580
I don't know whether to choose the older brother or the younger brother.

493
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,720
Do you see that?

494
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,440
Kheetika hasn't given up on pestering Din.

495
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,720
Are you still going to keep her around Din?

496
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,666
Ms. Chairwoman, did you call me here to fire her?

497
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,580
No.

498
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,253
Firing her won't end it.

499
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:19,140
I have another way. It's better than terminating her employment.

500
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,260
Another way? What is it?

501
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,426
If you want to get Kheetika out of Din's life,

502
00:32:26,426 --> 00:32:29,500
you should let Din know

503
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,405
that Kheetika has a new target.

504
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,620
You told me that you loved Din like your own brother

505
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,347
and that you would do anything for him.

506
00:32:46,347 --> 00:32:47,602
Yes.

507
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:51,453
Could you do something for Din this time?

508
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,306
Ms. Chairwoman, what do you want me to do?

509
00:32:58,306 --> 00:33:02,160
You should make Kheetika fall in love with you.

510
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,210
You should let Din know

511
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,760
how filthy and greedy she is.

512
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,100
When Din doesn't love her anymore, you dump her.

513
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,940
I can't lie.

514
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,900
And I can't trick Kheetika.

515
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,400
Why can't you do it?

516
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,465
Are you going to let her cheat Din and get away with it?

517
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,860
Could you please give me some time to think about it?

518
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,500
I'll take care of it as soon as possible.

519
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,020
No.

520
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,358
I would rather not waste any more time.

521
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,760
You have to follow my orders no matter what.

522
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,393
But Ms. Chairwoman─

523
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:42,780
I...

524
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:48,330
This is your chance to repay me.

525
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,960
I pulled you out of the trash.

526
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,920
If you're ungrateful, you don't have to do it.

527
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,660
I'm back.

528
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,860
What's up, Son? What's up, Son?

529
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,540
Why are you so unlucky?

530
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,540
Lom is getting worse.

531
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,980
His fear of dirty things is affecting him.

532
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,260
Look. He scratched himself and was covered in wounds.

533
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,760
It's really a strange disease.

534
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,660
I don't know what to do.

535
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,300
It happens every time I leave him alone at home.

536
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,535
I can't bring him to work.

537
00:35:45,535 --> 00:35:48,126
Do you want to send him to the welfare home where I work?

538
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:49,900
I'll take care of him for you.

539
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,480
You can pick him up on the weekend.

540
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,100
But I don't have money.

541
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,780
You don't have to spend too much money.

542
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:04,172
And he can study and make friends there.

543
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,100
Stay with Paa Nit, Son.

544
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,820
Where are you going?

545
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,313
I'm going to work.

546
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:20,836
I'll pick you up on the weekend.

547
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:23,520
I want to be with you. Don't leave me.

548
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,080
I won't leave you. But I have to go to work.

549
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,585
I promise you I'll pick you up.

550
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,193
That's a deal.
- That's a deal.

551
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,120
Be good here.

552
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,000
Remember, your mother abandoned you.

553
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,860
Lom was abandoned by his mother!

554
00:38:08,473 --> 00:38:09,850
Lom.

555
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,573
You have a guest.

556
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:13,954
Is it my mom?

557
00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:15,434
My mom's here.

558
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:18,686
Mom, I'm coming.

559
00:38:27,453 --> 00:38:31,053
She's not my mother.

560
00:38:31,053 --> 00:38:35,000
Khun Premyuda will take care of you instead of your mother.

561
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,988
Be a good boy. Okay?

562
00:38:37,988 --> 00:38:40,560
Turn around and say hi to her.

563
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,525
Hello.

564
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,172
This will be your home.

565
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:59,040
You will live here as the eldest grandson of the Kukitcharoen family.

566
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,780
Can I see my mom?

567
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,866
Your mom is not here.

568
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:06,900
And you must call me Ms. Chairwoman.

569
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,525
Okay.

570
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,480
Khun Lom.

571
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,807
I'm Paa Patthama.

572
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:18,823
You will live with Ms. Chairwoman.

573
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,486
She'll take good care of you.

574
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,450
You can go to school

575
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:27,520
and have a better life.

576
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,120
Isn't that too cruel, Madam?

577
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,500
Brothers fighting over a woman.

578
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,020
You won't learn your lessons

579
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,920
until you encounter heartbreaking things.

580
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,290
If your plan fails,

581
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,270
Khun Din and Khun Lom...

582
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,966
There will be no mistakes.

583
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:33,333
Whether it's Din or Lom,

584
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,700
I won't let Kheetika

585
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,600
step into my Kukitcharoen family.

586
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,380
I hope so.

587
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,220
I would rather not see you the way you were when...

588
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,040
you lost Khun Bonthai.

589
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,245
You were too impulsive.

590
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,280
This is your chance to repay me.

591
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,180
I pulled you out of the trash.

592
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,820
If you're ungrateful, you don't have to do it.

593
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,173
Khun Sira.

594
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,993
What is it?

595
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:36,713
I got you some breakfast.

596
00:41:36,713 --> 00:41:40,563
You left early in the morning. You must not have eaten yet.

597
00:41:40,563 --> 00:41:45,320
I got you a sandwich and a salad.

598
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,992
Where have you been?

599
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,968
I...

600
00:41:58,968 --> 00:42:01,800
I knew you were here.

601
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,993
Here.

602
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,500
Are you going to eat breakfast?

603
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,920
Good. Let's eat together.

604
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,460
I bought a lot of food.

605
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,350
Kanghan, please get us the cutlery.

606
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:19,973
Okay.

607
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,740
Din,

608
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,000
my office is not a restaurant.

609
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,760
If you want to eat, go to the restaurant.

610
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,300
It's not safe to eat at the restaurant.

611
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,340
It's safest to eat in your office.

612
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,140
What do you mean?

613
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:42,100
As you know, Grandma has many eyes in our company.

614
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,600
If Kanghan and I go to a restaurant, we'll be caught.

615
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,400
If we eat in your office, I can say I'm here to talk about work.

616
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,120
You can't eat in my office.

617
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,280
Brother, I'm already miserable because our grandma is cruel to me.

618
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,185
Don't be cruel to me.

619
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:02,340
Don't you love me?

620
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,272
If I make Kanghan my girlfriend,

621
00:43:11,272 --> 00:43:14,722
I promise I won't bother you anymore. Okay?

622
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,700
Are you saying you're going to pursue Kanghan again?

623
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:26,250
Are you sure Kanghan still loves you?

624
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:30,233
I'm not sure about that.

625
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:34,810
But I'm sure you are on my side,

626
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,920
and you'll help me.

627
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,946
What do you want me to do?

628
00:43:39,946 --> 00:43:42,960
Help me pursue Kanghan, Brother.

629
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,738
Okay, Brother?

630
00:43:46,738 --> 00:43:49,138
You are the only person I trust.

631
00:43:49,138 --> 00:43:51,118
Help me.

632
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,133
Thank you.

633
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,920
Come on, let's go eat.

634
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,220
Then, I'll go out.

635
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,680
Wait. Let's eat together.

636
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,360
Open it for me.

637
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,980
Come on.

638
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:03,140
All right, Khun Sira. Now, relax.

639
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,620
And then start talking about what's bothering you.

640
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:13,000
Doctor, if someone you love asks you for something,

641
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,020
but you would rather not do it, how do you say no?

642
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,940
I think I'd just say no.

643
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,800
But you love that person very much.

644
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,820
If it's someone I love and care about,

645
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:36,180
I might say yes.

646
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:45,620
If I choose to help her, someone will be sad.

647
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,980
Should I still help her, Doctor?

648
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,470
Someone will be sad?

649
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:52,785
If that's the case, I won't help her.

650
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,552
But I love her.

651
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,020
I owe her a debt.

652
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:04,186
If I don't help her, she will be sad.

653
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,620
If that's the case,

654
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:12,360
I don't think we can find an answer.

655
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:18,160
If it's something you were asked to do, is it really so difficult to decide?

656
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,946
If I help one of them,

657
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,540
I will hurt the other one.

658
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,660
Are you sure only one person will be sad?

659
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,960
Won't you also be sad?

660
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,060
Why, Kanghan?

661
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:54,080
I just wanted to know your address. Why do you keep it a secret?

662
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,624
There's no secret, Mom.

663
00:46:56,624 --> 00:46:59,410
I just don't want to disturb my friend.

664
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:02,720
If I can't go to your apartment,

665
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,034
I'll go to your company tomorrow.

666
00:47:05,034 --> 00:47:06,680
What time will you come?

667
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,120
Around 11:00. I'll bring green curry for you.

668
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,146
Call me when you arrive.

669
00:47:14,146 --> 00:47:15,593
Hey, you.

670
00:47:15,593 --> 00:47:19,780
This garbage bag was here last night. Haven't you taken it out?

671
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:24,310
Kanghan, I thought I heard a man's voice.

672
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,860
She's not a man, Mom. She's not.

673
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,900
Your hand is dirty. Your hand is so dirty.

674
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,140
You.

675
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,340
Kanghan, didn't you say you live with a female friend?

676
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,860
He's my gay male friend, Mom.

677
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,883
My gay male friend.

678
00:47:41,883 --> 00:47:43,440
My mom is on the phone.

679
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,560
How am I supposed to know?

680
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,400
If you don't believe me, you can talk to him.

681
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,360
- Speak to her.
- What do you want me to say?

682
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,340
Hello. How are you?

683
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,980
Come on. Be gentle.

684
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,220
I'm not a femboy. Do you want to lie to your mother? Are you crazy?

685
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,520
- I don't want you to lie.
- I just─

686
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,640
I just want you to parrot me.

687
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,880
Come on.

688
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

689
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,191
- Come on.
- No.

690
00:48:11,191 --> 00:48:14,080
Didn't you ask me to parrot you?

691
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,620
Mom, I have to go. See you tomorrow.

692
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,507
What should I do?

693
00:48:24,507 --> 00:48:27,506
How do I explain it to my mom?

694
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,780
You're a good liar.

695
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,020
It shouldn't be hard.

696
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,080
Kanghan's friend sounded familiar to me.

697
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,160
What?

698
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,680
It's the sound of Khun Hom's car.

699
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,400
Khun Hom is here.

700
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,060
Khun Hom.

701
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:15,360
Metta, help me wash my clothes and then pack them for me.

702
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,513
Are you not staying here?

703
00:49:19,513 --> 00:49:22,300
Do as I say.

704
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,040
Okay.

705
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,460
Aren't you going to live at home?

706
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,013
Your father will be worried about you.

707
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,853
It's none of your business whether I live at home or not.

708
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:44,740
But this is your home.

709
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,580
Are you sure this is my home?

710
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,089
I'm sure.

711
00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:50,380
This is your home.

712
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,660
Your dad's home. Your family's home.

713
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:58,020
As long as you're still here, this is not my home.

714
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,780
Because you're not my family.

715
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:05,840
Can you give me a chance to be a part of your family?

716
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,177
I can't. I won't let you be happy in this house.

717
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:14,000
Khun Hom, the reason why I beg you

718
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,200
is not to make myself happy

719
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,780
but to make your dad happy.

720
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,190
You made a scene and said that Kanghan and I

721
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,760
stole your dad's love for you.

722
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,660
Please think carefully about what you're doing now.

723
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,980
Is it right?

724
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,177
Look at me now.

725
00:50:35,177 --> 00:50:38,400
There is no home to return to, and I was removed.

726
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,940
Doesn't that prove that I'm right?

727
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,896
I'll hold you accountable for everything you do.

728
00:50:45,896 --> 00:50:49,280
I will remove you as the head of the Marketing Department.

729
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,620
I want you to admit your mistake and apologize to Kanghan.

730
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,000
No way. I won't apologize to her.

731
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,780
I won't force you if you don't want to.

732
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,420
I want you to make your own choices.

733
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:20,900
You may not be right occasionally.

734
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,640
Since you abandoned your dad,

735
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:28,620
he will give his love to me and Kanghan.

736
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:33,620
If he gives his property to us,

737
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,020
don't blame me and Kanghan.

738
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,880
You should blame yourself for it.

739
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,900
Your clothes are packed.

740
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,138
Do you want me to put them in your car?

741
00:51:46,138 --> 00:51:49,260
No. Take them to my room.

742
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,100
I will live at home.

743
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,900
Let's go, Khun Hom.

744
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,940
Are you coming back to work after only a few days off?

745
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,540
Actually, I'm not in good shape. But I'll think nonsense if I don't work.

746
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,860
So I decided to come to work.

747
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,643
Maybe I'll get over it faster.

748
00:52:19,643 --> 00:52:25,200
Besides, I would rather not trouble Khun Kheetika to take my place.

749
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,920
No worries.

750
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,960
It's good that you've come back to work sooner.

751
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,200
Maybe you can get a new girlfriend at the company.

752
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,440
Will it be me?

753
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,640
It's best if I were a monk.

754
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,560
Awesome.

755
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,100
Your face looks like a cow.

00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,620
- Are you saying I look like a cow?
- I'm not.

757
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:53,120
But you have two horns like a cow.

758
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,280
You can't find a boyfriend because you're mean.

759
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,700
You got dumped. It's better that you've never had a girlfriend.

760
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,240
Sādhu, I hope that your dream comes true.

761
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,840
A relationship always starts with a fight.

They will fall in love later.

Why don't you invite your mom to go upstairs?

Kanghan, Khun Sira's voice sounds familiar.

781
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:10,260
It's like your friend's voice.

If you want Kheetika to leave the Design Department, we will have no project leader.

♫ I will keep it all to myself ♫

803
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:17,020
♫ Since you deserve to be with that someone who is perfect for you ♫

804
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,660
♫ Let it be me who suffers ♫

805
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:25,220
♫ And be the one who ends this love ♫

806
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,100
♫ But it's all worth it ♫

807
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:36,460
♫ Because I have finally learned what it's like to love ♫
