00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,600
I refuse to be the head of the design department. Is it okay?

158
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,886
What's your reason? Can you tell me?

159
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,340
I would rather not get into trouble with Hom.

160
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,200
Let's put the job aside.

161
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,280
Do you think you have a problem with Hom?

162
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,980
I think you do.

163
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,840
Because no matter what, Hom will be against you.

164
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,040
If you don't have power,

165
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,440
Hom will bully you even more.

166
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,420
Don't worry about me.

167
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,510
I'll do my best to bear with her.

168
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,920
And I won't mess up my job.

169
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,740
Kanghan, sometimes you need the power

170
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,800
to fight someone.

171
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,480
If you could overcome others with kindness,

172
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,480
your mom would have won a long time ago.

173
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,780
I know. You are willing to work here

174
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,660
and willing to stay at my home

175
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,640
because you need to take care of your mom.

176
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,600
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,880
I failed to take good care of your mother.

178
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,540
I allowed Hom to exercise her will.

179
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,952
If I don't take this position,

180
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:34,180
who will take it?

181
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,953
Kansinee.

182
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,903
There was a department head meeting today.

183
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,506
Why didn't you go to the meeting?

184
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:53,520
Did your mom tell you that with my dad backing you up,

185
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,360
you don't have to work hard but wait for your paycheck?

186
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,160
See? I told you that you should see a doctor.

187
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,080
You have a mental problem.

188
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,380
You were good that day. But you went mad again today.

189
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,120
And I didn't go to the meeting this morning

190
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,840
because I had checked that the design department didn't have to attend the meeting.

191
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,220
So,

192
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,880
I came to say hi to your dad.

193
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,180
Do you know why? Because I'm a cultured and polite person.

194
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,520
I know I should respect other people's parents.

195
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:40,546
Good. It's good that you're polite.

196
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:45,045
You should respect me later.

197
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:49,080
Because I'm the new head of the Marketing Department.

198
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,937
What? You are the new head of the marketing department?

199
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,312
Wait a second.

200
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,860
[New Head of Marketing Department]

201
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,053
It's done.

202
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:16,340
So everyone knows that you're the new head of the marketing department.

203
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,580
- I'm not a friend you can joke with.
- Of course not.

204
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,520
I don't make friends with mean people.

205
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,903
Hey.

206
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:25,620
You're showing off to me about your new position

207
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,080
because you want to surprise me. Right?

208
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,160
Then, I can be surprised again.

209
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,400
Are you the new head of the marketing department?

210
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,840
Secretary, she's the new head of the marketing department.

211
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,800
Head. Applause.

212
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,140
Enough.

213
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,240
I told you that because you should report to me on every job from now on.

214
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,843
Wait. I work in the design department, not the marketing department.

215
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:58,420
Why should I report to you?

216
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,120
Because your first job is related to my marketing department.

217
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,052
The first job?

218
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,980
Don't worry. No matter how bad your design is,

219
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,260
I'm sure you'll find a way for our company to win.

220
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,540
Hello, everyone. My name is Riu.

221
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,050
Hello, everyone. My name is Atichart.

222
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,720
I just got back from New York.

223
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,640
I graduated from Parsons School of Design with a degree in design.

224
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,720
[Watch this video if you're sleepy]

225
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,960
And this is...

226
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:36,093
Sorry.

227
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,009
Then...

228
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:44,460
Thank you very much. We'll get back to you.

229
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,273
This way, please.

230
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,473
Hello.

231
00:18:08,473 --> 00:18:13,120
Hello, everyone. My name is Kansinee Vaalikone.

232
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,580
You've been working at KKPP since you graduated.

233
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,160
You've never changed jobs.

234
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Why do you want to work at GU Center?

235
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,800
I... want to improve myself.

236
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,640
I want to be a renowned designer.

237
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,640
GU Group is a top group with a high profile in Asia.

238
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,480
If I could work here,

239
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,540
I would go further in my design career.

240
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,980
Do you think she's lying?

241
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:10,640
Why do you think you'll have a better career working at GU?

242
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,440
My dad used to say that our lives are like a tree.

243
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,646
If you plant the tree in a little flowerpot,

244
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:18,917
no matter how well you take care of it,

245
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:23,860
it can't grow well. Because it's limited.

246
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,620
But if we get a bigger flowerpot for the tree, it will grow better.

247
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,400
I want to get a bigger flowerpot for myself, so I can grow better.

248
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,220
Are you sure working here

249
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,400
will help you realize your dream?

250
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,960
From your work experience at KKPP,

251
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,880
you've won many awards.

252
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,980
And you beat us for some of your awards.

253
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,879
GU lost because you didn't have a good designer like me.

254
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:58,980
If you hire me,

255
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,160
I'll make sure GU never loses.

256
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,420
You like Kansinee

257
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:31,280
because her resume says that she used to work at KKPP. Right?

258
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,372
It's not. I like her because she's good.

259
00:20:35,372 --> 00:20:38,577
You just interviewed her, didn't you?

260
00:20:38,577 --> 00:20:40,620
Don't you think she's good?

261
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,120
You know that KKPP will participate

262
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,920
in the International Lingerie Show Competition in a few weeks. Right?

263
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,120
Did you have finished designs before you quit your job?

264
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,060
I have finished designs.

265
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,140
But I didn't give them to KKPP.

266
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,900
Did you bring your designs?

267
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,373
Yes.

268
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,340
Thank you.

269
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,399
Did you design these yourself?

270
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:43,093
Yes.

271
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:47,380
Why do your previous designs look so different from the designs on your phone?

272
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,860
From what I've seen of your previous designs,

273
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,913
you like simple colors and lines that aren't overly complicated.

274
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:58,340
But the patterns and colors

275
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,620
of the designs on your phone look different.

276
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,220
Looks like you paid more attention to detail.

277
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,020
And you focused on dark and light color rendering.

278
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,329
To put it simply, they look younger and more fashionable.

279
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,299
Because...

280
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,960
the theme of this competition is fashion sense.

281
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,000
I just adjusted my designs to be more fashionable.

282
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,067
Khun Sira, it looks like you're interested in my designs.

283
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:32,100
Yes. I'm interested.

284
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,640
And I really want your design.

285
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,340
It's easy if you want it.

286
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,640
I'll give you the design...

287
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,040
if you hire me.

288
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
I would like to hire you.

289
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,620
I like Khun Kansinee because of her designs.

290
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,460
The designs she brought were beautiful in their entirety.

291
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,500
But if you look at their colors and patterns separately, you can clearly see the difference.

292
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,200
They are hardly the same.

293
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,460
But as a whole, they are all conspicuous.

294
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,200
Since when are you good at design?

295
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,440
Well. When I studied abroad, I met a designer.

296
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,232
Female.

297
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,960
- Look.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

298
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,820
Why isn't she dressed?

299
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,740
She felt hot. So she took them off.

300
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,960
I want to be as good as you at drawing.

301
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,600
Do you want me to teach you?

302
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,540
- Yes.
- Okay.

303
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,980
Let's start from here.

304
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,740
Here are the clothes.

305
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,550
Dress.

306
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,380
Eyes.

307
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,540
- And the eyes.
- Yes.

308
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,033
Eyes.

309
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:56,433
Good work.

310
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:57,720
Try to draw it yourself.

311
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,800
Okay.

312
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,440
Okay. Hold it.

313
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,732
Your drawing is beautiful.

314
00:25:09,732 --> 00:25:11,685
Thank you.

315
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:13,120
Are you a designer?

316
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,076
The lines are beautiful.

317
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:19,680
I just saw a painting that combines Asian and European elements.

318
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,072
It's beautiful.

319
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:24,040
Thank you.

320
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,060
Girl, call me when you're done.

321
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:29,552
Okay.

322
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,340
You're saying my first design

323
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,200
will be sent to a lingerie competition. Right?

324
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,320
Yes.

325
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:14,157
And our KKPP company has won the championship for five consecutive years.

326
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,580
Yes.

327
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,900
But you don't have to be anxious.

328
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,380
Although our company has won the championship for five consecutive years,

329
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,593
we almost lost last year's championship.

330
00:27:22,593 --> 00:27:26,331
We almost went to worship Buddha. Sādhu.

331
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,480
No wonder she wanted me to do this project.

332

What did you say?

333
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,720
Who is our competitor?

334
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,320
Our competitor is the design department of GU Center.

335
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,353
GU Center?

336
00:27:47,353 --> 00:27:48,827
Yes.

337
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:50,720
Don't hate me for gossiping.

338
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,860
They weren't worth taking seriously before.

339
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,720
But after Khun Sira took over,

340
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,400
he spent a lot of money recruiting excellent designers.

341
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,640
Khun Sira?

342
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,140
Yes.

Khun Sira.

344
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,720
You said you dumped a grandson of the Kukitcharoen Family, didn't you?

345
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,520
Look. He is the heir to the Kukitcharoen Family.

346
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,260
Why doesn't he seem to know you at all?

347
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,420
Khun Kheetika, the chairman wants to see you.

348
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,823
Ms. Kansinee submitted her resignation?

349
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:43,850
Yes.

350
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,920
I heard that Kansinee just signed a contract

351
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,180
with GU Center's design department.

352
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,605
She's our competitor.

353
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:56,753
Now that you're worried, do you need me to get someone to help you?

354
00:28:56,753 --> 00:28:59,196
Why would Kanghan need someone else's help?

355
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:03,020
She's the head of the design department.

356
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,113
If I don't take this position, who will take it?

357
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,019
Kansinee.

358
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,845
Then I can work as her assistant.

359
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:24,230
You just want to be an assistant?

360
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,000
Really?

361
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,633
Really.

You know why I stayed.

363

In that case, I don't need power.

364
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,960
When my mom gets better,

365
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,350
I'll go back to my old life.

366
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,020
- But I'm worried…
- You don't have to worry.

367
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,220
Although I don't have the power,

368
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,280
I have my own way of fighting.

Are you incapable of managing?

How long do I have?

372

Three weeks.

It doesn't matter if you can't do it.

I'll contact a designer in Milan to do it.

I'm firing you from KKPP.

487
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,560
My company doesn't need people who copy other people's designs.

488
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,820
You did copy GU's design. Right? What do you have to say for yourself?

489
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,300
Generally, before the show starts, designs are the secrets of each company.

490
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,320
How did you copy GU's design?

491
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,640
- Do you have a contact inside GU?
- Please answer my question.

492
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,300
You didn't plan this plagiarism alone, did you?

493
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,720
Please answer my question.

494
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,600
Please explain yourself.

495
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,900
Let's go.

496
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,880
Khun Sira, who do you want me to get?

497
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,340
Din, of course.

498
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,840
Oh, okay.

499
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,920
You just need me to get Khun Din. Right?

500
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,520
I don't need to get that woman. Right?

501
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,860
Get both of them, of course.

502
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,203
Oh, okay.

503
00:43:53,203 --> 00:43:56,700
If you ask me one more question, you don't have to get them.

504
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,340
You should pack your things and quit.

505
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,200
I'm clear.

506
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,140
Khun Sira, actually, you want...

507
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,140
- Aren't you finished?
- I'm clear. Excuse me!

508
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,990
Din, let go of me.

509
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,118
I won't.

510
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,140
I told you to let go.

511
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:43,820
When will you stop avoiding me?

512
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,740
Hey, I'm not avoiding you.

513
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,910
Then why did you drop out of language school?

514
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:57,039
Where did you go?

515
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,800
It was a long time ago, Din.

516
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,040
I think you know why I dropped out.

517
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,205
I don't know. That's why I've been looking for you.

518
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:14,340
I looked for your contact, email, and address.

519
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,196
Because I wanted to ask you why you dumped me.

520
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,260
I did all those things

521
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,532
because I wanted you to know that I didn't want to have anything to do with you.

522
00:45:27,532 --> 00:45:30,260
I think you understand now.

523
00:45:33,326 --> 00:45:35,126
I don't understand.

524
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:41,426
All right.

525
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:45,365
Listen up.

526
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,860
Because I only saw you as a friend.

527
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,080
But you wanted more than that.

528
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,680
It made me feel uncomfortable.

529
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,820
I tried to tell,

530
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,360
but you wouldn't listen. Do you know why?

531
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,018
Because all you thought about was yourself.

532
00:46:07,058 --> 00:46:09,859
I don't believe it. We were more than friends.

533
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,580
See? You only think about yourself.

534
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:17,640
You never think about other people's feelings.

535
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,838
I never considered to be more than friends with you.

536
00:46:20,838 --> 00:46:26,300
We were close because we were orphans.

537
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,660
What about our dreams?

538
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,920
Dreams are just dreams.

539
00:46:36,845 --> 00:46:39,880
You should get back to real life.

540
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,940
I never considered you to be anything

541
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,200
but a friend and a brother.

542
00:46:49,778 --> 00:46:51,725
A brother?

543
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,720
You're still so willful.

544
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,220
You must get what you want.

545
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,560
Right, you're from a rich family.

546
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,526
There should be plenty of people who spoil you.

547
00:47:17,526 --> 00:47:19,516
Don't talk to me like that. Okay?

548
00:47:19,516 --> 00:47:21,086
You know why I'm doing this.

549
00:47:21,086 --> 00:47:23,400
Why?

550
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,820
Because you consider me to be a woman who can be bought with money.

551
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,480
You and your grandmother can buy anything, but not me.

552
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,300
I never wanted to buy you off.

553
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:36,300
Everything I did was because I loved you.

554
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,180
But I never loved you.

555
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,660
That's why I changed schools, changed numbers, and changed emails.

556
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:48,760
I did everything to make you understand that I didn't want to see you again.

557
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,300
Did I make you that uncomfortable?

558
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,100
If you weren't wealthy,

559
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,540
and you didn't have your grandma's mall,

560
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,200
you'd just be a loser.

561
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,420
How could I love you?

562
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,220
Thank you for telling me what you really think.

563
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:30,380
Then, from now on, if you ever see me again,

564
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,240
please don't pester me.

565
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,080
It would be better if you could act as if we never knew each other.

566
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:50,080
If that's what you really want, it's okay.

567
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,760
From now on, I no longer know a woman named Kanghan.

How much money do you need to leave Din?

Don't think you're getting paid for sleeping with my grandson.

You're pestering my grandson again, aren't you?

I've never pestered your grandson.

He's the one who's pestering me.

590

Din pestered you..

591
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,599
because you seduced him first.

592
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,026
I should say you want to tie him down.

593
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:22,900
You finally got a high degree.

594

I'm not like you.

Although you are getting older,

597
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,560
you still have no brain.

598
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,253
You shouldn't talk to an elderly person like that.

599
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,760
That is very disrespectful to you.

I still haven't settled the score with you for copying our company's design.

In that case, you can go and claim compensation for damages.

606
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:21,120
But if I have proof that the person who copied it is your people,

you should prepare to pay me for damages.
