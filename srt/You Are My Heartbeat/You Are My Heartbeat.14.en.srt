Well. Is this lipstick yours or some woman's?

160
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,780
What do you want?

161
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,080
I'll put lipstick on you.

162
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,460
- What?
- Put it on.

163
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,920
If you don't answer, I'll open the door.

164
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,480
Tell him it's your lipstick.

165
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,220
No.

166
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,200
Three.

167
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,660
- I don't want to.
- Just a little of it.

168
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,440
Two.

169
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:31,799
What do you want?

170
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,240
♫ I don't understand why my heart trembles when I see you ♫

171
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,000
♫ In my dreams, at night and during the day, why do I still long for you? ♫

172
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,700
♫ I can't stop my heart beating out of rhythm like a delirious person ♫

173
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,100
♫ I've really fallen in love with you. The more you try to flee, the more I want to find you ♫

174
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,700
All right. Okay.

175
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,820
Here it is.

176
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,240
You can go out now.

177
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,953
One.

178
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:22,485
Brother, don't tell me you're─

179
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,332
Are you crazy?

180
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:29,026
I'm fine with you being that. It's cute.

181
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:38,487
I have something to deal with.

182
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:41,013
You can go back.

183
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:46,366
Go.

184
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:52,960
Go.

185
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:09,517
Yes. I got away with it.

186
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,307
Yes.

187
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:14,700
Oh, my god. I'm so lucky.

188
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,640
Hey, you. What kind of woman are you?

189
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,281
How could you kiss someone so easily?

190
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:22,147
Do you think I wanted to kiss you?

191
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:25,653
If you let me put lipstick on you in the first place, I wouldn't have done that.

192
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:30,241
I'd rather kiss an animal than kiss you.

193
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:32,107
Do you think you're the only one who thinks so?

194
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:35,941
I'm telling you. Every time I'm with you, I feel more tingly

195
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:40,520
when I put my mouth on ice than when I kiss a woman with a vicious mouth like you.

196
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,848
Ice cube? A person like you can only kiss ice cubes.

197
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:46,740
I am the unfortunate one that had to kiss you.

198
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,120
Every time I kiss you, I don't know how many years I'll have left in my life.

199
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,379
Then I'll make you unlucky for the rest of your life.

200
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:28,050
Excuse me.

201
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:31,493
Did you just deliver clothes to Khun Sira's room?

202
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:32,920
Yes. May I help you?

203
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,120
Have you ever seen a woman in his room when you delivered him clothes?

204
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,800
Do you mean Khun Sira's girlfriend?

205
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,180
- Does he have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

206
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,000
She's beautiful. They have been living together for a while.

207
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,980
I think her name is Khun... Khun Kheetika.

208
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,740
P'Kanghan, have you gone to your mother yet?

209
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,360
There's a little problem.

210
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,140
Din.

211
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,760
Brother, where are you? Come out.

212
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,260
Come out and talk to me.

213
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,458
- Din.
- Brother!

214
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,000
Din.

215
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,840
Din, calm down.

216
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,880
- Kanghan, stay out of it.
- You can't do that.

217
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,480
- Is Kanghan living with you?
- Din, allow me to explain.

218
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,120
Brother, why did you do this?

219
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,880
Answer me!

220
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,680
Hit me, Din. Hit me until you're satisfied.

221
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,940
Tell me when you're satisfied. So I can explain everything to you.

222
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,520
Go on.

223
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,939
Din, are you ready for me to explain. Right?

224
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,380
I let Kheetika stay at my house...

225
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
because she was kicked out of her home.

226
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,140
She had nowhere to go. So I let her stay at my place.

227
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,200
Couldn't she find somewhere else to stay? Why are you living together?

228
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,880
I had no money at that time.

229
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,880
But my brother had.

230
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,020
- You could also ask me for help.
- But I didn't want your help.

231
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:01,060
If you help me, your grandma will pester me again.

232
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,600
Yes, I had money. But I didn't trust Kheetika.

233
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,120
At that time, Kheetika was accused of plagiarizing our company's design. And she lied.

234
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,200
I didn't trust her.

235
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,203
If you didn't believe her, why did you let her stay at your house?

236
00:18:17,203 --> 00:18:21,060
I was afraid she would trick you, as the chairwoman said.

237
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,080
So I let her stay with me.

238
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,220
So I could tell if she was tricking you.

239
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,220
When are you going to tell me about it?

240
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,240
Answer me.

241
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,800
Why don't you answer me?

242
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,780
I think he has said enough.

243
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,700
I stay with him as his subordinate, not his girlfriend.

244
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,280
If you don't believe me, you can ask Nannam.

245
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,000
Nannam knows everything about Khun Sira and me.

246
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,960
Yes. They're not a couple.

247
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,280
It's up to you if you believe it or not.

248
00:19:06,975 --> 00:19:09,288
- Where are you going?
- Kanghan.

249
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,599
I'm going to sleep with my mom tonight.

250
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,740
The matter about me is settled.

251
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,580
All that's left is between you two.

252
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,360
Settle it yourselves.

253
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,940
Don't you really need me to drive you?

254
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,100
No need. I can go back by myself.

255
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,120
Sorry.

256
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,520
I never meant to betray you.

257
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,980
But what you're doing now is betrayal.

258
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,040
Why do you suddenly want to go back to sleep?

259
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,720
My roommate's relative is there.

260
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,160
So I wanted to come back for a night.

261
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,320
Is your roommate Nannam the person I met in the hospital?

262
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,259
No.

263
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,133
Why do you think it's Nannam?

264
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:55,320
I ran into Nannam when I went to your apartment.

265
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,600
Nannam lied to me that he didn't share an apartment with you.

266
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,400
- I asked him to lie to you.
- Why?

267
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,180
I don't want you to meddle in my private affairs.

268
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,220
I don't want anybody to meddle in my private affairs.

269
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,620
- Including me?
- Yes.

270
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:16,880
Now you know where I live, you don't have to come to me.

271
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,280
Do you want to live alone and away from me?

272
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,760
This makes me feel comfortable.

273
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,600
You have a new family.

274
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,000
We'd better live our own happy life.

275
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:37,500
But my happy life is a life with you.

276
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,220
I'm tired.

277
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm going to bed.

278
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,480
Din, come with me to Mrs. Sopa's birthday party this Saturday.

279
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,600
Do I have to go?

280
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,363
You have to go.

281
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:18,220
I want you to meet Mrs. Sopa's daughter, Minnie.

282
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,540
What happened to your hand?

283
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,820
Did you get into a fight again?

284
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,119
When will you stop acting like a mischievous kid? Please contemplate your current position.

285
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:31,060
When will you care about me as my grandma?

286
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,280
When will you not be afraid that I will not be able to do the job?

287
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,120
I said that because I'm worried about you.

288
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,960
If you're distressed about me,

289
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,580
you should ask me if it hurts and who hurt me.

290
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,120
Din.

291
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,460
Is it my fault that you got hurt?

292
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,600
Yes. It's all your fault.

293
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,880
It's all your fault that I'm hurting and that I'm like this.

294
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:12,779
What are you doing here early in the morning?

295
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,629
I stayed here last night.

296
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:22,582
You stayed here?

297
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:26,983
Did your mom bring you back?

298
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:31,609
Do you have nowhere to go?

299
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:33,730
I'm not moving back.

300
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,710
You can rest assured.

301
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,490
It means you're leaving today, right?

302
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,490
Take your mother with you.

303
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,850
You have a place to stay, don't you?

304
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,430
How do you know where I live?

305
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,530
Oh, so my mom knew where I lived because of you. Right?

306
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,830
Your mother had a hard time looking for you.

307
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,410
I sympathized with her.

308
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,610
Was it out of sympathy or guilt?

309
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,810
Why should I feel guilty about you?

310
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,710
Back then,

311
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,970
you would never have told my mom where I lived.

312
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,550
You would have wanted to see my mom grieve.

313
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,770
But you told my mom where I lived.

314
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,866
I thought maybe your mom would live with you.

315
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:21,395
Is that really what you thought?

316
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:24,910
If you feel guilty, you can apologize to me.

317
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:29,810
You don't have to pretend to be a bad woman.

318
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,090
Come on. Try to say it.

319
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,783
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

320
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,030
It's that simple.

321
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,490
But I don't want to say it.

322
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,890
Don't be so arrogant.

323
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,090
It's not that difficult to apologize.

324
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,110
Come on, everybody.

325
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,830
Hello.

326
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,231
- Hello.
- Hello.

327
00:25:05,243 --> 00:25:08,036
What are you doing here?

328
00:25:08,036 --> 00:25:10,790
We're waiting for you.

329
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,530
Why are you waiting for me?

330
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,350
We just want to ask you

331
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,650
if you know what happened between Khun Sira and Khun Sasa.

332
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,450
What have you heard?

333
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,770
Here's the thing.

334
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,550
This morning, Kirin,

335
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:32,310
Khun Sira, Khun Sasa, and I got into the elevator together.

336
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:37,230
They came in and stood far away from each other.

337
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,950
Not only that, but they didn't talk to each other

338
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,990
and didn't want to look at each other.

339
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,670
- Right, Kirin?
- Yes.

340
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,630
I saw Khun Sira with a wound in the corner of his mouth.

341
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,630
And Khun Sasa has injuries on his hand.

342
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,150
- Really.
- Did they fight?

343
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,270
I don't think it's a big deal.

344
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,610
Maybe you think too much.

345
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,950
Let's go to work.

346
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:11,956
What's wrong?

347
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:14,050
That's all for today's meeting.

348
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,650
- Where are you taking me?
- Come here.

349
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,310
If there is anything, just say it.

350
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,470
About you and Din.

351
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,450
Didn't you solve it after I left?

352
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:42,430
I tried to work it out, but Din wouldn't listen to me.

353
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,450
He thinks I betrayed him.

354
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,030
I didn't tell him that you lived with me.

355
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,210
If he's still angry, how about I move out?

356
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,670
Why should you move out?

357
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,150
Because he's angry at me for living with you.

358
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,890
If I move out, all the problems are solved.

359
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,370
I don't need you to help me this way.

360
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,210
I'm doing everything I can to keep you and Din from fighting.

361
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,890
Don't you want to make up with your brother?

362
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,550
I'll take care of it myself.

363
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,330
As for you, stop thinking about moving out.

364
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,986
I won't allow you to.

365
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:15,123
- But─
- Stop.

366
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:16,850
I don't want to hear you talk about it anymore.

367
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,350
Don't think about it.

368
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,030
I will never let you move out.

369
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,762
But─

370
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,890
Okay.

371
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,330
Do whatever you want.

372
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,956
It's up to you.

373
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:36,270
Din, wait.

374
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,650
Can you get over it already?

375
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,536
You're an adult.

376
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,190
Aren't you my brother? Tell me.

377
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,270
Why won't you agree to let Kanghan move out?

378
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,270
If she moves out, where will she live?

379
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,950
I can fix it.

380
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,430
If Grandma finds out,

381
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,610
do you think Grandma will agree to let you fix it?

382
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:01,570
I have my reasons for keeping Kheetika at my place.

383
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,730
You like Kanghan, don't you?

384
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,530
Answer me.

385
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,650
You like Kanghan, don't you?

386
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,910
I'm not a kid anymore.

387
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,730
I know why men want to be close to women.

388
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,790
I never wanted to take Kheetika from you.

389
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,110
You have no right to take her from me.

390
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,570
I will never agree to it.

391
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,290
Give me some time, Din.

392
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,010
I'll solve it.

393
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,470
Then I'll never meddle with you and Kheetika again.

394
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,410
What are you going to do?

395
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,250
Are you going to stop liking Kanghan and give her to me?

396
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,730
Is Kanghan yours?

397
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,770
Do I need you to give her to me?

398
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,290
I didn't think that way.

399
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,230
Good.

400
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,510
Because I'm no longer the kid

401
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,490
who tried to get everything I wanted.

402
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,530
I can control my feelings.

403
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,580
You can stop putting up with me

404
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,930
and making sacrifices for me.

405
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,930
Don't worry about me.

406
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,470
Just worry about yourself.

407
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,030
If you want to compete with me for Kanghan,

408
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,930
I can easily beat you.

409
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,010
Because you are new to pursuing women.

410
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,170
How can you be so sure?

411
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,310
Do you want to compete with me for Kanghan?

412
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,610
Let's see who Kanghan will choose.

413
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,350
Next time you're angry at Khun Lom,

414
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,630
don't hammer the wall with your hand.

415
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,110
If Khun Lom's wall collapses,

416
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,410
it's a big deal.

417
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,230
How do you know that?

418
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,750
Khun Lom called me last night.

419
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,310
He asked me to bandage your wounds

420
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:15,590
and asked me to get Dr. Zhao

421
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,310
if your wounds were inflamed or swollen.

422
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:22,210
Did he tell you why we were fighting?

423
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,750
He didn't say it.

424
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,710
And I didn't ask.

425
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,570
I think...

426
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,050
it's normal for brothers to fight.

427
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,110
But if you are angry at him and misunderstand him,

428
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,870
you have to solve it as soon as possible.

429
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,950
You can't keep putting it off.

430
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,270
Paa Patthama.

431
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:52,070
Do you think my brother would betray me?

432
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,670
It could never happen.

433
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,230
I've taken care of you two since you were kids.

434
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:05,350
I know how much Khun Lom loves you.

435
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:11,970
Not only do I know, I'm sure you know, too.

436
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,790
Spinning.

437
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,970
One, two, three.

438
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,810
Who broke the vase?

439
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:41,910
Who came up with the idea to pretend to be a parent asking for leave?

440
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,870
Then you have to take your punishment.

441
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,630
I'll deduct your pocket money for three months.

442
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,850
Three months, Grandma?

443
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,970
My brother will have no money to spend at school.

444
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,230
Here, Brother. Use my money first.

445
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,416
- No need.
- Come on.

446
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,630
Don't worry. I have an idea.

447
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,920
Just take it back.

448
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,110
Why didn't you tell Grandma it was my idea?

449
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,750
If you make another mistake,

450
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,570
you will be grounded for three months. Right?

451
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,730
Actually, I'm also at fault for this.

452
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:34,430
I didn't stop you but did it with you.

453
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,630
I swear I will study hard.

454
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,030
I won't skip classes again.

455
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,610
I'll make you proud of me.

456
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,190
That's what you told me last time.

457
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,690
They are exactly the same words.

458
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:01,363
This time, I will definitely do it.

459
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:04,150
It's for my beloved brother.

460
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,410
Oh, Din.

461
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,950
Din!

462
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,756
Din, are you moving here?

463
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,290
What's going on?

464
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,700
What happened?

465
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,670
You can live here, why can't I?

466
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,310
Right, Brother?

467
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,750
Did you make up?

468
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,510
We've made up.

469
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:45,650
From now on, the three of us must stay together.

470
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,110
We must eat together, watch movies together,

471
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,230
and go to work together.

472
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,830
Aren't you going to say anything?

473
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,269
Well.

474
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,910
That's it.

475
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,980
No.

476
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,670
Are we going to live together?

477
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,830
Don't forget our agreement.

478
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,270
If you break the agreement,

479
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,116
I'll send you home right away.

480
00:34:27,116 --> 00:34:29,015
Don't worry.

481
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:30,910
As long as Kanghan is here,

482
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,890
I'll never leave.

483
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,310
Are you and Khun Sira going to compete for Khun Kheetika?

484
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,670
Yes.

485
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,690
You four must help me.

486
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,290
What do you want us to do?

487
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,910
Your job is to keep an eye on my brother.

488
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:04,210
See where he and Kanghan go and what they do, and then report back to me.

489
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,290
Kanghan? Who is Kanghan?

490
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,570
Your Kheetika.

491
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,710
I see. Kanghan is a cute name.

492
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:21,750
We won't get fired if Khun Sira finds out that we're helping him. Right?

493
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,270
Yes.

494
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,970
If he doesn't sign the internship report for me,

495
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,750
I'll be in trouble.

496
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,230
No one will get fired.

497
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,350
And it won't harm you.

498
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,730
If you help me win,

499
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,490
I'll give you a reward.

500
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,550
Great.

501
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,830
In that case, no problem.

502
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,270
If there's anything we can do for you, just tell us.

503
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,670
We're here to help.

504
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,610
- Yes.
- Thank you.

505
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,570
- What is the reward?
- Of course it's money.

506
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,250
Wow. Money.

507
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:09,870
You would like me to teach you how to chase a girl and compete against Khun Sasa?

508
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,550
Exactly.

509
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,350
You must teach me everything you know.

510
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,750
I don't care how many ways there are to get a girl.

511
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,070
Anyway, you must tell me everything.

512
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,690
You will definitely lose.

513
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,470
Khun Sasa is a playboy.

514
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,210
How can you win against him?

515
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,130
Maha.

516
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,290
If I lose, I'll fire you.

517
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,570
What does it have to do with me?

518
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,394
I'm going to lose my job.

519
00:36:34,394 --> 00:36:36,510
- Are you talking back?
- No, I'm not.

520
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,070
No problem, I have an idea.

521
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,770
Let's start with Three Steps.

522
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,670
- Can you make it darker?
- Sure.

523
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,370
Add a little more blue.

524
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,510
Good.

525
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,230
Superb.

526
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,050
It's pretty good, right?

527
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,950
Khun Sasa, please come with me.

528
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,010
Maha, I'm glad you're here. Come and help us.

529
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,990
Help us find the last quarter's investment contract.

530
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,990
We can't find it.

531
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,610
Not now. I have to go downstairs and check the work with Khun Sasa.

532
00:37:18,982 --> 00:37:21,570
It's just checking the work.

533
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,770
Let Khun Kheetika go. She has done that before. Right?

534
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,150
Right, Khun Kheetika?

535
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,690
Aren't we supposed to be checking the work inside the mall?

536
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,470
Why did you bring me to the restaurant?

537
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:38,150
I'm going to check the Food and Beverage Department today.

538
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,463
Thank you.

539
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,530
Khun Sasa is incredible.

540
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:52,070
He bought off Rossarin, Palida, and Kirin.

541
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,250
It's just the two of us.

542
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,630
How do we deal with Din?

543
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,910
Don't worry about that.

544
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,170
I'll find a way to get all three of them on our team.

545
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:08,430
But now you have to stop Khun Sasa and Khun Kheetika.

546
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,130
Okay.

547
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,990
Don't forget the three steps.

548
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,410
Pursuing a girl in a restaurant.

549
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,220
I won't forget.

550
00:38:17,723 --> 00:38:19,130
Sweet talk.

551
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,430
Be thoughtful.

552
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,110
Frame the opponent.

553
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,230
Frame the opponent?

554
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,740
Yes.

555
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:30,390
Does framing your opponent mean lying?

556
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,070
It's not lying.

557
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:37,430
It's just that we pick up on certain issues and make them bigger.

558
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:40,470
Just exaggerate it a little bit.

559
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,650
It's not lying.

560
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,270
Good.

561
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,930
Why didn't you invite me if you were eating, Din?

562
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,450
Do you want to join us?

563
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,910
All right.

564
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,450
It's better to eat together, so we're not lonely.

565
00:39:02,435 --> 00:39:04,310
What good dishes are there in this restaurant, Din?

566
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,670
Give me some recommendations.

567
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,550
You often brought Thatha here.

568
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,710
[First, frame the opponent]

569
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:18,070
This restaurant is remarkable. They cut the steak.

570
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,870
Khun Sira ordered us to do it.

571
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,570
So you can eat it easily.

572
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,150
[Second, be thoughtful]

573
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,630
Brother, I didn't expect you to be so thoughtful to girls.

574
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,470
Maybe you often use this trick to chase girls.

575
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,110
I haven't done this to any other girls.

576
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,170
Kheetika is the first one.

577
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,670
[Third, sweet talk]

578
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,110
Don't run away. Come here.

579
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,290
- What do you want?
- Come here.

580
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,390
Are you willing to leave Khun Sasa's team now?

581
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,170
I'm not.

582
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,150
You have no right to force me.

583
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,650
Wait!

584
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,370
Do you have to go against me?

585
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,290
Let go of me.

586
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,850
Let go. I'm going to work.

587
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,170
No.

588
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,070
You have to promise me first.

589
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,710
You have to leave Khun Sasa's team.

590
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,750
Read my lips.

591
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,270
I'm not leaving.

592
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,630
Ouch, it hurts!

593
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,110
Hey. Let go of me!

594
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,870
Won't you let me go?

595
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,750
Maha.

596
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,050
How could you kiss me?

597
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,850
I'll kiss you more.

598
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,950
I'll kiss from morning to night.

599
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,290
If you're still so stubborn

600
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,470
and don't want to leave Khun Sasa's team,

601
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:59,010
remember, you are just a pawn in my hand.

602
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,670
If you're still so stubborn,

603
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,757
I'll give you a hard time.

604
00:41:03,757 --> 00:41:05,670
Got it?

605
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,190
You─

606
00:41:13,976 --> 00:41:15,976
- Let's go back home together.
- Let's go back home together.

607
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,330
You go back first.

608
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,530
I need to go to the supermarket.

609
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,830
Hello, P'Kanghan.

610
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,290
Nannam, did you come to shop, too?

611
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,850
Yes, I'm out of groceries.

612
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,630
Me, too.

613
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,570
Let's shop together.

614
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,510
Okay.

615
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,270
Excuse me.

616
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,570
Let's go.

617
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,930
- What do you want to buy?
- What should I buy?

618
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,030
Oh, me, too.

619
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,330
What do you want to cook?

620
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,630
I want to make stir-fried spinach.

621
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,930
Let's find spinach.

622
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,423
Here. Spinach.

623
00:42:12,423 --> 00:42:16,030
Thank you. And tomatoes.

624
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:18,790
Here, tomatoes.

625
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,110
You're so cute.

626
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,310
Since you're this cute, can I flirt with you?

627
00:42:28,323 --> 00:42:30,350
- Come on.
- Done.

628
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,730
I'll take it to the car.

629
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,776
No need, Brother. Just take it to my car.

630
00:42:37,776 --> 00:42:39,696
Kanghan will go home in my car.

631
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,450
Kanghan didn't say she was going to take your car home.

632
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,170
She didn't say she was going to take your car, either.

633
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,970
Nannam, how did you get here?

634
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,186
I drove here.

635
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:54,370
Then I'll drive home in your car.

636
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,850
Okay.

637
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:02,243
I'll take it.

638
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,110
Let's go.

639
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,350
I can't stand him anymore.

640
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:15,190
Brother, let's get rid of him first.

641
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,030
Everyone in the company is gossiping

642
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:26,050
that Khun Sira and Khun Sasa are pursuing Kheetika.

643
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,050
Who does Kheetika seem to care more about?

644
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,150
I'm not sure.

645
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,610
Khun Sasa seemed to be trying hard.

646
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,530
On the other hand,

647
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,770
Khun Sira looked like a rookie in love at first glance.

648
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:41,210
But to my surprise, he looked serious.

If they can't live in peace, they'll have to live separately.

Din will serve as a director of GU.

Sorry.

814
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,546
Why are you laughing?

815
00:55:47,546 --> 00:55:49,390
Hey, I'm serious.

816
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,710
- Sorry.
- I'm serious.

817
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:54,310
Is it that funny?

OST: Zom Marie - "Just Wanna Be With You"

819
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,590
♫ I have been keeping something to myself ♫

820
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:11,030
♫ Not wanting to tell you ♫

821
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:13,530
♫ I have been secretly watching you from afar ♫

822
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:18,090
♫ I hide and avoid your gaze ♫

823
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:21,710
♫ I'm afraid you will find out ♫

824
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:27,470
♫ Not daring to reveal the truth to you ♫

825
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:31,350
♫ Pretending to be cool ♫

826
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:34,550
♫ Even though my heart is lonely ♫

827
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:39,390
♫ Wanting that someone to be by my side ♫

828
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:43,430
♫ My heart wants to open the door ♫

829
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,630
♫ And let you in ♫

830
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:51,390
♫ I want you to understand and for you to know ♫

831
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:55,470
♫ I want to have only you ♫

832
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:58,470
♫ Just only you ♫

833
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,850
♫ My inner voice ♫

834
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,830
♫ Says I love you with all my heart ♫

835
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,550
♫ The more I force myself not to waver ♫

836
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,590
♫ The more I lose to you in every way ♫

837
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:15,190
♫ Can I have you by my side? ♫

838
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:23,910
♫ Just wanna be with you ♫
