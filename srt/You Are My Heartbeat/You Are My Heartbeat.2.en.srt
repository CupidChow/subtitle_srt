00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,600
Didn't we meet last week?

157
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,340
Khun Saya made two appointments. But you didn't see her.

158
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,380
So, you can't cancel your appointment this time.

159
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,280
Khun Sira, what can I do for you?

160
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,620
Didn't you say that Khun Saya had arrived?

161
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,920
I've been waiting for 15 minutes.

162
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,940
Is she in some corner of the mall?

163
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:59,660
Khun Saya's secretary told me so.

164
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,060
She lied before we met.

165
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:08,364
Khun Sira, please calm down. Think of Ms. Chairwoman,

166
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:14,540
because Ms. Chairwoman wanted you to meet Khun Saya.

167
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,020
How about this? You can handle some work while you wait.

168
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,200
Khun Saya will be here any minute.

169
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:36,670
I'll wait for Khun Saya there.

170
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,630
I'll leave you alone.

171
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,040
Come on.

172
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:52,112
If he's not here in 15 minutes, I'll leave.

173
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,260
Hello, Khun Sira.

174
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,000
That's her. Khun Saya.

175
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:21,118
Hello.

176
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:26,920
Your secretary told my secretary that you had been here for a long time.

177
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,450
It's true. I went to the bathroom.

178
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,930
I'm sorry.

179
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,519
- Please sit down.
- Sure.

180
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,580
Are you angry that I made you wait so long?

181
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,140
No. I was working while I was waiting for you.

182
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,212
In that case, I'll let you handle the work.

183
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,672
Okay.

184
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,600
Miss, you can't go in there.

185
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,260
I told you I'd just talk for a moment.

186
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,740
Excuse me. May I help you?

187
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,135
I want to talk to Khun Sira about a project.

188
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,029
Do you have an appointment?

189
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:22,910
I don't need it.

190
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,400
Tell Khun Sira that Chanaratee,

191
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:33,450
the only daughter of Khun Papop, the CEO of the clothing manufacturing company KKPP, the number one best-selling brand in Thailand, has come to meet him.

192
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,740
Could you repeat that? I couldn't follow you.

193
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:42,858
I can't tell Mr. Sira about that.

194
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:46,120
Since you can't tell him, I'll go in myself.

195
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,146
Well… Khun Sira is not here.

196
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,826
Where is he?

197
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,900
You don't need to clean it up.

198
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,860
How long do you have to work?

199
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,400
I think, two hours.

200
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,966
What? Two hours?

201
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,331
Are you dissatisfied with me?

202
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:28,839
No.

203
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,240
You must be upset that I was late.

204
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,010
So you're making me weather this out.

205
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:37,320
It's rude to be late.

206
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,160
But you've apologized, and I've forgiven you.

207
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,080
Is this what you call forgiveness?

208
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,710
Then why are you doing this?

209
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:51,699
You said you'd wait for me to finish my work, didn't you?

210
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:54,020
I was being polite.

211
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,220
You asked me out. But you are going to make me wait two hours?

212
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,600
Khun Sira, I think you're taking me too lightly.

213
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,920
Didn't anyone teach you to be polite?

214
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:10,110
Khun Saya, I came to see you for two reasons.

215
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,430
First, the chairwoman asked me to come. Second, I respect your father.

216
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:16,320
I hope you don't misunderstand.

217
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,053
Don't think you're spectacular just because you're a director of GU Center.

218
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:27,698
Everyone in the financial world knows that you were adopted.

219
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,680
In that case, you're too good for me.

220
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,251
Then, please don't ask me out again.

221
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,920
Please examine it.

222
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,366
Khun Sira, how is it going?

223
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,020
Nothing happened.

224
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,180
You can go back. I'll get back to work.

225
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,700
Okay.

226
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,120
Call Rossarin and tell her I'm going back to the office soon.

227
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,998
Yes.

228
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,060
How many girls has he turned down so far?

229
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,260
I really want to know if there will be any woman in this life that can make him waver.

230
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,866
Apologize to me now.

231
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:40,980
Are you crazy?

232
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,630
Do you want me to apologize to the person who insulted my mom?

233
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:45,360
Are you out of your mind?

234
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,260
To be honest, if you hadn't said that you were a jewelry store owner's son,

235
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,380
I wouldn't have seen it.

236
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,580
You talk like you haven't been educated by your parents, and like you're uneducated.

237
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,340
That's why you're so dirty.

238
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
Isn't she that virus girl?

239
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,840
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not done yet.

240
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,410
You should think before you speak.

241
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,840
Don't think that every woman will like you for your money.

242
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,600
Especially me.

243
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,780
I even dumped a grandchild of the Kukitcharoen Family.

244
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,479
Excuse me.

245
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:59,420
Oh, my boss.

246
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,800
I don't understand why you're arguing.

247
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,040
But please don't insult my family.

248
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,740
I'm not. I know your family well.

249
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,865
As a member of this family,

250
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:17,900
I don't know you.

251
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:22,380
Khun Sira.

252
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:28,360
What did you say? You said you dumped a grandson of the Kukitcharoen Family, didn't you?

253
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,140
Look. He is the heir to the Kukitcharoen Family.

254
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,040
Why doesn't he seem to know you at all?

255
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,800
You're angry at me.

256
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,133
Are you so upset that you can't remember me?

257
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,400
What are you doing?

258
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,200
Do you want me to help you remember what happened between us? Huh?

259
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:28,000
All right. I'm sorry I turned down your proposal.

260
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,920
- Proposal?
- Yes, exactly.

261
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,740
That day, you knelt in front of the Eiffel Tower.

262
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,663
That moment. I cannot forget.

263
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,400
Are you crying?

264
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,060
Don't cry. I'm sorry, too.

265
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,760
- Don't cry.
- Don't touch me. You. Don't move.

266
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,180
Don't touch me. You. Don't move.

267
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,980
♫ I don't understand why my heart trembles when I see you ♫

268
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,880
♫ In my dreams, at night and during the day, why do I still long for you? ♫

269
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,400
♫ I can't stop my heart beating out of rhythm like a delirious person ♫

270
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,780
♫ I've really fallen in love with you ♫

271
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,920
♫ The more you try to flee, the more I want to find you ♫

272
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,100
♫ Not being suspicious, not being careful, suddenly it's stuck in my mind ♫

273
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,660
♫ Are you the one my heart is searching for? ♫

274
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,600
♫ Not wanting to remember but I can't forget, because I miss you ♫

275
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,580
♫ So I have to find you to devote myself to you ♫

276
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,340
♫ I didn't think that I would love you, so I let you go ♫

277
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,540
♫ In the end, I fell madly in love ♫

278
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,360
♫ I don't understand why my heart trembles when I see you ♫

279
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,200
♫ In my dreams, at night and during the day, why do I still long for you? ♫

280
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,820
♫ I can't stop my heart beating out of rhythm like a delirious person ♫

281
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,220
♫ I've really fallen in love with you ♫

282
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,020
♫ The more you try to flee, the more I want to find you ♫

283
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,990
Will he die?

284
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,850
Did I go too far?

285
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,120
What did I do?

286
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,700
Why is my heart still beating so fast?

287
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,513
What's wrong?

288
00:25:06,513 --> 00:25:08,840
- Maha.
- Yes.

289
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,780
When did you come in?

290
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,360
Just now. I'm bringing you clean clothes.

291
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,718
Hang them there and get out.

292
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:27,866
Why are you still standing there?

293
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,820
Kanghan. You're back.

294
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,133
Why are you looking at me like that?

295
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,480
I want to say something to you.

296
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,260
I want to check with you if your plan succeeded.

297
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,906
What's going on?

298
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,740
- Well...
- What's going on, Khun Rin?

299
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:17,700
Sometimes I think that I might have made a mistake staying with you.

300
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,360
Kanghan.

301
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,820
- Please listen to me.
- Mom.

302
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,740
Are you going to say that you want to make my life easier?

303
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,680
I've been away from you for so many years.

304
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,440
Don't you know why?

305
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,820
I know you don't like what I did.

306
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,680
But I want you to have new connections.

307
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,900
You should know there's nothing wrong with being rich.

308
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,840
More importantly, with money and social status,

309
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,240
people won't think less of us.

310
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,740
With the life you're living,

311
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,380
no one thinks less of you?

312
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,340
Kanghan, calm down.

313
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,100
You're not at peace. It's not good for anyone.

314
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,800
Go home and get some rest. I've got a room ready for you.

315
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,450
It's all right.

316
00:27:05,345 --> 00:27:07,280
I can stay in a hotel.

317
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,000
You have a room. Why do you want to stay in a hotel?

318
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,564
Kanghan,

319
00:27:15,564 --> 00:27:20,580
I know you're reasonable and smart, not selfish.

320
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,580
Don't be impulsive.

321
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,900
Are you trying to trick me into staying at your place?

322
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:33,300
I'm not tricking you. I mean it.

323
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:39,620
I know you never considered me to be a father.

324
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,830
But for me,

325
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,940
you're my daughter.

326
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,520
Come home and take a break.

327
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,205
All right?

328
00:28:00,273 --> 00:28:01,580
You can't go in there.

329
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,633
I'm sorry. You really can't go in there.

330
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:05,810
Yes. Khun Chanaratee, you have to schedule an appointment.

331
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,430
Then─

332
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,100
Rossarin and I tried our best to tell Khun Chanaratee

333
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,680
that she couldn't come in here without an appointment.

334
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,000
Hello, I'm Chanaratee from KKPP Clothing.

335
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,260
Happy to meet you.

336
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,833
You came in rudely. Should I be happy?

337
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:45,020
I happened to hear that your company is looking for a clothing factory for your new website.

338
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,393
KKPP has always been a leader in the garment manufacturing industry.

339
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:53,880
If we can reach a cooperation, we will have a pleasant cooperation.

340
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,320
Here's our company's profile.

341
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,860
KKPP Clothing has the most advanced garment production machinery in Thailand,

342
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,380
skilled staff, and three brands.

343
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,680
And we had 30% of the market last year.

344
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,480
Have you ever heard of the Pareto Law?

345
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,100
What's that?

346
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,790
Twenty percent of the world's businesses focus on quality rather than quantity.

347
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,640
GU Center is one of them.

348
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,720
Eighty percent of them focus on quantity rather than quality.

349
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,866
You're one of them.

350
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:35,740
That's why I can't cooperate with you.

351

[Hyatt Regency]

352
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:11,450
Hello, Khun Lom. My name is Pretty.

353
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:18,680
I am your physical examination assistant of this machine.

354
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,680
I know you're Pretty.

355
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,480
You repeat that before every physical examination.

356
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,400
Just check me out and tell me if everything is okay.

358
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,700
Your heart rate is normal.

361
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,920
Maha, what's up?

362
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,166
Keep an eye on him. Don't let him run away.

363
00:32:03,313 --> 00:32:05,493
What?

364
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,166
Hia.

365
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,020
Don't come closer.

366
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,840
Come on in.

367
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:31,033
Welcome home, Khun Kanghan.

368
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:33,023
What are you doing, Metta?

369
00:33:33,023 --> 00:33:34,880
I'm flinging confetti.

370
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,800
After you called me to get a room ready for Khun Kanghan,

371
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,520
I bought this to welcome her.

372
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:48,000
Hello, Khun Kanghan. Do you remember me?

373
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,320
Looks like you don't remember me.

374
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:59,100
But I was quite impressed by you.

375
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,480
Metta, enough.

376
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,220
Remember to get Khun Kanghan's luggage from the car and take it to her room.

377
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,960
All right.

378
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:13,733
Have a good rest, Girl.

379
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:17,500
Make yourself at home, like I said.

380
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,633
This home is our home.

381
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,700
Thank you.

382
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,633
I'll get to work.

383
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,080
Step back.

384
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,860
You're getting in the way.

385
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,400
It's dirty. You became a burden on the first day you came.

386
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,480
Did that woman from earlier die?

387
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,400
She's still not dead.

388
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,860
But the woman standing here is about to die.

389
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,810
What do you mean?

390
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,290
She meant

391
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:04,000
that Metta was talking to trash.

392
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,680
Were you talking to Kanghan?

393
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,920
It doesn't matter.

394
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,520
I understand.

395
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,680
You can't tell trash from Kanghan.

396
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:21,866
You pretended to be remarkable and lofty.

397
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:24,320
You fled abroad and didn't want to rely on my dad.

398
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,840
But you ended up relying on my dad like a leech.

399
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,980
Leech?

400
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,740
Trash.

401
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,180
You can't say that about me.

402
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,320
Why can't I?

403
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,533
You're not different from your mom.

404
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:43,966
You have arms and legs.

405
00:35:43,966 --> 00:35:46,660
But you rely on others.

406
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,800
I said that

407
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,030
because we are the same.

408
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,600
Do you know why?

409
00:35:57,266 --> 00:36:01,580
Because we are both his children.

410
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,840
You're not my dad's daughter.

411
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,167
But your dad said I was his daughter.

412
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:08,500
And he asked me to live in this house.

413
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,500
If you don't believe it, you can ask your dad.

414
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,720
- Kanghan.
- Are you sure you want to hit me?

415
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,066
You'd better think it through.

416
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,420
If you hurt me, your dad will love me more.

417
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,380
At that time, I think you'll be the trash.

418
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,700
As for Metta, please get my luggage from the car.

419
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,200
There are several pieces of them.

420
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,700
All right.

421
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,540
Stay here if you want.

422
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,920
So you will know what hell is like.

423
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,033
Please calm down.

424
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,433
Stand there, Hia.

425
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,733
Please let me go.

426
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:22,666
Please let me go, Bro.

427
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,720
I'm begging you.

428
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,900
If you move one step further, I'll jump off.

429
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,940
I'd rather die.

430
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,180
If you really want to die,

431
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,100
I hope you will die peacefully.

432
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,400
If you're not dead and you become a vegetable,

433
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,700
that would be nice.

434
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,920
That way, I won't have to look for you.

435
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,120
Come on.

436
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,260
How can you say that?

437
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,420
Don't you love me?

438
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,960
I love you.

439
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,740
I love you very much.

440
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,220
Be a man.

441
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,340
Go back and do your job.

442
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,900
I don't want to run the company.

443
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,260
I don't like business.

444
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,340
You're doing great.

445
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,040
Since you helped Grandma, the company's business has doubled,

446
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,080
the company's business has doubled,

447
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,520
and the stocks have also gone up.

448
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,000
Why do you want me to do it?

449
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,206
Because you're the heir to the GU Group.

450
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,929
I would rather not be the heir to the GU Group.

451
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,300
I'm sorry, Hia. I don't want to go back.

452
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,420
I would rather not see Grandma.

453
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:38,720
Din!

454
00:38:41,226 --> 00:38:43,246
Bye-bye.

455
00:38:43,246 --> 00:38:44,926
Din.

456
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,700
Why is he so reluctant to see Grandma?

457
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,963
Khun Sira.

458
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:11,033
Khun Sira. You belittled my company.

459
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,760
Did I say something wrong?

460
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,840
KKPP Clothing produces plenty of products.

461
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,723
And you're planning to get your clothing brands to take the market.

462
00:39:21,723 --> 00:39:24,340
But why can't you enter foreign markets?

463
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,800
Because you focus on quantity rather than quality.

464
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,270
That puts your company and my company on a different level.

465
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,000
You've gone too far.

466
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,333
Please leave.

467
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:40,800
We've never worked with a company below us.

00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,680
What are you talking...

469
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,320
Khun Sira was just pointing out the facts.

470
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,120
I hope you don't get angry.

471
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,980
Yeah, I'm sorry, but our boss can't walk you out.

472
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:07,400
Khun Sira has work to do and can't walk you out in person.

473
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,100
Please try to understand.

474
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,720
I won't give up easily.

475

00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,200
the grandson of the chairman of the GU Group.

479
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,820
Now he is back from abroad.

480

He will take over the management of the New Look website.

Unfortunately,

482

Khun Sasa didn't attend the inauguration ceremony.

So the launch had to be canceled.

But it's all right. It's the internet era.

because there's a viral video on social media.

You'll be surprised when you see the video,

488
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,760
because the protagonist of the video is Khun Sasa,

489
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,640

do you want me to tell Khun Hom's father?

00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,140
♫ Not wanting to tell you ♫

642
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,700
♫ I have been secretly watching you from afar ♫

643
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:14,140
♫ I hide and avoid your gaze ♫

644
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:17,900
♫ I'm afraid you will find out ♫

645
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:23,540
♫ Not daring to reveal the truth to you ♫

646
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:27,660
♫ Pretending to be cool ♫

647
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,640
♫ Even though my heart is lonely ♫

648
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,540
♫ Wanting that someone to be by my side ♫

649
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:39,580
♫ My heart wants to open the door ♫

650
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,640
♫ And let you in ♫

651
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,540
♫ I want you to understand and for you to know ♫

652
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,580
♫ I want to have only you ♫

653
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,660
♫ Just only you ♫

654
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,900
♫ My inner voice ♫

655
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,900
♫ Says I love you with all my heart ♫

656
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,680
♫ The more I force myself not to waver ♫

657
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,620
♫ The more I lose to you in every way ♫

658
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:11,440
♫ Can I have you by my side? ♫

659
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,100
♫ Just wanna be with you ♫
