00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,899
Isn't it a man's shirt?

160
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:43,599
Is it for me?

161
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:46,200
No. I bought it for Nannam.

162
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,212
That dude?

163
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:51,280
- Why did you buy a shirt for him?
- What's wrong?

164
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,480
What does it have to do with you?

165
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,120
Do you want to rob the cradle?

166
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,680
Haven't you heard of it?

167
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,700
Robbing the cradle keeps you forever young. Excuse me.

168
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,680
Hom! Hom.

169
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,360
Let's make it clear.

170
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,720
You can't go to that dude.

171
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,780
Why? Whether I rob the cradle or not, it's none of your business.

172
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,580
Are you sure it's none of my business?

173
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:32,214
Think about it.

174
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:37,312
I don't have to think about it because I don't know what to think.

175
00:12:37,312 --> 00:12:39,473
What a shame.

176
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,239
Hom! Come back and make it clear.

177
00:12:45,938 --> 00:12:48,057
- Khun Na, wait.
- Yes.

178
00:12:48,057 --> 00:12:50,887
Do Khun Sasa and Khun Hom have any work to discuss today?

179
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:52,419
No.

180
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:54,215
When did Khun Sasa arrive?

181
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:56,940
I don't know. Khun Hom asked me to run an errand.

182
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,740
When I got back, I saw Khun Sasa lying on the couch in Khun Hom's office.

183
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:06,987
- Darling.
- What?

184
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:10,923
Go and ask Khun Kheetika about what happened today.

185
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,920
- Pa, why don't you ask her? Isn't she your idol?
- What?

186
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,000
What should I ask first?

187
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,180
Should I begin with Khun Sira kissing Khun Kheetika?

188
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,100
Khun Sira kissed Khun Kheetika?

189
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,960
Keep your voice down!

190
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:31,165
Or should I begin with Khun Sasa falling out of love?

191
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:33,605
Which one should I ask first?

192
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,420
I can't see that Khun Sasa has fallen out of love.

193
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,560
Of course.

194
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,180
The "LOVE" sign that appeared at that time was made by Khun Sasa.

195
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,240
The "LOVE" sign is not good. But the heart pattern is okay.

196
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,120
What?

197
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,320
Really?

198
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,360
- What?
- That's spectacular.

199
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,210
It's a fantastic idea, right? Am I great or not?

200
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:15,752
Are they gossiping about Khun Sira telling you his feelings?

201
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,180
You're well-informed.

202
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,460
You eagerly came over and asked.

203
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,020
Who do you want to relay the news to?

204
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,640
Who do you want me to tell first?

205
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,200
Khun Sasa or the chairwoman?

206
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:36,753
Actually,

207
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,820
whoever you want.

208
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,620
Don't forget to tell them...

209
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,080
that Khun Sira and I are already dating.

210
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,400
Did you hear that?

211
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,160
What are you gossiping about?

212
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,580
Is there no work to do?

213
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,140
No, we have a pile of work to do.

214
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,080
- We're working on it.
- I agree.

215
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,472
Are you going to check their work?

216
00:15:11,472 --> 00:15:15,272
Yes. Is there something you want?

217
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,320
Do you want to get something to eat

218
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,960
after checking their work?

219
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,100
It's up to you.

220
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,440
Your phone keeps ringing, Hom.

221
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,720
Who is messaging you? Won't you read them?

222
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,944
It's Din. He likes to bother me with messages.

223
00:16:07,944 --> 00:16:09,686
What a child.

224
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:12,353
I saw him in your office today.

225
00:16:12,353 --> 00:16:14,553
What's going on between you two?

226
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,640
I think he had a fight with Kanghan.

227
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,280
He looked tired and pale.

228
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,080
Do you know why they fought?

229
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,106
I don't know.

230
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,420
You'd better answer the phone.

231
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,060
What if it's an emergency?

232
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,766
What's up, Din?

233
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:51,440
Hom, I'm on your doorstep.

234
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,400
Come out and make it clear to me.

235
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,642
You are here.

236
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:58,500
Why don't you go home when you're drunk? Why did you come to my house?

237
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,300
I don't want to go home.

238
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,400
I want to ask you about that dude.

239
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm warning you. Don't go to that dude.

240
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,820
Don't mess around here. You're drunk. Go home.

241
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,000
Promise me that you won't go to that dude again.

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,520
Can you send him home? He's drunk.

243
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,766
Your boyfriend is so drunk.

244
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:19,306
Take care of him yourself.

245
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,273
Help me. He's not my boyfriend.

246
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:29,473
Send him back.

247
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:31,420
Is he going to survive?

248
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,459
Be careful. Watch your head.

249
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:40,160
If Khun Premyuda finds out, will she create problems for your company?

250
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,320
I don't care if she cancels her contract with us.

251
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,220
But if she wants to hurt our daughters, I won't let her go.

252
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,420
Din! Go home.

253
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,020
Get out.

254
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,360
I'll help them out. Come on.

255
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,582
Don't go to that dude.

256
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:03,660
- Come on.
- Come on.

257
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,180
What should we do, Dad?

258
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,230
Done.

259
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,893
Honey, it looks delicious.

260
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,060
Didn't you say we were going out to eat?

261
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,365
Why did you change your mind?

262
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,680
We can eat out whenever we want.

263
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,960
But it's difficult to eat the food you cook.

264
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,200
In that case,

265
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,760
why don't you move back in with me?

266
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,360
I'll cook for you every day.

267
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,620
I'll think about it.

268
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,920
Don't think about it for too long.

269
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:59,845
By the way,

270
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:03,600
did you tell Kansinee that we were dating

271
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,080
because you wanted her to tell the chairwoman?

272
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,533
Yes.

273
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:16,760
I don't want to date you secretly.

274
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,411
It's like it's wrong for us to date.

275
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:23,200
And I want her to know that I'm not afraid of her.

276
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,459
Don't worry.

277
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:32,520
I promise I'll be there for you

278
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,200
no matter what happens.

279
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,010
I'll get her to accept that we're dating.

280
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:45,619
Me, too.

281
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:50,200
I won't give up or run away again.

282
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,400
In that case, we should

283
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,212
discuss how to deal with the chairwoman.

284
00:19:58,212 --> 00:20:00,320
After you finish your salmon,

285
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,200
go to Nannam's, pack your stuff, and move in with me.

286
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,860
So we can discuss the plan together.

287
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,900
Are you worried I'll run away?

288
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,800
I don't like being alone.

289
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,660
I like being with you.

290
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,979
[Chanaratee]

291
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:28,406
Hom? Why did she call you?

292
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:36,773
Why are you so drunk, Din?

293
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,240
He's so drunk. I don't know what's bothering him.

294
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,500
I'm not drunk.

295
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,260
Why are you drunk?

296
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,559
Why are you here?

297
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,940
Let's talk about it later.

298
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,500
Let's get Din up there now. Let's go.

299
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,880
Careful.

300
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,600
Hom, you can't go to that dude.

301
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,470
- Hom.
- I'm not Hom. I'm your brother.

302
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,533
I'm your brother.

303
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,380
What are you talking about?

304
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,560
Ignore him.

305
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,880
I don't think he's talking nonsense.

306
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,920
If there's nothing else, I'll go home.

307
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,820
Okay, I'll come back with you.

308
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,420
I'll go back.

309
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,320
Wait.

310
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,280
Why don't you drive my car?

311
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,959
It's not safe for you to take a taxi back.

312
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,800
It's all right.

313
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,200
How are you going to work tomorrow?

314
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,450
I'll ask Mahakul to pick me up tomorrow.

315
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,040
Take it.

316
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,260
Call me when you get there.

317
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,000
Hom, don't leave me.

318
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,380
Why are your muscles so strong? It's strange.

319
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,940
Okay, Khun Lom. I arrived.

320
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:50,173
Okay, that's it.

321
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
You're finally dating Khun Sira, aren't you?

322
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:04,032
Does Din know?

323
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:05,932
I think he knows.

324
00:23:06,946 --> 00:23:12,146
Then... I think you had something to do with Din being drunk.

325
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:15,960
I don't think so.

326
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,820
If that was the case, he should have come to me. But he went to you.

327
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,900
I think he wanted to stop you from dating Nannam.

328
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,497
I told you Din was talking nonsense.

329
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:29,839
You're keeping something from me, aren't you?

330
00:23:31,372 --> 00:23:33,600
Don't try to change the subject.

331
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,540
I'm asking about you and Khun Sira.

332
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,020
If you're seeing him, what should you say to your mom...

333
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,738
about you going abroad?

334
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:47,500
I haven't thought about it yet.

335
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,486
I'm thinking about how to get Khun Premyuda to accept us.

336
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:55,640
It should be hard. You have to be mentally prepared.

337
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,920
Come on. Did you have to say that?

338
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,800
I have to get you mentally prepared.

339
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,972
I won't give up easily.

340
00:24:04,972 --> 00:24:06,420
Good.

341
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,900
I'm waiting for your good news.

342
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:14,653
Don't give up too easily.

343
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,453
What?

344
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,680
About Din.

345
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,620
I'm waiting for you to marry Din.

346
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,593
Don't talk nonsense.

347
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:27,593
It will never happen.

348
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,479
Din.

349
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,600
Din.

350
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:45,733
Wake up.

351
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,540
Brother?

352
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,500
Why am I at your place?

353
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,279
Khun Chanaratee sent you here last night.

354
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,120
Hom?

355
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,340
Hom sent me here?

356
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,900
Did she see that dude?

357
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,600
How could she see him so late at night?

358
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:07,780
What happened to you last night?

359
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,660
Why were you so drunk and messing around at Hom's house?

360
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,840
I didn't mess around.

361
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,786
I just wanted to make it clear to her.

362
00:25:15,786 --> 00:25:17,486
About what?

363
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,405
You don't want Khun Hom to see Nannam, do you?

364
00:25:22,405 --> 00:25:25,793
How do you know that? Did Hom tell you that?

365
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:29,027
No. You said it.

366
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:31,500
What?

367
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,280
Why don't you want Khun Hom to see Nannam?

368
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,760
I don't want it.

369
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,040
She's robbing the cradle.

370
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,533
That's her business.

371
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:45,425
Why? I don't think you have the right to stop her.

372
00:25:45,425 --> 00:25:46,882
Don't I have the right to stop her?

373
00:25:46,882 --> 00:25:48,900
I have the right to stop her.

374
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,380
How come?

375
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,880
Well─

376
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,738
I have the right to stop her anyway.

377
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,900
You don't have to pretend to sleep.

378
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,060
Tell me what you have done.

379
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,940
Brother, can you stop pushing me?

380
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,520
If you don't tell me,

381
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,494
I won't help you in the future.

382
00:26:13,494 --> 00:26:15,240
I'll leave your coffee here.

383
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,180
Wait, Brother. Calm down.

384
00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:21,300
I can say it.

385
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,560
But you should promise me

386
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,580
you won't get angry when I tell you.

387
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,265
Come here. Don't run, Din.

388
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:31,646
Stop!

389
00:26:31,646 --> 00:26:33,879
Din. Stop!

390
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:36,042
Didn't you promise me that you wouldn't be angry? Why are you chasing me?

391
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:38,863
Don't you think you deserve to be beaten?

392
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,840
From now on, you're not allowed to drink. If you drink, this will happen again.

393
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,460
I didn't mean to do that.

394
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,220
If Hom hadn't messed with me, it wouldn't have happened.

395
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,320
How can you blame Hom?

396
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,675
You have to take responsibility for that.

397
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,800
I want to take responsibility.

398
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,880
I have tried to talk to Hom and solve it. But she keeps running away.

399
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,660
And then there's that dude.

400
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,840
You said you wanted to take responsibility.

401
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,765
Is that because you feel guilty,

402
00:27:06,765 --> 00:27:10,665
or is it because you have a crush on Hom?

403
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,205
Brother, don't ask so much now. Okay?

404
00:27:13,205 --> 00:27:16,640
The unsolved problems are already giving me numerous headaches.

405
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,220
If you want to solve it,

406
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,640
you have to find the answer to it first.

407
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,760
So you will know how to take responsibility.

408
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,980
[GU]

409
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,400
Did Din tell you what happened last night?

410
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,480
It's hot.

411
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:37,760
Well.

412
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,540
Din asked me to give him some time, and then he would tell me.

413
00:27:45,072 --> 00:27:47,700
You are superb at stalling.

414
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,786
You always stall.

415
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:54,700
Hom is the same. She didn't say anything to me.

416
00:27:56,866 --> 00:27:59,446
I think we shouldn't worry about others.

417
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,980
We should focus on us.

418
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,220
Did Khun Premyuda ask you

419
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,700
about our relationship?

420
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,280
The chairwoman didn't say anything.

421
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,623
Or does she not know?

422
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:18,125
The whole mall knows it. How could she not know?

423
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:21,000
Kansinee knows it. The chairwoman must know it.

424
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,620
It's so quiet.

425
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,972
Maybe she's thinking of a plan to stab me in the back.

426
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:29,580
The chairwoman is not that kind of person.

427
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,940
If she's still so quiet,

428
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,440
I'll go and make it clear to her.

429
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:42,300
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

430
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,460
You can...

431
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,340
cheer for me.

432
00:28:52,986 --> 00:28:54,486
Okay?

433
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,500
Cheer for me.

434
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,159
Your illness is much better.

435
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:05,140
Before, when you were touched by someone,

436
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,200
you would wipe it with a wet wipe.

437
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,260
I don't know how I got cured.

438
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,400
I should ask Dr. Zhao.

439
00:29:25,484 --> 00:29:27,520
It's enough for me to have you around.

440
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,600
Cutie.

441
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:38,026
Maha.

442
00:29:40,086 --> 00:29:42,086
What is it, Maha?

443
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:45,859
Where is Maha?

444
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,300
He went out.

445
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,140
He saw it all.

446
00:29:53,115 --> 00:29:55,480
You.

447
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,386
You've developed a habit of lying.

448
00:29:58,386 --> 00:30:02,086
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

449
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,945
Kheetika high-profilely announced a relationship with Khun Sira.

450
00:30:27,945 --> 00:30:29,900
Aren't you going to do something?

451
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,540
What do I need to do?

452
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,100
All I want is to get Kheetika out of Din's life.

453
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,992
And I made it.

454
00:30:37,992 --> 00:30:43,286
Do you mean you accept that she's dating Khun Sira?

455
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:45,906
I won't accept that.

456
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:52,860
Then... let me know if you need any help.

457
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,960
I have my own plans.

458
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,260
I don't need you.

459
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,100
From now on, you don't have to come to me.

460
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,600
You are of no use to me anymore.

461
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,940
Do you think you can get rid of me?

462
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,547
There's only interest between us.

463
00:31:12,547 --> 00:31:16,900
But now, you are of no use to me.

464
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,300
I don't have to keep you.

465
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,740
You're thinking of kicking me out?

466
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,540
I'm not going to kick you out now.

467
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:29,960
But remember, if you get into any trouble at the company,

468
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,700
I won't help you.

469
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:40,533
Okay.

470
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,860
I'll keep that in mind.

471
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,580
Khun Kansinee is a scary woman.

472
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,620
I'm afraid she won't be willing to let it go.

473
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,980
Congratulations on finally being a couple.

474
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,300
I never knew when Khun Sira would

475
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,600
know how he felt about Khun Kheetika.

476
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,780
I want to thank you.

477
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,420
Thank you for enlightening me.

478
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,060
You're welcome.

479
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,860
Why have his symptoms improved so much?

480
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,725
It's because of love.

481
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:27,340
Doctor.

482
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,680
When will you stop teasing me?

483
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,200
Hey, I'm not teasing you. I'm serious.

484
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,520
Khun Sira's symptoms were caused by mental illness.

485
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,900
The reason why he consistently had to stay clean was because when he was a child,

486
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,060
he had to live in a scary environment.

487
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,420
The things around him cast a shadow on his mind.

488
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,480
Your symptoms improved because your mother was around you.

489
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,400
Your mother loved you and protected you.

490
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,780
But after my mom disappeared,

491
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,740
my symptoms got worse.

492
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,580
That was because your protective mechanisms from your mother were gone.

493
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,026
So you relapsed.

494
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:09,860
But don't worry. Now, you have a new protection mechanism.

495
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,460
That's Khun Kheetika.

496
00:33:13,555 --> 00:33:16,020
- Me?
- Yes.

497
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,400
When he's around you,

498
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,520
he feels safe and comfortable.

499
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,880
So he can overcome his fear of dirt.

500
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,600
Congratulations, Khun Sira.

501
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,460
Thank you, Kanghan.

502
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,980
You brought me good luck.

503
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,040
Good luck.

504
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,948
Where did you learn that?

505
00:33:47,948 --> 00:33:50,620
Which movie did you learn that from, Khun Sira?

506
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,140
He made fun of me.

507
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,300
Why are you turning on the lights? It's so bright.

508
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,860
Why aren't you going to work today?

509
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,820
Are you still upset?

510
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,180
Haven't you accepted Kheetika's relationship with Lom?

511
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,900
I'm just lazy.

512
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,480
It has nothing to do with my brother and Kanghan's relationship.

513
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,220
You love Kheetika so much.

514
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,740
Doesn't it hurt to be abandoned like this?

515
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,060
No.

516
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,432
I am happy to see the two people I love in love.

517
00:34:33,432 --> 00:34:35,713
- Really?
- Really.

518
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:38,306
Kanghan and I are just friends.

519
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:39,720
And we will only be friends.

520
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,480
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

521
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,262
You like it, don't you?

522
00:34:46,262 --> 00:34:49,200
You've finally separated me from Kanghan.

523
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,340
I hope you will stop meddling in Kanghan and my brother's affairs.

524
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:02,740
If she doesn't mess with my grandson, I won't do anything to her.

525
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,520
That's good.

526
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,720
Let them live a happy life.

527
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,040
I wonder how long

528
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,840
they will be happy,

529
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
how much will they love each other,

530
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,600
and how much will they trust each other.

531
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,965
They trust each other very much.

532
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:27,579
Nothing can destroy their mutual trust.

533
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,660
We'll see.

534
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,033
Why did you come back together today?

535
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:47,146
We ran into each other at the supermarket.

536
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:49,700
So we came back together.

537
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,140
You bought so many things. How about this?

538
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,205
I'll go prepare dinner for you.

539
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:56,200
Mom, wait.

540
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,680
I have something to tell you.

541
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,080
What is it? Just say it.

542
00:36:08,073 --> 00:36:11,333
Now, your symptoms are getting better.

543
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,840
I think I'll move back to the apartment.

544
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:20,620
Why do you want to move back to the apartment?

545
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:28,139
Maybe she's worried that her friend in the apartment misses her.

546
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:31,899
Maybe she's worried that the people around there...

547
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:38,660
In that case, can you spend your weekends with me?

548
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:42,544
Okay. No problem.

549
00:36:42,544 --> 00:36:47,240
Well, Kanghan. My friend called me yesterday.

550
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,460
He said you can go there to work when you are ready.

551
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,660
You don't have to worry about where you live.

552
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,900
Papop's friend has arranged it for you.

553
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,420
I thought about this. I'll come with you.

554
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,980
Mom, you're coming with me?

555
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,100
What about Lung Papop?

556
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,840
Don't worry about me.

557
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,240
It's okay if we don't live together.

558
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,100
I think you and your mother

559
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,360
should spend more time together.

560
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,760
I'm going to live with you for two or three years.

561
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,460
Or I'll live with you until you get tired of me and drive me out.

562
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,440
I'll go and prepare dinner for you.

563
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,680
Give it to me, Khun Hom.

564
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,720
You're in trouble.

565
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,180
No one bought it at 3:00. So we bought them all.

566
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,552
Feed me, Darling.

567
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:07,960
Khun Kheetika. What's wrong? You don't look good.

568
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,300
I don't look good?

569
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,900
I mean, you look anxious.

570
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,040
Your face is pretty.

571
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,400
Did you have a fight with Khun Sira?

572
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,160
Kirin, what are you talking about? Are you crazy?

573
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,800
They are in the infatuation period. How could they fight?

574
00:38:31,553 --> 00:38:34,680
Is it about Khun Sasa?

575
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,200
Did Khun Sasa change his mind?

576
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,900
Stop guessing.

577
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm worried about work.

578
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:42,799
What is it?

579
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:49,246
Kanghan, I want to talk to you.

580
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:51,080
Come on.

581
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,005
I'll go myself.

582
00:38:53,005 --> 00:38:54,605
Come on.

583
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,180
Do you want me to ask Hom out for you?

584
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,420
Why don't you call her yourself?

585
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,300
If I call her, she won't go out with me.

586
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,980
Can you tell me what happened between you?

587
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,540
I want to see Hom. I want her answer first.

588
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,640
Then I'll tell you.

589
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,886
Okay, Kanghan?

590
00:39:19,886 --> 00:39:21,886
Help me.

591
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,120
Okay.

592
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,180
[Kanghan]

593
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,499
Hello.

594
00:39:47,499 --> 00:39:49,073
Hom.

595
00:39:50,987 --> 00:39:52,240
Where are you?

596
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,100
I'm at a coffee shop near Khun Sira's apartment.

597
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,960
What are you doing there?

598
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,220
I asked Nannam out.

599
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,540
You asked Nannam out?

600
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,580
That dude?

601
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,880
That─

602
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,080
I got his shirt dirty that day.

603
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,460
So I bought a new one for him.

604
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:15,273
What do you want?

605
00:40:15,273 --> 00:40:20,900
I... I'm a little bored. I want to talk to you.

606
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,900
Why call me?

607
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,539
Why don't you call your boyfriend?

608
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:28,339
Yes.

609
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Khun Sira, have you heard the news?

610
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,400
Yes.

611
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,840
What happened?

612
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,480
Why is there a rumor that the chairwoman is going to fire you?

613
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,540
Everybody is talking about it. I just knew it.

614
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,869
It's not a rumor, Maha.

615
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:47,080
The chairwoman has called to inform me

616
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,890
that she is going to fire me.

617
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,793
Why?

618
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:55,820
I don't know.

619
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,920
The chairwoman will hold a meeting in a month.

620
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,640
I think she will give the reason.

621
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,980
Khun Kheetika!

622
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,660
Something is wrong.

623
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,100
What's wrong?

624
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,519
I heard that the chairwoman wants to fire Khun Sira.

625
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:14,119
What?

626
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,233
Do you want to fire Khun Lom?

627
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:25,000
Do I have to answer you?

628
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,660
If you are firing him because of me,

629
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,880
you have to answer me.

630
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,860
I just learned how important you are.

631
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,840
You are so important that I'll fire Lom for you.

632
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,125
It's because he's dating me, right?

633
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,075
- Rossarin.
- Yes.

634
00:41:43,075 --> 00:41:46,733
Go and get Lom to meet me in the conference room.

635
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:48,180
Khun Premyuda.

636
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,820
- Khun Premyuda!
- Okay.

637
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,240
Khun Kheetika.

638
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,060
Calm down.

639
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,560
Okay?

640
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,280
I'll go get Khun Sira first.

641
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:05,940
I think you know it, right?

642
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,820
In a month, I'll have Din take over.

643
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,480
The position I prepared for him

644
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,700
is the vice chairman of the GU Group, which is your current position.

645
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:21,940
I know.

646
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,667
And you have to leave this position.

647
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:31,367
I hope you understand my sudden decision to fire you.

648
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:33,640
I understand.

649
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,040
Do you have any questions?

650
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,740
No.

651
00:42:39,232 --> 00:42:41,032
I do.

652
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,860
I'm going to write a resignation notice for Khun Sira anyway.

653
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:54,326
I want to know if I need to write any other notices.

654
00:42:54,326 --> 00:42:56,126
For example,

655
00:42:57,273 --> 00:43:00,993
the notice of Khun Sira's new position after stepping down as vice chairman.

656
00:43:00,993 --> 00:43:02,659
Yes.

657
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:08,160
After Sira steps down as GU's vice chairman,

658
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,220
I'll let him...

659
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:14,540
replace me as GU's chairman.

660
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,580
Do you want me to replace you as GU's chairman?

661
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,920
Khun Sira, congratulations.

662
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,520
You're going to be GU's chairman.

663
00:43:31,305 --> 00:43:34,640
Why do you suddenly want me to be the chairman?

664
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,420
I'm tired. I want to rest.

665
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,200
You've been doing great,

666
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:45,840
especially in the recent task.

667
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,780
I'm proud of you.

668
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,925
I'm sorry, Ms. Chairwoman. What task?

669
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:58,520
The task I asked you to make Kheetika fall in love with you

670
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,860
and get her out of Din's life.

671
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,680
You did a good job.

672
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,440
Kheetika loves you very much now.

673
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,480
You can go out with Kheetika for another month or two.

674
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,160
Then you can get rid of her.

675
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,880
I'll let you make the decision.

676
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:19,498
Ms. Chairwoman, I think you misunderstood Kheetika and me.

677
00:44:19,498 --> 00:44:21,198
Enough.

678
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,820
I have other things to do.

679
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,720
You'll take care of it.

680
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,620
I'm sorry. I want to explain what's going on with Kheetika and me.

681
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:38,160
- Ms. Chairwoman.
- Khun Lom.

682
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,740
Have you really been fired?

683
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,000
I'll make it clear to the chairwoman first.

684
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:51,600
Darling, what's going on?

685
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,200
Has Khun Sira really been fired?

686
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,940
It's true Khun Sira was fired from the position of vice chairman.

687
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:03,200
Khun Sira has been working hard.

688
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,780
Calm down, Khun Pa.

689
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,933
The chairwoman fired Khun Sira from the position of vice chairman.

690
00:45:09,933 --> 00:45:12,653
Because she wants to make him GU's chairman.

691
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,300
Did Khun Premyuda make him the chairman?

692
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,505
Isn't that good news, Darling?

693
00:45:19,505 --> 00:45:20,606
Yes.

694
00:45:20,606 --> 00:45:22,760
Did she give a reason?

695
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,760
She didn't.

696
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,300
We should celebrate it.

697
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,620
Let's celebrate. He's becoming chairman.

698
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,820
P'Hom, you don't have to waste money and buy a new shirt for me.

699
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,920
It can be washed clean.

700
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,460
But I feel bad about it.

701
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:48,880
When I damage someone's property and I don't compensate them, I feel guilty.

702
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,998
If I want new clothes, I should hit you more.

703
00:45:54,998 --> 00:45:57,380
So I will have plenty of new clothes.

704
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:00,380
Do you want me to get this one dirty, too?

705
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,473
Last time, it was lipstick.

706
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:05,198
This time, let me use hot tea.

707
00:46:05,198 --> 00:46:07,098
I am kidding.

708
00:46:10,777 --> 00:46:14,178
If you like to buy clothes for others, buy me some, too.

709
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,580
How did you get here?

710
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:19,133
By car.

711
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,960
I'm not asking how you got here.

712
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,520
How did you know I was here?

713
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,906
Do you like old women?

714
00:46:28,906 --> 00:46:32,380
You missed Kanghan. Then you went to her sister.

715
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,040
P'Hom and I just know each other.

716
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,720
Before you say anything, please consider her feelings.

717
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,226
You speak like a gentleman.

718
00:46:42,226 --> 00:46:45,609
Do you like such a gentle and sweet man?

719
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:51,279
Yes. I like this kind of man.

720
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:56,440
Get away. Please don't disturb my private life.

721
00:46:58,139 --> 00:46:59,860
I can go away.

722
00:47:00,906 --> 00:47:04,475
But you have to come with me because I have something to tell you.

723
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,398
Let go.

724
00:47:07,398 --> 00:47:10,647
Din. You are hurting me. Let go.

725
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:14,740
I think if P'Hom doesn't want to go with you,

726
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,200
you should let go of your hand.

727
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,986
You should let go of your hand,

728
00:47:21,986 --> 00:47:26,106
because I have something to say to my girlfriend.

729
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,900
When did I become your girlfriend?

730
00:47:31,653 --> 00:47:36,373
Do you want me to tell him what happened that night?

731
00:47:48,393 --> 00:47:50,393
What do you want to say?

732
00:47:50,393 --> 00:47:52,440
Do you like that dude?

733
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,500
Be honest. Don't be sarcastic.

734
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,820
No.

735
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,760
You're not lying to me. Right?

736
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,820
Why should I lie to you?

737
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,466
Is that all you want to ask?

738
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:07,106
I want to ask you something.

739
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,740
But before you answer me,

740
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:15,000
you have to promise that you will answer sensibly.

741
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,493
No need to rush. Take your time.

742
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:19,193
Say what's on your mind.

743
00:48:19,193 --> 00:48:22,660
Don't be sarcastic. And follow your heart.

744
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,920
If you don't ask, I'll leave.

745
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,987
Do you want to go out with me?

746

747
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:42,900
I want to take responsibility for what happened that night.

748

It's not necessary.

Do you want to go out with me just because you feel guilty?

If that's the case, you don't have to.

752
00:49:02,859 --> 00:49:06,250
Two people should date out of affection for each other,

753
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,060
not about guilty feelings and taking responsibility.

754

I want to go out with you not just out of guilt...

I want to have you by my side.

Why should I go according to these words?

Because I'll stop you at any cost.

817
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:48,160
I won't let women like you enter the Kukitcharoen Family.

818
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,620
If you want to prove your love to me,

819
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:56,040
leave the Kukitcharoen Family.

820
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,667
Stop.

821
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:04,980
If you walk out of this house today,

822
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,220
I'm not your grandma anymore.

823
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:13,080
Please send him to his house.
-Thank you.
[Behind the scenes]

824
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,260
No. In the script, I have to go with him.

825
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,840
- I'm afraid he won't go home. I'll go with him.
- Okay.

826
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,060
I'll drop him off halfway.

827
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,620
Get in the car.

828
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,900
I'll call you a ride later.

829
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,980
I'll call you a ride.

830
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,940
Can I spit out the root?

831
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,580
- Did you eat the root, too?
- Cut!

832
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,610
Can I have a tissue?

833
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:41,630
OST: Zom Marie - "Just Wanna Be With You"

834
00:54:41,631 --> 00:54:44,116
♫ I have been keeping something to myself ♫

835
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:47,599
♫ Not wanting to tell you ♫

836
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,058
♫ I have been secretly watching you from afar ♫

837
00:54:50,058 --> 00:54:54,725
♫ I hide and avoid your gaze ♫

838
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:58,475
♫ I'm afraid you will find out ♫

839
00:54:58,475 --> 00:55:03,924
♫ Not daring to reveal the truth to you ♫

840
00:55:03,924 --> 00:55:08,265
♫ Pretending to be cool ♫

841
00:55:08,265 --> 00:55:11,249
♫ Even though my heart is lonely ♫

842
00:55:11,249 --> 00:55:16,074
♫ Wanting that someone to be by my side ♫

843
00:55:16,074 --> 00:55:19,935
♫ My heart wants to open the door ♫

844
00:55:19,935 --> 00:55:23,220
♫ And let you in ♫

845
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:28,212
♫ I want you to understand and for you to know ♫

846
00:55:28,212 --> 00:55:32,317
♫ I want to have only you ♫

847
00:55:32,317 --> 00:55:35,342
♫ Just only you ♫

848
00:55:35,342 --> 00:55:37,450
♫ My inner voice ♫

849
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:41,355
♫ Says I love you with all my heart ♫

850
00:55:41,355 --> 00:55:44,185
♫ The more I force myself not to waver ♫

851
00:55:44,185 --> 00:55:47,190
♫ The more I lose to you in every way ♫

852
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:52,075
♫ Can I have you by my side? ♫

853
00:55:52,075 --> 00:56:00,377
♫ Just wanna be with you ♫
