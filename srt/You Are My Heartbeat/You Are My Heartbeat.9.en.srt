You thought of me. Why don't you let the doctor know?

Doctor, ask something else.

74

Oh, Khun Sira. I don't know what to ask you.

75
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,880
Are you not answering my question because you deliberately don't want to answer

76
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,160
or are you pretending not to know?

77
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,740
If you don't answer my question, I can't treat your condition.

78
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,700
You have to be honest with me.

Kheetika. She's the one who makes my heart race.

I don't understand why I have symptoms because of Kheetika.

82

If you ask me,

83
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,260
your symptoms have nothing to do with your condition.

84
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,605
Then, what does it have to do with, Doctor?

85
00:05:30,312 --> 00:05:32,680
Love. The feeling of love.

86
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,980
- Love?
- Love. Right.

87
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,340
Your symptom is called falling in love.

88
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,920

00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,618
Yes.

- Yes!

00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:47,020
With whom?

92
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,180
Kheetika.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
Kheetika?

94
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,300
It's not possible, Doctor.

95
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,200
I could never fall in love with that sloppy woman.

96
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,860
I think you're wrong.

97
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,360
No.

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,700
If you think I'm wrong, focus and think.

99
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,460
Ask yourself if you're thinking what I'm thinking.

100
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,220
Didn't you say you don't like liars?

101
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,980
Then, why don't you be honest with yourself?

102
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,400
What's wrong?

103
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,160
Say it out. Say it out.

104
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,820
What?

105
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,300
Doctor.

106
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,920
I... I'd better go back. It's late.

107
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,520
That's all? You would rather not continue?

108
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,480
Where are you going, Khun Sira?

109
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,320
I can't help you with love.

110
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,040
Khun Kheetika?

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,200
Sorry. If there's nothing else, I'll go out.

112
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,380
I brought you breakfast.

113
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,060
I secretly asked Mahakul.

114
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,960
He said you don't like heavy food, soups, and boiled food.

115
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,760
Because they would waste your time.

116
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,340
So the foods that suit you

117
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,420
are stir-fried vermicelli, stewed egg with herbs, and braised eggs.

118
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,240
Don't forget to eat some fruit.

119
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,880
I prepared some cherries and blueberries for you. They are good for your eyes.

120
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,880
You use your eyes a lot at work.

121
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,600
Then there's warm peppermint tea.

122
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,880
You shouldn't drink too much coffee. You should have some tea.

123
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,160
Don't worry. Everything is clean and hygienic.

124
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,360
I watched every step in the kitchen.

125
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,420
Actually, I wanted to do it myself.

126
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,520
But I can only make instant noodles, boiled eggs, fried eggs, and omelets.

127
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,980
Could it be that Khun Sira really likes Khun Kheetika,

128
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,680
and they are flirting with each other?

129
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,840
Maha, use your head.

130
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,300
Khun Kheetika prepared a lunchbox for Khun Sira with love.

131
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,380
If it's not love, what else could it be?

132
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,980
Wow, how can't he like it?

133
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,440
Khun Kheetika is beautiful and cute.

134
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,920
I think so, too.

135
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,720
Khun Sira doesn't like people who lie, but she's a liar.

136
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,900
Khun Sira loves cleanliness, but Khun Kheetika doesn't love cleanliness at all.

137
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,580
Khun Sira doesn't like to drink, but Khun Kheetika is an alcoholic.

138
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,580
Based on these three points, there's no way they're dating.

139
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,440
Why are you bullying others?

140
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,060
- Don't bully others.
- I'm not!

141
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,240
- As a man, you shouldn't gossip about women.
- The facts are on the table.

142
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,880
I'm telling the truth.

143
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,180
Since we all have doubts,

144
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,960
we have only one way to find out the truth,

145
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,900
which is to ask Khun Sira directly if he likes Khun Kheetika.

146
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,500
- Yes.
- Good idea, Friend.

147
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,840
But who's going to ask?

148
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,800
One, two, three.

149
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,040
- Don't look at me. I won't ask.
- Why?

150
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,580
If you want to know, ask Khun Sira yourself.

151
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,940
- Don't look at me.
- Are you sure, Maha?

152
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,820
Maha.

153
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,160
Is Khun Sira here?

154
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,020
Yes.

155
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,780
- She smiled, right?
- She smiled.

156
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,040
Enough. Stop gossiping.

157
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,220
Khun Sira.

158
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,040
When will you learn how to knock?

159
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,220
Sorry.

160
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,638
I just want to know if you liked your meal.

161
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,920
What do you want? Just tell me.

162
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,160
Khun Sira, please help me.

163
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,000
Think of it as for the good of the company.

164
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,000
No. It's not my job to convince Thatha. Try to find another way.

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,120
If I could figure it out, would I come to you for help?

166
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,260
This is the best way.

167
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,500
No, I won't help you.

168
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,300
Khun Sira, if we succeed,

169
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,300
we can redeem the New Look website's reputation.

170
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,160
I know it's not your work.

171
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,800
Think of it as if you were pitying your employee.

172
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,080
So what? If I help you, when other employees come to me

173
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,560
with work that they can't do, should I help them?

174
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,780
That's not what I meant.

175
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,520
It depends on the actual situation.

176
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,680
In that case, it's not suitable for me to help you.

177
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,020
Khun Sira, I know I'm asking too much.

178
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,320
But this job is essential to me.

179
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,160
I want to take responsibility for my mistakes.

180
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,120
And I don't want you to feel bad.

181
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,340
You gave me the chance to work here, but I let you down.

182
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,020
Kheetika.

183
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,100
Can you tell me where we're going to meet Khun Thatha?

184
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,720
We've come a long way.

185
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,720
It's far away, outside of Bangkok.

186
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,520
Outside of Bangkok?

187
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,020
- What?
- Put your phone down, Maha.

188
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,972
Khun Sira won't need you today.

189
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:16,740
I'm Khun Sira's secretary.

190
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,780
I'm the closest to him, and I know him the best.

191
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,680
Why wouldn't he call me?

192
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,540
Because Khun Sira already has someone who understands him.

193
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,160
Why would he care about you? Got it?

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,140
All right, don't be a secretary, be a black sheep.

195
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,400
Are you saying that I'm bad?

196
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,100
I'm not.

197
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,680
Khun Rossarin told me that black sheep means happy.

198
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,978
Good. Go down some steps. Good.

199
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:57,420
- Beautiful.
- Good.

200
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,040
Good.

201
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,160
Edit here.

202
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,300
Hello, P'Hoymen.

203
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,320
Hello, Kheetika.

204
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,520
This is Khun Sira, the vice chairman of GU.

205
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,220
Hello, Khun Sira.

206
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,480
Hello, Khun Hoymen.

207
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,180
Thatha is up there taking pictures.

208
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,498
- P'Hoy.
- Hoymen.

209
00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:31,480
Whatever. Did you ask that woman to come and see me today?

210
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,140
Hey, don't start yelling. Okay?

211
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,740
Khun Kheetika is really sincere.

212
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,080
She said there was a misunderstanding last time.

213
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,160
No. I told her I would never be a backup.

214
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,980
Because I'm a top model in Thailand.

215
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,780
I know you're a top model. But think about it.

216
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:58,140
GU Center is a top international mall.

217
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:04,211
If you become a spokesperson for GU, your career will go further.

218
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:07,420
Your worth will increase, and you will receive a lot

219
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,480
of endorsements and other jobs.

220
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,020
You'll be up, up, up. Then you'll be famous, famous, famous. Then you'll finally be rich, rich, rich.

221
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:22,346
If I want to take this job, I can just talk to Sasa and be done.

222
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:26,981
Khun Sasa of yours doesn't want you to be their spokesperson.

223
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:31,619
If he really wanted you, he wouldn't have had Kheetika contact us.

224
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,130
Honey, let me be honest with you.

225
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,370
Khun Sasa isn't serious about you.

226
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,570
He's just playing with you like he did last time.

227
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:48,050
If you want to find someone you can rely on for the rest of your life,

228
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,290
you should find a backup.

229
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:59,230
What does that mean?

230
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,190
Kheetika won't come here alone.

231
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,850
Khun Sira will be with her.

232
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,370
He's the vice chairman of GU.

233
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:17,846
If you want to find someone to rely on,

234
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:21,430
he's the best choice.

235
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:36,533
Hello, may I help you?

236
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:40,686
I want to see... see...

237
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:44,163
I want to─

238
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,850
Hom?

239
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:59,463
Hello, Mahakul. Where did my brother go?

240
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:02,436
I called him, but he didn't answer.

241
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,783
Hello, Director of New Look.

242
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,430
I heard that a designer named Kheetika made the New Look website famous.

243
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,230
She made customers make a scene in the mall.

244
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,870
I wanted to call and ask where my brother was.

245
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,230
But now I want to talk to you

246
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,490
and kill time waiting for the elevator.

247
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,530
What are you going to do with the mess Kheetika made?

248
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,110
I hope you will punish her

249
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,390
instead of letting her go because she's your ex-girlfriend.

250
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,970
Kanghan's ex-boyfriend?

251
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,603
I have to go.

252
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,650
Don't you have anything to do? Is that why you're talking about other people?

253
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,290
Don't you have any friends?

254
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,451
Is it possible that no one wishes to be your friend?

255
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,938
I don't have friends because I don't want to make friends,

256
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:04,210
not because no one wants to be friends with me, got it?

257
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,290
You said that because you have no friends.

258
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,090
Sasa!

259
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,810
What are you doing here?

260
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,690
I'm here for a debrief.

261
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:18,870
I want to know whose fault it is when there is a problem with the lingerie.

262
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,230
When will you fire Kheetika?

263
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,390
She is the source of all problems, Sasa.

264
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,150
Sorry. I cannot help you.

265
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,330
Because I have nothing to do with it.

266
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,410
Kheetika is my brother's employee. He will take care of it.

267
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,730
But you're the director.

268
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,430
Do you need permission to fire someone?

269
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,450
Or...

270
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,390
are you waiting for Kheetika to come back to you?

271
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,510
Whether I wait for someone or not is my business.

272
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,430
But you don't need to wait.

273
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,850
I'm not waiting for you.

274
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,110
Aren't you waiting for me to like you?

275
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,210
Hey. Stop waiting.

276
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,770
I would never like you.

277
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,610
Okay. It's done, everyone. Thank you.

278
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,870
It's done.

279
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,180
You're Khun Sira, right?

280
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,070
Nice to meet you.

281
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,030
Hello, Khun Thatha.

282
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,610
I want to apologize for the misunderstanding.

283
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,730
I'm sorry that we made you unhappy and made you think

284
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,750
that GU wants you to be a backup.

285
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,070
But I'm sure that we have never thought about it that way.

286
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,830
We really are keen to work with you.

287
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,990
I'm aware that Gu wouldn't do that.

288
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:01,970
But I don't understand the thoughts of someone.

289
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,710
I never considered you a backup.

290
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,650
I only wanted you to be our spokesperson from the beginning.

291
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,030
If you really wanted me to be your spokesperson,

292
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,630
why did Sasa say that?

293
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,530
Sasa said that because─

294
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:24,310
Khun Thatha, I promise no one ever thought of it that way.

295
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,670
Yes, Thatha.

296
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:31,350
Khun Sira has given his word, so don't think too much about it.

297
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,410
Let bygones be bygones.

298
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,550
I also want to let bygones be bygones.

299
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,850
But I remember it whenever I see her.

300
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:52,690
Then... Khun Thatha, if there's anything I can do to make you feel better,

301
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,170
just say it. I'm willing to do anything.

302
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,470
Are you sure? Are you willing to do anything?

303
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,350
I'm sure.

304
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,910
I want you to stay out of this project.

305
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,650
Because you don't look professional to me,

306
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,590
and you do things like a child.

307
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,550
But I started this project.

308
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,550
If you are in this project,

309
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,730
you may influence me and make me feel unhappy,

310
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,970
which will cause me not to concentrate on my work.

311
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,650
Khun Sira, if you really want me to be your spokesperson,

312
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,150
you need to do what I ask.

313
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,390
We need a spokeswoman of the new era for this project.

314
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,370
She should be beautiful, brilliant, and innovative.

315
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,730
Khun Thatha, we thought you met all of them.

316
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,550
But now, I think we were wrong.

317
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:08,270
Because you don't meet any of them.

318
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,450
Khun Sira, why did you say that?

319
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,190
You only think about yourself.

320
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,990
I think you like to think too much and look down on others.

321
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,490
Our spokesperson should not only be beautiful

322
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,470
but also kind and innovative.

323
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,070
If I make you our spokesperson,

324
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,030
I think you will lower the grade of New Look.

325
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,070
- Khun Sira.
- Excuse me.

326
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,750
Khun Sira. Khun─

327
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,450
Please wait for a moment.

328
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,450
I'll be right back.

329
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,130
P'Hoymen.

330
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,870
Give me the key. I'll drive myself.

331
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,970
I won't let you go.

332
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,910
Why did you say that about Khun Thatha?

333
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,690
Come with me and apologize to her. Go.

334
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,710
I have nothing further to say.

335
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,750
I've made up my mind.

336
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,810
I brought you here because I wanted you to convince Khun Thatha to be our spokesperson,

337
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,090
not to reject her.

338
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,610
I don't like people joking with me, and I don't like people looking down on you.

339
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,790
Well. You work for GU.

340
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,830
If someone looks down on you, they look down on GU.

341
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,170
Even if I'm insulted, as long as the job goes well, it's acceptable. Right?

342
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,870
I'm sure we can find a more famous model that can replace Thatha.

343
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,930
Have you ever heard of the substitution rule?

344
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,270
I've heard of it.

345
00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:00,050
But presently, we can't find anyone more famous and suitable than Khun Thatha.

346
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,510
And I don't want this project...

347
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,470
to fail again.

348
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,490
If you choose Thatha, you'll leave the project.

349
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,545
Can you accept it?

350
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,170
I can.

351
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,930
I can't.

352
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,750
Khun Sira!

353
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,070
Stupid. The boss is as stupid as his employee.

354
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,450
It's not the two of them who were stupid.

355
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,550
It's you.

356
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,850
Did you call me stupid?

357
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,050
Yes!

358
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,030
Khun Sira is the director of the group.

359
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,630
If he tells others what you did today,

360
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,470
your career is over, and you will fall into the abyss.

361
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,490
- I'm not afraid!
- I'm afraid!

362
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,070
Your head isn't just a decoration.

363
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,050
You should use it.

364
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,350
You rejected a job that was delivered to you.

365
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:04,010
Well, just wait and see. A model will replace you soon.

366
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,510
Kheetika, you're driving too fast.

367
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,050
Didn't you want to go back to Bangkok as soon as possible? So I'm driving fast.

368
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,810
If you're mad at me because of Thatha,

369
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:30,150
you shouldn't take it out on me by this kind of driving. It's dangerous.

370
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,450
Kheetika!

371
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,670
Please fill up the whole tank.

372
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,770
Kheetika.

373
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,330
Give me the key. I'll drive.

374
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,750
- Give me the key.
- No. Let go.

375
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,690
- Give me. I'll drive myself.
- No, I─

376
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,990
- Let go. Give it to me.
- No. I─

377
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,490
It fell down.

378
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,090
You dropped it.

379
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,510
- Me?
- Yes!

380
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,870
I asked you for it. But you didn't give it to me.

381
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,450
Why did you scramble for it? It wouldn't have happened if you hadn't scrambled for it.

382
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,850
- It wouldn't have happened if you had given it to me.
- How did I know it would fall?

383
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,190
Sir, your car is gassed up.

384
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,310
It's ฿1,700 ($51.45).

385
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,770
Would you mind opening it for me? My car key fell in there.

386
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,150
It can't open. Even if you can open it, you can't get your key. Because it's deep.

387
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:41,383
I think your key is in the Chao Phraya River now.

388
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:43,950
- But you must get it out for me.
- Get it out?

389
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,151
I can't. Because the owner of the gas station doesn't allow me to open it.

390
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:48,670
- I need to ask her first.
- Then call her.

391
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,010
I can't.

392
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,050
Because she went to cultivate. She'll be gone for three days. She can't answer the phone.

393
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:56,010
You can't open it, you can't get the key out, and you can't call her.

394
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,110
What should we do?

395
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,790
I don't know. Please pay for the gas. It's ฿1,700.

396
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,630
It's his car.

397
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:18,490
My wallet and my phone are in the car.

398
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,950
My wallet is in the car, too.

399
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,070
I didn't bring it with me.

400
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,270
Okay, Phi. Please be quick.

401
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,910
The mechanic is on the way here.

402
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,110
Thank you.

403
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,450
Sir, please come to the front of the car.

404
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,130
Okay. Smile.

405
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,950
Why are you taking a picture of us?

406
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,290
Okay.

407
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,730
Take a selfie. Okay.

408
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,070
You can only stay in this area.

409
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:09,250
If you leave this area, I will blackmail you on social media.

410
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,030
Okay?

411
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,590
Why am I so unlucky?

412
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,550
Do you think you're the only one unlucky?

413
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,349
You're hungry, right?

414
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:46,350
We have no money.

415
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,950
Would you kindly lend us some money?

416
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,990
- What?
- Could you lend us some money?

417
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,590
Because we're hungry.

418
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,930
My mom and sister haven't eaten tonight.

419
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,450
Phi, drop the act.

420
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,350
Okay.

421
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,910
You owe me ฿1,750 ($52.96).

422
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,090
That's all I have.

423
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,700
Let's eat some instant noodles first.

424
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:40,354
Instant noodles were my dad's favorite.

425
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:42,535
Do you know how to make instant noodles?

426
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:48,370
I'm not an immortal. I know how to make it.

427
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,630
Who knows?

428
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,810
What are you doing?

429
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:01,750
I don't know what's ever been put on this chair.

430
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:06,410
Come on. This is the fastest way to peel eggs.

431
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,070
If you eat it and die, I'll take you to the temple.

432
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,010
Here. Hold it for me.

433
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,310
I'll put it in there.

434
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:25,143
Done. It looks delicious.

435
00:30:25,143 --> 00:30:28,670
This is yours. I'll rip it off.

436
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,210
What are you doing?

437
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,830
I'll eat it in this.

438
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,210
You'll eat it in the bowl.

439
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,530
Wow, it looks delicious.

440
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,610
It's hot.

441
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,930
You can see it's steaming.

442
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,270
It's hot.

443
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,890
It's all right. If you die, I'll take you to the temple.

444
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,670
You deserve it.

445
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,450
- Are you all right? Do you need to go to the temple?
- I'm still alive.

446
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,750
Did you choke?

447
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,570
It's delicious.

448
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,210
I'll get you a new spoon.

449
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,070
It's all right.

450
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,870
We can share it.

451
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,150
This is economical and can mitigate climate warming.

452
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,690
You are sharing your spoon with me.

453
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,550
Don't you think I'm dirty?

454
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,890
We have...

455
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,990
kissed each other.

456
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,830
It's not that scary.

457
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,450
♫ I have been keeping something to myself ♫

458
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,810
♫ Not wanting to tell you ♫

459
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,430
♫ I have been secretly watching you from afar ♫

460
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:42,030
♫ I hide and avoid your gaze ♫

461
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,510
♫ I'm afraid you will find out ♫

462
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,470
We can eat it together. In case you want soup.

463
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,390
♫ Not daring to reveal the truth to you ♫

464
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,410
♫ Pretending to be cool ♫

465
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,450
Even though my heart is lonely ♫

466
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:03,330
♫ Wanting that someone to be by my side ♫

467
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,410
♫ My heart wants to open the door and let you in ♫

468
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,490
♫ My heart wants to open the door and let you in ♫

469
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:15,270
♫ I want you to understand and for you to know ♫

470
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:19,370
♫ I want to have you ♫

471
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:22,370
♫ Only you ♫

472
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,650
♫ My inner voice says I love you with all my heart ♫

473
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,650
♫ My inner voice says I love you with all my heart ♫

474
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,450
♫ The more I force myself not to waver, ♫

475
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,430
♫ The more I lose to you in every way ♫

476
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,170
It's hot.

477
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,270
It's hot.

478
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,870
I'm so hot after drinking the broth.

479
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,890
Yes.

480
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,990
You eat first. So we won't bump each other's heads.

481
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,750
That's it?

482
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,210
If you want it to be delicious, don't bite it off.

483
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,070
Suck it in.

484
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,830
Don't bite it off.

485
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,830
Suck. Come on.

486
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:21,110
If the noodles were any longer, I would die.

487
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,310
About the the lingerie problem on the New Look website,

488
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,470
Khun Sasa is making a publicity plan

489
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:53,390
and looking for a new spokesperson to give our website customers confidence in us again.

490
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,661
Was it all handled by Sasa?

491
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,410
Yes, Chairwoman. Khun Sasa wants to make this publicity plan himself.

492
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,270
He wants to take responsibility for what happened

493
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,850
and make up for not listening to Khun Sira's assistant's reminder.

494
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,070
Mahakul?

495
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,690
Did he remind him about the lingerie design?

496
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,725
When did he learn about lingerie design?

497
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:16,118
It was not Mahakul. It's Khun Sira's new assistant.

498
00:35:16,118 --> 00:35:18,330
What?

499
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,630
Sira got a new assistant?

500
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,630
Why didn't I know that?

501
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,570
Who is his new assistant?

502
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,790
Her name is Kheetika.

503
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,110
Please don't run into him.

504
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,550
- Come on.
- This way.

505
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,370
Something is wrong.

506
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,130
Not now. Let's go up there first.

507
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,050
Wait.

508
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,990
Otherwise, we won't be able to make it up to greet Khun Sira in line.

509
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,510
You don't have to line up to greet Khun Sira.

510
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,450
Why?

511
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,150
Because Khun Sira is not coming today.

512
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,150
What? Khun Sira isn't coming?

513
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,770
P'Maha!

514
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,070
What happened?

515
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,370
Why didn't Khun Sira come to work?

516
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,810
Tell us everything you know.

517
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,790
Quickly.

518
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,190
I don't know anything.

519
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,650
Khun Sira called and said he was tired.

520
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,930
He'll come to work in the afternoon.

521
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:08,970
Is Khun Sira sick?

522
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,150
No. It's not possible.

523
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,730
He loves cleanliness.

524
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,390
Bacteria would have been wiped out a hundred meters away.

525
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,740
True, ever since I came here to work,

526
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,210
I've never heard Khun Sira cough at all.

527
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,350
So, what's the deal?

528
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,050
Is there something you're not telling us?

529
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,850
I also want to know like you all.

530
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,090
You have so many questions.

531
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:31,030
If P'Maha doesn't know, who would?

532
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,570
- Are you sure?
- Khun Kheetika.

533
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,490
Khun Kheetika and Khun Sira left Bangkok yesterday.

534
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:43,290
So, Khun Kheetika must know what happened to Khun Sira.

535
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,210
Khun Kheetika and Khun Sira left Bangkok.

536
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,550
Then─

537
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,050
Hey, Kirin, you're imagining things, aren't you?

538
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,290
No, I'm not.

539
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:57,030
I just wanted to applaud Khun Pa's intelligence. She's smart.

540
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:01,230
They left Bangkok together.

541
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,170
Stop applauding! Nothing happened!

542
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,610
There's no way that Khun Sira and Khun Kheetika did that.

543
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,310
No!

544
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,410
Go. Let's go,

545
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,750
What happened? I feel dizzy.

546
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,290
Are you awake?

547
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,250
Khun Sira.

548
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,070
What is it?

549
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,910
I'm coming in.

550
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,790
Can you sit up? Wait.

551
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,670
Your face is still pale.

552
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,490
Are you still having diarrhea?

553
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,670
Do you want to go to the hospital? I'll take you there.

554
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,537
I'm not going to the hospital.

555
00:38:01,537 --> 00:38:03,023
I'll be fine after taking the medicine and sleeping for a while.

556
00:38:03,023 --> 00:38:05,810
What's wrong with the hospital?

557
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,630
I wanted to take you there yesterday, but you kept complaining.

558
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,730
If I can't hold on, I'll call Dr. Zhao.

559
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,050
Okay. Your decision.

560
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,570
Be careful what you eat next time.

561
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:22,090
So you won't get diarrhea again.

562
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:25,330
It's all your fault. You bought the food.

563
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,050
Hey, don't blame me.

564
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,330
I also ate it. But I don't have diarrhea.

565
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,870
Be good. Eat before you take your medicine.

566
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,390
Let's eat.

567
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,670
Open your mouth.

568
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,810
I can eat it myself.

569
00:38:58,623 --> 00:38:59,696
Okay.

570
00:38:59,696 --> 00:39:01,196
Ah, it's so hot.

571
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,550
You're taking care of me.

572
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,230
Aren't you mad at me for Khun Thatha?

573
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,530
I'm angry.

574
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,610
But that's work. It has nothing to do with you being sick.

575
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,190
Don't ask so much. Eat your meal.

576
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,010
You're mean. I'm so scared.

577
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,390
Hello, Khun Hoymen.

578
00:39:40,192 --> 00:39:41,910
Thank you.

579
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:47,010
About what happened yesterday,

580
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,310
I want to sincerely apologize to you, Khun Kheetika.

581
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:54,430
Nong Thatha is not that kind of person.

582
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,570
She was tired from work yesterday.

583
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:02,230
So she was a little upset. That's why it happened.

584
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,230
Khun Kheetika, I hope you don't get mad at Nong Thatha.

585
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,550
It's all right.

586
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,811
It's water under the bridge. And I'm not taking it personally.

587
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:14,211
Actually, Nong Thatha wanted to come today.

588
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,710
But she's sick.

589
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:22,109
She was so distressed that she went to the hospital.

590
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:23,970
She went to the hospital?

591
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,510
Which hospital? I'll visit her later.

592
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,850
Thank you. But don't bother.

593
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,910
Thatha doesn't want too many people to know.

594
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,930
She's worried about it being in the news.

595
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,450
When Thatha feels better,

596
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:44,490
I'll bring her to apologize to you again.

597
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,330
Why did Khun Thatha suddenly change her mind and want to become our spokesperson?

598
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:53,470
Nong Thatha was very upset that she made you think

599
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:56,250
she was a person who only looked beautiful on the outside.

600
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,170
In fact, she's beautiful inside and outside.

601
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:05,470
She's the perfect spokesperson for New Look.

602
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,698
I hope we can work together well.

603
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:08,969
Definitely.

604
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:14,150
Who wouldn't want to work with such a top model?

605
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:21,350
She's really... really perfect in every way.

606
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:24,670
So when do we sign the contract?

607
00:41:32,445 --> 00:41:36,012
I want to do it as soon as possible. Does it work for you? How about tomorrow?

608
00:41:36,012 --> 00:41:38,570
Great! What are we waiting for?

609
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,010
We can sign it at any time.

610
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,510
Great.

611
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,490
I feel much better now.

612
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:51,550
One, two. One, two, three. One, two. One, two, one.

613
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,690
Khun Kheetika.

614
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,850
No wonder you're Khun Sira's special assistant.

615
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,960
You know what? When Thatha rejected us the first time,

616
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,350
we were so upset.

617
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,150
When you say that we have succeeded,

618
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:14,000
our sadness has turned into happiness.

619
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,265
I don't want to take all the credit.

620
00:42:17,265 --> 00:42:18,950
Khun Sira deserves some credit.

621
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,430
If Khun Sira hadn't helped negotiate,

622
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,150
things wouldn't have gone so well.

623
00:42:26,017 --> 00:42:28,537
Really?

624
00:42:28,537 --> 00:42:35,110
I've never seen Khun Sira so eager to help his staff.

625
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,070
Yes. He treats you carefully and specially,

626
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,350
unlike other employees.

627
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,610
It's like...

628
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,310
Like what?

629
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,090
Like the boss and his employee.

630
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:56,656
Since there's good news, let's go celebrate.

631
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:02,510
Which restaurant should we go to? What should we eat?

632
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,210
What are you celebrating?

633
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:09,110
We're celebrating the fact that Khun Thatha will be our spokesperson.

634
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,030
Did she really agree?

635
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,370
I feel sorry for you.

636
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:17,450
Your plan to stop me didn't work out.

637
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:21,570
Good for you.

638
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,810
You made Thatha change her mind.

639
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,790
Even if Thatha agrees to be our spokesperson,

640
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,070
it doesn't mean that everything will work out.

641
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:35,970
What? What are you up to?

642
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,230
It's not fun to say it now.

643
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,050
Excuse me, Khun Sira.

644
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,050
Khun Sira?

645
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:05,630
Khun Sira, are you still having diarrhea?

646
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,370
I told you not to come.

647
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,470
Look at you. Let's go to the hospital.

648
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,830
It's all right.

649
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,910
I'll ask Maha to do it.

650
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,410
Maha.

651
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,270
Take Khun Sira to the hospital. Hurry.

652
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,250
Khun Kheetika, don't worry. I'll take care of Khun Sira.

653
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,050
Khun Sira, are you all right?

654
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,770
Come on, Khun Sira.

655
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,890
Be careful.

656
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,370
Khun Sira, I've contacted Dr. Zhao.

657
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:41,530
Dr. Zhao will go to your home to see you.

658
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:43,230
Why does he have to go home?

659
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,530
It's a waste of time. Let's go to the hospital.

660
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:49,670
Khun Sira doesn't like to go to the hospital. Because it's full of bacteria.

661
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,910
If he sees dirty things there,

662
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,870
his cleanliness issue will make his condition worse.

663
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,116
- Maha.
- Yes.

664
00:44:57,116 --> 00:44:59,081
- Hurry and take me home.
- Yes.

665
00:44:59,081 --> 00:45:02,553
Come on. Be careful, Khun Sira.

666
00:45:02,553 --> 00:45:04,390
Are you okay, Khun Sira?

667
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:27,688
Doctor, he ate normal things.

668
00:45:27,688 --> 00:45:30,633
I ate the same as him, but I'm fine.

669
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:34,398
Khun Sira is sensitive to strange things.

670
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:39,750
When he eats something that is a little strange or unclean, it can have this kind of effect on his body.

671
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,829
What can he eat?

672
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:45,437
Can he eat fish porridge or something?

673
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:49,394
Ordinary porridge is all right.

674
00:45:49,394 --> 00:45:53,739
Tonight, I'll leave it to you to take good care of Khun Sira.

675
00:45:53,739 --> 00:45:55,684
His condition is still weak.

676
00:45:55,684 --> 00:45:58,808
Don't let him move around too much.

677
00:45:58,808 --> 00:46:00,955
I'll leave. See you.

678
00:46:00,955 --> 00:46:03,290
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

679
00:46:18,685 --> 00:46:20,670
Would you like some water?

680
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,370
Why are you dressed like this?

681
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,930
- Whose bed is that?
- It's mine.

682
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,430
I'm sleeping here tonight.

683
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:35,070
No need. I can take care of myself.

684
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,470
- You can sleep in your room.
- No.

685
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:40,550
I'll sleep here. Don't try to drive me away.

686
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:43,170
If you understand, go to sleep.

687
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,150
Hey.

688
00:47:09,263 --> 00:47:11,017
Can you move over? I want to go to the bathroom.

689
00:47:11,017 --> 00:47:13,050
Wait.

690
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,750
It's all right. I can walk there by myself.

691
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,830
If you don't let me help you, I'll carry you there.

692
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,550
Can you carry me?

693
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,390
I mean it.

694
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,230
Be careful.

695
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,190
Slowly.

696
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,670
Okay.

697
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,070
Go in there.

698
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,630
Wait.

699
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:41,330
Do you want to go into the bathroom with me?

700
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,870
- Yes.
- You don't have to.

701
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,030
Don't worry.

702
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,750
I'll close my eyes. I won't peek.

703
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:50,150
Go out. No. Are you crazy?

704
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,290
What?

705
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:52,790
No. Go out.

706
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,510
Why?

707
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:58,710
Wait outside.

708
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,710
Don't lock the door.

709
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,350
- Don't lock the door.
- Okay.

710
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,916
Okay.

711
00:48:58,137 --> 00:48:59,609
We can start the meeting.

712
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:02,970
Khun Thatha asked for an assistant.

713
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:05,010
Did you discuss it with your team?

714
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,970
Who will be Thatha's design assistant?

715
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,890
I've talked to the Design Department about Khun Thatha's assistant.

716
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,710
When? Why don't I know?

717
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:19,465
Do I need your permission to have a meeting with my employees, Khun Kheetika?

718
00:49:19,465 --> 00:49:22,370
You don't need my permission. But you should let me know,

719
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:24,490
because I'm also in charge of the Design Department.

720
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:28,990
I'll remember it. But whether I do it or not is another matter.

721
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:34,250
The person who will be Khun Thatha's assistant is Khun Kansinee.

722
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:38,645
Khun Sasa, thank you for giving me the chance.

723
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:41,550
You're a good designer with no bad history.

724
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,430
You deserve a good chance.

725
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:46,010
I will do my best

726
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:49,830
to make up for last time.

727
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:54,070
If there's nothing else, I'll go first.

728
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:56,270
I have an appointment with Thatha.

729
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:12,530
Women in the 5G Era must be beautiful inside and outside.

730
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:16,890
Visit our website, New Look, to change your life.

731
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,810
Cut!

732
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:25,770
We'll do it again later.

733
00:50:27,283 --> 00:50:29,415
What's wrong, Thatha?

734
00:50:29,415 --> 00:50:31,260
I'm sorry.

735
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,070
It's dusty here.

736
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,550
The fan blew dust into my nose.

737
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,791
Can I take a break?

738
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:43,690
Okay. You can take a break.

739
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,030
Let's take a 10-minute break.

740
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:46,590
Excuse us.

741
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:50,070
Khun Thatha, is everything okay?

742
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:58,270
Everything is okay, Khun Kheetika.

743
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:01,670
If you need anything, just tell me.

744
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:06,770
Could you please get me a cup of coffee?

745
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,979
Babe, don't bother Khun Kheetika.

746
00:51:10,979 --> 00:51:13,550
I'll get it for you later.

747
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,830
P'Hoymen, aren't you going to deal with my schedule?

748
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:22,490
It's a waste of time for you to get me coffee.

749
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,025
It's all right.

750
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:26,130
I'll get it for you.

751
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,390
Okay.

752
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:29,830
- Thank you.
- No problem.

753
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:37,343
Thatha, it's not good for you to order her around.

754
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:44,110
- It's dusty.
- Just put up with it.

755
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:46,730
Khun Thatha, here's your hot coffee.

756
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:51,116
I forgot to tell you I wanted iced coffee.

757
00:51:51,116 --> 00:51:53,512
- Okay.
- Thank you.

758
00:51:53,512 --> 00:51:55,290
Here's your iced coffee.

Thank you.

00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,802
Could you please get me some water?

761
00:51:58,802 --> 00:52:02,033
I want mineral water. Ordinary water makes me dizzy.

762
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:03,638
Which brand of water do you want?

763
00:52:03,638 --> 00:52:06,371
I can't think of its name now.

764
00:52:06,371 --> 00:52:10,290
Could you buy a bottle of each brand?

765
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,450
All brands?

766
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,830
What?

767
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,730
Your duty is to supervise the shooting, isn't it?

768
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,510
Why did you buy water?

769
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,110
Is this your duty?

770
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:46,830
Khun Thatha is thirsty. So I went to buy it.

771
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,062
- I'll carry it myself.
- No need.

772
00:52:49,062 --> 00:52:52,410
Thatha is my girlfriend. I'll take care of her myself.

773
00:52:53,165 --> 00:52:56,503
You say she's your girlfriend all the time.

774
00:52:56,503 --> 00:52:58,336
Because it's a fact.

775
00:52:58,336 --> 00:53:01,546
Whatever I think and like, I will say it directly.

776
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:03,129
I don't like to keep it to myself.

777
00:53:03,129 --> 00:53:05,186
And I don't like to do things that make people misunderstand.

778
00:53:05,186 --> 00:53:06,630
Good.

779

If you are going to put it on, make sure to cover the back.

Thank you so much for today.

782
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,080
You did a good job.

783
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,502
This is my job.

Don't move. Stand still.

803
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,710
You don't have proof yet.

804
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:51,690
Don't frame Kheetika for plagiarism.

805
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,910
You can't ditch me.

806
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:57,030
Why not?

807
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,830
You ditched KKPP and went to GU.

808

[Behind the scenes]
Khun Sira.

809
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,730
This job is essential to me.

810
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,950
- What's my next line?
- My legs are blocked, how can I move?

811
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,890
Wait, wait, wait, wait, Khun.

812
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:17,950
Cut!

813
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,950
Start over.

OST: Jackie Jackrin - "Let's End This"

815
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:51,250
♫ I never loved anyone before ♫

816
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:59,170
♫ Until I met you, the one my heart was looking for ♫

817
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:05,810
♫ But Heaven must have made us meet, even though it was just a dream ♫

818
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:12,990
♫ After waking up, it all disappeared ♫

819
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:16,270
♫ If this love has to hurt ♫

820
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:20,830
♫ I will keep it all to myself ♫

821
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:27,230
♫ Since you deserve to be with that someone who is perfect for you ♫

822
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:30,870
♫ Let it be me who suffers ♫

823
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:35,330
♫ And be the one who ends this love ♫

824
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:39,410
♫ But it's all worth it

825
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:46,670
♫ The love I want is blurred ♫
