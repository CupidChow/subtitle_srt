1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's raining heavily.

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There are storms and thunder.

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I remind you to be careful.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Welcome back to our Happy Car.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's hear from a high school student.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
According to the assessment of the new round of science and technology,

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
the tunnel to the Jiletasqa,

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
which is six kilometers from the University of Science and Technology,

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
is about 50 meters from the exit.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There is a traffic accident.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hello, Chen.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Where are you?

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Stop rushing.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You'll know when you get in the car.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You were so mean to me last time.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You can't just let me go.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No, I'm not.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm rich now.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I know you're in a hurry.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll miss you first.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Isn't it your best emergency?

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Where are you going?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The school is about to open.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's so far away.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Are you afraid that others won't pick you up?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
How much do you want?

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Are you going to pick me up?

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, okay. I'm almost there.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll be there.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Xing.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What's wrong?

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Did you let me take all these things?

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
My car may not fit.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You can put whatever you want.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The dog house is closed.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You don't have to take all these things.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Are you really going to take all the garbage in my car?

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Stop it.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Get back to work.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The landlord is in a hurry to clean up the house.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Come here.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't come over.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't disturb her.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The worker who moved in yesterday was almost dead.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm going to take care of her.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll be back in a minute.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll be back in a minute.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll be back in a minute.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The worker who moved in yesterday was almost bitten by her.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No one is going to take care of her.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
She has been with her mother.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Later, her mother died in that box.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
She has been guarding that box all day.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No one is allowed to touch it.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Be careful.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What's wrong with this car?

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Uncle Zhao, this is my house.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hai Chuan Zoo.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This is the Black-clad Woodpecker.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't scare my cats and dogs.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What are you doing?

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Do you only have cats and dogs in your eyes?

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What are you doing?

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You don't know?

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't be afraid.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I didn't put you in the house.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What dog?

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We're going to take care of the child.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We're going to take care of the child.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What are you doing?

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What are you doing?

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Uncle Zhao, stop it.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Boss.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Go home and sleep if you drink too much.

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll go to you to drink.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can't find you.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You drink too much.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't understand.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're not good at drinking.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're too sad.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He drinks too little.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He's a good guy.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He's a good guy.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't know what to eat when you're drunk.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're here.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Help me with the food.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let me see.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
One, two, three.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
One, two, three.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How much?

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
450.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
360.

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I only have this much.

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Where's the wood?

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Wait for you.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Leave.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Leave.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What's so good about drinking here?

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Leave.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Dad.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Dad.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,260
You broke the dog's

112
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,000
box at the door.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You pay for it.

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I have no money.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He put a dog at the door.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He should have known that it was a dog.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll get him a piece of wood.

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm looking for wood.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Take it away.

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Do you know how long I've been looking for a big piece of wood?

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I've been looking for it for more than half a month.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You can take it away.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Who are you calling a dog?

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If it wasn't for the good material I found last time,

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
would our family have a home?

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We wouldn't have that shop.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It would sell the good places to the benefit.

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It would become a dog house.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're perfect.

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Shouldn't you sell a shop to my mom?

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You only have money, right?

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I just want money.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You don't pay back the money your mom owes you?

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So you'd rather give up treatment than spend money on my mom.

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Bullshit!

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Where are you going?

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm going to the police station.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:43,740
to

141
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,860
Two, three...

142
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,500
Three, four...

143
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,700
Four...

144
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,180
Excuse me.

145
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,700
Watch what you do!

146
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,700
I'll work hard to save money and let you go to a good university.

147
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,700
This is called changing your fate, right?

148
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,700
Yes.

149
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Okay.

150
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
Don't waste my time.

151
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,700
Go back and write your resume.

152
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
I'll be with you.

153
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,700
If you don't go back, I'll hit you.

154
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
I can't.

155
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Go back and listen to me.

156
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,700
You're with his mother.

157
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
His mother died in that box.

158
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,700
He was watching the box all day.

159
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,700
No one is allowed to touch it.

160
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,700
Brother!

162
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Brother!

163
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Brother!

164
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
Brother!

165
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,700
Brother!

166
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
Brother!

167
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,700
Brother!

168
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,700
Brother!

169
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
Brother!

170
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,700
Brother Cheng, I'm here to save you.

171
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
Brother! Brother!

172
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
Come here.

173
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
Come here.

174
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Come here.

175
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
Come here.

176
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,700
This is your mother's house, right?

177
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
Come here.

178
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,700
Come here.

179
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,700
Come here.

180
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Calm down.

181
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Take her with you.

182
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,700
She's good to you.

183
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,700
She's good to me, too.

184
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Brother Cheng!

185
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,700
I want this.

186
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,700
It's not a big problem.

187
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
It's just a little bleeding.

188
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
I'll just keep it for a while.

189
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Who will keep it?

190
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
You.

191
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Me?

192
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Then why did you bring it here?

193
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,700
No, I didn't say I wanted to keep it.

194
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Look.

195
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,700
She likes you.

196
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Well...

197
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
What if no one keeps her?

198
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Then...

199
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,700
I'll make a decision.

200
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
And then I'll let her go.

201
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
And continue to wander.

202
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Here you go.

203
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Wine, gauze, cotton swab.

204
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
I'll just treat my wound.

205
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,700
Or maybe after the dog is cold,

206
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
I'll decide

207
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
whether to keep it or not.

208
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,700
Okay.

209
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
Who's there?

210
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
I'll get it for you.

211
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Don't move.

212
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Come on.

213
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Did you buy it?

214
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,700
I picked it up.

215
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Don't bite it.

216
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,700
I know.

217
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Don't be so loud.

218
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
Don't move.

219
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Come here.

220
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
It's coming out.

221
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,700
Don't move.

222
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,700
You're so loud.

223
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
It's a dog.

224
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
It's not a dog.

225
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,700
It's a dog.

226
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
Don't move.

227
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Close the door.

228
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Close the door and catch the dog.

229
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Hurry up.

230
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
Open the door.

231
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,700
Open.

232
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,700
Open the door.

233
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
Open.

234
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,700
Don't worry.

235
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
You can go out and wander.

236
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
I'll pick it up in an hour.

237
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Don't move.

238
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Good boy.

239
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,700
Pipi did a good job today.

240
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
Brother Shang.

241
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,700
Who is this?

242
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
He's pretty handsome.

243
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
You're right.

244
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
You're right.

245
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
I bought you some milk tea.

246
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,700
Thank you.

247
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Thank me?

248
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,700
He's so handsome.

249
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
I can't bear to send him away.

250
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
I have to clean it up.

251
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Okay.

252
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Hello.

253
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Dr. Chuan.

254
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
How's your contact?

255
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
When did you come to pick up Lele?

256
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
I was busy.

257
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
But during this time,

258
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
I saw another golden-haired dog.

259
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
It looked like Lele.

260
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,700
So I bought it back.

261
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
He's in a good mood.

262
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
He won't see Lele again.

263
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm afraid he'll be sad.

264
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,700
Can you help us to deal with Lele?

265
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
We won't pick him up.

266
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
Okay.

267
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Thank you.

268
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
What?

269
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
Is this a human?

270
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,700
Lele is dead.

271
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
This is a life.

272
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,700
You don't care?

273
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,700
You don't want to?

274
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
I...

275
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
We've seen a lot of Lele.

276
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,700
What do you mean?

277
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
At least we have to clean it up.

278
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
Yes.

279
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,700
What about Lele?

280
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
They don't care.

281
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,700
I don't care.

282
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
You can say goodbye to the dog.

286
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
As long as you want.

287
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Miss Qiao.

288
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
Don't be sad.

289
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
She went to Wangxing.

290
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
There are many dogs there.

291
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
I cook for them.

292
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
I'll go inside.

293
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Call me when you're done.

294
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,700
Thank you.

295
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,700
I'll go inside.

296
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,700
Do you want to say goodbye to Lele?

297
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
I helped you to bring Lele here.

298
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,700
It's a waste of time.

299
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,700
I have to go back.

300
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
You can't see this.

301
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Luckily it's not my dog.

302
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
I'll go.

303
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
I have a surgery later.

304
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,700
I'll go to the old house.

305
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Brother Cheng.

306
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,700
Do you have a pet?

307
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
Yes.

308
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
It's called Tang Bao.

309
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
It's a dog.

310
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
It's much better than me.

311
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
China's national treasure.

312
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
Look.

313
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,700
Look.

314
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,700
It's a dog.

315
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
Look at this.

316
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
It's a dog.

317
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
It's a dog.

318
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
Can you drive?

319
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
Yes.

320
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
You scared me.

321
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
It's a good dog.

322
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
It's a good dog.

323
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
It's a good dog.

324
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
Look.

325
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
It's a good dog.

326
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
It's not as good as your mom's.

327
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
It's not as good as your mom's.

328
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
You're talking too far.

329
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,700
You're good at talking.

330
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
I don't know what to eat.

331
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Boss.

332
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,700
How much is this?

333
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,700
50.

334
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,700
How about it?

335
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,700
30.

336
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,700
Come on.

337
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,700
Come on.

338
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
I was packing up at home a few days ago.

339
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
I saw your notice again.

340
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
I lost.

341
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
I checked it.

342
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
It said that

343
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
if you don't report it, you'll automatically give up.

344
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
It will affect your next year's exam.

345
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
Who said I'm going to take the exam next year?

346
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,700
You don't take the exam.

347
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,700
You said a girl like you

348
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,700
is not good enough for society.

349
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
I can earn your mother's dream.

350
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,700
Look.

351
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
You've been painting my mom's face

352
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
for the rest of her life.

353
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
You're going to continue painting her face

354
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
after she dies, right?

355
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
Before you die,

356
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
that piece of wood has been bought by someone.

357
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
I want to buy that piece of wood.

358
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,700
My mom likes the sea.

359
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
When she was alive, I didn't let her give up.

360
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
After she died,

361
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,700
I let her live in the sea every day.

362
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,700
You don't have to buy a sea tank for a family like ours.

363
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Let's go.

364
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,700
Eat well.

365
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
Let's go.

366
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,700
You're wrong.

367
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,700
I'm not wrong.

368
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,700
Mom, you're a bad person.

369
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,700
Okay, okay. I'll do it again.

370
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,700
I'm sorry.

371
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,700
I'm sorry.

372
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,700
I'll send it back at noon.

373
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,700
I have work to do in the morning.

374
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,700
Are you sure you're a good person, Brother Fang?

375
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
Of course I believe you.

376
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,700
Okay, you'll send me the phone number later.

377
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,700
Okay, thank you, Brother Shuang.

378
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Okay.

379
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,700
Let's go.

380
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Be careful. Don't break the furniture.

381
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,700
Okay.

382
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,700
That... that is...

383
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,700
That is...

384
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Sister-in-law, Dad is gone.

385
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
What about Xiaosi?

386
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Your brother and I are working all day.

387
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
We don't have time to keep him.

388
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,700
My sister-in-law is allergic to dog hair.

389
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
I can't keep him.

390
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
Is there more?

391
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
No.

392
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,700
Xiaosi.

393
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,700
Brother.

394
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,700
Brother.

395
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
I'll keep one.

396
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Give it to him, Xiao.

397
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Do you want the tea?

398
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,700
No.

399
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Follow me.

400
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,700
Help me.

401
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,700
Let's go, Xiaosi.

402
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,700
Let's go.

403
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,700
Xiaosi.

404
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Xiaosi, come.

405
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
Xiaosi.

406
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,700
He is fine on the road.

407
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,700
Why do you have to touch him?

408
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,700
What should we do now?

409
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,700
What should we do now?

410
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,700
Mr. Xiao.

411
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,700
You don't give me your address.

412
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,700
I'll drive you home.

413
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,700
Yours?

414
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,700
No.

415
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,700
We saw him on the road.

416
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,700
He wanted to catch us.

417
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,700
He was scared and ran on the road.

418
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,700
He was hit to death.

419
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
He blamed you.

420
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,700
If you didn't chase him, he wouldn't die.

421
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,700
I'm sorry.

422
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
What's going on?

423
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,700
Zhao.

424
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
Hello? Zhao.

425
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Can you hear me?

426
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
Hello?

427
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,700
Mr. Xiao.

428
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,700
Can you do this?

429
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,700
I'll change lanes later.

430
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
I've registered my car in the company.

431
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,700
I won't run away.

432
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,700
What are you doing?

433
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,700
I'm scared to death.

434
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
I want to

435
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,700
be a funeral.

436
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,700
A funeral for a cat?

437
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
Mr. Xiao.

438
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,700
Hurry up.

439
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,700
Zhao.

440
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,700
Okay.

441
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,700
I'll be there as soon as possible.

442
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,700
Where are you?

443
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,700
I saw you.

444
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,700
I saw you.

445
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,700
The dog is here.

446
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,700
The dog is here.

447
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Xiao Man?

448
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,700
Give me the rope.

449
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,700
So cute.

450
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,700
Come here.

451
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,700
He bit me.

452
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,700
He's a good boy.

453
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,700
He's going to a new house.

454
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,700
He's not like this.

455
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:58,660
He's a little bit

456
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,660
Okay.

457
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Hua Hua.

458
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,660
Don't worry.

459
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,660
Look at us.

460
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,660
We're not hungry.

461
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,660
Come on.

462
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,660
Xiao Zhong.

463
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,660
Don't embarrass me.

464
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,660
I'm leaving.

465
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,660
I'll call you if I have time.

466
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Bye.

467
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,620
Why did you fall?

468
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,620
Get up.

469
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,620
Come on.

470
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,620
Go home.

471
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,620
Go home.

472
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,620
They ran away.

473
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,620
The dog is gone.

474
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,620
The dog looks okay.

475
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,620
You took so much.

476
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,620
Can you see it?

477
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,580
What did you do?

478
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,580
Design.

479
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,580
It's a pity that you don't go.

480
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,580
What do you think?

481
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,580
I'll talk to you later.

482
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,580
I made a funeral for a kitten.

483
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,580
I took Le Le back when I took her back.

484
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,580
What are you going to do?

485
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,580
You're going to a funeral.

486
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,580
I've seen it all.

487
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,540
I sent it to Lao Feng.

488
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,540
He made a wakawa.

489
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,540
So you paid for it.

490
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,540
What should I do?

491
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,540
Get up.

492
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
I'll go.

493
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
My dad used this to put his grave.

494
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
You still keep it.

495
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
I think it's appropriate to put it like this.

496
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
What's your name?

497
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Wakaawa.

498
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Xiao Bai.

499
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,460
They didn't ask for it?

500
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,460
Yeah.

501
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:29,460
I think you should find a suitable chance to put them in the soil.

502
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,460
My mom is like that.

503
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,460
I have to put her in the soil.

504
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,460
But I don't think it's appropriate.

505
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,460
So, if I don't go to college,

506
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,460
I won't be afraid.

507
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,460
Mom,

508
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,460
don't worry.

509
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,460
I'm fine now.

510
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,460
I borrow a lot of money every day.

511
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,460
You didn't deduct too much?

512
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,460
Anyway, I take good care of myself.

513
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,460
Mom,

514
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,460
wait for me at home.

515
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
I will let you live in a big house.

516
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,460
I will be your wife.

517
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,460
I will be your wife.

518
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,460
I'm leaving.

519
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,460
Take care.

520
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,460
Zhao.

521
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,460
Zhao.

522
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,460
Zhao.

523
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Zhao.

524
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,460
Little monkey.

525
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,460
I'm really not able to take it.

526
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,460
It's almost 1 o'clock.

527
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,460
It's really fat.

528
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,460
It's really dangerous.

529
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,460
Zhao.

530
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,460
I see it. I see it.

531
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,460
Hua Hua. Hua Hua.

532
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,460
You are really lucky.

533
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,460
You can send it back in one night.

534
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,460
If you behave well,

535
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,460
you are Miss Zhao.

536
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,460
Zhao.

537
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,460
Come.

538
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,460
You'd better not be angry with it.

539
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,460
Let's look for it again.

540
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,460
So cute.

541
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,460
My girlfriend said that if I don't send it back today,

542
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,460
I have to send it back.

543
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,460
The property certificate was cut like this.

544
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,460
There is still half in the paper.

545
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,460
So cute.

546
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,460
Don't.

547
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,460
I just sent it back for a while.

548
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,460
What are you going to do?

549
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,460
Are you going to eat paper?

550
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,460
What are you doing?

551
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,460
Don't scare me.

552
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,460
I said no.

553
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,460
No.

554
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,460
No.

555
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,460
Here.

556
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,460
Where are you?

557
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,460
Where are you?

558
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,460
Where are you?

559
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,460
Half an hour more?

560
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,460
Please pay my waiting fee.

561
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,460
Okay.

562
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,460
Please hurry up.

563
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,460
The supermarket is too long.

564
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,460
Hello.

565
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,460
Who is it?

566
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,460
Mr. Xiao.

567
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,460
Which Mr. Xiao?

568
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,460
The one who pulls furniture.

569
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,460
How much?

570
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,460
Okay.

571
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,460
I am very professional.

572
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,460
Okay, see you later.

573
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,460
Doggie.

574
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,460
Let's go.

575
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,460
I am sorry.

576
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,460
I am sorry.

577
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,460
You know it.

578
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,460
Let's go.

579
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,460
Let's go.

580
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,460
Let's go.

581
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,460
Let's go.

582
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,460
I can't find the price.

583
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,460
I can adjust it.

584
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,460
How about this?

585
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,460
I will give you the key later.

586
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,460
I will give you the key.

587
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,460
I won't come over.

588
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,460
Okay.

589
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,460
Xiao Si.

590
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,460
He was quite healthy last time.

591
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,460
You do it.

592
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,460
After my dad's brain hemorrhage,

593
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,460
I took Xiao Si to my place.

594
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,460
The rascal ran away on the first night.

595
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,460
I looked everywhere but couldn't find him.

596
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,460
This noon,

597
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,460
the old neighbor called me and said,

598
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,460
Xiao Si,

599
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,460
he is in the hospital.

600
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,460
I asked him to come over.

601
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,460
He said he was in the hospital.

602
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,460
I said,

603
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,460
Xiao Si is at your dad's door.

604
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,460
Come back and see him.

605
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,460
I came back and saw him.

606
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,460
It was almost the same.

607
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,460
He was in my arms.

608
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,460
Do you want music?

609
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,460
Music.

610
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,460
Play a nice song.

611
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,460
Okay.

612
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,460
My dad raised him for 13 years.

613
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,460
He has never suffered much.

614
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,460
I will start.

615
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,460
I will start.

616
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,460
I am too stubborn.

617
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,460
After my mom left,

618
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,460
I once...

619
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,460
Hi.

620
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,460
Zhong.

621
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,460
I am Zhong.

622
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,460
I am Zhong.

623
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,460
I am Zhong.

624
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,460
I am Zhong.

625
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,460
I am Zhong.

626
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,460
I am Zhong.

627
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,460
Actually, sometimes,

628
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,460
I think about the dog.

629
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,460
No problem.

630
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,460
It is indeed better than us,

631
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,460
being a daughter.

632
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,460
We can say goodbye to Xiao Si.

633
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,460
We are family forever.

634
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,460
We will always be together.

635
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,460
I will always be with you.

636
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,460
I will always be with you.

637
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,460
I will always be with you.

638
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,460
I will always be with you.

639
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,460
I will always be with you.

640
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,460
I can't say it.

641
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,460
Music.

642
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,460
What do you plan to do next?

643
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,460
After this,

644
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,460
I'll send you to do the flower processing.

645
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,460
If you need the stock,

646
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,460
I definitely need it.

647
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,460
I'll send it to you when my dad goes to work.

648
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,460
I saw you making that cat on the street that day.

649
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,460
I'll transfer the money back to you.

650
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,460
You're so young.

651
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,460
Why do you want to do this?

652
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,460
Because...

653
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,460
Because of Lin Guoyu,

654
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,460
I want to punish others.

655
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,460
What do you mean?

656
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,460
It's just...

657
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,460
No matter...

658
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,460
what life is,

659
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,460
dead,

660
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,460
I want them to know

661
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,460
that there are still people who are in love.

662
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,460
The second time.

663
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,460
Li Maoping.

664
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,460
I'm sorry.

665
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,460
I'm sorry.

666
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,460
I'm sorry.

667
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,460
I'm not going back to eat. I have a favor to ask.

668
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:58,460
Can you be more careful with Xiao Mei's school thing?

669
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,460
My sister is just like that. I'll just say that she's not.

670
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,460
It's her family's business.

671
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:27,460
I'm sorry.

672
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,460
Hello?

673
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,460
Where are you?

674
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,460
Zhangzhou.

675
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,460
Lao Liu introduced me to a fabric factory.

676
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,460
They're paying a high price to hire me.

677
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,460
You... you're not coming back recently?

678
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:10,460
I'm not coming back.

679
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,460
I have a lot of work to do in the factory.

680
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,460
You should go home.

681
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,460
It's not safe for girls to live in cars.

682
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,460
You should go home too.

683
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,460
What?

684
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,460
I said...

685
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,460
I said you should take care of your health.

686
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,460
I know. You too.

687
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,460
Hello?

688
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,460
Hello, Uncle Liu?

689
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,460
Xiao Mei, your dad is missing.

690
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:01,460
Zhang!

691
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,460
Zhang!

692
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,460
Uncle Liu, are you sure my dad is in the woods?

693
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,460
Your dad has been saying that he found a piece of wood in the woods.

694
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,460
I've been saying that for years. It's all in the key.

695
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,460
That's great.

696
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,460
I've been saying that for years. It's all in the key.

697
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,460
I'm sorry.

698
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,460
Zhang!

699
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,460
It's all a small job.

700
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,460
Lao Zhao!

701
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,460
Zhao!

702
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,460
Uncle Liu, my dad is good at this.

703
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,460
Why is he only a small job?

704
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,460
He's a master of art.

705
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,460
Lao Zhao!

706
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,460
He's got a machine. Who else has a piece of wood?

707
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,460
And your dad's hand is injured.

708
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,460
Lao Zhao!

709
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,460
He's injured?

710
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,460
I thought he was drunk.

711
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,460
Zhao Buji!

712
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,460
Dad! Zhao Buji! Dad!

713
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,460
Zhao Buji!

714
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,460
Zhao Bai!

715
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:18,460
Be careful!

716
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:21,460
Are you okay? I'm okay.

717
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:24,460
Come here!

718
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:27,460
Zhao Bai!

719
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:30,460
Zhao Buji!

720
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,460
Zhao Buji!

721
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:36,460
Zhao!

722
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,460
Zhao!

723
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:42,460
Zhao!

724
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,460
Zhao Buji!

725
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,460
Zhao!

726
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,460
Zhao Buji!

727
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,460
Zhao!

728
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:57,460
Zhao!

729
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,460
Zhao!

730
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:03,460
Zhao!

731
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,460
Zhao!

732
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,460
Zhao!

733
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,460
Zhao!

734
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,460
Zhao!

735
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:18,460
Zhao!

736
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,460
Zhao!

737
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:33,860
Noira?

738
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,720
Maintali?

739
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,280
Maintali!

740
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,280
Here you go.

741
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,280
It's done.

742
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,280
It's done.

743
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,280
Are you done?

744
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,280
Yes.

745
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,280
This is Wen Bingyang's promise.

746
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,280
Three thousand words.

747
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,280
What's your dog's name?

748
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,280
Zhao Xiaoyi.

749
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
My name is Zhao Xiaoyi.

750
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,280
Come on, fill your glass.

751
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,280
Wen, Wen, Wen.

752
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,280
This is a big leafy gourd.

753
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,280
It's a kind of gourd with garlic.

754
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,280
It's the same as this small leafy gourd.

755
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,280
Wen, Wen, this.

756
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,280
Does it taste different?

757
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,280
I have something good for you.

758
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,280
Come on, look at this.

759
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,280
At first, I just used a piece of a leafy gourd to make a...

760
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,280
Eat.

761
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,280
A dragon.

762
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,280
I made a dragon.

763
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,280
Eat slowly.

764
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,280
Good boy.

765
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,280
I want to eat it.

766
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,280
It's a good thing to see it, but it's a good thing to smell it.

767
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,280
This dog has a good nose.

768
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,280
It's not a pity to eat it.

769
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,280
That dog saved your life.

770
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,280
Besides, it's famous.

771
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,280
Xiaoyi, I'll buy beef for Xiaoyi.

772
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,280
It's delicious.

773
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,280
How much is it in your hand?

774
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,280
It's the box from when your mother was hospitalized.

775
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,280
Why don't you drink it?

776
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,280
I won't shake it if I drink some wine.

777
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,280
I'm kidding.

778
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,280
Xiaoyi.

779
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,280
That hand.

780
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,280
I have to beg.

781
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,280
Work out and recover in the morning.

782
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,280
I'm going to work out.

783
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,280
It's been a long time.

784
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,280
What's wrong with your leg?

785
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,280
I fell by accident.

786
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,280
Uncle Zhao, this dog is pretty.

787
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,280
When did you raise it?

788
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,280
Liu Langgou.

789
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,280
Xiaoman picked it up.

790
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,280
She asked me to bring it to her.

791
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,280
What's wrong with your leg?

792
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,280
I fell by accident.

793
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,280
It's not serious.

794
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,280
Take it easy.

795
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,280
Go, go, go.

796
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,280
You want to kill me?

797
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,280
What if you fall?

798
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,280
Go.

799
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,280
Go.

800
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,280
This is sick.

801
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,280
Boss.

802
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,280
How much is the beef?

803
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,280
Beef shoulder and beef tongue, 48 yuan.

804
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,280
Blood flower, 52 yuan.

805
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,280
Cheap ones eat cheap ones.

806
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,280
Then I'll take the expensive ones.

807
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,280
Okay.

808
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,280
Brother Zhao.

809
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,280
Isn't Xiaoman your favorite?

810
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,280
Give me one.

811
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,280
Okay, okay.

812
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,280
Then I'll take one.

813
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,280
How about this?

814
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,280
Okay.

815
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,280
This dog is yours.

816
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,280
No, Xiaoman picked it up.

817
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,280
Liu Langgou.

818
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,280
It's a little short.

819
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,280
Are you talking about me?

820
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,280
No, I'm talking about your dog.

821
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,280
Where is it short?

822
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,280
Let's go, Langgou.

823
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,280
Go, go.

824
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,280
Look.

825
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,280
Is it?

826
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,280
It's a little short.

827
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,280
Is it?

828
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,280
What's wrong?

829
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,280
Come on, Xiaoyi.

830
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,280
Look, it's short.

831
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,280
Let Brother Chuang see.

832
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,280
Sit.

833
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,280
This way.

834
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,280
It's not a problem to touch.

835
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,280
Is it okay?

836
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,280
Xiaolan, I'm coming.

837
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,280
Xiaoyi.

838
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,280
Good girl.

839
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,280
What's wrong with Xiaoyi's foot?

840
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,280
She was walking in the vegetable market just now.

841
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,280
I don't know what happened.

842
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,280
We ran in the woods a few days ago.

843
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,280
Did she get stung or bitten by something?

844
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,280
I checked her foot.

845
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,280
There is no wound on her foot.

846
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,280
I don't think it's a fracture when I touch it.

847
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,280
I'll shoot a film for her.

848
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,280
Come on, Brother Chuang, let's go.

849
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,280
Come on.

850
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,280
It's a big deal.

851
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,280
You want to shoot a film?

852
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,280
I'll shoot one.

853
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,280
You have a drink.

854
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,280
What time is it?

855
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,280
It's really fake.

856
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,280
Really?

857
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,280
Biya, is my family drinking water like yours?

858
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,280
We drink pure water at home.

859
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,280
What kind of water is yours?

860
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,280
Don't worry.

861
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,280
We also drink pure water.

862
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,280
And we don't stop filtering it 24 hours a day.

863
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,280
You should know that if you're a professional.

864
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,280
This kind of pure blood dog has a weak stomach.

865
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,280
Why does it keep drinking water?

866
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,280
It doesn't usually drink water that much.

867
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,280
It must have eaten too much before noon.

868
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,280
How is that possible?

869
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,280
You, go in and ask the nurse to stop it.

870
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,280
Don't worry.

871
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,280
Our nurse will take good care of it.

872
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,280
I'm done drinking.

873
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,280
I'm so scared.

874
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,280
Sister Xiaodan.

875
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,280
Isn't our aunt doing fine?

876
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,280
She's not.

877
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,280
Dad, she's not weak.

878
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,280
Really?

879
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,280
I remember now.

880
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,280
When I took her out to buy groceries today.

881
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,280
I scolded her.

882
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,280
She got weak in a second.

883
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,280
This brat was actually learning from me.

884
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,280
He's a real jerk.

885
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,280
Sister Xiaodan, look.

886
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,280
My aunt is so smart.

887
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,280
Listen to me.

888
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,280
Dogs are dogs.

889
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,280
And bats are bats.

890
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,280
Xiaoman, come here.

891
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,280
There's no problem with the corner of the leg.

892
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,280
But look at this piece.

893
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,280
Xiaoyi's kidney.

894
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,280
The shape is a bit off.

895
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,280
Look at this.

896
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,280
It's obviously enlarged.

897
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,280
This is a B-shape.

898
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,280
It shows that the kidney on both sides.

899
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,280
There's a tumor.

900
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,280
What does that mean?

901
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,280
The tumor is a common disease of the Crematian dog.

902
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,280
The edge is also a sign of the Crematian dog.

903
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,280
This is wrong.

904
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,280
Is this a tumor?

905
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,280
Maybe it's fat.

906
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,280
Yes, it's fat.

907
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,280
Dr. Wang, the test results are out.

908
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,280
This is a blood test.

909
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,280
A urine test.

910
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,280
A STMA test.

911
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,280
Look at these.

912
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,280
All the indicators are not normal.

913
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,280
How is that possible?

914
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,280
Do you think it's pretty good?

915
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,280
The early stages of kidney disease.

916
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,280
It looks normal.

917
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,280
Once symptoms appear.

918
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,280
It's a very serious stage.

919
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

920
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

921
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

922
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,280

923
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

924
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

925
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

926
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

927
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

928
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

929
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

The first stage of kidney disease.

931
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

932
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

933
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,280
The first stage.

934
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

935
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

936
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

937
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,280
The first stage of kidney disease.

938
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,280

The first stage of kidney disease.

940
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,280

The first stage of kidney disease.

943

The first stage of kidney disease.

944
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,280
Hot.

945
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,280
Low in salt, low in protein, low in protein.

946
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:38,880
Here.

947
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,280
Does he eat it?

948
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,080
He likes cans.

949
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,080
Cans.

950
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,280
Put the cans back.

951
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,080
He can't eat any of them now. It's bad for his health.

952
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,280
Here.

953
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,680
Xiao Ye, don't look at that.

954
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,480
Let's not eat cans anymore, okay?

955
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,880
Eat this.

956
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,680
Is it because you gave him medicine today and he has no appetite?

957
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,680
Oh, right. He hasn't taken his medicine yet.

958
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,080
Come.

959
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,880
Xiao Ye, take your medicine.

960
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,880
Come, get up.

961
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:12,480
Xiao Ye, be good.

962
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,080
He's a dog, not a human.

963
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,680
If you let him eat, he'll eat.

964
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,080
Come, let me help you.

965
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,480
Come here, Xiao Ye.

966
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,280
Come here.

967
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,280
Open your mouth.

968
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,080
Open your mouth.

969
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,280
Don't. It hurts.

970
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,080
It's in.

971
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:26,880
What's wrong?

972
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,080
Let go.

973
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,480
Let go.

974
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,680
You have to use some tricks.

975
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,680
How can you cure your illness if you don't take your medicine?

976
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,680
Xiao Ye.

977
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,480
Xiao... Xiao Ye.

978
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,880
Come here.

979
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,680
Come here.

980
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,080
Be good. Take your medicine.

981
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,680
Xiao Ye, be good. Come here.

982
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,280
What's wrong?

983
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,880
Are you afraid that my dad will get mad at me?

984
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,680
Everyone says that a person's life is a rich and noble life.

985
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,680
How can you be so arrogant?

986
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,480
Come out!

987
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,880
I told you not to come here.

988
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,480
Why are you following me?

989
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:28,280
Why are you following me?

990
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,880
People can live for more than ten years.

991
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,680
Why are you so angry?

992
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,680
Why don't you take your medicine or eat?

993
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,880
You want to die, right?

994
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,080
Come. You want to die?

995
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,880
Get out. Get out and die.

996
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,280
What are you doing sitting on the floor?

997
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,080
You stupid dog.

998
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,880
Stupid dog.

999
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,880
Xiao Ye.

1000
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,680
How long can she live?

1001
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,680
If she is lucky, she can live for several years.

1002
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,080
But if she turns into a dog,

1003
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:22,880
maybe seven weeks or several months.

1004
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,880
If you miss your lover,

1005
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,680
you need to be prepared.

1006
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,680
Maybe several weeks or several months.

1007
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,680
Xiao Ye.

1008
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,480
What are you doing?

1009
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,880
Leave me alone.

1010
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,280
Leave me alone.

1011
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,680
Xiao Ye.

1012
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,680
Xiao Ye.

1013
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,480
Xiao Ye.

1014
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,480
Come here.

1015
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,080
Come here.

1016
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,280
Come here.

1017
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,080
Xiao Ye.

1018
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,480
Come here.

1019
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,280
Take your medicine.

1020
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,680
I'll feed you.

1021
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,080
Jia Xiao Yi is the best.

1022
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,480
Go play.

1023
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,880
I'll go play with you.

1024
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,480
Come. Come.

1025
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,480
Look. Your sister's bed has become your car.

1026
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,280
Dad.

1027
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,080
I'm coming. I'm coming. Did you find it?

1028
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,880
Come with me.

1029
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,280
Come.

1030
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,480
It's so pretty. It's quite fashionable.

1031
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,880
Your mom made all of these.

1032
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,480
When you were little, when you went out,

1033
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,280
everyone praised you.

1034
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,080
Everyone praised your clothes.

1035
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,480
Your mom was a little proud of you.

1036
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,880
Isn't that right?

1037
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:58,280
She made all of these.

1038
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,280
Come.

1039
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,880
Did you smell it?

1040
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,280
It smells like your box.

1041
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,680
It smells like mom.

1042
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:00,880
I thought you threw away all my clothes.

1043
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,080
They're all here.

1044
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,280
I put them in the house.

1045
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,680
Xiao Ye.

1046
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,280
Xiao Ye.

1047
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,880
You like this?

1048
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,880
You like this?

1049
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:28,880
I hope Xiao Ye won't use this car.

1050
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,880
Xiao Ye's porridge is ready.

1051
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,480
I'm a little late.

1052
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,280
I'll go get some medicine for Xiao Ye.

1053
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:45,280
No. You're in the hospital. I'll go get the ingredients.

1054
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,480
Okay. I'll take Xiao Ye today.

1055
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,880
Xiao Ye, go with your sister today.

1056
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:52,280
Go with your sister, okay?

1057
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,480
Xiao Ye, don't come to bed.

1058
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,480
What's going on?

1059
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,880
Dad!

1060
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:08,480
The best way to treat him is to treat him regularly.

1061
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,480
At the same time, help him get rid of the swelling.

1062
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:16,680
The loss of his body and the loss of appetite will also lead to a blood clot.

1063
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,080
You need to treat the blood clot at the same time.

1064
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,080
This is a long-term treatment.

1065
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:24,880
So it takes a lot of money.

1066
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,080
One is Xiao Man, one is Xiao Yi.

1067
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:40,280
I'm a man and a woman now.

1068
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,880
Look at this. Is Xiao Yi handsome?

1069
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,680
Mom.

1070
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,480
I can't buy you a big house.

1071
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,280
You won't blame me, right?

1072
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,680
Your mom won't blame you.

1073
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,080
She understands your feelings.

1074
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,880
Last night, you asked me

1075
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,880
if I was worried that I wouldn't agree.

1076
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,280
There will be a purpose.

1077
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,080
This is fate.

1078
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,680
I'm sorry.

1079
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,080
Think about it.

1080
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,680
Once you sign, you need to re-arrange your purpose.

1081
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,680
I'm sorry.

1082
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,680
We're going down.

1083
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,080
Let's go.

1084
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,280
This is Xiao Yi's will.

1085
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,080
He keeps holding on until we get off the car.

1086
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,680
Be careful. Don't get your feet stuck.

1087
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,680
Stupid dog.

1088
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,280
How can he jump when he can?

1089
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,680
Xiao Yi.

1090
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,480
Xiao Yi.

1091
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,480
Xiao Yi, dad.

1092
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,880
Xiao Yi.

1093
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,680
Xiao Yi.

1094
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,480
Xiao Yi.

1095
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,280
Xiao Yi.

1096
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,080
Where are you going?

1097
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,680
Xiao Yi.

1098
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,080
Xiao Yi.

1099
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,480
Dad.

1100
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,280
Xiao Yi.

1101
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,680
Dad.

1102
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,480
Go after him.

1103
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,080
Xiao Yi.

1104
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,480
Xiao Yi.

1105
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,480
What are you doing?

1106
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,480
Xiao Yi.

1107
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,880
Xiao Yi.

1108
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,280
Xiao Yi, you scared me.

1109
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,680
Xiao Man.

1110
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,680
Dad, here.

1111
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,880
Found him.

1112
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,480
How are you?

1113
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,680
How did he get hurt?

1114
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,280
Xiao Yi.

1115
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,280
What's wrong?

1116
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,480
What's wrong, Xiao Yi?

1117
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,480
Xiao Yi.

1118
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,480
Xiao Yi.

1119
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,480
Dad, what's wrong?

1120
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:39,480
Look at that tree.

1121
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,880
Yes.

1122
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,080
Look.

1123
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,680
To the right.

1124
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,480
Look.

1125
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,280
Yes.

1126
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,480
It's here.

1127
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,880
When I was...

1128
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,480
here,

1129
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:08,280
I found that piece of wood.

1130
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,480
When I went back, I saw you.

1131
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,680
Your mom kept saying you were Fu Xin.

1132
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,680
You really are Fu Xin.

1133
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,720
Yes.

1134
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,080
This...

1135
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,180
is my man in plain clothes.

1136
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,280
All right.

1137
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,280
Where is he?

1138
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,680
Yes.

1139
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,680
Where is he?

1140
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,080
Here.

1141
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,320
We should go to the hospital.

1142
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,480
You don't want to go?

1143
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:03,760
I know you're upset, but you're sick.

1144
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,720
We should go to the hospital, right?

1145
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,160
I have a little thing for you.

1146
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,320
I'll be right back.

1147
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,680
Xiao Man, you don't have to go.

1148
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,680
You said you'd give me both.

1149
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,680
You can't just hang up on me.

1150
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,680
I've already sealed the train.

1151
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:48,680
When you're better, I'll take you to the hospital every day.

1152
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,680
I'll be there.

1153
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,680
Okay?

1154
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,680
Come on, Xinyi.

1155
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:07,680
Hug me, hug me, hug me.

1156
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,680
Xiao Yan.

1157
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,680
Are you listening?

1158
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,680
How is he?

1159
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,680
Are you feeling better?

1160
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,680
I'm okay.

1161
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,680
What did Brother Chuan say?

1162
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,680
He...

1163
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,680
Ask him.

1164
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,680
Brother Chuan.

1165
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,680
How is my little sister?

1166
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,680
Is she feeling better?

1167
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,680
It's a common disease.

1168
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,680
It's all about money.

1169
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,680
Don't tell me about money.

1170
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,680
Money is not a problem.

1171
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,680
Brother Chuan.

1172
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:20,680
Do you have any other best treatments?

1173
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:23,680
I'm sure I have.

1174
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,680
Xiao Man.

1175
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:35,680
There's no other way to cure him.

1176
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,680
I'm sorry.

1177
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:05,680
It's okay.

1178
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,680
Listen to me.

1179
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,680
Take your medicine, okay?

1180
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,680
You can only go there after you've been treated.

1181
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,680
Right?

1182
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,680
Be good.

1183
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,680
Okay.

1184
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,680
Cover him.

1185
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,680
Are you hungry?

1186
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,680
I'm not hungry.

1187
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:34,680
Xiao Yi, are you hungry?

1188
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,680
I've prepared blueberries and honey.

1189
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,680
Brother Chuan.

1190
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,680
Xiao Nan is waiting for you.

1191
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,680
Xiao Nan.

1192
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,680
Xiao Nan.

1193
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,680
What's going on with you?

1194
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,680
You're all so idle.

1195
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,680
Don't you know how to do the surgery?

1196
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,680
The surgery is very risky.

1197
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,680
99% of the patients can't get off the operating table.

1198
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,680
We can't let him suffer like this.

1199
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,680
We've thought of all the ways.

1200
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,680
I brought Tang Bao here today to say goodbye to you.

1201
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,680
Alice? No way.

1202
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,680
I can't do this.

1203
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,680
This is my dog. I won't let him go.

1204
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,680
He's been with you for a year. He's been with me for eight years.

1205
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,680
Xiao Nan.

1206
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,680
Inform the anesthesiologist.

1207
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,680
Prepare for the surgery.

1208
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,680
No reaction from the patient.

1209
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,680
The anesthesia is deep.

1210
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,680
The heart rate is normal.

1211
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,680
The blood pressure is normal.

1212
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,680
You can start the surgery.

1213
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,680
I'm sorry.

1214
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,680
Brother Chun.

1215
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:01,680
Our family

1216
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,680
is in the military base.

1217
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,680
Tang Bao

1218
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,680
is the smartest of us all.

1219
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,680
He followed me everywhere I went.

1220
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,680
No matter what I said,

1221
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:19,680
he would do it all at once.

1222
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:26,680
So I was very worried at that time.

1223
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:29,260
I was knocked out by the

1224
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:31,680
chicken pox in the chicken coop.

1225
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:34,680
I was knocked out myself.

1226
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,680
Tang Bao.

1227
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,680
I was thinking

1228
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,680
if it was possible for him to

1229
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,680
be in pain during training,

1230
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,680
I was scratched.

1231
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,680
He was the first patient every time.

1232
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,680
But he was fine.

1233
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,680
After he retired,

1234
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:05,680
he was mine.

1235
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:12,680
How can I be?

1236
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:15,680
I was so hurt that I was blinded by it.

1237
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,680
I could see it.

1238
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,680
But I still had to do it.

1239
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:30,680
I didn't even get a chance to see him.

1240
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,680
What's wrong, Tang Bao?

1241
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,680
Tang Bao is tired.

1242
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,680
Brother Chun.

1243
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,680
This...

1244
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:02,680
Do you still have a chance to say goodbye to Tang Bao?

1245
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,680
I love you.

1246
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,680
I love you.

1247
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:02,680
Would you like to comb my hair?

1248
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,680
I'm sorry.

1249
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,680
My name is Tang Bao.

1250
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:44,680
The first person I saw was not my mother.

1251
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,680
It was Brother Wang Haichuan.

1252
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:49,680
I was inseparable from Brother Haichuan when I was a kid.

1253
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:52,680
He said I was his shadow.

1254
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,680
When I was one year old,

1255
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:57,680
Brother Haichuan told me that I was going to school.

1256
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,680
I was selected to go to the training base in Kendo.

1257
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:03,680
I promised him that I would be the best Tang Bao.

1258
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,680
After more than a year of training,

1259
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,680
I graduated.

1260
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,680
Sister Xinxin became my new partner.

1261
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:14,680
We are the left-handers and the famous.

1262
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:17,680
We have the power of superman together.

1263
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,680
We went to many places.

1264
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,680
We have this great mission.

1265
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:26,680
We have to protect mankind and save the earth.

1266
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:30,680
Then I got hurt.

1267
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:34,680
Sister Xinxin cried so much that her eyes were swollen.

1268
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:37,680
We couldn't go to the big party together.

1269
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:43,680
I know you can't bear to leave me.

1270
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,680
But I'm going to another planet to do my mission.

1271
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:50,680
I'm going to take my skills

1272
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:53,680
to another place to be a super hero.

1273
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:58,680
Goodbye, Brother Haichuan.

1274
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:03,680
I know you are the best doctor.

1275
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:08,680
Goodbye, Sister Xinxin.

1276
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:12,680
I know you are the best chicken and pork police.

1277
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:16,680
Goodbye, everyone.

1278
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,680
Remember me.

1279
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:21,680
The best.

1280
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:25,680
The best Tang Bao.

1281
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:35,680
The best.

1282
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:49,680
Jinglei.

1283
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,680
Jinglei.

1284
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:23,680
It's okay.

1285
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:24,680
Dad.

1286
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,680
It's okay.

1287
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:28,680
Can you help me?

1288
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:30,680
Here.

1289
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:38,680
We are not going to the hospital today.

1290
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:44,680
We are not going to the hospital in the future.

1291
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:46,680
We are not going.

1292
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:49,680
If it's because of money...

1293
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,680
It's not because of money.

1294
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:57,680
If you continue to treat it, it will only make you feel better.

1295
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,680
But it's no use for Xiao Yi.

1296
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:02,680
Even if it makes him more painful,

1297
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:06,680
the best thing is to

1298
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,680
fight with him.

1299
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:14,680
Say goodbye.

1300
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,680
Thank you, Brother Haichuan.

1301
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,680
You made me understand.

1302
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,680
Help me prepare some medicine.

1303
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:27,680
Let Xiao Yi not feel so painful.

1304
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:36,680
Xiao Yi.

1305
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:04,680
Hello.

1306
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:22,680
Xiao Yi.

1307
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:25,680
Hurry.

1308
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,120
Yiyi you...

1309
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:34,120
Miam look

1310
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,360
Were you tired walking?

1311
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:57,160
It's okay. Take a break.

1312
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:59,160
Take your medicine first, okay?

1313
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:10,760
You are my good brother.

1314
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,760
Why is Xiao Yi so good?

1315
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:14,640
My good baby.

1316
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,840
My good baby.

1317
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:26,680
Come on.

1318
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:39,040
Xiao Yi.

1319
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:41,200
I'm done. Let's eat.

1320
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,200
I'll feed you.

1321
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,440
Here.

1322
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:45,440
Have a bite.

1323
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,080
Xiao Yi, be good.

1324
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,080
Have a bite.

1325
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:50,560
You don't want to eat?

1326
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,320
No.

1327
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,320
Come on, Xiao Yi.

1328
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:54,320
Have a bite.

1329
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,320
I'm fine.

1330
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,320
It's New Year.

1331
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:58,320
Let's have a party.

1332
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:00,320
It tastes good, right?

1333
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,320
Look.

1334
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:05,320
This kid knows what's good.

1335
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,320
It's good?

1336
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:09,320
Okay.

1337
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,320
Eat.

1338
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,320
I'll eat whatever you want.

1339
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,320
This meat and skin

1340
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:18,320
are made by your mother

1341
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,320
when she was alive.

1342
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,320
When did my mother make it?

1343
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,320
Wasn't she always in the hospital?

1344
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:27,320
You were so fierce when you argued with me

1345
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:30,320
that I shouldn't have brought her out.

1346
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,320
She went home?

1347
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:51,320
It's good to be home.

1348
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,320
When you're done,

1349
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,320
stay at home every day.

1350
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:06,320
Our Xiao Man

1351
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:08,320
is going to college soon.

1352
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:12,320
I'm going to go to school.

1353
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:14,320
I'll see you later.

1354
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:16,320
I'll see you later.

1355
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,320
We have to save up for tuition.

1356
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,320
Don't worry about the money.

1357
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:28,320
I can earn it.

1358
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:32,320
You can't throw the money

1359
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:34,320
into my grave.

1360
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:39,320
I've been in the hospital for so long.

1361
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,320
I know my illness.

1362
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,320
If you're really angry,

1363
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,320
don't save me.

1364
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:52,320
I'm sorry.

1365
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:55,320
You don't know.

1366
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:02,320
It hurts.

1367
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:05,320
It really hurts.

1368
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:10,320
Don't make me suffer again.

1369
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:14,320
The patient's blood pressure has dropped.

1370
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:15,320
What's the blood pressure?

1371
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:16,320
Blood pressure is 84.

1372
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:18,320
What's the blood pressure?

1373
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:19,320
Blood pressure is 100.

1374
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,320
What's the blood pressure?

1375
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:22,320
100.

1376
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:24,320
What's the blood pressure?

1377
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:25,320
100.

1378
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:27,320
What's the blood pressure?

1379
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:28,320
100.

1380
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:30,320
What's the blood pressure?

1381
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,320
100.

1382
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,320
What's the blood pressure?

1383
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,320
100.

1384
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:36,320
What's the blood pressure?

1385
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:38,320
100.

1386
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:40,320
What's the blood pressure?

1387
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:42,320
100.

1388
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:44,320
What's the blood pressure?

1389
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:46,320
100.

1390
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:48,320
What's the blood pressure?

1391
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,320
100.

1392
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,320
Why didn't you tell me?

1393
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:27,320
I just want you to take me as a scapegoat

1394
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,320
and get angry.

1395
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:31,320
You can feel better.

1396
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,320
I'm sorry.

1397
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,320
I'm sorry.

1398
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:20,320
I'm sorry.

1399
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,320
Mu Nian,

1400
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,320
eat well.

1401
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:50,320
Eat well.

1402
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:12,320
Old man,

1403
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:15,320
I'm going to lose weight.

1404
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:18,320
What about you?

1405
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:20,320
What about you?

1406
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,320
I'm going to lose weight.

1407
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:52,320
Ten, ten, nine, eight,

1408
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:59,320
one, six, five, four, three, two, one.

1409
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:20,320
Sleep.

1410
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:25,320
Sleep, my good baby.

1411
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,320
It's not that bad when you fall asleep.

1412
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:50,320
Sleep, my good baby.

1413
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:09,320
Do you want to listen to this?

1414
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:21,320
I'm going to lose weight.

1415
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,320
I'm going to lose weight.

1416
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:20,320
I'm going to lose weight.

1417
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:50,320
I'm going to lose weight.

1418
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,320
Yi.

1419
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:27,320
Yi, wake up.

1420
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:32,320
Yi.

1421
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:55,320
This is mom's nest, right?

1422
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,320
It tastes the same as your box.

1423
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:12,320
It's mom's scent.

1424
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:20,320
It's mom's scent.

1425
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:50,320
It's mom's scent.

1426
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:20,320
Mom.

1427
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:50,320
Mom.

1428
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:20,320
Mom.

1429
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:51,320
Mom.

1430
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:20,320
Yi.

1431
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:24,320
Goodbye.

1432
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:50,320
Goodbye.

1433
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:21,320
Goodbye.

1434
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:50,320
Goodbye.

1435
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:21,320
What?

1436
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:23,320
Come on, Sister Zeng.

1437
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:24,320
What?

1438
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:25,320
Who's so smart?

1439
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:26,320
Dad, dad, dad.

1440
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:27,320
What?

1441
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:28,320
There's a surprise.

1442
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,320
Sit down.

1443
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:30,320
Are you ready?

1444
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:31,320
I'm ready.

1445
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:33,320
Three, two, one.

1446
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:39,320
The one before was broken.

1447
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:41,320
Today, this one is yours.

1448
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:42,320
Isn't this great?

1449
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:44,320
Teacher Zheng, you're good.

1450
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,320
How is it?

1451
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:46,320
Isn't your uncle Zhao's skill good?

1452
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:47,320
Look at this.

1453
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:48,320
Stop it, Zhao.

1454
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,320
You can say it.

1455
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:51,320
Dr. Cai.

1456
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:52,320
Dr. Cai.

1457
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,320
I'm going to sue you.

1458
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,320
Your hospital is a crime scene.

1459
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:59,320
Our baby is a pure drug addict.

1460
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:01,320
I've always been reluctant to give her a sedative.

1461
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:03,320
She's always been very strict.

1462
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:05,320
She's always been very strict.

1463
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:07,320
She came back to see the patient in your hospital.

1464
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:09,320
And then your little Yi ran away.

1465
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,320
Look, she's a victim.

1466
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:13,320
What should we do?

1467
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:18,320
I'm so happy.

1468
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:23,320
Look at her.

1469
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:24,320
Look at her.

1470
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:50,320
There are days when the sun is gentle.

1471
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:54,320
There are days when the rain is heavy.

1472
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:58,320
When I grow up, I'll eat a lot of food.

1473
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:02,320
It doesn't hurt to say it out.

1474
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:08,320
The hand that said goodbye.

1475
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:12,320
The wind that I walked on.

1476
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:18,320
Please become my umbrella.

1477
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:26,320
In the long and wandering journey of loneliness.

1478
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:31,320
Guard me, I dare to laugh and cry.

1479
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:33,320
There are stones.

1480
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:38,320
And it's really a little hard.

1481
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:40,320
Small stones.

1482
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:45,320
I still want to think of you when I'm lonely.

1483
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:47,320
Big stones.

1484
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:52,320
And cut my wound again.

1485
01:57:53,320 --> 01:58:00,320
I still remember those who loved me.

1486
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:03,320
The people who lift the stones.

1487
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:07,320
How many years have passed.

1488
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:10,320
It's not the beginning of the week.

1489
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:14,320
The sad thing should be the end.

1490
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:17,320
There is no fate.

1491
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:21,320
There are moonlight waiting.

1492
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:25,320
If you want to lift the stones.

1493
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:28,320
There are many parts of the stone.

1494
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:32,320
It doesn't hurt to say it out.

1495
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:35,320
The hand that said goodbye.

1496
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:39,320
The wind that I walked on.

1497
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:45,320
Please become my umbrella.

1498
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:53,320
In the long and wandering journey of loneliness.

1499
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:58,320
Guard me, I dare to laugh and cry.

1500
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:00,320
There are stones.

1501
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:05,320
And it's really a little hard.

1502
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:07,320
Small stones.

1503
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:12,320
I still want to think of you when I'm lonely.

1504
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:14,320
Big stones.

1505
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:19,320
And cut my wound again.

1506
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,320
I still remember those who loved me.

1507
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,320
The people who lift the stones.

1508
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,320
It doesn't hurt to say it out.

1509
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:26,320
The hand that said goodbye.

1510
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:29,320
The wind that I walked on.

1511
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:33,320
Please become my umbrella.

1512
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,320
The hand that said goodbye.

1513
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:39,320
The wind that I walked on.

1514
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:42,320
Please become my umbrella.

1515
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:45,320
The wind that I walked on.

1516
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,320
The wind that I walked on.

1517
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:51,320
The wind that I walked on.

1518
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:57,320
Please become my umbrella.

1519
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:05,320
In the long and wandering journey of loneliness.

1520
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:11,320
Guard me, I dare to laugh and cry.

1521
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:14,320
The wind that I walked on.

1522
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:18,320
Please become my umbrella.

1523
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:20,320
The wind that I walked on.

1524
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:25,320
Please become my umbrella.

1525
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:32,320
In the long and wandering journey of loneliness.

1526
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:39,320
Guard me, I dare to laugh and cry.

1527
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:46,320
All the things that I remember are gifts.

1528
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:58,320
Take me to see the sunrise.

1529
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:12,320
I am going to the college entrance exam tomorrow.

1530
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:13,320
Xiao Xiao Yi will take care of you.

1531
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:14,320
You should eat less and be more careless.

1532
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:15,320
Less salt, less oil, less can, less meat.

1533
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:16,320
I know.

1534
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:17,320
My daughter is really really good.

1535
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:20,320
Her high-school score is as good as last year.

1536
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:21,320
Tonight I will show it to everyone.

1537
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:22,320
I know.

1538
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,320
I know.

1539
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:24,320
I know.

1540
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:25,320
I know.

1541
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:26,320
You are really good.

1542
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:27,320
I know.

1543
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:28,320
I know.

1544
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:29,320
I know.

1545
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:30,320
I know.

1546
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:31,320
I know.

1547
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:32,320
I know.

1548
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:33,320
I know.

1549
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:34,320
I know.

1550
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:35,320
I know.

1551
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:36,320
I know.

1552
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:37,320
I know.

1553
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:38,320
I know.

1554
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:39,320
I know.

1555
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:40,320
I know.

1556
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:41,920
I'm going to show you something.

1557
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:43,420
Don't add any more dishes to Xiaoxiao.

1558
02:01:43,420 --> 02:02:09,100
How come there are so many
