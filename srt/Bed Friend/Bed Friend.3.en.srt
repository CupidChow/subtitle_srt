Caution: The show is created for entertainment purposes only. Please exercise caution while watching.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,860
I'm sorry for avoiding you.

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,640
and...

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,310
have a sharp tongue with you.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,710
Is that your ex?

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,140
Why being so blue?

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,020
To hell with him!

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,870
You deserve better, I knew it.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,190
To be honest...

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,040
If it wasn't you...

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,790
I might ask for being a...

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,980
Friend With Benefits.

13
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,510
You're so damn hot.

14
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,360
Wait.

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,600
We've gotta set the rules first.

16
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,800
Sure.

17
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,680
Just tell me.

18
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,860
First rule,

19
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,140
We will make love...

20
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,520
not more than twice a week.

21
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,700
Woah.

22
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,510
Too less.

23
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,090
If you're not ok with this,

24
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,030
call it end now.

25
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,310
I didn't say I'm not ok.

26
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,480
What's next?

27
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,340
Huh?

28
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,520
Ah.

29
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,000
Second rule,

30
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,550
Do not make any love bite.

31
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,100
I don't like bruise.

32
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,010
Fine.

33
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,930
That's all?

34
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,220
and always ask for my consent.

35
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,990
If I say NO,

36
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,810
It means NO.

37
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,030
Always wear condom, too.

38
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,300
Don't butt in me at the office.

39
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,020
No one mustn't know about us.

40
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,360
Even Jade,

41
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,690
Must not know, too.

42
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,839
That's all?

43
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,390
and!

44
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,330
either you or me fine the one...

45
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,760
to be with...

46
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,590
We have to end our relationship right away.

47
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,409
This includes...

48
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,920
when you or me want to end this,

49
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:42,880
we call it the end.

50
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,580
Fine.

51
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,180
That's all?

52
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,070
Not yet.

53
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,240
one more,

54
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,880
If you sleep with another one,

55
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,960
I will end this relationship right away.

56
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,830
Hey.

57
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,320
If you can't accept the rules,

58
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,190
so don't start it at all.

59
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,410
Call it the end NOW.

60
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,090
Fine.

61
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,870
I won't sleep with another one.

62
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,100
It's not even the problem.

63
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,110
I don't like you.

64
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,120
You don't like me.

65
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,890
It's just sex.

66
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,850
You think the guy like you can follow the rules?

67
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,420
Hm?

68
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,830
I don't know.

69
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,800
If I sleep with another one,

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,320
I promise I won't lie to you.

71
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:52,590
um.

72
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,290
Fine.

73
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,220
I have one rule.

74
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,660
If I can't sleep with another one,

75
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,480
I think twice a week is too less.

76
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,910
I need 4.

77
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,150
Too much.

78
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,880
No.

79
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,200
I won't do it.

80
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,340
3 is fine.

81
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,160
Just 3 times a week, deal?

82
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,310
Hm? Mr.Anol?

83
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,740
I ask for only one rule.

84
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,270
um.

85
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:36,900
Fine.

86
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,180
[Is that true we're just friends?]

87
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,700
[but I think we're much more than that.]

88
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,960
[Our friends say that we made like a pack.]

89
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,770
[I don't know what do you feel about me.]

90
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,320
[but I think you have feeling for me.]

91
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,440
[Things between us makes me feel good]

92
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,250
[I don't think I can keep it anymore]

93
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,280
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

94
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,260
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

95
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,550
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

96
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,140
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]

97
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,200
[It's up to you to, just say it.]

98
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,390
[I like you.]

99
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:46,130
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

100
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,980
Just drop me here.

101
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,680

102
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,170
I can wait.

103
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,600
Drop me here.

104
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,870
I will walk in there.

105
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,150
Why walking?

106
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,090
Don''t want anyone seeing us together?

107
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,030
If you get it, then drop me here.

108
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,520
I have to go.

109
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:15,960

111
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,100
Keep your naughty hands.

112
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,960
Hmmmm.

113
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,690
I mean massage me!

114
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,600
I don't wanna have kid like you!

115
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,830
Please let me go, mom! I'm sorry!

116
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,030

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,140
You have to come home this Sat.

120
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,820
Your dad asked about you. So boring.

121
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,420
Don't accept the call?

122
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,510
What happened, Uea?

123
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,390

124
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,290
My mom wants me to come home.

125
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,560
Um.

126
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,140
You should go home.

127
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,680
King.

128
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,150
Hm?

129
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,020

131
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,060
You don't go home?

132
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:12,990
No.

133
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,110
I haven't back home for a long time.

134
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,540
Are you okay, Uea?

135
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,510
Well...

136
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,770
Just call me when you arrived.

137
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,040
I'll pick you up.

138
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,730

141
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,380
Oh. It's here.

142
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,400
Keep it in your car.

143
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,380
Sure.

144
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,220
Hm?

145
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:54,970
What?

146
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,470
Hey!

147
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,710

148
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,240
Come with me?

149
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,250
Where?

150
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,170
Ahh!

151
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,030
What're you gonna do?

152
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,640
Let me dry your hair.

153
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,510
I can handle it.

154
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,160
No. Come here!

155
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,630
Ahhh/ Ummm.

156
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,220
[It's kinda feel good.]

157
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,020
Come here.

158
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,550
[Can I be your boyfriend now?]

159
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,530
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

160
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,230
[Aye.]

161
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,820
[Aye.]

162
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,380
Hm?!

163
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,690
What're you doing, uncle Sorn?

164
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,820
What're you doing?!

165
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,120
I don't like it.

166
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,910
Did I scared you?

167
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,480
I'm sorry.

168
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,620
I promise.

169
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,440
I will never do things you don't like anymore.

170
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,990
Uea.

171
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,660
Oh./ Ah.

172
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,670
This is for you.

173
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,589
This is mine?

174
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,089
Yeah, take a look!

175
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,250
Whoa. Colored pencils!

176
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,500
I like it so much!

177
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,859
You like it?

178
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,020
so you can do your drawings.

179
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,170
Cool?

180
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,880
Uea. Can you teach me how to draw?

181
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,160
Of course!

182
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,320
What're you gonna draw?

183
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,140
Well...

184
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,310
The mountain...because...

185
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,480
It's the easiest one.

186
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:43,870
Just a mountain?

187
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:44,550
Yes.

188
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,670
Go ahead.

189
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,010
Hm.

190
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,730
Here. Ahhhhh.

191
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,320
Wait. You should guide my hand.

192
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,080
Hm.

193
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,170
What're you doing, uncle Sorn?

194
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,890
Mosquito! The big one! It's gonna bite you here.

195
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,440
[Please forgive me]

196
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,520
Can you forgive me?

197
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,720
I won't do anything...

198
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,060
that you don't like again.

199
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,840
This is from me.

200
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,850
Not from the others...

201
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,400
Are you sure you don't want it?

202
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,570
Please...

203
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,250
Ueaaaaaaaa!

204
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:33,860
Uea.

205
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,740
Wooo.

206
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,480
Ah.

207
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,780
Are you teasing him, King?

208
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,560
I'm sorry.

209
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,970
Ahhh.

210
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,070
I'm not mad at you anymore.

211
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,720
Hmmmm. What did you do, King?!

212
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Tell me! Hm?!

213
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,560
Shut your mouth.

214
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,830
Tell me now!

215
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,540
King.

216
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,240
Why don't you wait for me? I'm not finished talking to you.

217
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,650
Why you're so hurry?

218
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,020
Are you an infant?

219
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,100
Do I need to look after? / Ah. Ah. Ah. Anyway.

220
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,910
Just don't stand me up!

221
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,420
You guys are hanging out together again!

222
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,750
But when I asked you to eat red pork rice....

223
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,580
No one come with me!

224
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,150
Ueaaaa.

225
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,080
Kinggg.

226
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:42,860
Please eat red pork rice with me./ King, pleaseeee

227
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,830
Hello, Mr.Anol.

228
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,290
What's up?

229
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,030
Nothing.

230
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,320
Just wanna call you.

231
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,220
For what?

232
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,000
so...

233
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,350
You're not hanging with Gun?

234
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,150
I'm not hanging with him.

235
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,460
or even another one.

236
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,300
If it wasn't you.

237
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,530
I have to go.

238
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,780
I feel sleepy.

239
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,430
Heyyyy.

240
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,430
Too shy to stay?

241
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,220
I-said-I'm-sleepy!

242
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,070
Ah. Ah. Ah.

243
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,600
I promise I'll be a good boy tonight. I'm not going anywhere.

244
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,340
Why telling me?

245
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,290
Just want to.

246
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,560
Why, Mr.Anol?

247
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,080
Don't bug me.

248
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,960
Um.

249
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,980
I'll text you when I arrived.

250
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,300
Don't worry about me.

251
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,980
Who cares?

252
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,660
Well.

253
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,590
King.

254
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,030
Who're you talking with?

255
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:15,950
Secret.

256
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,580
Fine. I don't wanna know.

257
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,720
so...

258
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,210
Can we go?!

259
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,330
I wanna get in now!

260
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,480
Let's go.

261
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:52,810
King (Incoming calls)

262
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:23,870
If you don't reply me, I'll come to see you.

263
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,700
I tried to cheer with her so long!

264
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,290
Why don't she interested in me?!

265
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,560
What a boring!

266
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,100
Ahhh.

267
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,380
Shhhh* King! You...

268
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,070
You do nothing, why did she look at you?!

269
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,500
How to do that?!

270
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,760
Please tell me the trick.

271
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,020
Stop put this f*cking thing in your mouth.

272
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,910
Why? It's kinda cool.

273
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,590
I'm not looking for a high rate type.

274
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,040
but why I can't catch any girl?

275
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:44,870
so,

276
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,580
What's your type?

277
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,660
Ummmm

278
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,700
Can you give an example one from the office?

279
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,110
Oh.

280
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,170
Fah, the accountant.

281
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,630
She's so damn cute!

282
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,590
I might flirt with her if she's still single!

283
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,900
Wait. Wait. Wait.

284
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,250
There's another one.

285
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,680
so cute.

286
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,060
Uea.

287
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,560
Ouch.

288
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,190
Hmmm. Gun.

289
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,440
Why did you hit me?

290
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,930
Don't cross the line.

291
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,820
I'm just giving an example!

292
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,040
Thought I need to go home alone.

293
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Can I give a toast with you?

294
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,650
Ummm.

295
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,100
I don't drink today.

296
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,340
Can I cheers with this?

297
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,850
So cute.

298
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,260
Er.

299
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,360
Fries are nice.

300
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,500
Can you order more?

301
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:54,900
Huh?

302
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,840
Sh*t!

303
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,450
You're not King!

304
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,700
Hurry up!

305
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,290
Ok.

306
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:29,600
King sent at 3:10 am. : I arrived home already.

307
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,880
King sent at 3:10 am. : Come back alone. Sleep alone. So lonely.

308
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,260
Uea: Gun told me already.

309
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,960
Ah. Uea. Sawasdeekrub. [Hello]

310
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,350
I'm hungover.

311
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,190
Need coffee?

312
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,030
Ah.

313
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,800
I'm about to get it.

314
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,680
I will do it myself.

315
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,870
Ah. Ok.

316
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,140
Ah.

317
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,180
Sh*t.

318
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,710
What happened?

319
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,150
The dust is in my eyes.

320
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,050
Hey! Don't squeeze.

321
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:08,830
Come here.

322
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,480
There's another one. So cute.

323
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,150
Uea.

324
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:26,970
What're you doing?

325
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,500
Hey!

326
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,280
What's wrong with you?

327
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,360
Leave me!

328
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,230
What're gonna do?

329
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,540
We're in the office now.

330
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,070
It should be me asking you.

331
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,610
What're you gonna do?

332
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,610
What the hell happened to you?

333
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,500
I don't like it.

334
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,500
I'm getting jealous.

335
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:57,990
Jealous?

336
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,200
Don't kidding me by saying that.

337
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,360
What if I'm not kidding?

338
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,470
You never settled down with anyone.

339
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,310
Don't talk to me like that.

340
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,720
I've already fixed the part you asked, King.

341
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,720
Is there anything else?

342
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,450
Nope.

343
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,220
Ah, then...

344
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,720
I'm going home.

345
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,250
Uea, Jade, good bye.

346
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,110
Good bye.

347
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,450
Good bye, King.

348
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,200
Um.

349
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,320
Mongkol, I'm going home, good bye.

350
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,040
Wait!

351
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,150
Where are you going?

352
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,180
Uh... I'm going back home.

353
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,360
Why would you leave before seniors like us?

354
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,340
Understood.

355
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,030
Wait a minute.

356
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,530
Yes, sir.

357
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,780
There is so much to do. My back hurts.

358
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,020
Hey, Jade.

359
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,560
Don't forget to check your inbox. I've already sent you the file.

360
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,210
Okay.

361
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:36,710
Keep fighting.

362
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,490
I'm leaving, Uea.

363
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,580
See you, everyone.

364
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,370
See you.

365
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,200
Jade.

366
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,190
I'll go to the bathroom.

367
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,530
Um.

368
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:05,590
Uh.

369
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
He sent me a blank file again!

370
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,380
Really?

371
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,850
There is not even a single layer!

372
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,700
How could he do this to you?

373
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,410
That's horrible.

374
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,740
I think...

375
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,900
I should tell Bas about this.

376
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:27,970
Hey!

377
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,310
It's useless.

378
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,300
You are being too kind, Jade.

379
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,520
Is there anything I can do for you?

380
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,690
It's alright.

381
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,590
I'll do this tomorrow.

382
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,250
Are you leaving?

383
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,280
Um.

384
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,580
I'll go to the bathroom first.

385
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,440
Get ready and wait for me.

386
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,760
Um, I'll wait for you.

387
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,880
My room tonight.

388
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,370
Will you come?

389
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,600
So you no longer avoid me.

390
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,140
We've come to this point...

391
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,110
How could I keep avoiding you?

392
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,170
Can we do it like this again next time?

393
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,350
Why do you agree to sleep with me?

394
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,050
Why are you asking this now?

395
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,400
I don't know.

396
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,630
I feel like...

397
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,000
If I had bothered you from the start,

398
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,830
you would have changed your mind.

399
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,940
Besides,

400
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,670
You don't seem like you'd be interested in this stuff.

401
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,820
So I want to know why you let me do it.

402
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,310
I guess I just wanna f*ck up my life even more.

403
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,360
Since most of the time...

404
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,980
my life isn't great after all.

405
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,780
Then...

406
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,290
Will you let me be a good thing in your life?

407
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,000
Someone like you?

408
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,639
At least,

409
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,830
I'm good in bed.

410
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,330
Enough!

411
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,699
I'm still upset with you, you know?

412
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,370
Is that so?

413
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,239
Yes, I am.

414
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,000
You still parked in the same spot, Uea.

415
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,700
Pock?

416
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,570
So if I want you to talk to me,

417
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,780
I have to come to your office?

418
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:36,600
Let go of me!

419
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:37,950
No.

420
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,140
Why?

421
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,540
Can't I just hold you?

422
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,860
Are you deaf?

423
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,850
Get out of my life!

424
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,850
I won't.

425
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,660
You made a one side decision with our break up!

426
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,650
I won't let you go that easily.

427
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,140
What are you looking at?!

428
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,810
Huh? What the f*ck are you looking at?!

429
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,840
Pock.

430
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,890
Let's have a real talk.

431
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,140
Hm?

432
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,140
Pock!

433
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,970
Hey! What are you doing?

434
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:01,710
Butt out!

435
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,280
You're the one that should butt out!

436
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,980
Tell your friend it's not his business!

437
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,740
If you won't let him go,

438
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,340
I'll call a security!

439
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,850
You want to fight me?!/ Hey!

440
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,570
Huh?!

441
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,940
Talk to me!!/ No!

442
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:14,900
Stop looking!

443
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,930
Are you looking for trouble?!/ Hey, Jade!

444
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,290
I have nothing to say to you!

445
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,020
Hey! Stop!

446
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,140
Freeze!

447
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,150
Aren't your father a politician?

448
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,360
It won't be good if you're in the news, right?

449
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,700
It's a misunderstanding.

450
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,970
I'm sorry.

451
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,000
Are you alright?

452
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,070
Yes, I'm fine.

453
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,700
Okay, I'm leaving then.

454
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,720
Thank you.

455
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,440
Let's get back to work.

456
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,260
Uea!

457
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,610
Are you really alright?

458
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,410
Are you hurt anywhere?

459
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,690
I believe

460
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,650
Pock won't end it like this.

461
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,200
Will you report against him to the police?

462
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,300
Report who?

463
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,480
Uea's ex-boyfriend.

464
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,340
He came and made a scene.

465
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,940
Did he do anything to you?

466
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,280
Not yet.

467
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,220
I called the security in time.

468
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,070
Hey!

469
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,830
What if he go to your condominium?

470
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,270
He won't dare.

471
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,250
Let's file a police report.

472
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,580
Uh.

473
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,040
Let's do that!

474
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:04,940
Never mind.

475
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,340
But I think you should.../ I threatened him about his father.

476
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,320
He wouldn't dare to do anything to me.

477
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,470
Why are you spacing out here?

478
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,580
It's nothing.

479
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,000
Why don't you temporarily move into my room?

480
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,410
Kinggg! King!

481
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:31,330
Hurry up!

482
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,280
A bug needs to be fixed immediately!

483
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,190
You go fix it first.

484
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,190
Yes, yes. Let's go! The boss is calling!

485
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,080
I'm going to bed.

486
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,280
Noo.

487
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,280
What's the hurry?

488
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,520
Uea, stay with me.

489
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,670
Uea, Uea, Uea.

490
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:29,550
I. am. replying. aren't. I?

491
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,580
I'm replying, aren't I?

492
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,510
(King sent a photo)

493
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,580
Can I make a call?

494
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,090
Nope

495
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,610
(King is video calling)

496
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,570
You said no, but still answered my call.

497
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,130
Uea, don't end it!

498
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,210
I'm feeling lonely.

499
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,240
I need someone to sleep with me.

500
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,600
Why are you telling me, then?

501
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,160
Ah.

502
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,410
Why wouldn't I?

503
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,670
I only have you.

504
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:24,810
I'm lonely.

505
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,180
Can I come over?

506
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,290
For what? It's already late.

507
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:31,760
To sleep, of course.

508
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,970
Please, mr. Anol.

509
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,270
I'm going to sleep.

510
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,860
Then leave the call like this. Don't end it.

511
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,470
You're acting like a child, King.

512
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,260
I just want to lie down and look at you.

513
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,300
Do as you please.

514
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,940
I'm going to sleep now.

515
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,890
Hmm, Uea!

516
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,250
Not the feet!

517
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:22,980
Hm?

518
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,190
Um.

519
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,790
Are you happy now?

520
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,160
Yes, I am.

521
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,010
Um.

522
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,190
So...

523
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:50,830
I'll sleep.

524
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,750
Sweet dreams.

525
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,050
I'm going to sleep.

526
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,590
[You and me are just chilling]

527
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:18,030
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

528
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,150
[I don't wanna be your friend]

529
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,650
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

530
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:27,800
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

531
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:33,060
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

532
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,610
[I think I has crossed the line]

533
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,190
Woahh.

534
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,450
We'll get off work in just a moment!

535
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,610
I feel like I got a lot of work done today. Do you think so?

536
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:02,670
King?

537
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,070
Do you feel like you accomplished a lot of work?

538
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:10,250
Eh? Nobody talks to me.

539
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,870
Oh, guys. I'll be leaving first for today.

540
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:16,050
I have a meeting and dinner appointment with our boss.

541
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,450
Oh, hello.

542
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,060
Hello./ Hello.

543
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,170
I have a dinner appointment with my boss.

544
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,640
Really?

545
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,410
What a high-pitched tone.

546
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,610
I'll take my leave.

547
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,200
Oh my, how could he?!

548
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,640
He is the last to arrive and the first to leave!

549
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,640
What a jerk!/ Right?

550
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,550
Well, now I know why we got troubles today.

551
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,820
King! Your shirt is an inauspicious color!

552
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,440
What's inauspicious?

553
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,290
You see, the marketing team said that...

554
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,430
The clients don't use promotion because there're a lot of bugs!

555
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,950
So how does that relate to the color of my shirt?

556
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,610
It sure does! Take a close look at this.!

557
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,850
It's Friday, so Black is inauspicious!

558
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
You should wear a lively Blue like this!

559
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,340
Lively!/ Yes.

560
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,280
Hm.

561
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:27,450
Oops!

562
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:31,370
Oppa (Older brother in Korean) is calling./ Hehehe.

563
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,140
Hello? *Speaking in Korean*

564
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,410
Hello.

565
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,200
Brother, I love you!

566
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:37,830
Oh?

567
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,790
Oppa?

568
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,490
Don't go!

569
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:44,610
Why?

570
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,880
He broke up with me!

571
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,990
See? Muay, I told you that your pants is an inauspicious color!

572
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,520
Did you watch the Chae show?

573
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,910
Moddam clearly tells you what color you should wear.

574
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,590
Yes, I always watch it.

575
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:59,130
But they laughed the entire show, so I didn't understand a thing.

576
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,620
I think they're quite good though./ Whatever!

577
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,360
Hahaha./ Boohoo.

578
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:04,560
Hey, King!

579
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,330
Remember to check the best color next time.

580
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:08,370
Yes, maam.

581
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:09,320
Good.

582
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,610
I'm leaving, guys. Good bye.

583
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,890
Wait a second./ Huh?

584
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:15,330
Aren't you working OT?

585
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,600
No way, my child is waiting.

586
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:18,400
Boo.

587
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,170
Say, your child or your hubby?

588
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,020
Fine!

589
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,490
My hubby is waiting.

590
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,420
I have a husband, after all.

591
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,890
Hello, Waeo?

592
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
2,500 like always.

593
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:37,150
Stop it, Muay! Don't call Waeo. Let's go home!

594
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,440
Treat me to a Soju.

595
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,870
Alright, 3 bottles, my treat.

596
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,360
Hahaha.

597
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,750
You're acting like a madam.

598
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:45,840
Hehehe.

599
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,130
I've got a backache, don't wanna work anymore.

600
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,020
You can go first, Gun.

601
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,710
Huh? Why?

602
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,320
It's not that much.

603
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,060
You can go. I'll take care of the rest

604
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,220
Then, I'm going first.

605
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:06,650
Jade.

606
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:07,500
Hm?

607
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,610
Wanna go together?

608
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:10,410
There's a buy 1 get 1 free promotion

609
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,050
Wow.

610
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,030
4 - 6 p.m.

611
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:16,700
Shit!

612
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,170
We've 15 minutes left!

613
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,810
Gun, let's go!

614
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,010
Don't you think you agree too fast?

615
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:22,630
Why not? Hurry up!

616
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,440
Hurry!

617
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:29,200
Uea!/ Huh?

618
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,050
Wanna join?

619
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:32,410
Urr...

620
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,410
Wait! I was just being polite.

621
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,510
I know you wouldn't come. Let's go!

622
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,440
King!

623
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:39,950
Wanna go?

624
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:41,120
Ha?

625
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,070
You don't have to go. Let's go!

626
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,400
Hey, hey!

627
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,810
What else?/ I forget something.

628
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Good bye./ Good bye.

629
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,910
Speed up, we're late!

630
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,020
You can go first, Uea. Don't wait for me.

631
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:15,270
Um.

632
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,100
Er.

633
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:28,950
So...

634
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:30,890
I'm leaving.

635
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,520
Yes.

636
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:08,610
Hi./ Pock!?

637
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,560
All your friends have already left, huh?

638
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,020
No one can protects you from now on!

639
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,940
We already broke up!

640
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,280
Can you get the f*ck out of my life?!

641
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,010
I told ya. I won't break up with you!

642
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,660
But I have a new boyfriend!

643
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:23,800
Oh, really? Where is he, then?

644
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,490
Help!

645
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,830
Pock!

646
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:26,550
Keep resisting!

647
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,060
Pock!

648
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,500
Happy birthday!

649
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,600
It's your birthday gift!

650
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,720
Why are we unable to make this an overseas trip?

651
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,840
We can have fun everywhere, though.

652
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,470
Because we have each other.

653
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,860
Uea! You came.

654
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,340
I was waiting for you.

655
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,640
Can you stop doing this to me?/ We need to talk.

656
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,380
Are you such a player?/ Player?

657
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,730
Mom! Mom!

658
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:52,970
Take this! Is one man not enough for you?!

659
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:57,170
[You and me are just chilling]

660
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,400
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

661
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,610
[I don't wanna be your friend]

662
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,140
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

663
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:10,410
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

664
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:15,540
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

665
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:20,060
[I think I has crossed the line]

666
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,340
[You and me are just chilling]

667
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,460
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

668
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,470
[I don't wanna be your friend]

669
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,030
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

670
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:36,110
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

671
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:41,540
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

672
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:47,490
[I think I has crossed the line]
