00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,760
Can you wear this for me?

3
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,560
You like it?

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,880
Damn...

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,060
You're freaking hot.

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,870
What're you thinking?

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,210
I never felt like this for long time.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,590
If this bite off more than you can chew, I got your back.

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,140
or Mr.Krit just wanna talk to you.

10
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,550
We're just bed friend.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,000
You don't have to do this.

12
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,000
Uea is typing: I'm sorry. [deleted]

13
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:23,030
that I was too harsh to you. I felt like... [deleted]

14
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,920
[If I have to fight you, I'll give up on this game]

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:38,590
[It's unfair to continue playing, because my heart is all yours.]

16
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,930
[]If you want to keep going,]

17
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,170
[I ask you to please stop.]

18
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:51,280
[Just let you win since I can't take it anymore]

19
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,190
[I can't help but fall for you]

20
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,780
Here's for you.

21
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,570
Woahh.

22
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,670
Don't you think it's too much? Wanna share others?

23
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,870
For public's sharing is over there.

24
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,780
You can keep it for months.

25
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,450
Just take it.

26
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
Forgive me that I left for a week.

27
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,800
Don't be overthinking.

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,930
I'm glad that you had fun.

29
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,490
Umm.

30
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,490
Let's see what you have.

31
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,700
Hello, everyone!

32
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,130
Yay.

33
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,550
What did you buy for me?

34
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,270
Whoa, Gun. so that will be the first thing you mentioned?

35
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,970
It's on the table.

36
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,710
You too, King. If you need more, there's still some from public's.

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,710
Why did you buy that much?

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,430
I didn't see you for a while,

39
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,210
thought you've already resigned.

40
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,940
Even HR didn't complain me.

41
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,650
So who're you, Hm?

42
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,760
Hm?!

43
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,640
Huh.

44
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,300
Let's talk about your story.

45
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,400
What story?

46
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,200
How was an arranged match? Tell me.

47
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,150
I wanna know it so much.

48
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,940
Nothing to tell.

49
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,060
Woahhh. How can it be nothing?

50
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,130
My mom talking with your mom for hours.

51
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,050
There must be something.

52
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,730
It's all about business.

53
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,000
I didn't even listen to them.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,130
Hm?

55
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,670
Ummm.

56
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,500
For the lady you went with... // Can you just stop talking?!

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,200
[Is that true we're just friends?]

58
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,710
[but I think we're much more than that.]

59
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,390
[Our friends say that we made like a pack.]

60
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,690
[I don't know what do you feel about me.]

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,260
[but I think you have feeling for me.]

62
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,510
[Things between us makes me feel good]

63
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,840
[I don't think I can keep it anymore]

64
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,070
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

65
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,260
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

66
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,850
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

67
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,830
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]

68
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,310
[It's up to you, just say it.]

69
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,790
[I like you.]

70
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,970
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

71
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,670
What do wanna have?

72
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,560
Mine...Stir fried pork with basil...Simply, easy, and fast.

73
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,540
Me too.

74
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,190
I wrote down for you.

75
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,070
Stir fried pork with basil. No veggie. No long bean.

76
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,909
Add one more for me.

77
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,550
You looked different today.

78
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,300
Why today you're not too picky?

79
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:46,140
I'm lazy. Just wanna take it easy.

80
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,880
Um.

81
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,870
I'll send it to her first.

82
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,510
Thank you.

83
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,880
Glad that we came down fast.

84
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,460
Er, Uea.

85
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,210
Mr.Krit asked you to meet him again?

86
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,419
There are too many times for this week.

87
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,289
and it took so long for briefing each time.

88
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,020
He took advantage from you.

89
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,550
Pardon?

90
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,820
Nothing.

91
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,990
Have I told you?

92
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,990
If he makes the deal with you,

93
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,180
just refuse him.

94
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,740
No way. He's our boss.

95
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,080
Yes!

96
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,170
Here you are.

97
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,930
Can you...help me?

98
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,890
Come in, please.

99
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,590
Mild, you didn't manage it very nice.

100
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,110
That's why I have to do something.

101
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,620
Don't tell me that I was too mean.

102
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,880
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,150
Check your work carefully next time.

104
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,120
Don't force me to tell the boss.

105
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,820
You may go.

106
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,960
Uea, let's have a seat first.

107
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,550
Sorry to asked you coming at the end day.

108
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,090
It's okay.

109
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,870
[sigh]

110
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,340
It's because Marketing team's briefing wasn't very nice.

111
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,560
I just noticed when you told me that work needs to be fixed.

112
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,690
I've already warned Mild.

113
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,010
to be more cautious.

114
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,930
Anyway, I have to ask you to fix this by today.

115
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,100
but I work...// I really need your help.

116
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,940
Hello.

117
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,940
Uea.

118
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,170
You missed the nice scene. So intense.

119
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,320
Mr.Krit asked programmer team to have an urgent meeting.

120
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,350
He looked so stressful.

121
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,090
I was goosebumps.

122
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,700
Um.

123
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,650
Must be some urgent work.

124
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,950
Always be urgent.

125
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,980
With us either.

126
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,500
So boring.

127
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,000
Er, yeah.

128
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,580
Have you talked to King recently?

129
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,630
Which topic?

130
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,020
I heard from my mom,

131
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,430
King will have an arranged dinner with same lady this week.

132
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,810
Why did he tell it's nothing?

133
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,330
or...

134
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,780
He liked her?

135
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,520
At first, I did understand him.

136
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,220
He might not avoid his mom.

137
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,880
But, this is second time now. Weird, right?

138
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,330
or still arranged?

139
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,730
Hello. How's everything, Jan?

140
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,960
What?

141
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,450
Okay.

142
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,010
Wait for me. I'll be there asap.

143
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,380
What happened?

144
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,300
Jan told me that she admitted. I need to see my sister.

145
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,880
Yeah, go ahead.

146
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,270
Tell me if everything's alright // Okay, please take care that work for me.

147
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
Sorry for rushing your work.

148
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,940
Er.

149
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,770
Mr.Krit,

150
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,520
I talked to Mild that this campaign will be launched next week.

151
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,330
Is that correct, sir?

152
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,640
so, why do you rush me right now?

153
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,150
We've to send the file for making Vinyl Banners.

154
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,200
That's why I rush you.

155
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,080
Do you mind doing this for me?

156
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,840
Briefing at the end of the day?

157
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,400
What a bad "Marketing team".

158
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,710
"They" don't really know their place.

159
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:10,690
Yes.

160
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,010
I really need your help, Uea.

161
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,150
Uea.

162
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,920
Just do it.

163
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,880
I'll wait for you.

164
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,470
Almost done?

165
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,580
so, I'll go to the toilet.

166
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,340
Um.

167
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,860
I'm almost done.

168
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,340
Uea.

169
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,920
Meet me in my room.

170
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,660
Er...

171
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,200
It's about work.

172
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:32,950
Now, please.

173
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,920
Hurry up.

174
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,640
Come on.

175
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,380
This way, please.

176
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,200
Sorry to asked you being here,

177
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,500
at the end of the day.

178
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,450
Is there anything you'd like me to do?

179
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,120
About Mongkol,

180
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,460
I want to apologize for him.

181
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,840
He might run an urgent errand.

182
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,540
Can I tell you something?

183
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,430
Go ahead.

184
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,550
Jade and I worked overloaded.

185
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,170
Mr.Krit, can you...

186
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,920
tell Mongkol to do his work, please?

187
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,670
Hmm.

188
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,590
Hey,

189
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,090
You called me "Mister" again.

190
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,890
[Sigh]

191
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,210
Let's put it this way.

192
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,540
About Mongkol,

193
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,490
If you "want me"...

194
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
"to talk to him", I will do for you.

195
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,560
Thank you, sir.

196
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,750
Excuse me, I have to back home.

197
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,280
Ah.

198
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,880
Mr.Krit.

199
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,710
Mr.Krit.

200
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,810
Hmm.

201
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,930
Uea.

202
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,400
Do you know you worked really nice?

203
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,450
For this evaluation,

204
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,360
I'll plus an extra points for you.

205
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,230
Sorry, sir.

206
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,940
I don't wanna mess up with wrong things.

207
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,620
Just do your work as a good boss

208
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,890
And I'm your simple employee, that's all.

209
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,910
Hm.

210
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,250
Hey.

211
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,520
I

212
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,250
don't wanna be just your boss.

213
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,610
Ahh.

214
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,060
Uea...

215
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,250
Mr.Krit!

216
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,240
Help me!

217
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,750
Mr.Krit! Ah!

218
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,770
Don't move!

219
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,830
Help me!

220
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,390
Ah!

221
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,500
Mr.Krit!

222
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,210
Ah!

223
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,880
Mr.Krit!

224
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,800
Ah!

225
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,670
Um. Ouch.

226
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,350
The hell, Uea!

227
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,160
Have I told you?

228
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,680
If he makes the deal with you,

229
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,350
just refuse him.

230
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,160
Why did you go inside his office?

231
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,800
How can I avoid him, King?

232
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,840
Why not?

233
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,290
What do you have in your mind?

234
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,600
How do I know?

235
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,670
You two are staying face to face.

236
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,320
King!

237
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,250
What do you mean?!

238
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,690
Why?

239
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,150
Are you mad at me?

240
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,530
If you talk to me like that,

241
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,620
you can't even be my friend, King!

242
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,540
Wait, Uea.

243
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,890
For everything I did,

244
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,530
It's because I care about you.

245
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,370
so this is called "caring"?

246
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,890
Then, stop caring about me, King!

247
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,030
Yeah.

248
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,740
It's my fault for worrying about you.

249
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,060
I'm sorry.

250
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,300
Uea!

251
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,440
Uea!

252
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,100
Huh?

253
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,880
Is something wrong?

254
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,300
No.

255
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,120
I couldn't sleep well last night.

256
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,900
Uh.

257
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,240
King told me Mr. Krit kept calling you after I left?

258
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,240
Um.

259
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,240
I'm sorry, Uea.

260
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,960
So you had to work until it's late, right?

261
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,960
It's alright.

262
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,340
From now on, I'll go home with you every day!

263
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,460
If King hadn't told me, I'd have been kept in the dark.

264
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,380
Speaking of which, King really cares about you.

265
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,500
Is that so?

266
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,340
Um.

267
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,600
Can you trying giving it more space?

268
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,600
Hey, bro.

269
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,460
Hm?

270
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,700
Mai sent a resignation email.

271
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,700
Ha?

272
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,780
What about the project you're working on?

273
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,020
Resigning like this...

274
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,380
He might be forced.

275
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,300
That's not a problem at all.

276
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,020
Just an incompetent employee leaving.

277
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,060
How's your work progress, Uea?

278
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,780
I'm here to check your work.

279
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,820
It's...

280
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,320
not finished yet.

281
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,780
I'll speed up.

282
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,960
Do your best.

283
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,420
Yes, sir.

284
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:01,780
Hey.

285
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,260
I'm pretty sure Mai was forced to resign.

286
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,620
Transfer me some money. Just 3,000 baht is fine.

287
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,080
Uea!

288
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,820
You're here.

289
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,820
What's wrong?

290
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,920
Krit asked you to meet him.

291
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,920
I looked for you everywhere.

292
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,240
Is there something urgent?

293
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,240
I don't know either.

294
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,400
But he asked everyone in the department to find you.

295
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,040
Are you alright?

296
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,620
Oh.

297
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,520
I'm good.

298
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,520
This too..

299
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,900
...shall pass.

300
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,440
Hm?

301
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,560
Nothing.

302
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,920
You go first.

303
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,580
I'll go with you.

304
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,580
Hmm.

305
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,340
Just go quickly.

306
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:49,840
Um.

307
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,020
I'll go right after you. Go.

308
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,000
(Resignation letter)

309
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,640
Ah, you came so late.

310
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,760
Do you know how lonely I was working with just King beside me?

311
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,900
So I dragged him back. I don't wanna attend anymore meeting.

312
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,120
Why was the meeting so long?

313
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,780
I was told to fix it back and forth.

314
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,020
I'm going crazy.

315
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,860
Out of 8 hours of work,

316
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,420
I attended the meeting for 12 hours!

317
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,540
When will have the time to work?

318
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,320
Uea?

319
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,680
Why are you standing here?

320
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,120
Are you free?

321
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,460
Wanna share my work?

322
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,420
Get to work!

323
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,120
So nosy.

324
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,000
My T-shirt?

325
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,080
What's wrong with it?

326
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,100
What's going on, student?

327
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,600
Hello, Uea.

328
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,020
I miss you.

329
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,320
I miss you too.

330
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,900
How are you?

331
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,220
Do you study hard?

332
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,580
Yes, real hard.

333
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,400
And there are a lot of activities.

334
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,800
Hm, really?

335
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,940
Uh, where are you now?

336
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,340
At dorm or at home?

337
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,320
I'm at home doing the laundry.

338
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,020
Uea.

339
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,240
There's a guy came to see mom.

340
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,620
Who?

341
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,260
He said... he's your boss.

342
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,920
His name is Krit.

343
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,140
Hurry. Hehehe.

344
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,300
It looks delicious.

345
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,800
Yeah, please eat anything you want.

346
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,560
Oh, Uea!// Uea!

347
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,660
You came just in time. Come on here.

348
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,340
You came at the right moment.

349
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,040
Come and sit here. You must be tired.

350
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,380
Sit down.

351
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,260
Your boss came to give me some fruits.

352
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:13,960
Hehe.

353
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,780
He came this way, so he stopped by to say hello.

354
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,300
Thank you so much, Mr. Krit.

355
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,260
No problem. It's my pleasure.

356
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,300
Haha, yes.

357
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,080
Oh, you should thank him too.// Thank you.

358
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,300
Why don't you go back first?

359
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,440
I have something to say to mom.

360
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,880
Hey, what are you saying?

361
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,900
He's tired coming here. Why'd you let him go back so quick?

362
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,080
Never mind. I'm leaving.

363
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,800
Let's meet again in the office, Uea.

364
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,580
Alright?

365
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,020
Good bye // Good bye.

366
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,980
Good bye.

367
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,300
Go send him off.

368
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,020
No.

369
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,500
I told you to go.

370
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,739
I said no.// Go!

371
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,679
It's alright.

372
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,300
I'm leaving.

373
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,040
Ah, yes.

374
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Then you send him off, Tonkao.// Yes.

375
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,360
This way, please.

376
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,260
Is he your new hubby?

377
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,139
He seems to be rich.

378
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,179
Look at this.

379
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,460
The fruits he brought are all high quality.

380
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,920
He's my boss.

381
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,120
But he seems to be interested in you.

382
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,420
I'm fine with him.

383
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,240
Don't you hate me being gay?

384
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,020
Hahaha.

385
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,140
So what? Huh?

386
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,200
You can't quit it any way.

387
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,500
I don't care what you are.

388
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,560
What do you mean?

389
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,560
Nothing special.

390
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,980
What you are is your business. I don't care.

391
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,840
You have money to take care of me well, that's all I care.

392
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,160
Mom!// Oops!

393
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,100
What am I to you?

394
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,140
You dared to shout at me? Huh?

395
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,480
You never care about my feelings!

396
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,100
Shut up!

397
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,440
Uea.// I didn't talk to you.

398
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,300
Now you dared to be aggressive against your dad? Huh?

399
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,460
Dad?// Uea.

400
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,200
He's just your new beloved husband, isn't he?

401
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,580
He's not my dad!

402
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,560
You ungrateful child! How could you say that?!

403
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,240
He brought you up! How dare you say such a thing?!

404
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,940
You m*ther f*cker! Get the hell out of my house! Now!

405
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,840
Mom!// Get out!// Talk nicely.

406
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,160
Get out.

407
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,480
Get out of my house, ungrateful b*tch!

408
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,020
Ungrateful?

409
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,240
Have you ever felt guilty?

410
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,040
About the thing you've done to me?

411
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,340
Shut up! Shut up right now!

412
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,680
Don't you dare say anymore words!

413
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,280
How about you?!

414
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,960
Have you ever felt guilty protecting him?

415
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,620
Even when I told you he molested me...

416
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,720
Molest?!// Hey.

417
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,660
Mom!

418
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,220
You're still protecting him.

419
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,740
Mom.

420
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,980
Have you ever felt guilty?

421
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,720
Have you ever cared about my feelings?!

422
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,140
I'll tell you something.

423
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,480
Having you as my son,

424
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,420
brings me so much troubles!

425
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,940
If you didn't exist in my life,

426
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,600
I'd lived well long ago.

427
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,520
Fine!

428
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,880
Why did you give birth to me then?!

429
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,040
If I had a choice,

430
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,320
I wouldn't want to live like this!

431
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,520
Uea.

432
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,100
Get out!

433
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,840
Get the hell out of my house! Now!

434
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,840
And don't ever come back!

435
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,160
Get the hell out!

436
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,980
Mom, don't do this.

437
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,760
Uea.

438
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,160
You're a really good employee, you know that?

439
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,280
This time's evaluation....

440
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,820
I'll give you an extra points.

441
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,740
Why did you go into his office?

442
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,280
Who knew...

443
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,760
that you'd be with him privately like that?

444
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,340
King!

445
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,160
What are you trying to say?

446
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,000
If this is how you worried about me, then please don't be, King.

447
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,900
Have you ever felt guilty, mom?

448
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,740
Have you ever cared about my feelings?!

449
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,860
Having you as my son,

450
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,800
brings me so much troubles!

451
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,320
If you didn't exist in my life,

452
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,980
I'd lived well long ago.

453
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,880
I can't believe Mr. Krit do this to you.

454
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,340
Let's tell boss about this.

455
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,880
Whose side do you think boss will take?

456
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
Damn.

457
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,780
But you're the victim.

458
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,140
We all know...

459
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,960
the higher ups are on the same side.

460
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,120
I'm helpless.

461
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,980
What are you going to do?

462
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,820
I'll directly confront him.

463
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:55,980
And ask him to stop.

464
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,140
Um.

465
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,460
Er.

466
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,120
Go for it!

467
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,720
If he won't stop.

468
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,460
I'll face him too.

469
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,660
To let him know that I know his true colors.

470
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
So...

471
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,100
About your family...

472
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,320
I don't want to think about it yet, Jade.

473
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,760
Um.

474
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,740
I'll stay by your side, Uea.

475
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,880
Umm.

476
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,380
Thanks.// Um.

477
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,900
*Typing* Miss you.

478
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,300
[Because if I have to fight you]

479
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,210
[I will give up on this game.]

480
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,340
[It's not fair to continue playing]

481
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:21,480
[because my heart is all yours.]

482
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,780
[If you want to keep going]

483
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,970
[I ask you to please stop.]

484
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,900
[Just let you win since I can't take it anymore.]

485
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,880
[I can't help but fall for you.]

486
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,340
Are you sure you don't wanna sleep at my house?

487
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,700
Um.

488
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,540
I'm getting better.

489
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,540
Really?

490
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,820
Um.

491
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,920
Can I go?

492
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,220
I'll be back quickly.

493
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:22,780
Um!

494
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,140
I'll drop you off.

495
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,200
Give me a sec.

496
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,180
I'm going to the bathroom first. I wanna pee.

497
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,080
Okay.

498
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,040
Um.

499
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,100
Ouch!

500
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,420
Aw.

501
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,860
I'm fine.

502
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,740
Ah.

503
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,480
What is it, Uea?

504
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,780
What do you want?

505
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,680
I've already told you.

506
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,380
Do you realize that...

507
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,020
you're harassing me?

508
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,460
Don't play hard to get.

509
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,400
I can get you a promotion.

510
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,820
You think I'll agree if you help me?

511
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,380
If you don't agree with me,

512
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,620
what else can you do, Uea?

513
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,260
Just wait and see.

514
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,540
No one is here yet?

515
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,450
Hello, Uea.

516
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:28,770
Hey, Jade.

517
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:31,960
Can you go to my table?

518
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,060
Ha?

519
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,600
Just do it.

520
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,420
Go to my table.

521
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:39,840
What is it that you need?

522
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:41,740
Are you coming late?

523
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:43,500
Nah.

524
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,220
Well, do you see a white letter?

525
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,500
Um, yes.

526
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,300
What is this, Uea?

527
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,660
Is it a leave letter?

528
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:07,520
Er...

529
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,250
Take it to HR for me.

530
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,340
What is it, Uea? I'm confused.

531
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,370
Last night...

532
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,930
I called Mr. Krit.

533
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:20,290
But he refused to stop.

534
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,140
I won't tolerate this kind of leader.

535
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,560
But why would you be the one to give up and leave?

536
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,370
I just want to remind him that...

537
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,040
his power...

538
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,280
only works in his place.

539
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,200
He can't do anything to me after I resign.

540
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,480
Please understand, Jade.

541
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,250
Um, I understand.

542
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:45,680
So, where are you?

543
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,570
I'm out of town.

544
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,250
Hey.

545
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,960
I'll contact you after I arrived at the residence.

546
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:58,610
Hey, King.

547
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,720
Hello.

548
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,780
Did you see Uea?

549
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,620
He's not here yet.

550
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,360
How about Jade?

551
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,700
He's going somewhere.

552
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,530
With a stressful face.

553
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:23,720
King. I'm sorry for being rude. I know you're worried. It's my fault to be that impulsive. Thank you for caring about me and for always staying by my side. Thank you for everything. Let's stop being FWB.

554
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,120
King, what's wrong?

555
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,040
You seems upset.

556
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,060
[Because if I have to fight you]

557
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,010
[I will give up on this game.]

558
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,170
[It's not fair to continue playing]

559
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:43,100
[because my heart is all yours.]

560
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,640
[If you want to continue]

561
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,810
[I ask you to please stop.]

562
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:54,780
[Just let you win since I can't take it anymore.]

563
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,120
Do you have any rooms available?

564
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,520
Oh, yes...

565
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,170
I like you.

566
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,370
You also feel the same way, right?

567
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,340
Is my feelings matter?

568
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,220
you'll have to get married any way.

569
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,850
I need everyone's help.

570
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,980
I've sent the video in the office group chat.

571
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,660
Please write down your thoughts after watching.

572
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:25,030
[You and me are just chilling]

573
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,570
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

574
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,740
[I don't wanna be your friend]

575
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:34,940
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

576
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,400
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

577
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,040
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

578
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,620
[I think I has crossed the line]

579
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,860
[You and me are just chilling]

580
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:54,450
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

581
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:57,870
[I don't wanna be your friend]

582
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,080
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

583
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,200
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

584
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:09,750
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

585
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:15,990
[I think I has crossed the line]
