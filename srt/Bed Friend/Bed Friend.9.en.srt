00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,510
Do you have available room for rent?

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,870
Yes, we do.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,520
I like you.

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,710
Do you thinking what I'm thinking?

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,900
Can you give me a chance to hit on you?

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:26,840
I...

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,350
got sexual harassed by my stepdad.

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,880
About your stepdad,

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,200
can I do something with him?

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,420
For the thing you had me to detect,

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,710
Mr.Sorn was more likely to do the sexual harassment.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,170
and this lady...

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,830
She is the latest victim.

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:51,870
Stepdad sent picture

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,330
What're you gonna do?

17
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,300
I didn't lie, mom.

18
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,520
Uncle Son was sexual harassed me.

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,780
Being gay by yourself isn't enough?

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,750
You wanted to blame him for being gay like you?!

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,130
Have you ever felt guilty when you protected him?

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,020
Even when I told you he molested me...

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,090
Molest?!
 Hey.

24
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,810
You're still protecting him.

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,830
Have you ever cared about my feelings?!

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,140
If you didn't exist in my life, I'd lived well long ago.

27
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,220
Uea.

28
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,240
Uea. Don't go!

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,370
Uea, hold on!

30
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,180
Uea...

31
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,130
Please give me some time.

32
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,430
[Detective]

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,740
Yes?

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,310
Mr.King, I have something to tell you.

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,490
For the one that you asked me to detect.

36
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,160
Someone has reported the police and he is arrested now.

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,610
Go go to the police station.

38
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,980
Wait 
 Officer!

39
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,890
I need an evidence. How can you arrested me? 
 Officer Officer Officer!

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,210
Where will you take my husband to?

41
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,480
I do nothing wrong! 
 My husband didn't do anything!

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,090
How can you arrest him since he do nothing wrong? 
 The accuser has an evidence.

43
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,530
Mr.Sorn was sexually harassed her as meant to be legally punished.

44
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,160
What evidence?!

45
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,520
Leave me!

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,660
I didn't do anything!

47
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,790
Leave my husband! 
 I do nothing wrong!

48
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,350
Get him inside!

49
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,680
I'm sorry. Sorry, Miss.

50
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,370
Get him inside/ Leave my husband!

51
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,160
Leave him. Leave him now!

52
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,070
Honey!

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,690
Call the lawyer for me! 
 Stay calm!

54
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,000
I do nothing wrong!

55
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,370
Leave him!

56
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,500
Leave him!

57
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,079
Leave him!

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,980
Leave him!

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,040
Leave him!

60
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,250
Hey! Where are you guys going?!

61
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,510
Leave him!

62
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,829
Leave him...Leave him...

63
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,300
No!!

64
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,140
My husband did nothing wrong.

65
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,200
I never thought that he was being like this. 
 Right.

66
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,010
What are you looking?!

67
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,200
Have you ever seen human, Huh?!

68
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:11,840
Go away!!!

69
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,330
[Is that true we're just friends?]

70
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,200
[but I think we're much more than that.]

71
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,530
[Our friends say that we made like a pack.]

72
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,590
[I don't know what do you feel about me.]

73
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,220
[but I think you have feeling for me.]

74
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,840
[Things between us makes me feel good]

75
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,080
[I don't think I can keep it anymore]

76
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,250
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

77
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,420
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

78
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,500
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

79
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,000
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]

80
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,760
[It's up to you, just say it.]

81
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,160
[I like you.]

82
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,250
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

83
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,040
Hey,

84
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,350
You don't have to be strong,

85
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,520
when you're with me.

86
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,010
I'm not.

87
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,140
I'm just worrying about my sister.

88
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,290
She might be upset.

89
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:34,990
so...

90
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,880
Would you like to see her?

91
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,490
I believe she can get it.

92
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,730
Trust me.

93
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,780
Hmmm.

94
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,380
How was it?

95
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,430
You looked like a Christmas!

96
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,940
Hello~

97
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,770
Let's have some pizza, guys! 
Merry Christmas! This is newly baked.

98
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,300
This pizza restaurant was really nice. Mr.Bas ordered for all of us!

99
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,760
Thank you so much!

100
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,010
Merry Christmas, everyone!

101
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,280
Let's relaxing your eyes and having pizza first! 
 Yeah~

102
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,530
So good!

103
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,230
So happy!

104
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,190
Not too much work. Be chilling!

105
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,820
Woahh! I wanna have it! 
  Hello.

106
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,260
Hello. 
 Oh, hello! Merry Christmas!

107
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,810
Looks so yummy! Pizza looks really nice!

108
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,710
How poor of you.

109
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,210
Wait for your turn,

110
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,750
I'll give you a hard time, Jade.

111
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,600
Oohhh. So tough!

112
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,660
Hm hm?

113
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,300
[Screaming] Oh my god!

114
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Here!

115
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,380
My job might be hard but don't have to work OT everyday like yours...

116
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,150
Calm down. 
 Calm down.

117
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,680
Hey, Calm down.!

118
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,900
Jade. 
 Yes?

119
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,420
Why did you tease him? Don't get the trouble with him.

120
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,820
Today's Christmas Day!

121
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,380
Yes!

122
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,480
Alright. forget it, Muay. Let's have some pizza!

123
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,000
Hmmm

124
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,870
Woo. This looks yummy, so nice!

125
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,350
Woahh. Looks delicious. 
 Faii!

126
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,650
You eat the whole slice? 
 Ah. Of course!

127
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:05,340
It looks so nice 
 Yeah, so delicious.

128
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,120
Gotcha~

129
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,030
Are you looking to each other?

130
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,690
Oops~

131
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,790
I can see you~!

132
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,840
Nosy!

133
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,910
Oops. I'm shy for them.

134
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,820
King, just don't waste your time arguing with Jade.

135
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,320
Save your energy for work.

136
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,520
Umm 
 Umm

137
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,100
Aww. Thought you be brave than this.

138
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,420
but, finally you lose for your work. You'll work overtime for life!

139
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,170
Oops.

140
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,450
What?

141
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,140
I forgot that...

142
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,840
He's your man. Please don't hate me.

143
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,690
Ummm.

144
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,270
What?

145
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,400
Ah.

146
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,590
As he always works overtime,

147
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,920
do you have to wait for him every day?

148
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,350
Nope.

149
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,300
I'm driving myself now.

150
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,470
Hmm.

151
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,970
He's not driving for you any more?

152
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,870
No...I mean...

153
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,970
He has to work so hard.

154
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,300
so, I told him to drive home separately.

155
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,690
Oh, I see.

156
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,480
How poor of you.

157
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,290
Having your man, but not having much time to take care.

158
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,960
Boo!

159
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,550
Then he'll be hit again!

160
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,530
Then, we'll have the New year's holiday! Woo!

161
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,840
So happy, and you work overtime!

162
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,200
OT. OT work OT! 
 Jade.

163
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,680
For the latest campaign,

164
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,580
I've done everything now.

165
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,730
Hm?

166
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,840
If...

167
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,340
If there's anything I could help, just tell me.

168
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,700
Oh.

169
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,080
It's all done.

170
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,750
For the past thing I've done...

171
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,430
I do apologize everyone that

172
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,210
I don't really help you guys.

173
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,330
But, the work was really overloaded.

174
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,420
I'm sorry for slacking off.

175
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,140
From now on...

176
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,690
If you need any help, just tell me so.

177
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,410
Cool cool.

178
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,170
We're in the same team.

179
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,280
New year is upcoming soon. We should forgive each other.

180
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,740
So cool!

181
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,690
Very cool, then.

182
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,850
Hello, every one!

183
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,290
Ah, boss! Hello, sir! 
 Hello, sir!

184
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,850
Merry Christmas, boss!

185
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,040
Are you ready to celebrate?

186
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,730
Of course! 
 so...

187
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,160
Merry Christmas!

188
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,420
Hey!

189
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,770
Yeah~

190
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,910
Merry Christmas!

191
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,410
Everyone let's have some pizza~

192
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,790
Here. Oh!

193
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,470
It's yummy!

194
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,160
Don't tease Jade~!

195
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,910
Huh.

196
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,790
So tired.

197
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,080
Can you give my some encouragement?

198
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,470
Hm?

199
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,080
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?] 
 Please...

200
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,000
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?] 
 You did it again.

201
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,780
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

202
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,160
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]  
 I just need your support.

203
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,210
[It's up to you, just say it.] 
 I worked so hard.

204
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,240
[I like you.]

205
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,080
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

206
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,470
Umm~

207
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,200
Are you okay now? 
 [Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

208
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,890
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

209
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,430
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

210
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,890
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]

211
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,650
Please~

212
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,730
[It's up to you, just say it.]

213
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,710
[I like you.]

214
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,300
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

215
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,630
Er...

216
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,360
How was everything at home?

217
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,300
Actually, not very good.

218
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,130
Mom cries everyday.

219
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,860
Tonkao wants to say sorry for dad.

220
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,080
and for that I can't help you anything.

221
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,990
If Tonkao can do anything for Uea...
 Er...

222
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,920
Tonkao...

223
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,340
Actually, Tonkao was never do anything wrong.

224
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,580
For what you have done is just right/

225
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,470
You're always being a nice sister for me.

226
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,810
Come on.

227
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,290
Let's go study.

228
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,050
If there's anything,

229
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,430
you can always call me. You know it, right?

230
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,680
Alright.

231
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,110
Tonkao will call Uea frequently.

232
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,130
Tonkao gotta go study. 
 Alright.

233
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,470
Bye bye.

234
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,660
Go study.

235
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,819
I love you, Uea.

236
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,510
I love you too, Tonkao.

237
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,790
Let's go study.

238
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,040
Hello, King. 
 Hello.

239
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,560
Tonkao needs you to take care of Uea.

240
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,220
Of course, I will.

241
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,250
so, Tonkao gotta go.

242
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,780
Fighting.

243
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,340
Yeah.

244
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,960
Bye bye. 
 Bye bye.

245
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,120
That's so cute, Mr.Anol.

246
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,140
Could you smile to me like that?

247
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,220
Let me think first.

248
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,030
Just take your time, but not too long.

249
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,170
I mean for considering about our relationship.

250
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,600
I have to look on your behavior first.

251
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,580
Why?

252
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,340
Can't wait any more?

253
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,640
We can go back being just friend 
 Okay. Okay. Okay.

254
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,110
You can take your time as long as you want.

255
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,090
Go ahead.

256
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,030
I'm hungry now.

257
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,500
I will go to eat.

258
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,920
Hey, wait!

259
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,590
Let's go.

260
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,550
Let's go.

261
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,930
Valentine's day

262
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,730
Where're you going today?

263
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,960
Excuse me.

264
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,150
You two are so cute. Do you guys have boyfriend?

265
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,920
Not yet.

266
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:08,930
Oops.

267
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,250
How can you hit me?

268
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,950
He's single.

269
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,800
but, I've already "Dibs".

270
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,090
Um.

271
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,440
Thank you.

272
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,040
Should you be his boyfriend first?

273
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,700
so that you can get jealous on him.

274
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,430
Don't worries, I will be soon.

275
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,830
How confident!

276
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:39,730
Wait!

277
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,400
If King can hit on Uea and be his boyfriend,

278
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,240
It means that Jade...

279
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,590
What?

280
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,690
Don't you forget your words?

281
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:51,920
Huh.

282
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,940
Alright, everyone. If King and Uea have something between them...

283
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,650
I...

284
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,770
I will bark with a dog in front of the office.

285
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,090
If not...

286
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,080
I'll eat dog's food instead.

287
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,360
Deal.

288
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,680
Deal.

289
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,140
[woof-woof]

290
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,470
It means that I won't have to eat dog's food!

291
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,050
but, you! Jade...

292
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,330
When did I say that, hm?

293
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,250
What did I say? I said nothing~

294
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,230
Huh.

295
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,970
Stop dancing around the subject.

296
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,680
I have a witness.

297
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,280
Yeah.

298
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,810
Today's Valentine's Day. I gotta back home fast.

299
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,670
Why don't you back home now?

300
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,570
Jade. 
 Hm?

301
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,810
Are you running away?

302
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,890
I don't runaway.

303
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,120
but you...

304
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,360
might need to celebrate on Valentine's Day as well.

305
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,670
You're not in rush?

306
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,400
Believe it or not, maybe Uea...

307
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,550
might accept you to be his boyfriend~

308
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,150
What're you saying?

309
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,500
I don't know when I'll have a boyfriend.

310
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,490
I wanna get flowers for my man.

311
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,270
Um.

312
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,690
I don't have any boyfriend as well.

313
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,100
so...

314
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,240
Wanna have dinner with me?

315
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,050
No.

316
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,090
No refuse.

317
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:17,550
[Attached Stickers] Um.

318
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,320
For you.

319
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,070
Uea.

320
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,960
Hm?

321
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,020
Wanna have the same as usual?

322
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,100
Um.

323
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,920
I'll buy coffee for you.

324
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,170
Er...

325
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,320
Give me your bag.

326
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,720
Can I give you my heart instead?

327
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,150
Give me your bag~

328
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,490
Hurry up.

329
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,290
Thank you.

330
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,900
I'll meet you up there.

331
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,190
Um.

332
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:56,410
Oops.

333
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,490
I'm so sorry. Are you alright?

334
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,630
It's okay.

335
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,090
I'm so sorry

336
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,310
Are you okay?

337
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,230
Good Morning, Mr.Uea!

338
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,240
Yes?

339
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,810
I... 
 Uea!

340
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,320
Ah, mr.Boom. Good Morning!

341
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,760
Hello, Mr.Jade.

342
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:47,990
I heard that...

343
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,590
Your department is s o hot as on fire!

344
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,670
You must be busy, right?

345
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,330
Well...pretty busy.

346
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,640
Ah. I forgot something in my car. Mr.Jade and Uea can go ahead.

347
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,800
Okay.

348
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,070
Okay.

349
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,120
Why did you come alone?

350
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,430
Where's King?

351
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,070
Buying coffee.

352
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,490
Jade.

353
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,490
Is there anything wrong?

354
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,670
If I don't think that up myself...

355
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,040
Boom might probably interested in you.

356
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,810
Huh?

357
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,110
I don't think so.

358
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,210
I guaranteed!

359
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,200
Hm?

360
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,620
Have Jade already left us?

361
00:25:59,380 --> 00:25:59,860
Hmph!

362
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,300
He doesn't want to bark with Dang, I guess.

363
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,680
Um.

364
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,720
Don't you like it?

365
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,500
Thanks.

366
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,980
Is it refreshing?

367
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,180
Um.

368
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,200
Yesss.

369
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,240
Are you happy now?

370
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,240
I am, Mr. Anol.

371
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,900
Then, I'll go to the bathroom first.

372
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,280
My bag is right here.

373
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,560
Um.

374
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,540
I'll pack your stuffs and wait for you in front of the elevator.

375
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,100
Okay.

376
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,180
Woah.

377
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,560
You wait for him to go back together.

378
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,820
So cute!

379
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,580
You've got a big mouth.

380
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,980
I'm going.

381
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,220
Good bye.

382
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,740
Mr. Uea.

383
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,600
Yesterday is Valentine's day.

384
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,960
But I have work to do.

385
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,820
So I bring you flowers today.

386
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,800
I've been impressed with you since the first time we met.

387
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:46,940
I...

388
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,280
I like you, Mr. Uea.

389
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,720
Err.

390
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,600
I'm sorry.

391
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,940
What I want to say is...

392
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,100
I have a boyfriend.

393
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,360
Ah, yes, congratulations.

394
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,600
Thank you.

395
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,860
Uea.

396
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,560
Who's that?

397
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:47,860
Huh?

398
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,620
What?

399
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,500
Who is...

400
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,700
your boyfriend?

401
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,520
The one I stay with...

402
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,280
is my boyfriend.

403
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,840
It's only me here.

404
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,580
Does that mean...

405
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,700
Aren't you?

406
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,660
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

407
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:42,760
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

408
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,760
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

409
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,360
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]

410
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,420
[It's up to you, just say it.]

411
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,600
[I like you.]

412
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,840
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

413
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,100
Hello.

414
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,740
This is my boyfriend, Uea.

415
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,220
I want to introduce Uea to dad and mom.

416
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,180
Because... I'm determined to be with him.

417
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,600
I don't want to ruin the mood.

418
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,460
About love,

419
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,380
I won't restrict you.

420
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,520
But if it's about work,

421
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,540
you'll have to listen to me.

422
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,200
Go resign, then help me work at our company.

423
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,260
But... 
 There's no "BUT"

424
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,640
That's not it.

425
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,500
I just want to say that all this time...

426
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,620
I might be overbearing.

427
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,260
But I'm also aware of your concern for me.

428
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,500
So I'm not gonna fight with you.

429
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,120
I'm just asking you to respect my decision.

430
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,820
Please?

431
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,820
What if it turns out bad?

432
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,280
If you know I'm concerned, you should understand me.

433
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,580
No matter what happens, I'll accept it all.

434
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,400
Let's give him a chance.

435
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,420
Hey!

436
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,420
Smile for me.

437
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,260
Don't think too much.

438
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,460
I'm used to it.

439
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,220
And you? Are you alright?

440
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,780
Um.

441
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,820
I'm okay.

442
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,680
She has her reasons.

443
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,800
What if it turns out bad?

444
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,040
If you know I'm concerned, you should understand me.

445
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,980
What's wrong?
 I don't know.

446
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,180
I'm going to check.

447
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:10,060
What happened to this wheel?

448
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,179
Why did you get out?

449
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,340
The rain will make you sick.

450
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,679
You can get sick, too, don't you?

451
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,640
I'm...

452
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,860
healthy.

453
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,960
You're soaking wet!

454
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,580
I'll leave the car here.

455
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,640
Huh?

456
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,760
I'll have someone pick it up.

457
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,560
So... who is healthy again?

458
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,940
I caught a cold because...

459
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,460
I want your attention.

460
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,880
If you're not getting better,

461
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,000
I'll take you to the hospital.

462
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,600
Are you hungry?

463
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,700
It's almost morning.

464
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,600
What do you want to eat?

465
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,700
Can I have you?

466
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,320
Then I'll decide for you.

467
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,980
I wanna eat congee with pork balls.

468
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,040
I wanna eat it!

469
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,760
I wannaaa.

470
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:13,940
Um.

471
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,280
(Mom)

472
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,460
King.

473
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,020
King!

474
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,160
Hello.

475
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,660
King, I have something...
 Er.

476
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,940
Aunt.

477
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,300
Hello, this is Uea.

478
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,480
King is sick.

479
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,840
What happened?!

480
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,820
He has a fever and is sleeping right now.

481
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,820
How bad is it?

482
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,960
His fever is high, but...

483
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,740
if he's not getting better, I'll take him to the doctor.

484
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,460
Okay. Take care of him for me, Uea.

485
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:22,700
I will.

486
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,300
While you were sleeping,

487
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,800
your mom called.

488
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,820
She seems to be very worried.

489
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,720
Um, I'll call her back.

490
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,320
Hm.

491
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,060
Where are you going?

492
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,060
I'll wash the dishes and clean the kitchen.

493
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,060
In case your mom came over.

494
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,060
Don't go.

495
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,420
I can't sleep without you.

496
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,320
She won't come.

497
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,260
If you don't feel good, just go to sleep, King.

498
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,320
Hello.

499
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,120
Why are you here?

500
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,560
Uea told me you're sick.

501
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,840
So I come to take a look.

502
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,300
It's not serious.

503
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,220
And Uea treated me well.

504
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,380
Never mind, Uea.

505
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,500
I'll look after him.

506
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,580
Hmm.

507
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,740
Hey! With this much energy, you must be fine now.

508
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,000
Hm.

509
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,080
Don't be stubborn.

510
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm the same as you.

511
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,640
Is that it?

512
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,340
Are you the one who asked me for a chance yesterday?

513
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,200
Yes.

514
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,240
That's me.

515
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,040
I just want my boyfriend's attention.

516
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,860
What you said, I've thought about it.

517
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,100
I'll give you that chance.

518
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,260
If one day

519
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,120
you have problems,

520
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,360
don't forget that...

521
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,260
you have a family

522
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,000
that will always be by your side.

523
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,520
Yes, mom.

524
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,420
Alright, bed time.

525
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,380
I appreciate how you took a good care of King.

526
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,500
Ah, no problem at all.

527
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,840
Uh, have you eaten yet?

528
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,200
King calls me mom.

529
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,360
You should do that too.

530
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,480
Yes... mom.

531
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,100
Is there anything you want to eat?

532
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,100
It's alright.

533
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:05,920
From now on,

534
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,800
please look after King for me, Uea.

535
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,380
Yes.

536
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,900
I promise I'll do my best.

537
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,220
I'll propose to Uea next month.

538
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,160
Both of my friends are going to settle down! *sob*

539
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,760
I want to love someone

540
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,660
and take care of him for the rest of my life.

541
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,540
Did you think it over?

542
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,020
I'm certain

543
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,920
that Uea is the love of my life.

544
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,310
[You and me are just chilling]

545
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,840
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

546
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,750
[I don't wanna be your friend]

547
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:18,300
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

548
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,320
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

549
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,370
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

550
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,810
[I think I has crossed the line]

551
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:34,320
[You and me are just chilling]

552
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:37,830
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

553
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,720
[I don't wanna be your friend]

554
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:44,430
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

555
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,430
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

556
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:53,220
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

557
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:59,450
[I think I has crossed the line]
