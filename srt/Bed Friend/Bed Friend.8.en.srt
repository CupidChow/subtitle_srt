You're a really good employee, you know that?

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,330
This time's evaluation....

4
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,290
I'll give you extra points.

5
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,050
Why did you go inside his office?

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,650
What do you have in mind?

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,770
You two were staying face to face.// King!

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,730
If you talk to me like that...

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,690
you can't even be my friend!

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,050
Is he your new hubby?

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,210
I'm okay if you're with this man.

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,770
Lampang City train station.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,010
Lampang City

14
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,170
What would you like to order?....

15
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,370
Hello, auntie.

16
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,090
Uea.

17
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,930
Is it really you?

18
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,170
Uea.

19
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,650
Look at you...

20
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,690
You are really my Uea.

21
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,090
Can I hug you?

22
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,610
Poor boy.

23
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,850
What's wrong?

24
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,410
I thought I saw an illusion.

25
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,970
Why didn't you tell me before coming?

26
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,370
Um... so

27
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,690
I...

28
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,210
I'm afraid that you...// Um.

29
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,770
You're my nephew!

30
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,329
Even though your mom and I....

31
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,530
Any way,

32
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,930
it's still the same for us.

33
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,970
Have you told anyone that you came here?

34
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,530
Oh, I told Jade.

35
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,490
Good. So he won't be worried.

36
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,210
Yes.

37
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,770
Uh, auntie.

38
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,290
Hm? What is it?

39
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,370
Is it possible... if I stay here for a while?

40
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,930
Of course!

41
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,090
Uea.

42
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,530
This is also your home.

43
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,890
You can stay as long as you like.

44
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,570
Thank you.

45
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,930
Hahaha.

46
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,450
I always miss you.

47
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:21,000
[King.I'm sorry for being rude.
I know you're worried. It's my fault to be that impulsive.
Thank you for caring about me.Thank you for everything.]
[Let's stop being FWB.]

48
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,100
King, Jade is here.

49
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,580
Hey!

50
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,060
Jade, where is Uea?

51
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,100
Uea...// What?

52
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,580
He's already resigned.

53
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,260
Is it true?

54
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,540
Sorry, the number you've dialed cannot be connected.

55
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,780
Tell me everything.

56
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
Why did he resign?

57
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,060
Mr. Krit went to his mom's house yesterday.

58
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,700
He rushed home after knowing about it.

59
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,900
And had a fight with his mom.

60
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,380
Krit.

61
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,270
Um, Uea can't bear it anymore.

62
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,460
As you can see,

63
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,070
He called and told me that he's going to resign this morning.

64
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,780
And he'll be out of town for quite a while.

65
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,620
Sorry, the number you've dialed cannot be connected at this time.

66
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,140
Why don't you answer?

67
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,760
Why did you go inside his office?

68
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,800
What do you have in mind?

69
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,340
How do I know?

70
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,080
You two were staying face to face.

71
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,610
King!

72
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,260
What do you mean?!

73
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,630
Why?

74
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,340
Are you mad at me?

75
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,080
If you talk to me like that,

76
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,700
you can't even be my friend, King!

77
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,650
Wait, Uea.

78
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,530
[Is that true we're just friends?]

79
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,580
[but I think we're much more than that.]

80
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,200
[Our friends say that we made like a pack.]

81
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,660
[I don't know what do you feel about me.]

82
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,860
[but I think you have feeling for me.]

83
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,190
[Things between us makes me feel good]

84
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,350
[I don't think I can keep it anymore]

85
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,520
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

86
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:46,050
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

87
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,750
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

88
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,320
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]

89
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,600
[It's up to you, just say it.]

90
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,490
[I like you.]

91
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,160
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

92
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,700
Wat Phra That Lampang Luang.

93
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,230
Lampang City

94
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,150
Do you have any rooms available?

95
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,520
Oh, yes...

96
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,670
Hold on!

97
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,880
Where are you going?

98
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,300
I'm going to find him.

99
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,250
You won't be able to catch the plane in time.

100
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,020
I'm sure he's arrived already.

101
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,690
Do you expect me to do nothing?

102
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,870
Wait!

103
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,150
Why are you this angry?

104
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,090
Is there anything you're hiding from me?

105
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,910
Silent...

106
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,940
You really have something!

107
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,310
King.

108
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,680
Answer me.

109
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,320
Yeah.

110
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,120
What have you done?

111
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,450
It's the thing between us.

112
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,380
You mean...

113
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,260
you two are... together?

114
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,420
No.

115
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,530
I'm...

116
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,100
his friend with benefits.

117
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,390
Friend with benefits.

118
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,070
Which is...

119
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,700
Bed friend.

120
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,710
Sh*t!

121
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,260
This is not funny.

122
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,870
You idiot!

123
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,700
You give me headaches!

124
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,920
Can you scold me later?

125
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,630
Help me think first.

126
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,460
I'm serious about Uea.

127
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,990
I wanna talk to him.

128
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,870
Ouch!

129
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,760
Why the heck did you go to the blind date then?!

130
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,160
Uea must believe that you're not serious.

131
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,300
I'll explain it to him.

132
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,510
But do you know...

133
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,840
where he is now?

134
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,270
Um.

135
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,210
Jade.

136
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,870
With Uea...

137
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,140
I'm serious.

138
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,560
Please help me.

139
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,430
Please?

140
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,040
I'm begging you.

141
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,340
Fine!

142
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,240
He went to stay with his aunt at Lampang.

143
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,570
Wait!

144
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,330
Are you going right now?

145
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,600
I'll go.

146
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,490
But I'll deal with Krit first.

147
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,700
Why did you come?

148
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,620
To find you.

149
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,190
I want you to understand.

150
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,750
I'm not putting the blame on you.

151
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,240
I just...

152
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,250
It's my fault.

153
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,340
That I...

154
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,220
I was rude to you first.

155
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,140
I...

156
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,080
I'm sorry.

157
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,750
It's not that I'm mad at you.

158
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,860
I'm just jealous

159
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,840
and possessive.

160
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,590
Um.

161
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,710
Uea.

162
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,130
I like you.

163
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,340
[You and me are just chilling]

164
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,510
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

165
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,750
[I don't wanna be your friend]

166
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,940
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

167
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,400
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

168
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,060
You also feel the same way, right?

169
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,420
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

170
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,000
Is my feelings matter?

171
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,780
you'll have to get married any way.

172
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,740
Who told you that?

173
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,940
It's...

174
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,590
because you went to the blind date.

175
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,110
It's already ended.

176
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,280
I've told everyone.

177
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,790
If you have anything, we'll talk about it at home.

178
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,830
No.

179
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,730
Belle and I have reached an agreement.

180
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,500
That I'll explain it to you all.

181
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:26,960
We...

182
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,210
won't get married.

183
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,940
That's right.

184
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,050
We want to marry the one we love.

185
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,810
What if the one you choose is bad?

186
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,700
So how could you know...

187
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,710
that King and I are compatible?

188
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,340
I just to live my own life, mom.

189
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,680
I'm sorry, everyone.

190
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,100
But marriage is between two people.

191
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,380
Please understand us.

192
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,290
King!

193
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,990
So... can you give me a chance?

194
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:41,900
And...

195
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,910
How about your parents?

196
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,440
I'll do everything for you.

197
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:54,570
Uea.

198
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,130
I can stop being your FWB.

199
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,890
Can you still remember our bet?

200
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,849
If you lose,

201
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,990
you'll do what I ask.

202
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:22,730
Uh-huh.

203
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,859
Can I ask for a chance to make a move?

204
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,350
I know you don't like a player.

205
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,090
But do you remember what I said?

206
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,270
If I love someone,

207
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,710
I'll definitely be good to him.

208
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,320
Uea.

209
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,910
With you, I'm serious.

210
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,100
And I promised...

211
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,150
I won't ever hurt you.

212
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,270
You...

213
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,990
Are you sure?

214
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,620
I'll prove it.

215
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,760
That I really like you.

216
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,720
Um.

217
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,550
But...

218
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,550
We'll only be seeing each other.

219
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,760
I don't want to tie you down.

220
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,480
I'll try my best to make you believe me.

221
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,160
I wanna tell you that...

222
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,210
I've never feel like this towards anyone...

223
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,680
as I'm feeling with you.

224
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,850
Hold on.

225
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,590
During this period,

226
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,110
you're not allowed to touch me.

227
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,790
If I'm not willing.

228
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,250
What?

229
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,710
We're just seeing each other!

230
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:43,960
Can I kiss you?

231
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,550
No.

232
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,350
Hug?

233
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,050
No.

234
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,750
Hold hands?

235
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,620
If I don't allow, then you can't.

236
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,710
Woah.// Why?

237
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,590
If you disagree, we can call it quits.// No!

238
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,460
I didn't say that I disagree.

239
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,770
But can I hug you right now?

240
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,670
Any way,

241
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,260
with this status,

242
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,190
I should be able to ask you out, right?

243
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,130
NO.

244
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,440
No problem.

245
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,680
Enough!

246
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,690
Hey, just a little.

247
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,400
What did I say?

248
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,770
We're just seeing each other.

249
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,310
I'm already happy with just this.

250
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,860
Wat Phra That Lampang Luang

251
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,390
[Is that true we're just friends?]

252
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,440
[but I think we're much more than that.]

253
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,060
[Our friends say that we made like a pack.]

254
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,520
[I don't know what do you feel about me.]

255
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,720
[but I think you have feeling for me.]

256
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,050
[Things between us makes me feel good]

257
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,210
[I don't think I can keep it anymore]

258
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,380
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

259
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:35,910
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

260
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,610
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

261
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,180
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]

262
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,460
[It's up to you, just say it.]

263
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,350
[I like you.]

264
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,020
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

265
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,590
Keep going, we're almost there.

266
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,540
[Are you becoming lonely with no reason?]

267
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,900
[I fluttered when we were closed.]

268
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,390
[Am I addicted to you?]

269
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,790
[Things between us makes me feel good]

270
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,270
[I don't think I can keep it anymore.]

271
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,580
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

272
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,450
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

273
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,480
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

274
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,180
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]

275
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,740
[It's up to you, just say it.]

276
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,960
[I like you.]

277
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,980
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

278
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,560
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

279
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:12,160
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

280
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,880
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

281
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,410
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]

282
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,100
[It's up to you, just say it.]

283
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,610
[I like you.]

284
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:29,160
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

285
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,930
[I like you, but don't wanna be just your friend.]

286
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,960
When will you go back?

287
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,640
I'm going back with you.

288
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,070
I haven't decide when I'll be back yet.

289
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,580
And I resigned.

290
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,620
Who says that you resigned?

291
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,800
Jade haven't sent your resignation letter.

292
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,600
Go back with me.

293
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,560
But I don't want to meet Krit anymore.

294
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,680
Don't worry.

295
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,020
No one can hurt you from now on.

296
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,450
You're a really good employee, you know that?

297
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,450
This time's evaluation....

298
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,360
I'll give you extra points.

299
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,810
Sorry, sir.

300
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,230
I don't wanna mess up with wrong things.

301
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,440
Just do your work as a good boss.

302
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,230
But I don't wanna be just your boss.

303
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,270
Ah!

304
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,280
Mr. Krit!

305
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,280
Mr. Krit!

306
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,740
I like you, Uea.

307
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:39,750
Mr. Krit!

308
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,590
Help me!

309
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,210
Everyone.

310
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,710
I need everyone's help.

311
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,320
I've sent the video in the office group chat.

312
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,870
Please write down your thoughts after watching.

313
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,440
Ah!

314
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,450
Mr. Krit!

315
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,560
Mr. Krit!

316
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,710
Help me!

317
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,320
Um. Ouch.

318
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,670
This behavior is inappropriate.

319
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,280
I don't like a rapist boss.

320
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,640
It's terrible. Don't bully the weak!

321
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,080
He must be punished.

322
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,230
What are you guys doing?

323
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,830
Don't worry.

324
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,040
I won't do something in the dark like you.

325
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,610
You reap what you sow.

326
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,290
Ah!

327
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,260
Mr. Krit!

328
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,410
Help me!

329
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,980
Can you report him to the HR?

330
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,140
Come with me.

331
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,200
I'll go too.

332
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:21,920
Ah?

333
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,420
Is something wrong?

334
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,160
Here.

335
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,280
What happened?

336
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,280
Tell me the story.

337
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,550
My friend, Uea, from the graphic team...

338
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,840
was harassed by Mr. Krit for several times.

339
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,230
He invaded his privacy.

340
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,230
And went to his house without permission.

341
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,880
Please see the video for yourself, Boss.

342
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,900
Then you'll realize your nephew's true color.

343
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,190
Ah!

344
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,270
Mr. Krit!

345
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,390
Mr. Krit!

346
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,440
Help me!

347
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,920
I hope you handle it with extreme caution.

348
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,480
I'll deal with it as soon as possible.

349
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,720
And...

350
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,700
There's also Mongkol.

351
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,960
He always refuse to work.

352
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,490
Like...

353
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,240
He let us do all the work.

354
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,960
and didn't help with anything.

355
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,080
I had no idea about this.

356
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,400
Have you ever tried to talk to him?

357
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,570
Yes.

358
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,410
But I didn't want to make a fuss,

359
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,410
so I didn't file a report to the manager.

360
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,480
It doesn't matter if it becomes a fuss.

361
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,480
He must be responsible for his job.

362
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,870
Even if he's my relative,

363
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:05,460
he has no privileges in this office.

364
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,310
Yes, sir.

365
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,200
I'll take care of both issues, so don't worry.

366
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,640
Thank you.

367
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,830
He's already left.

368
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,090
So...

369
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,960
Can you go back with me?

370
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:45,600
Uea.

371
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,070
After this,

372
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,360
I'll look after you.

373
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:05,960
But...

374
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,320
I still...// If you're not ready,

375
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,800
I'll wait for you.

376
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:23,590
Then,

377
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,040
Let's go back.

378
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:27,960
Back to your aunt's house?

379
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,420
Back to work with you!

380
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,050
Um?

381
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,660
I'll keep my promise.

382
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,010
Hm.

383
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,990
Let's go.

384
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,030
Did you see the harassment policy issued by HR?

385
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,550
Um.

386
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,570
That's blast!

387
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,160
Nailed it! // Hmm

388
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
That's good.

389
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,310
The harassment won't happen again.

390
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,720
I don't wanna think that

391
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,140
what if the big boss is on his nephew's side...

392
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,060
we'd probably find the new job! // Woahh. That's thrilling me!

393
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,220
Oops.

394
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,730
Anyway..

395
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,010
I'd like to say thank you

396
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,910
for you two that helped me.

397
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,290
Ummmm.

398
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,680
Uea, It's my pleasure.

399
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,110
We're colleagues. It's our pleasure.  // Right!

400
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,760
Family have to help their members.

401
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,900
Like Addams family?

402
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,640
Woahh. Do you wanna tricked by me? // You're always naughty!

403
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,660
What a naughty boy. // Umm.

404
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:58,980
I see it.

405
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,380
See what?

406
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,010
For these Ichitan you bought for us...

407
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,330
can't change my friend's mind.

408
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,510
Oops. What happened for this couple?

409
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,130
Whether you like it or not,

410
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,340
we're seeing each other now.

411
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,900
Awww. // Really, Uea?

412
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,060
Really? Uea?

413
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,880
Oh my goshhh.

414
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,540
Is that true?

415
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,310
Oops. Is it true?

416
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,520
Huh? // Ah....

417
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,190
Umm.

418
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,440
[scream] My goodness!

419
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,100
I'm so shy for him.

420
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,790
Omg Omg Omg

421
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,460
I can't tell you nothing. Hm.

422
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:43,340
Hmm. You have to be happy for them. // Yeah!

423
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,199
I gotta go back to work.

424
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:47,469
See you later.

425
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,280
Alright!

426
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,239
Ooh. So cute couple.

427
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,870
Mr.Anol, the big boss wanted to meet you.

428
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,489
Ooh // Huh.

429
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,639
Please come this way.

430
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:57,830
Er...

431
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,100
Alright.

432
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,470
Do you want me to go with you?

433
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:02,720
It's okay.

434
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:15,770
What happened now? // Should we go with him?

435
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,280
I do apologize for the situation...

436
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,880
that happened with you.

437
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,990
I've already took action with Krit.

438
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,210
Thank you, sir.

439
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,340
You don't have to say thank you.

440
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,590
It's my pleasure to do as a boss.

441
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,450
Here.

442
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,290
If you don't feel alright,

443
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,720
you could see the psychiatrist.

444
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,150
For Mongkol thing,

445
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,930
I had my last word with him.

446
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,590
If he won't change his behaviour, won't do anything...

447
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,240
I have to lay him off.

448
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,330
Thank you very much, boss.

449
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,040
Thank you so much.

450
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,740
You looked so stressed.

451
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,820
You could share your work to me.

452
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,410
Jade.

453
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,420
You talked like this again.

454
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,370
I'm working so I looked stressful.

455
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,000
I just wanna help you.

456
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,910
You didn't send the resignation letter so that's why I'm still here.

457
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,780
Then, stop worrying too much.

458
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,350
Umm.

459
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,540
Graphics team,

460
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,320
Who's available now?

461
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,960
The market team wants us to change the banner of new campaign.

462
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,170
In urgent.

463
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,200
Ah...

464
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,830
I'll do it.

465
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,240
I'll be responsible for this.

466
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,300
Are you sure?

467
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,190
Yes, I am.

468
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:38,960
Okay, so...

469
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,300
I need it urgently. // I'll take care of it, sir.

470
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,720
Hmmm, Mongkol...

471
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,180
You looked so concentrated recently.

472
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,000
Don't you have your job?

473
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,840
Go away from me. I'm working on it.

474
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,190
Yes, sir.

475
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,920
You're really...

476
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,030
One more word, then I'll stop working.

477
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,970
Hmmm.

478
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,020
If you need my help,

479
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,050
you can always asked me for it.

480
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:13,900
Yes, that's right.

481
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,080
If you need any hand, just ask me.

482
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,720
Yeah, thank you everyone!

483
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,540
But I can do it!

484
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,280
Fighting! Woo!

485
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,160
Fighting!

486
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,550
Let's do it!

487
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,730
Woo!

488
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,760
Uea.

489
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
What makes you smile?

490
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,700
Why?

491
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,320
I can't smile?

492
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,980
Please drink.

493
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,210
I bought for you.

494
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,970
Just go keep smiling away from me.

495
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,610
I wanna take you to my place.

496
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,300
Hm.

497
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,500
May I kiss you?

498
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,400
We're outside now!

499
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,360
so, if it's not outside...

500
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,230
I can kiss you?

501
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,660
You said you can wait.

502
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,430
I am.

503
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,640
So...

504
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,260
Can you wait for 3 years?

505
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,360
Just tell me when,

506
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,540
I'll always wait for you.

507
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,470
Can I sleep with you tonight?

508
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,670
No way.

509
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,530
I didn't wanna have...// King

510
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,530
It's just sleep.

511
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,670
Please~

512
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,800
Ahhh.

513
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,430
It's up to you.

514
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,480
So, why did you sit over there?

515
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,350
Because I'm beautiful.

516
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,250
Why?

517
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,010
I'm not beautiful?

518
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,350
Here.

519
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,320
Um.

520
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,210
Don't sleep with that stressful gesture.

521
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,170
Why do you lay down like that?

522
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,470
so...

523
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,930
May I hold your hand?

524
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:24,720
Um.

525
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,000
I allow.

526
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,360
for next time.

527
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,790
What?

528
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,380
Why?

529
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,460
Ummm.

530
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,100
Where're you going, Mr.Anol?

531
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,160
Taking a medicine.

532
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,350
You have a fever? Uea?

533
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,060
Er.

534
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,100
Your body temp is normal.

535
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,180
or air allergy?

536
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,090
No.

537
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,050
so...

538
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,710
You knew I had a stepdad, right?

539
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,140
Um.

540
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,000
Actually, I don't wanna tell anyone.

541
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:42,710
Because at last,

542
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,390
I can't do nothing with it.

543
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,130
No way.

544
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,610
We can fix it.

545
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:13,240
Every cloud has a silver lining.

546
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,040
Are you okay?

547
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,940
to talk about that to me?

548
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:52,800
I...

549
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,670
got sexual harassed by my stepdad.

550
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:07,450
But,

551
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,320
I've already told my mom.

552
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:21,870
She...

553
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,440
never believe me.

554
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:33,430
That's why...

555
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,600
I don't wanna go back home.

556
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,840
And I felt that,

557
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,500
Everyday in my life was so hard to get through.

558
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,520
I came to see the psychiatrist.

559
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,670
And you knew right?

560
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,920
That I fear of the darkness.

561
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,600
Um.

562
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,910
I have to take the medicine.

563
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,160
To make my Mental health be stable.

564
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,320
Thank you for revealing to me.

565
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,130
I wanna tell you that,

566
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,930
I'll always be by your side.

567
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,920
If you have anything to tell me,

568
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:11,860
just say it out.

569
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,050
Uea.

570
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:14,520
Uea.

571
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:18,970
For the thing you told me,

572
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:21,700
I don't feel okay about it.

573
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,580
Can I do something with it?

574
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,950
What you're gonna do?

575
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:32,470
About your stepdad,

576
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,500
can I do something with him?

577
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,750
Um.

578
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:59,210
For the thing you had me to detect,

579
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:02,600
Mr.Sorn was more likely to do the sexual harassment.

580
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,760
and this lady is the latest victim.

581
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,790
She worked at the restaurant.

582
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,920
Thank you so much.

583
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,520
For helping us.

584
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,570
My pleasure.

585
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,790
I want to see that bastard get the punishment.

586
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,450
I really don't know how to do this.

587
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,080
I do apologize for him.

588
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,320
Please let me fix this right.

589
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:47,320
I really need your help for this.

590
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:49,750
As a victim,

591
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,400
we just only need the justice.

592
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,770
Hey, you! // Where will you take my husband to?!

593
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,020
I didn't do anything wrong!

594
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,190
If I don't think that up myself...

595
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,860
Boom might probably interested in you.

596
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,830
I...

597
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,580
I like you, Mr.Uea.

598
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,080
Go resign, then help me work at our company.

599
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,880
But... // There's no "BUT"

600
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,080
If you know that I worry about you...

601
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,810
You must understand me.

602
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:45,140
[You and me are just chilling]

603
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,670
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

604
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:51,580
[I don't wanna be your friend]

605
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,130
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

606
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:58,150
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

607
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:04,200
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

608
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:07,640
[I think I has crossed the line]

609
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,150
[You and me are just chilling]

610
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,660
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

611
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:17,550
[I don't wanna be your friend]

612
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:21,260
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

613
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,260
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

614
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:30,050
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

615
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:36,280
[I think I has crossed the line]
