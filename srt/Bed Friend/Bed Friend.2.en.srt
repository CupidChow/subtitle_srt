2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,760
Uea! Wait for me!

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,910
Um!

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,150
Again?

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,000
Need help?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,540
Sure. Can you get f* out of my face?

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,540
Do you have feelings for me?

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,970
I'm surprised you worked overtime with me.

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,450
Is this a couple shirt?

10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,200
Shut up!

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,630
I'm Pock's boyfriend.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,790
Who are you?

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,800
Don't end the call! Let me can explain.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,360
If you end it I swear I'll not stop easily, Uea.

15
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,150
I broke up with Pock.

16
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,480
You just have a bad luck meeting an asshole like him.

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,140
It's good that you moved on.

18
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,210
I won't carry you even if you pass out.

19
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,480
Gun!!/ Hey, hey!

20
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,050
I don't want to be alone.

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,160
Embrace me all night...

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:49,820
Please?

23
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,300
You didn't talk to me...

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,810
and avoid seeing me.

25
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,660
I didn't.

26
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,400
I just don't have anything to say.

27
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,770
Because it was me?

28
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,660
Just forget it

29
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,290
and I hope that...

30
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,790
you'll never bring this up again.

31
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:11,740
Uea!

32
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:12,960
Huh?

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,420
I was so worried when you called me!

34
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,420
Umm... I'm fine.

35
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,940
So, how will you go home today?

36
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,430
Hmm

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,620
I guess...

38
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,640
I'll take a taxi home.

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,300
You...

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,329
Are you okay?

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,310
I'm just worried.

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,470
Uea!

43
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,500
Uea!

44
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,630
Uea!

45
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,140
Keep quiet.

46
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,300
Uea!

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,300
Rak told me you haven't sent the latest mail.

48
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,980
Can you send it again?

49
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,560
Oh

50
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,890
Hm?

51
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,680
Sure! Let's go!

52
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,030
King.

53
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,700
King!

54
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,850
Can you help me with this?

55
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,960
Just click here.

56
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,520
Uea, it differs from what we're expected to do.

57
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,450
Uea!

58
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,200
Huh?

59
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,520
it differs from the brief.

60
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,450
Here.

61
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,830
I'll be right back.

62
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,740
Hm?

63
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,650
Hello?

64
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,590
Hello. Are you miss Thida's relative?

65
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,300
Yes, I am

66
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,300
We're from the hospital.

67
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,900
Miss Thida had an accident and she is injured.

68
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,820
Got it, I'll be there as soon as I can.

69
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:32,970
Jade!

70
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,100
I can't work overtime today.

71
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,830
My mother is in the hospital.

72
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,770
I'm so sorry.

73
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,930
Come on. Get in!

74
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,250
Hurry up!

75
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,030
Mom!

76
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,020
Ha!

77
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,560
What took you so long?

78
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,980
Give me the money. I'll go home myself.

79
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,560
I'll take you home.

80
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,690
Don't.

81
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,690
Just give me the money.

82
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,440
See?

83
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,590
If you were home, I wouldn't have been hurt like this!

84
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,370
And what the f* is wrong with you?

85
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,370
Why didn't you answer my calls?

86
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,180
Huh?

87
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,170
Who is this? You know him?

88
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,690
He's my coworker.

89
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,730
My car is in the service center,

90
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,230
so he gave me a ride.

91
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,010
Your friend?

92
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,390
Or your new hubby, exactly?

93
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,290
Is he wealthy?

94
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,640
Hm?

95
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,270
Hello, aunt.

96
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,870
Hello there.

97
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,480
Ah... Are you Uea's boyfriend?

98
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,120
Hm?

99
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,360
Err...

100
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,380
I'm Uea's friend.

101
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,560
Oh, really?

102
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,550
And I was thinking...

103
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,560
Um... Can I call a taxi for you?

104
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
No, I'll do it for you.

105
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,680
Never mind.

106
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,430
Enough!

107
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,610
Give me the money. I'll go home myself

108
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,870
Give me the money! I'll go home by myself!

109
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,330
This is all?

110
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,080
How could this be enough?

111
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,530
This is Bangkok. The traffic here is really bad.

112
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,650
Then...

113
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,140
I'll get the cash from the ATM over there.

114
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,800
Um!

115
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:00,830
Don't worry.

116
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,180
Please take it.

117
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,870
It's alright.

118
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,580
Please consider it a consolation.

119
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,320
Haha.

120
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,660

And you. Don't forget to go home.

124
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,920
You heard it all, aren't you?

125
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,300
About what?

126
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,740
What my mom said.

127
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,620
Um.

128
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,570

129
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,280

Uea.

132
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,780
About that night...

133
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,310
Er...

134
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,670
I'm sorry about that too.

135
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,230
Sorry for avoiding you.

136
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,500

It's just...

139
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,520
I was confused.

140
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,720
I understand.

141
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,020
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,880
I'm not mad at you anymore,

but I'm upset with myself.

144
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,200
If you're gonna upset with yourself,

145
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,300
you better be mad at me.

146
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,570

Am I not allow to look at my coworker?

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,430
Some Sexual Transmitted Disorders...

196
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,540
might not show the signs immediately.

197
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,900
Everything's done.

198
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,310
The result will be shown within an hour.

199
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,590
Thank you.

200
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,810
Why are you embarrassed?

201
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,500
We didn't do anything wrong.

202
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,820
[It's okay]

203
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,970
Keep calm.

204
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,140
Um.

205
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,300
I always have a protection.

206
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,920
and always have a blood test.

207
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,180
The result will be shown soon.

208
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,470
We have the result already.

209
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,960
Please go inside the diagnosis room.

210
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,540
How was the result?

211
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,430
How about you?

212
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,280
Negative of course.

213
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,870
Don't worry, Be happy.

214
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,050
How about yours?

215
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,030
Negative.

216
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,610
Look at your face.

217
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,670
You should be relieved now.

218
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,690
I'll come with you again next time.

219
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,530
Smile for me first.

220
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,680
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT!

221
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,170
Ah.

222
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,380
That's fine, No smile.

223
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,810
but you gotta treat me to a meal.

224
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,610
What do you wanna eat?

225
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,120
I can choose?

226
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,350
Sure.

227
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,240
Why not?

228
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,860
You force me to come here.

229
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,630
Do I have the choice?

230
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,780
Come on!

231
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,580
I'll treat you.

232
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:13,880
Why?

233
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,550
Well...

234
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,820
Redeem my mistake.

235
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,770
Let's say...

236
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,250
If you don't choose,

237
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,580
I will.

238
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,830
Let's eat here.

239
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,460
Choose anything you want.

240
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,760
It's on me.

241
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,100
Let's share the bill.

242
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,470
I don't want to owe you.

243
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,970
What a stubborn!

244
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,300
Hello.

245
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,510
Can I have Stir-fried Rice Noodles with Chicken please?

246
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,320
and can I have Stir-fried beef with bird's eye chilies please?

247
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,970
and

248
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,180
just a little bit spicy on this menu, please.

249
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,090
I remembered you don't like spicy.

250
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,230
That's all.

251
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,040
Thank you.

252
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:42,920
Sh*t.

253
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,730
Pock.

254
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,780
Er.

255
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,150
Excuse me

256
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,050
Why did you do that?

257
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,500
We should eat quickly.

258
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,400
so we can leave.

259
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,000
Heyyy.

260
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,180
You invited me to your home?

261
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,610
What's wrong?

262
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,740
What's on your mind?

263
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,650
Butt out.

264
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,200
Is he your ex?

265
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,660
Um.

266
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,960
Why are you upset?

267
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,700
F* that shit.

268
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,400
A person like you...

269
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,760
could find a lover far better than that.

270
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,000
King.

271
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,010
Why aren't most people feel enough with what they have?

272
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,000
Are you talking about your ex-boyfriend?

273
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,690
People have different nature.

274
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,700
And it's hard to fix.

275
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,450
How about you?

276
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,520
Wait, wait, wait!

277
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,220
Don't count me in on that sh*t!

278
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,390
When I date someone, I never cheat.

279
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,050
Then why was that guy running wild in our office?

280
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,400
Isn't he your boyfriend?

281
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,400
Of course not!

282
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,730
Frankly speaking,

283
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,600
ever since I graduated from the university,

284
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,680
I didn't date anyone.

285
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,110
I only had one night stand.

286
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,340
Even with someone you don't love?

287
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,450
Um.

288
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,340
Just like our last night.

289
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,170
But for me,

290
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,820
love and sex...

291
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,880
don't need to come together.

292
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,980
You're scolding me in your head, aren't you?

293
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,690
Forget it.

294
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,260
We just have different point of views.

295
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:47,970
I'm single.

296
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,360
So I'm free to do whatever I want.

297
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,610
But If I'm gonna take someone seriously...

298
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,470
I'll only have eyes for that person.

299
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,520
Can a player really stop being flirty?

300
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,310
You have to try if you wanna know, Uea.

301
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,190
King.

302
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,120
This isn't the way to my condominium.

303
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,080
Come on. It won't take long.

304
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,130
Isn't the atmosphere nice?

305
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,450
Why did you bring me here?

306
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,250
Because of you.

307
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,120
Stop frowning.

308
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,780
See?

309
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,890
You're frowning again.

310
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,580
What's wrong with you?

311
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,160
Uea.

312
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,260
Will you scold me if I say this?

313
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,000
Say what?

314
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,520
That night...

315
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,620
Never mind!

316
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,440
Say it.

317
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,330
I think that...

318
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,650
it's a wonderful night.

319
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:16,900
And?

320
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,710
I'll honestly say that...

321
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,880
if it wasn't you,

322
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,150
I might ask for being...

323
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,240
a FRIENDS WITH BENEFIT.

324
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,160
You can see me off here.

325
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,080
Hm.

326
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,450
Good bye.

327
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,860
Try?

328
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,340
Uea! Uea!

329
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:36,840
I'm in.

330
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,180
An unknown number: Where have you been?

331
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,710
An unknown number: I miss you.

332
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,630
Uea!

333
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,260
What?!

334
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,580
Why didn't you answer my call?

335
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,360
You didn't read my messages too.

336
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,900
I...

337
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,080
didn't check the phone.

338
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,480
You have something to say?

339
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,010
About what you asked me if we could "try"...

340
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,520
Will you be my friend.../ Why are you asking that here?!

341
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,750
Uea!

342
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,580
Are you still hesitating?

343
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,680
It's just trying it out.

344
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,510
If you don't like it, I can...

345
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,720
Hey guys!

346
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,610
Jade.

347
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,830
What the hell are you doing here?

348
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,000
It's Gun.

349
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,470
He told me you guys are making some coffee,

350
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,230
so I came after you.

351
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,610
Why are you guys looking at me?

352
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,980
Do I have anything on my face?

353
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,060
King, do I have anything on my face?

354
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,380
Uea.

355
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,600
Do I have anything on my face?

356
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:51,940
Teeth.

357
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,640
Teeth?

358
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,210
your teeth.

359
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,170
Teeth?

360
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,460
This side?

361
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,010
Chocolate.

362
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,090
Gun. [whispering]

363
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,450
Ouch.

364
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,200
I'm sorry.

365
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,510
Don't you have your job?

366
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,950
I'm looking for the color.

367
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,530
Ouch!

368
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,190
I'm sorry.

369
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,340
Gun.

370
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,710
I think you're teasing me now.

371
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,620
Hey... this color.

372
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,020
Where?

373
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,440
Ahh.

374
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,140
Here.

375
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,380
Hey!

376
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,420
Does programmer...

377
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,320
need to know about the color?

378
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,630
Of course.

379
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,830
It's a part of the job.

380
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,370
You guys don't know anything! Shh.

381
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,920
Don't be too lazy!

382
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,500
Why I'm the only one who works too much?!

383
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,610
Are you guys having fun?

384
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,830
Teasing me makes you guys fun?

385
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,550
Huh? You all?

386
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,550
Fine! I'm going home.

387
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,200
Bye!

388
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,490
Mongkol has returned home. so...

389
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,890
I'm going home, too.

390
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,350
Sawaddee krub. [Bye bye]

391
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,500
Sawaddee krub. [Bye bye]

392
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,000
Sawaddee krub. [Bye bye]

393
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,250
Mongkol is a piece of sh*t.

394
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,300
He always come late and back home early.

395
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,270
He doesn't really work.

396
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,850
It's gotta be you and me as ALWAYS!

397
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,780
Jade.

398
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:35,930
Hm?

399
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,000
We need to talk to Bas.

400
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,550
Don't have to.

401
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,710
I'm alright.

402
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,160
I don't wanna make it a big deal.

403
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,900
But, he took the advantage from us!

404
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,820
Um.

405
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,970
I know.

406
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,000
But, he's the boss's cousin.

407
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,280
Sighhhhh.

408
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,920
Let's eat rice with red pork first.

409
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,280
Come on, King.

410
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,830
You guys go ahead.

411
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,490
I wanna keep working.

412
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,360
Ah.

413
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,410
You never go with us.

414
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,430
Ummm.

415
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,320
Later.

416
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,890
Hmmm.

417
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,810
King, let's go!

418
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,400
I'm working an OT.

419
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,270
Huh?

420
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,800
What're you saying?

421
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,540
I'm working an OT.

422
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,910
You too!

423
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,600
You never go with me.

424
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,380
How can I all you guys as friends?

425
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,330
Let's see when I have a lover.

426
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,170
I'll leave you guys!

427
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,210
Hm.

428
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,680
Are you leaving, mister Anol?

429
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,630
Um.

430
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:47,630
My work is done.

431
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:51,900
Er.

432
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,270
The picture you sent to me.

433
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,140
I've already uploaded on the web.

434
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,530
Um.

435
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,590
Can you stay longer?

436
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,700
I feel lonely.

437
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,800
Uea.

438
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,560
Yes?

439
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,100
The marketing team called me.

440
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,679
They said the picture was wrong.

441
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,400
This campaign has been canceled.

442
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,510
When you sent the pic to the programmer.

443
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Why don't you check it first?

444
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:18,719
Ah.

445
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,090
Bas, I'm.../ Er, Bas.

446
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,830
It's me who's uploaded the pic.

447
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,179
I'm sorry.

448
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,639
I'll fix it now.

449
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,889
okay, then hurry up.

450
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,179
yes, sir.

451
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:36,949
King.

452
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,340
Why did you protect me?

453
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,880
It was my fault.

454
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:44,989
I don't know.

455
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,469
Since I protected you.

456
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,060
how can you leave me alone?

457
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,410
Hm?

458
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,670
Huh?

459
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:05,940
Ah.

460
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,830
Wait here for a sec.

461
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,580
I'll give you a ride.

462
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,160
Hurry up.

463
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,770
Alrighttt.

464
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,710
Thank you.

465
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,050
that you told Bas like that.

466
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,040
and...

467
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:58,930
giving me a ride.

468
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,050
No problem.

469
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,800
My pleasure.

470
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,940
Er...Uea

471
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
I wanna talk about that.

472
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,950
What're you gonna do?

473
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:29,950
Just tell me.

474
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,620
I respect on your decision.

475
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,060
Let's say.

476
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,790
Which way do you wanna go?

477
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,540
If you tell me to go straight to my condo.

478
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,260
It's a "Yes"

479
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,520
but if not...

480
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,710
Just tell me to ride to your home.

481
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,130
Your condo.

482
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,700
I don't have clothes to change.

483
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,000
Shouldn't be a problem.

484
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,520
Tonight...

485
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,930
You don't have to wear it.

486
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,880
Let's take a shower first...

487
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,680
and get the robe for me.

488
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,940
Why did you sleep with me?

489
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,480
I turned back for my love life.

490
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,430
Since...

491
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,070
Nothing good in my love life.

492
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,620
so...

493
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,980
Let me be something good in your life.

494
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,140
Don't make fun about this.

495
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,830
You never settle down with anyone.

496
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,970
Don't talk to me like that.

497
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,640
Don't you understand?

498
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,170
Can you stay away from me?

499
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,460
I can't.

500
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,220
I didn't say I broke up with you.

501
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,440
What're you doing?

502
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,500
Hey.

503
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,610
What's wrong with you?

504
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,420
What's wrong with you?

505
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,640
[You and me are just chilling]

506
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,940
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

507
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,150
[I don't wanna be your friend]

508
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,370
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

509
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,850
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

510
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:38,190
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

511
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,590
[I think I has crossed the line]

512
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:50,750
[Finally, it's me who crossed the line]

513
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,830
[Finally]

514
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,160
[It's me who can't conceal my feelings]

515
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,220
[I suddenly falling in love]

516
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,320
[Every time I look into your eyes]

517
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:09,550
[It's always you that makes me feel something more]

518
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:15,700
[I know that between you and me are just Bed Friend]

519
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,600
[I'm not supposed to expect anything]

520
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,130
[Every time you feel alone, that's when I matter]

521
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,480
[We're just Bed Friend]

522
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,870
[It's just the deal we're looking for]

523
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:33,490
[No matter how much warmth we give to each other]

524
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,700
[You and me are just chilling]

525
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,020
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

526
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,050
[I don't wanna be your friend]

527
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:47,390
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

528
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,860
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

529
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:56,440
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

530
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,430
[I think I has crossed the line]
