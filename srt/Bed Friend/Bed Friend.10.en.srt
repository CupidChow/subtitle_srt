00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,030
I could sleep.

155
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,400

Gun.

Here, take it and do some research.

165
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,140

Why don't you go with me, King?

167
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,260
I won't ever leave my boyfriend.

168
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,400
Could you please stop flirting?

191
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,040
Umm.

192
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,680
Tonkao, if you have not enough money, you can tell me.

193
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,720
It's enough.

194
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,960
I feel bad, you're so considerate.

195
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,160
Don't mention it.

196
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,940
So... does mom still ask you for money?

197
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,560
Sometimes.

198
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,340
But I didn't text back.

199
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,040
Do you understand me?

200
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,600
Yes.

201
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,300
Thank you for still taking care of me.

202
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,080
I love you, Uea.

203
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,540
I'm going to study. Hope we meet again soon.

204
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:44,680
Sure.

205
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,340
Who did you talk to? Your voice was so sweet.

206
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,860
Hm?// It's Tonkao.

207
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,660
It'd be great if you talk to me like that.

208
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,860
Are you getting bored of me?

209
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,440
Huh?

210
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,580
There's no way that will happen.

211
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
Hmm.

212
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,640
So when are you going to meet your friend?

213
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,840
Hm?

214
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,620
At noon.

215
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,340
Hm.

216
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,640
But It might go all the way to the evening.

217
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,400
So I may come back late.

218
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:35,840
Um.

219
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,660
I'll wait for you.

220
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,160
What are you smiling for?

221
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,100
My boyfriend is cute.

222
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,020
So I want to smile at him.

223
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,540
Hmph!

224
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,600
I wanna squeeze you. Take this!

225
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,480
Eat it and stop fooling around!

226
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,600
Um.

227
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm chewing!

228
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,620
1 year later.

229
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,820
Will we be caught by Uea?

230
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,640
I've never lied to him.

231
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,920
Argh!

232
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,720
You don't tell, I don't tell. How will he know?

233
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,380
But you know I'm not good at lying!

234
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,540
Sh*t! I'm stressed out!// Hey! Why are you so nervous?

235
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,740
You're just here to help me choose a ring.

236
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,300
Are you not nervous at all?!

237
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,260
Of course, I am.

238
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,460
I'm very nervous. But I tried to keep my cool.

239
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,000
Please tell me if you have any preferences.

240
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,400
Um...

241
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,280
My lover likes the basic style.

242
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,880
Basic?

243
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,280
Then it should be this one.

244
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,420
What kind of person is your lover?

245
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,040
I'll help you choose.

246
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,640
Um.

247
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,300
My lover?

248
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,060
He's arrogant, moody and likes to overthink things.

249
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,340
King!

250
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,920
I'll tell Uea about this!

251
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,780
But he takes a very good care of me...

252
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,360
and I love him more than anything.

253
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,040
Good saying.

254
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,000
Can I take a look at that one?// Yes, sure.

255
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,180
This is the new product of our shop.

256
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,040
It's a 0.7 carat white gold ring.

257
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,680
What do you think, Jade?

258
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,480
Is something wrong?

259
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,540
What's wrong?

260
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,520
Boohooo.

261
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm touched.

262
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,980
You've never be this good since I know you.

263
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,260
Is that a compliment?

264
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,660
Um, of course!

265
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:55,260
Both of my friends are going to settle down! *sob*

266
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,700
I'll have this one.

267
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,600
Yes, sir.

268
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,940
Dad, mom.

269
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,540
I'll propose to Uea next month.

270
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,820
Did you think it over?

271
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,360
Yes.

272
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,600
I've decided that Uea...

273
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
is the love of my life.

274
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,380
We're not going to stop you.

275
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,040
Because after all this time you make us believe that...

276
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,260
you will be a great couple.

277
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,220
Thank you.

278
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,820
I'm still your son,

279
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,740
Got's brother,

280
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,580
and the same family member.

281
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,320
What's more is...

282
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,200
I want to love someone...

283
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,900
and take care of him for the rest of my life.

284
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,720
You've grown up, King.

285
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,920
I'm happy that you're happy.

286
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,080
I can't wait to see your ring.

287
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,960
I've looked for it.

288
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:15,960
Here.

289
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,640
Let me have a look.

290
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,700
King!

291
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,980
This... I think...

292
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,800
Isn't the diamond too small?

293
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:27,900
Ha?

294
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,900
It won't stand out when you take photos.

295
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,940
Why don't you choose it carefully?

296
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,880
Let him decide. It's up to him.

297
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,420
But the bigger, the better.// Um.

298
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,540
Why?

299
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,820
The bigger one will be more beautiful!

300
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,640
Let's take a photo.

301
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,240
Hahaha.

302
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,320
Argh!

303
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,940
When did you come back?

304
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,960
Just now.

305
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,020
I'm surprised!// Can you kiss me?

306
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,140
Hehe.

307
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,380
What did you do?// Hm?

308
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,760
It looks good.// I made salad.

309
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,580
How was it? Are you tired?

310
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,440
Hm?

311
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,500
No.

312
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,700
Sit down first.

313
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:42,600
Massage here.// Nonsense.// Will you do it?// Maybe.

314
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,860
Are you hungry?

315
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,560
Not much.

316
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,680
There's always traffic jam on Valentine's day.

317
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,300
Uh-huh.

318
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,460
Actually,

319
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,520
we can cook something at home.

320
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,520
Or else you'll have a stomachache.

321
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,500
I don't want to make you tired.

322
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,190
And I want a change of atmosphere.

323
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,240
If I'm with you,

324
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,550
I won't be tired just from cooking for you.

325
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,550
Hmm.

326
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,460
Talking like this, do you want to do something that's not eating?

327
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,030
Focus on driving!

328
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,330
Drive properly, King!

329
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,510
Give me attention. It's Valentine's day.

330
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:48,450
Kiss my cheek.

331
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,630
I can't feel it.

332
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,590
Drive!// I'm driving! You haven't touched me!

333
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,340
I know it. You're always like this!

334
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,179
You...

335
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,600
What are you doing?

336
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,730
What are you doing?

337
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,560
Asking you for a hand in marriage.

338
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,010
Here?

339
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,110
Um.

340
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:19,750
Right here.

341
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,580
King love Uea.

342
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,300
Next year...

343
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,720
will you marry me?

344
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,040
Um.

345
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,140
Why did you choose to propose here?

346
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,460
I want to let everyone know about us.

347
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,190
That after this...

348
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,590
I'll take care of you...

349
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,280
and love only you.

350
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,380
Wow, congratulations!

351
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,190
It's very lovely!

352
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,740
Hello, mom.

353
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,520
Hello, dad.

354
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,440
You've become my child, Uea.

355
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,840
Welcome to our family, Uea.

356
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,500
Thank you.

357
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:14,470
Congrats, Uea!// Tonkao!

358
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,870
I wish you a lot of happiness.

359
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,220
If I can help with anything, you can always tell me.

360
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,440
So cute!

361
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,820
I hope you guys to be very happy,

362
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,290
and love each other for a looong time.

363
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:45,680
Who knows that my office mate, who's also my FWB,

364
00:37:50,640 --> 00:38:01,250
will be the simple happiness that I've been looking for.

365
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,850
I love you.

366
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,300
Um.

367
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,640
I...

368
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,750
love you too.

369
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,020
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

370
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,950
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

371
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,020
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

372
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,490
[Please understand, I wanna be your boyfriend.]

373
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,080
I've warned you that...

374
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,600
don't play with Anol.

375
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,860
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

376
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,250
