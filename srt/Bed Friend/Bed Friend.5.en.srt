Uea.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,400
Here you come.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,830
I'm waiting for you.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,260
Just stop doing like this to me.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:20,990
We need to talk.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,960
Don't you feel ashamed?

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,580
Of what?

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,000
Mom! Leave me!

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,670
You never!

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,340
make me proud!

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,890
Uea! Come back!

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,180
Wait! Uea!

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:38,840
Uea.

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:40,910
Come home.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,470
I don't like anyone to look at you.

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,700
Hurry up!

18
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,120
Don't be too fast. I can't follow you!

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,490
Hurry up, Uea!

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:53,990
Hey! Hey!

21
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,580
Ah!

22
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,320
Ummm.

23
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,250
Uea!

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,460
Hm?

25
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,300
Please help me.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,550
I'm drunk.

27
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,410
I don't wanna take advantage from you.

28
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,540
What time right now?

29
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:22,940
8 o'clock.

30
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,180
Let me hold this.

31
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,670
Last night, I was a good boy,

32
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,730
Any rewards for me?

33
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,040
No.

34
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
It supposed to be like that.

35
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,640
to not taking advantage from me.

36
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,839
so...

37
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,780
Can I sleep with you tonight?

38
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,180
Run out of quota.

39
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,110
Too strict!

40
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,550
Last night was totally different.

41
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,490
[Is that true we're just friends?]

42
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,540
[but I think we're much more than that.]

43
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,160
[Our friends say that we made like a pack.]

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,620
[I don't know what do you feel about me.]

45
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,820
[but I think you have feeling for me.]

46
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,150
[Things between us makes me feel good]

47
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,310
[I don't think I can keep it anymore]

48
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,480
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

49
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:46,010
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

50
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,710
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

51
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,280
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,560
[It's up to you, just say it.]

53
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,450
[I like you.]

54
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,120
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

55
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,440
Ooh.

56
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,860
Er.

57
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,140
You.

58
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,000
can take a shower first.

59
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,659
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,150
You said you don't like it.

61
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:50,930
Ah.

62
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,420
What're you doing?

63
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,620
Um.

64
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,260
so...

65
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,200
What's the code of Rosy pink?

66
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,110
Rosy pink?...

67
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,600
Finally, you're here.

68
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,300
I'm ready to scold you.

69
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,950
What the hell?

70
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,440
Miss me?

71
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,960
F*ck you.

72
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,930
Your mom called me last night.

73
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,000
that you dismissed her call.

74
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,760
Ah, that's true.

75
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,000
So what?

76
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,520
So what?

77
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,270
Why don't you receive her call?

78
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,930
It was just 9 pm.

79
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,740
What did you do last night?

80
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,250
Wanna know?

81
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,909
I think...

82
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,159
It must be like what I'm thinking.

83
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,850
What is it?

84
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,630
Well, it's...

85
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,800
Hmm?

86
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,210
Are you trying to test me?

87
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,150
Hm?

88
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,450
Ummm.

89
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,310
Exactly like you thought.

90
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,570
and...

91
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,230
You//Er!

92
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,800
My mom called you.

93
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,010
What did she say?

94
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,010
Um.

95
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,060
She wanted you to called her back.

96
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,450
She need to talk to you.

97
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,980
in Urgent.

98
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:17,830
Um.

99
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,240
I'll call her this evening.

100
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,100
anyway.

101
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,740
Who were with you last night?

102
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,890
Don't say that one is...

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,670
Nosy Parker.

104
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,170
Yes.

105
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,640
I'm a Nosy Parker.

106
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,520
I wanna know who was with you.

107
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,160
Deal from the club?

108
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,090
Or from outside?

109
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,910
Is that one cute?

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,260
Of course.

111
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,000
Very cute.

112
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,480
Do you like that one?

113
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,150
You smiled.

114
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:57,910
I do.

115
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,480
That one is my type.

116
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,400
As cold as a cat.

117
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,460
[Meaw]

118
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,820
Always fierce to me.

119
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,140
Fierce to you?

120
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,430
Sorry.

121
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,790
Then, what?

122
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,620
ONS?

123
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,560
or more than that?

124
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,450
Hm.

125
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,320
much more than that.

126
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,480
Yeah, That's my man!

127
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,390
So cool!

128
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,910
Of course, I am.

129
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,780
Alright. I'll follow up from you.

130
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,740
Before anything else.//Umm.

131
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,240
Um.

132
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,640
Stand up! //Hm.

133
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,310
Ummm.

134
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,810
Come here.

135
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,490
Keep fighting.

136
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,480
Yeah, don't have to tell me.

137
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,260
Ewwwww. King!

138
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,830
Ouch!

139
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,910
King: Today at my place?

140
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,980
Keep working

141
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,570
Jade.

142
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,550
Hm?

143
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,600
Do you have the nail clipper?

144
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,480
Let me check.

145
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,320
Did I have one...

146
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,350
Um. Here.

147
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:12,920
Um.

148
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,170
Hm?

149
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,500
Your nails are already short. Why do you need to cut more?

150
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,240
It's getting longer again.

151
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,180
Um.

152
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,930
Too short. It will cut your skin.

153
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:30,990
Uea.

154
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,490
Oh.

155
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,090
See?

156
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,450
Hm. Ah. Ah!

157
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,560
Ouch Ouch.

158
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,090
Why you're so reckless?

159
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,820
Why did you call me?

160
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,290
Forget it. Cure your nail first.

161
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,970
It's your fault, Jade. Your nail clipper!

162
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,410
Did I do something wrong?

163
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,590
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,830
It's my fault. I called you.

165
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,390
Um.

166
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,580
Never mind.

167
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,900
Er, so...

168
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,100
Why did you call me then?

169
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,820
Nothing.

170
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,140
Just wanna ask you for having dinner.

171
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,250
so,

172
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,700
Wanna go or not?

173
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,470
See you at the parking lot.

174
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,390
Don't be late.

175
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,770
[You and me are just chilling]

176
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,470
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

177
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,460
[I don't wanna be your friend]

178
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,890
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

179
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,220
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

180
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,030
What do you wanna eat?

181
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,370
Just order.

182
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,550
It's on me.

183
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,620
Don't have to.

184
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,690
I can pay.

185
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,180
Woah.

186
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,590
I have too much money.

187
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,140
I wanna spend.

188
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,530
Fine.

189
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,770
I'll order all of this.

190
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,490
Fine.

191
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,680
Mom: You read, but you don't f*cking reply me?

192
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,470
Mom: You read, but you don't f*cking reply me?

193
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,750
Uea: Recently, I'm pretty busy.

194
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,270

I can't help it.

366

Why did you come so early?

373

What did she say?

382
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,020
Do you think I'm your secretary?

383
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,560
What is it about?

384
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,490
She wants to bring you to a blind date.

385
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,890
So you haven't told her that you already have someone in mind?

386
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,850
I'm waiting for him to be ready./ Um.

387
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,520
Speaking about it,

388
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,610
who's the one you have in mind?

389
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,340
You always change the subject when I asked about it.

390
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,720
I'm dying to know the truth.

391
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:53,960
King!

392
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,420
Answer me.

393
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:00,960
Ah?

394
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,320
What are you guys doing?

395
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,670
Hm?/ Ha?

396
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,690
You're suspicious.

397
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,390
You don't need to be curious about everything.

398
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,550
Which one are you talking about?

399
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,010
Every. Single. Thing.

400
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,360
Ha! You're no fun!

401
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,560
And you, Uea!/ Huh?

402
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,620
Don't be like him.

403
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,780
Having a crush on someone, but keeping it hidden from friends.

404
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,890
I don't have one.

405
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:30,900
Hm?

406
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,690
Really?

407
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,700
Um.

408
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,720
Then...

409
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
Do you want me to help you find a good man?

410
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,730
Take this! Don't be nosy.

411
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,510
Why did you scold me?!

412
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,080
You shouldn't meddle with every businesses of others.

413
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,580
Let him decide things by himself.

414
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,020
Do you agree with me, Uea?

415
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,850
I don't know.

416
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,450
I don't know, either.

417
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,170
Back to work.

418
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,430
What restaurant did you eat at?

419
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,890
The one that's near our office.

420
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,130
It's delicious, isn't it?

421
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,790
Bring me with you next time.

422
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:50,890
I think... it's better if you eat at other restaurants, Mr. Kit.

423
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,170
Why?

424
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,070
Can't you share it with me?

425
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,410
I'm afraid not.

426
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:05,990
How about you, Uea?

427
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,389
Do you have any recommendations? I'd like to eat with you.

428
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,850
Well...

429
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,690
It's as what King said.

430
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:24,989
I'll leave first.

431
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:32,610
You're...

432
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:35,230
quite good at acting cool.

433
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,190
I'll take it as a compliment, Mr. Anol.

434
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,679
That stupid Kit wants to be with you.

435
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,179
And you? Do you have any feelings for him?

436
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
Not at all.

437
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,060
I'm just asking.

438
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,760
Or do you.../ Don't mess with me, King.

439
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,780
That's not my type.

440
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,060
You mean a player?

441
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,480
If you're talking about me,

442
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,220
I can stop being a player...

443
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,540
when I like someone.

444
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,440
Do you believe me?

445
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,160
That I can really do it?

446
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,360
No.

447
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,460
If you never try, you'll never know.

448
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,840
Can I please have this documents, Ann?

449
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,600
Sure. I'll find it for you.

450
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,620
Great.

451
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,500
There should be 2 copy of it.

452
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,900
Can I sleep with you tonight, Uea?

453
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,380
Oh!

454
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,400
You mentioned earlier that you'll bring Jade along, right?

455
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,760
And that we'll eat Thai BBQ buffet after that?

456
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,060
In the evening, am I right?

457
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,200
It sure is!

458
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,380
Why did you speak so loudly, huh?

459
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,720
Ow!

460
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,700
Have you forgotten our agreement?!

461
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,220
There are so many people here.

462
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,040
What are you going to do if they know?

463
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,220
Hm?/ Ummm.

464
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,780
I just talked to you normally, aren't I?

465
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,420
If you don't like it this way,

466
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,680
then what would you like me to do?

467
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,380
Haha.

468
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,700
Hello.

469
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,640
Oh!

470
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,680
The insurance?

471
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,720
Yes.

472
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,000
You want to come to my place?

473
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,980
But you don't have any quota left for this week, do you?

474
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,520
If you're coming for nothing,

475
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,520
then please don't come.

476
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,040
My water and electricity are being wasted by you.

477
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,700
Hi, Darling!

478
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,700
Ah, I'll buy you a drink.

479
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,780
Hm?

480
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,500
I promise that I won't just sit still and do nothing.

481
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,960
Please don't be too harsh on me, babe.

482
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,400
Umm... What I said about sitting still...

483
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,880
Oh, I mean not sitting still.

484
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,460
I just wanna watch an important football match with you.

485
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,900
Are you interested, babe?

486
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,840
Oh.

487
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,940
That proposal?

488
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,140
I'm interested.

489
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,240
Alright, babe.

490
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,800
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

491
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,340
Do you get it?

492
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,740
Do you want to make a bet with me?

493
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,660
Brazil will definitely win.

494
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,540
No way.

495
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,820
Then...

496
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,000
If the team you're rooting for loses,

497
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,060
you must do whatever the winner says.

498
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,000
For once.

499
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,560
Are you in?

500
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm not betting.

501
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,980
Are you afraid of losing, Mr. Anol?

502
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,160
Well, I understand, your team tends to lose this time.

503
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,600
Er, I'm in.

504
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,920
Let's make a bet.

505
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,700
If you lose, you'll have to do EVERYTHING I say.

506
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,640
Wait a second.

507
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,560
Say that again. I'll record it.

508
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,040
Yes! Woohoo! I win!

509
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,640
Hm?

510
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,720
Are you running away, Mr. Anol?

511
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,720
Did you forget our bet?

512
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,240
What do you want?

513
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,460
What do you want?

514
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,340
I can't think of anything right now.

515
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,440
Can I tell you later?

516
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,720
Um.

517
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,600
Brazil! Brazil!

518
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,520
It's okay.

519
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,420
I'm here with you.

520
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,200
I promise...

521
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,780
that I will hold you all night.

522
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,160
Attention, please, graphic team.

523
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,840
Don't forget what I asked for in our last meeting.

524
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,940
I need it to be ready this evening.

525
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,880
Yes.

526
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,620
Easy peasy, Bas. I got this!

527
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,060
You don't need to worry.

528
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,280
Ah.

529
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,960
Anyway, please work hard.

530
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,980
It's my work, isn't it?

531
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,020
Uea!

532
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,900
Are you with the web page's banner?

533
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,400
Oh, yes. I'll mail it to you right away.

534
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,660
Thank you so much!

535
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,660
Gun.

536
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,860
Why did you have to talk that sweet?

537
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,920
Ha? Why?

538
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,140
Can't I be adorable?

539
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,980
Lately, I can tell that you've been talking nicely to Uea.

540
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,100
It's my business.

541
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,700
Hmm... It's not that you and Uea...

542
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,160
are secretly dating, right?

543
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah!/ Yeah!

544
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,200
Listen.

545
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,920
Listen, guys.

546
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,920
If King and Uea are really dating in secret,

547
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,920
I will...

548
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,180
bark with Dang in front of the office!

549
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,380
Interesting.

550
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,100
Can you wear it?

551
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,940
You like this style?

552
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,080
Damn. Your sexiness is out of this world.

553
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,180
What's on your mind?

554
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,640
It's been a long time since I've felt this way.

555
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,360
If it's too much, do you want me to help you, Uea?

556
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,320
Is that scum Kit using it as an excuse to talk to you?

557
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,980
[You and me are just chilling]

558
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,100
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

559
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,940
[I don't wanna be your friend]

560
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,160
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

561
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,920
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

562
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:59,380
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

563
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,220
[I think I have crossed the line]

564
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,900
[You and me are just chilling]

565
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,120
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

566
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,000
[I don't wanna be your friend]

567
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,340
