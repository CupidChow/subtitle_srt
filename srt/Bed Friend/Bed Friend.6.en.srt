Caution: The show is created for entertainment purposes only. Please exercise caution while watching.

2
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,920
My mom just call me.

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,640
She have an arranged match for me.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,240
Do you want me to go?

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,480
Ah, I want to introduce Krit.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,980
He's my nephew.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,800
Uea, are you a graphic designer?

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,700
Yes.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,680
I'm only good at coding. Graphic isn't my thing at all.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,580
There must be a lot of things we have to discuss.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,180
Please take care of me.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,060
I'm sick of him.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,420
He stared at you as if wanted to eat you whole.

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,140
And you? Do you have any feelings for him?

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,180
Not at all. That's not my type.

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,500
You mean a player?

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,040
If you're talking about me,

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,920
I can stop being a player... when I like someone.

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,280
Do you believe me that I can really do it?

20
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,840
Attention, please, graphic team.

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,640
Don't forget what I asked for in our last meeting.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,720
I need it to be ready this evening.

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,720
Yes.

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,460
Easy peasy, Bas. I got this!

25
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,940
You don't need to worry.

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,860
Anyway, please work hard.

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,780
It's my work, isn't it?

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,979
Uea!

29
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,860
Are you done with the web page's banner?

30
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,300
Oh, yes. I'll mail it to you right away.

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,700
Thank you so much!

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,400
Gun.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,660
Why did you have to talk that sweetly?

34
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,900
Ha? Why?

35
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,740
Lately, I can tell that you've been talking nicely to Uea.

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,780
It's my business.

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,660
Hmm... It's not that you and Uea...

38
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,120
are secretly dating, right?

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,960
Yeah!/ Yeah!

40
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,160
Listen.

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,880
Listen, guys.

42
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,880
If King and Uea are really dating in secret,

43
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,880
I will...

44
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,140
bark with Dang in front of the office!

45
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,340
Interesting.

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,740
Uea.

47
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,720
Do you want to go out with me?

48
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,980
I wanna see...

49
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,320
Jade bark with Dang.

50
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,579
King! Don't mess with me!

51
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,260
Gun.

52
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,660
You wanna join?

53
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:58,860
Er.

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,520
Eat dog food if you dare!

55
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,120
Shall I?

56
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,980
If King and Uea are really dating in secret,

57
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,520
Jade will bark with Dang in front of the office.

58
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,620
But if I'm wrong,

59
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,720
I'll eat dog food!

60
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,500
I'm siding with Gun.

61
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,079
Um.

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,160
Come on.

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,760
Deal?

64
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,240
Deal!

65
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,400
I think someone stole my phone.

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,220
No, it's nothing like that.

67
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,540
Krit: Uea, would you please come to my room?

68
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,580
Uea!

69
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,080
Let me go with you.

70
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,320
It's okay. I'll be right back.

71
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Do you need any help, Uea?

72
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,680
What's that attitude?

73
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm just going to lend him a hand.

74
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,720
This is frustrated. I better go to the restroom.

75
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,860
Come in.

76
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,900
Have a seat. Would you like anything to drink?

77
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,120
No, thank you.

78
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,480
So my friend recently opened a restaurant in Sukhumvit.

79
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,260
Are you free this evening? I'd like to invite you to a meal.

80
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,780
I'm very busy lately, Mr. Krit.

81
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,760
Brother Krit?

82
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,240
You told me to come here in order to ask me about this?

83
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,159
Actually, something urgent has come up.

84
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,700
I just received feedback from the marketing team.

85
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,220
They want us to redo the entire Midyear sale campaign we've done.

86
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,160
Because they want the concept to represent the rainy season.

87
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,480
But I've completed 80% of the work.

88
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,960
If it's too much, do you want me to help you, Uea?

89
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,180
When is the deadline?

90
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,940
As soon as possible.

91
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,000
But I think within this week should be fine.

92
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,240
Alright.

93
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,480
I'll try to figure it out.

94
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,360
Ah.

95
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,380
How about the dinner?

96
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,940
I'll excuse myself.

97
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,940
I need to hurry back reworking this work.

98
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,010
[Is that true we're just friends?]

99
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,060
[but I think we're much more than that.]

100
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,680
[Our friends say that we made like a pack.]

101
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,140
[I don't know what do you feel about me.]

102
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,340
[but I think you have feeling for me.]

103
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,670
[Things between us makes me feel good]

104
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,830
[I don't think I can keep it anymore]

105
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,000
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

106
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:09,530
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

107
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,230
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

108
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,800
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]

109
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,080
[It's up to you, just say it.]

110
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,970
[I like you.]

111
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,640
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

112
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,240
Ridiculous.

113
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,159
Why'd they change the concept so suddenly?

114
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,380
Er.

115
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,500
Is that scum Krit using it as an excuse to talk to you?

116
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,900
Why?

117
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,900
Actually, I heard that Mild from the marketing team,

118
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,060
sent the feedback a long time ago.

119
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,140
He might want to pressure me.

120
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,480
Ha? For what?

121
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,900
Hey, Jade.

122
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,040
Is something wrong? You're so loud!

123
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,940
It's work. Do you want to help?

124
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,180
Not my business.

125
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
I'll start working on it.

126
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,400
I'm sick of this.

127
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,380
You can tell me if there's anything I can do.

128
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,060
I'll help you.

129
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:24,900
Um.

130
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,400
Here, I bought it for you.

131
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,920
This is yours, Jade.

132
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,760
Gun!/ Hm?

133
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,600
Here./ Thank you.

134
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,000
Want some Ichitan?

135
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,640
For me?

136
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,360
You're acting weird.

137
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,860
Oh, hello.

138
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,120
Hello./ Hello.

139
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,820
How is the work I assigned?

140
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,120
Well.

141
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,040
All that remains is to add the fonts, Mr. Krit.

142
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,260
Adding the fonts?

143
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:57,980
Yes.

144
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,800
Err.

145
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,280
I think.../ Mr. Krit, should I make any changes to my part?

146
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,520
Oh.

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,620
Nothing.

148
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,500
Uea.

149
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,800
I'll follow up the work later then.

150
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,220
Yes, sir./ Thank you.

151
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,160
What's wrong?

152
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,600
Huh?

153
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,660
I'm irritated.

154
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,240
Wait, don't you want to keep smoking?

155
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,080
I'm trying to quit.

156
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,180
Why is that?

157
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Someone dislikes it.

158
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
Who is it?

159
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,540
It's still not the right time for you to know.

160
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,160
To hell with it.

161
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,280
This week is a complete mess.

162
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,540
Ha! You can't leave me curious like this!

163
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,180
I can't say it.

164
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,140
We still aren't in a relationship.

165
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,860
Just give me something, please?

166
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,920
Take it.

167
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,760
You look tired, Uea.

168
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,700
Um.

169
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,460
I'm fed up.

170
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,580
Uea.

171
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,240
Hm?

172
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,760
Have I ever told you...

173
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,880
that you really look like a cat?

174
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,320
Hmm.

175
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,780
What is it?

176
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,620
Give me a sec.

177
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,180
If you don't mind...

178
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,840
Can you wear it for me?

179
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,880
King.

180
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,440
Is this the reward you want from winning our bet?

181
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,140
What if I say no?

182
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,620
But if you don't want to wear it.

183
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,740
Or don't like it.

184
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,220
That's also fine.

185
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,560
I won't force you.

186
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,040
Damn.

187
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,940
Your sexiness is out of this world.

188
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,640
You like it?

189
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,300
You look so damn good with it.

190
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,420
You really resemble a cat.

191
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,080
So...

192
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,740
Are you willing to be my slave?

193
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,500
What's the hurry? Hm?

194
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,460
You seduce me like this...

195
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,140
how in the world can I stay calm?

196
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,620
Uea.

197
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:27,880
Huh?

198
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,220
You know what?

199
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,820
I'm several months older than you.

200
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,740
So what?

201
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,700
Can you try calling yourself "Uea"...

202
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,800
and call me brother King?

203
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,840
Why?

204
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,860
Do you want to be brother King...

205
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,900
of Uea?

206
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,360
Pick up the phone.

207
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,440
What's up?

208
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,100
What's on your mind?

209
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,720
Nothing.

210
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,460
I'm just gonna tell you that...

211
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,600
It's been a long time since I've felt this way.

212
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,020
Uea.

213
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,660
If one day we...

214
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,260
Forget it.

215
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,100
I just wanna tell you about the work...

216
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,760
if you're really uncomfortable,

217
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,680
you can resign.

218
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,480
Hm.

219
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,100
I'll think about it.

220
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,020
Do you want to spend this long vacation on a sea trip with me?

221
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,800
Are you asking me on a trip?

222
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,480
Do you want to go with me?

223
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,060
Um.

224
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,280
Let's go.

225
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,840
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

226
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,400
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

227
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,640
You can choose where you want to go and what you want to do.

228
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,400
I'll be with you.

229
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,460
Um.

230
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,660
Okay.

231
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,600
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

232
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,300
Uea.

233
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,880
Can you...check your email?

234
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,430
I sent the the retouched file for you.

235
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,830
A long hair lady one.

236
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,560
Can you finish it?

237
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,870
Why don't you do it by yourself?

238
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,450
I'm not free.

239
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,950
It's not my job.

240
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,730
Krit told me to let you finish it.

241
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,680
If you don't wanna do it, then tell him by yourself.

242
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,040
I had nothing to do with this.

243
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,310
A*shole.

244
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,060
What happened?

245
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,020
Mongkol asked me to finish his work.

246
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,830
from Krit's command.

247
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,970
Why don't you refuse?

248
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,360
I'm totally done with it.

249
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,780
Krit never complain about Mongkol's work.

250
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,230
What a freaking...deep connection.

251
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,590
Hard working person always lose the big connection ones.

252
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,300
Ahhh. Oh my gosh.

253
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,270
Fabulous! Two more days then I could have a holiday.

254
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,200
Gotta buy some clothes for the vacation.

255
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,320
Shopping again, Muay?

256
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,480
Your wardrobes couldn't be more full.

257
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:11,980
Hey.

258
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,410
Your routine is just laying down and watching Netflix.

259
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,240
You couldn't get me right.

260
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,400
When I have a holiday,

261
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,730
I just wanna grab some nice clothes for vacation.

262
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,630
Right, everyone?

263
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,280
Yeahhhh

264
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,080
Perfect. Hmm.

265
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,340
so, where do you wanna go?

266
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,700
I'm planning to go to Busan. I wanna go to ''Haeundae'' beach.

267
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,580
There're a lot of handsome guys.

268
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,890
Or you mean ''Hongdae''? Do the plastic surgery?

269
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,900
I'm going to ''Haeundae beach'' at Busan.

270
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,090
I wanna see handsome guys getting sunbathed.

271
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,730
Famous plastic surgery is "Gangnam" in Seoul.

272
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,700
Oops. You're missing out.

273
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,310
Ouch.

274
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,730
It's hurt! Who did it?

275
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,060
You!

276
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,590
Ooh. This one is gorgeous, right?

277
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,090
Here here here. I'll put it on a list.

278
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,780
Ooh. This bag is very pretty. I wanna have one.// I think this color is nice.

279
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,170
Ayeee. I didn't have any clothes to go to Phuket.

280
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,620
Just ask your mom for it. Don't ask me.

281
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,410
Ahh, this one is very gorgeous. Looks really nice on me.

282
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,270
This one suits me!

283
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,450
Hm. or this one?

284
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,190
You gotta blast it with this shirt.

285
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,840
Er, King.

286
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,640
Let's go to Koh Larn.

287
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,150
I take a look for the hotel // I'm sorry, Uea.

288
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,350
Hm?

289
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,210
so...

290
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,700
I've to go to the arranged match.

291
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,290
but right after I came back I will... // Hey, that's okay.

292
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,900
Just go with her.

293
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,460
Are you okay, Uea?

294
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,010
Um.

295
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,030
Okay so,

296
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,970
I'll go back working.

297
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,450
[July 2022]

298
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,230
What're you doing?

299
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,460
Having dinner.

300
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,620
Let's go watching movies.

301
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,310
Umm.

302
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,300
I wanna take a rest.

303
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,090
Umm.

304
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,270
Or should I go to see you?

305
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:32,820
King's mom: King, come here. Today I'll sleep at your place.

306
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,070
Er, Uea.

307
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,830
Just stay with your mom.

308
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,020
I'll finish my dinner.

309
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,150
Uea.

310
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,290
Hm?

311
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:27,389
Having a holiday didn't make you look fresh. Are you sleepy?

312
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,010
Um. A little bit.

313
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,260
Where did you go for a holiday?

314
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,760
I didn't.

315
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,150
Hm. Me neither.

316
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,900
My heart is broken. I couldn't go anywhere.

317
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,199
[sigh]

318
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,710
Am I that bad?

319
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,100
No matter how hard I tried, everyone still broke my heart.

320
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,740
Do we have to be a good guy?

321
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,790
so that they won't leave us?

322
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,660
You're right.

323
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,460
[sigh]

324
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,550
Why the hell I be the drama queen with you?

325
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,980
You come so early this morning.

326
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:25,510
Oh.

327
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,490
Hello, sir. // Hello.

328
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,100
What're you guys talking? It looks fun.

329
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,580
Er...well...we're talking about the holiday.

330
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,030
so, where did you guys go?

331
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,340
Uea and I didn't go anywhere.

332
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,530
Just watching Netflix at home, how about you?

333
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,470
I...

334
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,720
Just wandered around BKK. My American friend just visited me.

335
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,310
If you have any recommendations,

336
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,560
just tell me to.

337
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,020
Oh of course, I'm really good at it.

338
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,880
Actually, where do you guys live?

339
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,780
Er. I'm living in Nana road.

340
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,520
and Uea....

341
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,820
Uea lives near my place

342
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,990
Yeah yeah, that's right.

343
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,450
Sometimes, we back home together.

344
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,280
I don't really know that Uea...

345
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,880
Lives near your place.

346
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:25,670
Yes he is.

347
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,060
The lift is ready.

348
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:39,390
Let's go.

349
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,740
You could go ahead. I'll grab some coffee first.

350
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,600
Bye bye.

351
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,730
Helloooo~ Everyone!

352
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,940
Hi~

353
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,080
Oops!

354
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,950
Today's office looks different.

355
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,260
The place here's so silent without Jade.

356
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,360
Ah, take it.

357
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,970
Better be silent sometimes,

358
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,190
Really?

359
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,690
King,

360
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,730
How was your arranged match? // Er.

361
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,200
How do you know?

362
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,220
Ah.

363
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,420
Jade told me.

364
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,620
Do we still have an arranged match?

365
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,370
Oh my gosh.

366
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,660
Are you getting married?

367
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,480
No way.

368
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,990
It's Mom's business.

369
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:05,940
Not mine.

370
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,690
Heyyy.

371
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,060
It's good though.

372
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,550
It's nice that she set an arrangement match for you.

373
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,620
I don't see the problem. Right?

374
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,350
Yeah.

375
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,670
So the woman she arranged for you,

376
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,320
She is not your type? // Umm.

377
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,520
I'm the choice.

378
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,620
I couldn't choose.

379
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,620
I don't know he'll choose me or not.

380
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,740
Woah, man.

381
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,300
You're like...

382
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,040
Rich, Handsome and Nice. How did she can refuse?

383
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:49,920
Uea.

384
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,060
Can we talk?

385
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,660
You mad at me?

386
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,620
For what?

387
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,840
that I had an arranged match.

388
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,900
I stood you up,

389
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,420
I'm sorry.

390
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,190
Next time I'll take you to... // I get it.

391
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,150
I'm fine.

392
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,340
Do you wanna go to the beach this weekend?

393
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,360
I don't wanna go anymore.

394
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,020
So, can I sleep at your place tonight?

395
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,210
You can't.

396
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,000
Just sleep. That's all.

397
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,940
King.

398
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,660
I wanna stay alone.

399
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,810
Okay.

400
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,500
Can you tell me when you work OT?

401
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:56,960
I'll wait for you.

402
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,770
We're just bed friend.

403
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,290
You don't have to do this.

404
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,620
Few days later

405
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,510
Uea!

406
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,400
You're here!

407
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,410
What happened?

408
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,240
Mr.Krit wanted to see you in his room.

409
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,460
I'm looking for you the whole office.

410
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,980
Anything in urgent?

411
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,970
I don't know.

412
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:51,150
He demanded everyone to find you. So hectic.

413
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,900
Are you alright?

414
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,550
Oh.

415
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,160
I'm ok.

416
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,470
It's getting to an ending part...soon.

417
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:09,180
Hm?

418
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,020
Nothing.

419
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
You go ahead.

420
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,200
I'll go with you.

421
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,530
Ummmm.

422
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,110
You can go ahead.

423
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,440

424
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,520
Alright.

00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,060
Do you know you worked really nice?

427
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,540
For this evaluation,

428

430
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,830
What do you have in your mind?

431
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,880
You two are staying face to face. // King!

432
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,030
If you talk to me like that, you can't even be my friend!

433
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,260
Your new hubby?

434
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,460
If this guy is your husband, I'm okay.

440
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:20,620
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,200
[I think I has crossed the line]
