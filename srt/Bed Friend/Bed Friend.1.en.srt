Why do you have to hurry back?/ Huh?/ You're going?

209
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:26,540
My hubby said that our child keeps crying and refuse to sleep. I'm going home

Have you got your salary yet? Give me some for your sister's tuition fee

221
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,710
Have you got your salary yet? Give me some for your sister's tuition fee

222
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,540
Your dad has many things to pay for. Why? Are you gonna die if you help us?

223
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,970
I understand you got a tight deadline

224
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,800
but the customer said this part is not right. We have to fix it

225
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
If I'm your lover, then who is that?

226
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,290
I broke up with Pock

227
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,970
Don't end the call and let me can explain. If you end it I swear I'll not stop easily, Uea

228
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,200
I won't carry you even if you pass out

229
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,170

You're really drunk

236
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,690
You should get some sleep

237
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,300
Nahh

238
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,120
I don't want to be alone

239
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Embrace me all night...

240
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:33,620
Please?

241
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,300
Are you sure about this, Uea?

242
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,270
Uea?

243
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,780

Jade

246
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,060
Where is Uea?

247
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,020

250
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,320
No, I didn't

251
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:25,770

Are you alright?

262
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,140
You looked so pale!

263
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,000
I just

264
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:13,920
have a sleep deprivation

265
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,870
You had a sick leave this morning

266
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,070
I thought you won't come today

267
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,250

298
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,490
He's at the printer room

299
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,300
You look so scary

300
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,730
Heyyy

301
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,070
Nooo You did it again, King

[Printer room]

303
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,150
Ready to talk to me now?

304
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,700
Leave me alone

305
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:15,740
I have to work

306
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,670
What's going on with you?

307
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,320
I'm doing fine

308
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,090
then why you kept hiding from me?

309
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,040
What I'm doing wrong?

310
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,830
You didn't

311
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,310
I didn't...

312
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,400
so why you act like this?

313
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,620
What do you mean by...

314
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,010
"acting like this"?

315
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,010
You didn't talk to me

316
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,110
You avoided me

317
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,420
I didn't

318
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,730
I just don't have anything to talk with you

319
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,370
You hate that you slept with me

320
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,400
Why did you bring it up?

321
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,550
Why not?

322
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:06,890
You and me.../ Just forget it!

323
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,810
Just do as if it never happened

324
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,750
Because it was me?

325
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,710
that makes you don't feel the same

326
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,550
It was my fault

327
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,680
I'm too reckless

328
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,420
What do you mean?

329
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,490
Can I ask you for something?

330
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,660
Just forget it

331
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,210
and I hope that...

332
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,290
you'll never bring this up again

333
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,890
From now on

if it wasn't you

357
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,100
