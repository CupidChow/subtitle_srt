2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,970
Why do you agree to sleep with me?

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,740
I guess I just wanna f*ck up my life even more.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,270
Since most of the time...

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,340
my life isn't great after all.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,620
Then...

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,090
Will you let me be a good thing in your life?

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,420
What're you doing?

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,270
Hey!

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,750
What's wrong with you?

11
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,990
You've got to be kidding me.

12
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,640
You never settled down with anyone.

13
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,730
Don't talk to me like that.

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,110
Are you deaf?

15
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,890
Get out of my life!

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,000
I won't.

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,170
You made a one side decision with our break up!

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,990
Let's file a police report.

19
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,200
I threatened him about his father.

20
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,660
He wouldn't dare to do anything to me.

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,170
Hi./ Pock!?

22
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,160
All your friends have already left.

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,750
Oh, where is your boyfriend, then?

24
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,460
Help!

25
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,080
Pock! Anybody, help!!

26
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,950
Keep resisting!

27
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,940
Pock!

28
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,770
Who the hell are you?!/ I'm Uea's boyfriend!

29
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,310
If you dare bother Uea again, I'll not let you go.

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,910
Are you alright, Uea?

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,310
Are you really okay?

32
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,470
Yes, I'm okay.

33
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,730
I should have punched him harder.

34
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,990
Are you hurt?

35
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,620
Thank you for saving me.

36
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,920
It's what I should do for you.

37
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,900
I knew it...

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,750
that he will resort to such underhanded trick.

39
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,550
But if I couldn't come in time,

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,060
he'll really rape you.

41
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,730
Move to my condo this week.

42
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,490
But...

43
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,680
No buts, Uea.

44
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,750
I don't want to be any angrier.

45
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,250
Um.

46
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,440
[You and me are just chilling]

47
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,920
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

48
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,860
[I don't wanna be your friend]

49
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,240
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

50
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,640
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

51
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,780
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,590
[I think I have crossed the line]

53
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,390
You didn't deserve to meet such a horrible person.

54
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,690
From now on,

55
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,700
if you're going to date someone,

56
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,210
make sure he's a good guy.

57
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm unlucky.

58
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,580
so I always met terrible people.

59
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,630
How about me?

60
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,860
Am I terrible for you?

61
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,020
You guess.

62
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,460
You talk to your helper like this?

63
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,900
I've already thanked you!

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm not looking for a thank you.

65
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,000
Can I have something else?

66
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
If you want more than this,

67
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,120
then let's get going.

68
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,430
[Is that true we're just friends?]

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,570
[but I think we're much more than that.]

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,790
[Our friends say that we made like a pack.]

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,240
[I don't know what do you feel about me.]

72
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,350
[but I think you have feeling for me.]

73
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,230
[Things between us makes me feel good]

74
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,390
[I don't think I can keep it anymore]

75
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,540
[Can we change from friend into boyfriend?]

76
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,440
[Are you thinking what I'm thinking?]

77
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,650
[Can you say it first? Say it now!]

78
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,340
[boyfriend. I wanna be your boyfriend.]

79
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,840
[It's up to you to, just say it.]

80
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
[I like you.]

81
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,510
[Don't wanna be just your friend.]

82
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,420
Uea's birthday.

83
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,289
Happy birthday!

84
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Happy birthday!

85
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,510
I wish you lots of happiness!

86
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,000
My dear friend.

87
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,580
Thank you.

88
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,610
So... what should we have for lunch?

89
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,160
Hmm.

90
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,580
How about Shabu?

91
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,860
Sure!

92
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,780
Er.

93
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,230
But I have to make merits at the temple first.

94
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,320
Um!

95
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,500
Wait for me here.

96
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,410
I'll take a bath and be right back.

97
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,450
Please come quickly.

98
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,170
Um.

99
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,800
How's it going, Tonkao?

100
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Uea, happy birthday!

101
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,550
Thank you.

102
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,140
I wish you a very happy birthday.

103
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
And... I love you lots.

104
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,750
Yes, I love you too.

105
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,500
So...

106
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,500
Will you come back home today?

107
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,730
I miss you so much.

108
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,290
Mom told me to convince you to come back.

109
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,060
It's your important day.

110
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,190
Why don't you come home once in a while?

111
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,910
Please come.

112
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,410
Er.

113
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,320
Then,

114
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,490
I'll go to the temple first...

115
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,330
and go home after that.

116
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,230
Okay.

117
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,200
Then I'll help mom cook a lot of dishes for you.

118
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,190
See you soon, Uea!

119
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,570
Alright.

120
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,830
See you soon.

121
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,790
Uea!

122
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
You finally came!

123
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,190
Stop./ Huh?/ Follow me.

124
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,620
Stay right here and keep your eyes closed

125
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,780
Close your eyes!

126
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,770
Um.

127
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,980
Don't cheat and wait for me here

128
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,110
Understand?/ Yes.

129
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,370
Hey!

130
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,780
Who say you can open your eyes?

131
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:21,830
Here you go!

132
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,050
Your birthday gift!

133
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,670
I put an effort to do it for you, Uea.

134
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,640
This is for me?

135
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,320
Uh Huh.

136
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,240
Thank you so much!

137
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
You can open it.

138
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,210
Happy birthday./ Here you come.

139
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,990
It took you long enough.

140
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,330
I cooked for a long time. Is no one going to help me?

141
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,060
Come on, Tonkao.

142
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:02,960
Hurry up!

143
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,840
Then I'll go help mom first.

144
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,110
Hurry!

145
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
(I love you the most! My dear brother!)

146
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,610
Uea?

147
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,880
You came.

148
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,210
I was waiting for you.

149
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,210
Huh? Long time no see.

150
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,160
Who's in the back?

151
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,200
Uea.

152
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,500
Have you been doing well, Uea?

153
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,000
Hm?

154
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,720
Yes.

155
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,060
Of course he's doing well.

156
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,880
He works in the office and receives a monthly salary.

157
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,100
We still need water.

158
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,030
Tonkao, go get it.

159
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,860
Get the water?

160
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Whose birthday is this? Why am I being used?

161
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,320
Uea, wait!

162
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,990
Let them get it for us.

163
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,110
Can you stop doing this to me?

164
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,730
Uea! Look at me!

165
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,680
F*ck you!

166
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,090
Uncle Sorn!

167
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,860
Uea.

168
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,670
Calm down.

169
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,450
Let's talk.

170
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,990
What are you going to do?!

171
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,180
Calm down.

172
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,560
It's nothing.

173
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,870
Help me!

174
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,440
Mom!

175
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Uea!

176
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:19,830
Uea!

177
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,370
You calm down first. Let's talk properly.

178
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,670
I haven't done anything.

179
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,850
Back off!

180
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,770
Uea.

181
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,430
I told you to back off!

182
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,270
Don't make it a big deal, Uea.

183
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,740
You f*cking back off!

184
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,630
I'll really stab you if you come closer!

185
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,900
Uea.

186
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,270
Mom.

187
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,670
What?

188
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,860
Uncle Sorn.

189
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,810
Just say it.

190
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,740
He sexually assaulted me.

191
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,740
Are you crazy, huh?

192
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,950
What did you just say? I'll hit you to death.

193
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,400
I'm telling the truth, mom.

194
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,530
Uncle Sorn sexually assaulted me.

195
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,810
Is it not enough to be homo alone?

196
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
Now you're dragging your father along with you?

197
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,540
Huh?

198
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,830
You need a beating.

199
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,880
Mom!/ I'll hit you to death!

200
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,380
Is it not enough for you to be homo alone?

201
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,890
Hey, wait! What're you doing?

202
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,260
He talked nonsense!

203
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,560
I told you the truth!

204
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,090
Huh?

205
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,920
Mom.

206
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,930
Come right here!

207
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,080
Mom!

208
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,350
Mom! Don't do this!/ Get in!

209
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,480
Mom! I beg you!/ Get in!

210
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Don't be too harsh, he'll get hurt.

211
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,610
Get inside and don't come out!

212
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,800
Do you have to do this?

213
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,600
Mom, I'm scared!

214
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,830
Hey, why do you have to go this far?

215
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,510
No!

216
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,170
What did our son do to deserve this?

217
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,420
Do you have any idea what he told me?

218
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,300
Mom, I'm sorry!

219
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,470
I said we need to talk.

220
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,600
Let go of me.

221
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,540
Let's have a good chat.

222
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,860
Ah.

223
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,850
Here is your water.

224
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,670
Why don't you sit down?

225
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,070
You too!

226
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:05,970
Er.

227
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,710
I'll get going.

228
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,540
Good bye.

229
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,420
I'm leaving, Tonkao.

230
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,020
Brother!

231
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,350
Uea!

232
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,320
Let me go!

233
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,440
Uea!

234
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,010
Look what you have done!

235
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,610
What the hell is wrong with him?

236
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,690
Uea!

237
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,690
Uea! Please wait!

238
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,570
Brother!

239
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,270
Uea.

240
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,890
I'm sorry...

241
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
for inviting you here.

242
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,400
It's not your fault.

243
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,270
Don't worry.

244
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,940
Go back to eat.

245
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,020
But it's your birthday.

246
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,240
Go back.

247
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,220
Okay, then.

248
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,650
Let's meet again next time.

249
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,540
You miss me?

250
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,080
Are you in your room?

251
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,380
Hm.

252
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,270
Are you coming?

253
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,160
Uea.

254
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,760
Is everything alright?

255
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,550
You look anxious.

256
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,950
A little bit.

257
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,440
Do you want to take a bath first?

258
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,230
It'll make you feel better.

259
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,370
Um.

260
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,570
Happy birthday to you.

261
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Happy birthday to you.

262
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,210
Happy birthday dear Anol.

263
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,890
Happy birthday to you.

264
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,500
Happy birthday to you.

265
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,030
Happy birthday to you.

266
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:36,300
Happy birthday happy birthday.

267
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:42,950
Happy birthday to you.

268
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,130
Now blow the candles!

269
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
Yes!

270
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,460
You're so good!/ I wish you all the happiness in the world!

271
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,800
Uea! Why are you standing idly here?

272
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,680
Can you see that I'm heavy? You should help me carry it!

273
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,180
Oops!

274
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,670
God damn!

275
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,950
Why did you let it go?

276
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,200
Happy birthday to...

277
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,340
Uea.

278
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,920
I wish you lots of happiness.

279
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Make a wish.

280
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,160
Happy birthday, Uea.

281
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,580
I'll blow the candles and stay with you tonight.

282
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,330
And if you need anything tomorrow,

283
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,000
Just tell me.

284
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,300
[You and me are just chilling]

285
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,990
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

286
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,110
[I don't wanna be your friend]

287
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,460
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

288
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,680
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

289
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,720
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

290
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,680
[I think I have crossed the line]

291
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,490
[You and me are just chilling]

292
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,880
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

293
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,880
[I don't wanna be your friend]

294
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,370
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

295
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,560
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

296
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:31,850
[Are we just friend no matter how much I love you?]

297
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,650
[I think I have crossed the line]

298
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,480
[Crossed the line]

299
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,760
Sleep some more.

300
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,210
I'll wake you up after finish bathing.

301
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,740
Shall we take a bath together?

302
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,770
It'll save a lot of time.

303
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,920
I surrender.

304
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,090
You go first.

305
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:33,780
Go.

306
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,840
Uea.

307
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,480
Is Pock still bothering you?

308
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,910
You punched him that hard.

309
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,660
He won't dare to mess with me anymore.

310
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,760
If he dares,

311
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,040
I'll let his father know about this.

312
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm going to take a bath.

313
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,330
Have you done your work, Jade?

314
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,850
Almost there.

315
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,230
Have you done your work, Jade?

316
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,430
I said "Almost". Don't ask me too much.

317
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,450
Ouch!

318
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,070
I almost there!

319
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,280
King~

320
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,340
What should we do tonight?

321
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,170
Hm?

322
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,090
Umm.

323
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,970
Mong-Kol!!!

324
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,750
Ah! Yeah Yeah Yeah. I'm working!

325
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,000
Gun!/ Ahhh.

326
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,210
Mongkol!

327
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,440
Calm down!

328
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:21,800
Nooo.

329
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,170
Ahhh

330
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,140
Nooo

331
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,140
Hmmm

332
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,320
Bas~

333
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,780
Let's have dinner with me.

334
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,650
What're you doing?

335
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,140
Ahhh.

336
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,930
Ummmm.

337
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,900
Um.

338
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,110
Ahhh.

339
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,000
So tired.

340
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,680
What happened?

341
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,420
Hm?

342
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,900
Hmm.

343
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:57,590
It's about my mom.

344
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,640
She called me to come home.

345
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,450
Do you have any plans this weekend?

346
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,060
Umm.

347
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,550
Nope.

348
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,000
Can I go to your room?

349
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,280
What?

350
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,100
Don't you come home?

351
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,909
You told me your mom wants you to.

352
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,870
Yes, she wants me to.

353
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,300
But, I don't.

354
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,370
She's a grumpy lady.

355
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,600
Why I have to come home?

356
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,280
Er.

357
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:49,900
Do you have any problems with your family?

358
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,440
Not exactly.

359
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,390
It's my brother.

360
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,850
He's a perfectionist.

361
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,490
so, my mom wanted me to be like him.

362
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,290
Er. Uea.

363
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,210
For the company outing,

364
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,110
Hm?

365
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,040
Let's sleep together.

366
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,760
Bring Jade stay with Gun.

367
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,170
and I'll stay with you.

368
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,560
Sit first.

369
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,260
I'm tired.

370
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,010
Hm.

371
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,990
Please~

372
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,150
Feed me~

373
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,220
[Outing]

374
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,140
Muay didn't join us, so who's gonna take pictures for me?

375
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,240
Sis, Look at me!

376
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,800
How can you overlook me? I'll take care of you!

377
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,090
No.

378
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,600
No No way.// Come on, Sis!

379
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,010
Hmmmm. No way.

380
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:14,980
Bas.

381
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,210
Why can't we go abroad for this trip?

382
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,390
Er.

383
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,340
Errr.

384
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,260
Come on.

385
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,430
We've gotta save cost for now.

386
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,150
Since we couldn't reach the goal.

387
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:26,550
but...

388
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,000
It's not about the place.

389
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,040
It's about people you go with!

390
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,560
Hahaha.

391
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,130
Right?

392
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,640
Yeah.

393
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,380
Let's check in first.

394
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,380
Of course...Ka.

395
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,200
What an excuse!

396
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,220
He always keep saying

397
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,820
couldn't reach the goal!

398
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,090
saving the cost!

399
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,280
Every year!

400
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,120
Wanna change?

401
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,160
of what?

402
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:45,860
of the job.

403
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,460
No.

404
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,510
No. No way.

405
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,500
I'm poor.

406
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,950
Let's selfie, Sis // Yeah!

407
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,130
Need help?

408
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,680
No.

409
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,510
Nahhh. Come on!

410
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,700
Enough. Hey!

411
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,500
It's hurt!

412
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,500
Ouch!

413
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,180
Aye!

414
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,680
Hey!

415
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,370
Ah! Gun! I'm sorry!

416
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,840
Are you okay?

417
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,080
What're you doing?

418
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,430
He wants to help me.

419
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,050
but, I don't need his help.

420
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,810
so, It turned out like this.

421
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,680
Did you get hurt?

422
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,480
Come on.

423
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,430
Ah. Get him the bandage first.

424
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,360
Ahhh.

425
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,230
Umm

426
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,800
Hurry up. Get him the bandage.

427
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,820
What're you guys playing?

428
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,860
Hey! Hold him tight.

429
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:41,740
Ummm

430
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,520
Gun.

431
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,940
Is it hurt?

432
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,270
Yeah, pretty much.

433
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,510
Woah.

434
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,800
Are you alright?

435
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,000
If not, I'll take you to the hospital.

436
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,350
Hospital?

437
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,780
Ouchhhh.

438
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,440
Gun.

439
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,310
But, I think...

440
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,210
Hey! Hey! Shhh.

441
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:02,920
No! Your wound.

442
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,330
wasn't that big.

443
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,000
Trust me, you'll be alright.

444
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,960
I knew from my experience.

445
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,430
Here. // Oh!

446
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,440
Sorry.

447
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,320
Is it hurt a lot?

448
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,590
Ohh.

449
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,620
Abracadabra!

450
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,870
Get well soon, good boy!

451
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,630
Jade.

452
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,510
You should stay with Gun tonight.

453
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,380
What?

454
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,280
Why?

455
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,300
He's your responsibility.

456
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,710
You can't blame on me.

457
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,810
Um. Yeah Yeah.

458
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,580
Yeah. Umm.

459
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,330
I agree.

460
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,890
You should take care of me for the whole trip.

461
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,730
Er. Alright.

462
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,230
I know.

463
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,040
Ueaa.

464
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:44,780
Hm?

465
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,600
Can you stay with King tonight?

466
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,140
but // Sure!

467
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,770
Right?

468
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,150
Hmmmm.

469
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,170
Get well soon!

470
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,380
Why smiling?

471
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,550
I'm glad to have the single bed.

472
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,450
Ah.

473
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,670
I'll sleep on that side.

474
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,450
It's mine.

475
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,410
so, what?

476
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:43,880
Hey.

477
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,140
Where're you going?

478
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,370
You said you're gonna sleep this side.

479
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,180
I'll sleep in the same side with you.

480
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,280
No way.

481
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,530
If not,

482
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,260
I won't let you go anywhere.

483
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,820
or...

484
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,460
Wanna do something fun?

485
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,280
Do you like sea?

486
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,140
Kind of.

487
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,740
but, I preferred the calm one.

488
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,030
I do too.

489
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,700
so, where's your normally go?

490
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,420
Ummmmm.

491
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,110
Have you been visited to Lampang?

492
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,000
Nope.

493
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,350
There's attractions in Lampang?

494
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,480
of course.

495
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,940
It's me.

496
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,310
so,

497
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,140
let's go now.

498
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,180
I'm kidding!

499
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,950
There's the park.

500
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:37,900
waterfall.

501
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,250
Many beautiful places.

502
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,520
Not too crowded.

503
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,730
I'm in since It's including you.

504
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,430
I'm kidding.

505
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,160
and...

506
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,510
You often go to Lampang?

507
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,350
I have the cousins in Lampang.

508
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,850
I lived there when I was a kid.

509
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,460
but, we don't keep in touch anymore.

510
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,710
Next time, let's go together.

511
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,130
Work hard, Play hard!

512
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,900
Maybe play harder!

513
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,580
Yeahhh! Cheers!

514
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,080
Wooo

515
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,780
King, cheers!

516
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,670
King!

517
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,400
Cheers!

518
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,680
Hey! // Let me find Uea first.

519
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,820
Ah.

520
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,320
Er.

521
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,120
Come on, Everyone!

522
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:07,850
Yeah.

523
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:08,350
Yeah. Yeah.

524
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:09,150
Everyone,

525
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,840
Cheers!!!

526
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,480
Woo!

527
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,590
Bottoms up!

528
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,790
Nice to meet you.

529
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:30,390
Cheers.

530
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:36,450
so...

531
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,870
You have plans for tonight on Samui?

532
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:39,890
I'm not sure.

533
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:42,870
What's your name?

534
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,820
Lilo.

535
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:44,550
Lilo?

536
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,030
Oh, so nice.

537
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:46,750
Uea.

538
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:49,550
Hm?

539
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:50,890
You're drunk.

540
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,410
Come home.

541
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,060
Noooo.

542
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:01,630
Come home!

543
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,250
I don't wanna come home. Why?

544
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,840
I don't anyone to look at you.

545
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,410
Huhhhh?

546
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,680
[sigh]

547
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:15,940
See you, Lilo.

548
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,100
Hm.

549
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,980
Let me go!

550
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:23,370
Enough!

551
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,280
Don't be too fast. I can't follow you!

552
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,230
Hurry up, Uea!

553
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:31,940
Hey! Hey!

554
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,490
Ah!

555
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,050
Ummm.

556
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:42,860
Uea!

557
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:43,950
Hm?

558
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,540
My mom just called me.

559
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:12,630
She wanted me to go on a date.

560
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,020
Do you want me to go?

561
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,990
Ah. I want to introduce him for you guys...

562
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,160
Krit.

563
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,490
My niece.

564
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,250
Are you a graphic designer?

565
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,320
Yes, I do.

566
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,380
I'm good at coding, but the graphic things...

567
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,160
I've gotta need your helps a lot.

568
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:28,800
Let's keep in touch.

569
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,020
[You and me are just chilling]

570
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,110
[but I'm thinking much more than that]

571
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,560
[I don't wanna be your friend]

572
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,030
[Can we change into a boyfriend?]

573
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:50,180
[Am I just a home only when you feel alone?]

574
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:55,760
