EPISODE 1
AN UNEXPECTED TWIST

10
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,639
KOOK'S SEAFOOD HOUSE

11
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,902
KOOK'S SEAFOOD HOUSE
CEO KOOK SU-JIN

12
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,447
So I, um, made business cards.

13
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,991
-Ooh.

14
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,535
I'm super jealous.
Twenty-one and a CEO already.

15
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,038
Now that you're the boss,
you can pick your hours, huh?

16
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,415
Maybe you could help my mom.
Her back is pretty bad.

17
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,627
If you're so worried about your mother,
then why you moving all the way to Seoul?

18
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,630
The drive to school from here
has been a lot.

19
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,757
Now that my sister isn't in the hospital,

20
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,344
I can live closer to school
and utilize that time better.

21
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,514
Hey, Kooksu.

22
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,766
Thank you.

23
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,768
Take care of my mom, you hear?

24
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,311
Don't worry about it, okay?

25
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,944
If, by any chance, while you're in Seoul,
you happen to see Doona,

26
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,696
dude, you gotta call me, all right?

27
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,073
Yeah, right.
Like that would ever happen.

28
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,951
WHEN THE ANSWERS INCLUDE
VERBS AND NON-VERBS

29
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,746
Verbs are in the middle.
Nouns are… in front.

30
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,541
Oh, sorry about that.

31
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,872
LOVE AND DO WHAT YOU WILL

32
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,346
Hello there.

33
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,223
-Oh.

34
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,724
It worked.

35
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,575
Hey, uh, you look familiar.
Do we know each other at all?

36
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,914
Oh, uh, I guess not.

37
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,960
I think I had you confused
with someone I once knew.

38
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,754
I'm sorry about that.

39
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,299
Ah, just so you know,
I'm the new tenant on the second floor.

40
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,717
I hope we become great neighbors.

41
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,387
This is actually the first time
that I have left home.

42
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,908
PLEASE KNOCK

43
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,451
Oh.

44
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,499
Hi, I'm Lee Won-jun.
I'm the new tenant upstairs.

45
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,710
Here. Please review the house rules.

46
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,628
HOUSE RULES

47
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,672
Specifically, number seven,
the laundry guidelines.

48
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,677
Since you're upstairs,
you do your laundry on the rooftop, okay?

49
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,516
-Is that clear?
-Yes, it is. It's very clear, sir.

50
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,526
Oh.

51
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,821
-Newbie?
-Uh, yes.

52
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,407
-It's really nice to meet--
-I'm a senior and a psych major.

53
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,201
Taek, Taek, I'm Yun-taek.

54
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,412
Seo Yun-taek.

55
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,625
Okay, cool. So I'm Lee Won-jun,
second year, civil engineering.

56
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,794
You have nothing to worry about here,
so let's just say

57
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,421
you can just be yourself, freely.

58
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,881
Live free, Won-jun.

59
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,257
Okay?

60
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,175
Uh-huh.

61
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:06,801
Ah.

62
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,261
Welcome.

63
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,393
-Huh?

64
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,561
Oh jeez.

65
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,561
Whoa! Ah! No, wait!
Don't fall. Don't fall.

66
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,771
Where are you going, huh?

67
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,024
-Oh jeez.
- Ah!

68
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,986
Ay! Oh! Oh!

69
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,279
Ow! Ow! What the heck?

70
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,324
-Oh! Ah! Ah!

71
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,715
This goes here.

72
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,758
There we go.

73
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,266
This looks great.

74
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,232
Organic pumpkin, huh?

Oh, that's great.

-Here you go.
- Thank you.

82
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,214
Hmm.

83
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,132
Hey, do you see that boy's hoodie?

84
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,010
He must be a superfan, huh?
Why would he wear that outside?

85
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,262
-It's kind of cute, right?
-Obviously, cute.

86
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,685

89
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,601
Hey, bro!

90
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,895
Get ready to bow and kiss my feet, bro!

91
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,104
Kiss your feet?

92
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,816
Someone's willing to pay
800,000 won for tutoring?

93
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,318
Yeah, isn't that great?

94
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,194
Every month and that's just for math.

95
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,404
Isn't this freaking sweet?

96
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,156
Uh, yeah. Can't believe it at all.

97
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,075

00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,403

You're Lee Doona! Dream Sweet!

00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,627

-You really expect me to believe that?
-What?

00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,882
Sorry, but what did you mean by that?

Seriously! You're a joke!

Oh! Are you insane?
That could've really hurt!

Wow, you act like a child.

135
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,356
What's that?

136
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,151
-So how did you know I live here, huh?
-Well, I didn't.

Where's your spy cam?
It's around here, right?

What are you hoping to see?

139
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,368
You're here 'cause you're stalking me,
isn't that right?

140
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,746
Listen, I'm not a stalker. I swear.

141
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,082
I have a friend who's a superfan.
That's why I recognize you. I promise.

142
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,669
Look, I'm sorry. I'll stop talking.

143
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,801

144
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,179

In terms of math, I'm certain
you won't find a tutor that's better.

148
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,663
And my expertise
is a result of my experience as a tutor.

149
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,290
I'm truly confident.

150
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,628
I think you're quite earnest, hmm?
I appreciate that.

151
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,091
Then, um, can I start
the tutoring lessons next week?

152
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,926
Mm-hmm.

153
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,263
- Oh, Mr. Lee!
-Yes?

154
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,518
You, uh… you forgot this.

Oh, Won-jun, hey.

160
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,137
It's been a while, hasn't it, Jin-ju?

161
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,521
Ah. Mmm.

162
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,107
I almost didn't recognize you
because your hair is much shorter.

163
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,026
Oh, really?
It's been like this for over a year.

-Exactly.
-Ah.

Uh, for the record,
short hair suits you well.

167
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,127
So where are you staying?
Are you still commuting here?

168
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,213
I was until last year.
Now I share a co-ed house nearby.

00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,510
Oh, that's too bad.
I thought we could ride here together.

Round trip, it's five hours.

172
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,931
I'll probably go crazy commuting alone.

00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,391
What do you mean?

00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,602

I finally got in. Where's the congrats?

177
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,901
Oh, right. Uh…

178
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,486
Cheers!

179
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,200
It's snowing.

180
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,752
-It's so chilly.
-Uh…

181
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,545
- Mmm.

182
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,841
- Here.
-Oh, uh, are you sure?

183
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,135
Take it. It's cold. And it's snowing too.

184
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,138
All right. Thank you.

185
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,686
-Nice to know you're still a sweet guy.

186
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,776
Mmm, that's mine.

187
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,781
And that's mine.

188
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,949
KOREAN TUTOR FOR CSAT

189
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,575
Oh, so you're the competition then.

190
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,410
We've always been competitors, haven't we?

191
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,162
Even though I've never won yet.

192
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,543
Hmm.

193
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,382
Anyway, how about we
get together more often

194
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,758
since we're at the same school?

195
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,926
Mmm, I'd like that.

196
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,344
-Hmm.

197
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,180
Oh, that's my bus.

198
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,767
-I'll see you later.

199
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,333
Hmm.

200
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,172
KOREAN TUTOR FOR CSAT
MINSONG KOR LIT FRESHMAN

201
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,678
Is she okay in this cold?

202
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,832
-Hey!
-Uh, yes?

203
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,176
Don't ever sing my song again.

204
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,845
Just so you know,
you're a horrible singer.

205
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,393
If you so much as hum a lyric
of my song ever again, I'll…

206
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,603
I'm gonna have to smash your head in.
You got it?

207
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,979
Hmm, smash my head?

208
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,947
Whoa! Oh!

209
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,698
Uh, hey.

210
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,367
Can you hear me? Are you okay?

211
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,294
Uh, hi.
I'm at 21 Minsongdae Road.

212
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,088
Someone passed out here.
She's unconscious.

213
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,590
Please get here as soon as you can.

214
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,717
Please hurry. Get here quickly.

215
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,511
Yes, thank you. Yes.

216
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,582
JOB HUNTING STUDY GROUP

217
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,543
Is this applicable only to seniors?

218
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,463
- Hey.
-Oh!

219
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,715
Oh! You're awake.

220
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,216
You're at the hospital right now.

221
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,804
Oh, the, uh… the nurse
asked for you emergency contact earlier.

222
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,183
I've got nobody.

223
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:10,936
Well,

224
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,398
you really should call your family, then.

225
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,650
There's nobody, dude.

226
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,695
Uh, how about your… manager, or--

227
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,197
There's fucking nobody, okay?

228
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,538
How come you're swearing?
People are around.

229
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,915
Yeah, what's your point?

230
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,584
-You don't swear at all?
-No, I don't at all.

231
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,545
I'm also not a celebrity, unlike someone.

232
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,756
Yeah, well, I'm not now either.

233
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,016
Miss Lee Doona, is your next of kin here?

234
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,061
Miss Lee Doona.

235
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,022
Uh, so… so I'm her sibling, actually.

236
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,857
You can speak to me about everything.

237
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,526
Could you please come with me, then?

238
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:08,202
Thanks to your quick action,
there are no complications at this time.

239
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,996
However, her body temperature
is a bit on the low side,

240
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,625
so please make sure her head,
hands, and feet always stay warm.

241
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,419
Have her use a dry blanket,
and most importantly,

242
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,797
make sure she always
has socks on her feet.

243
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,175
Having her drink warm beverages
will also help the recovery process.

244
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,301
Okay, got it.

245
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,930
Oh, also, could she be having
any internal problems at all?

246
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,599
Do you know
if she'll need other prognostic testing?

247
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,686
No, no further tests
are required at this time.

248
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,356
Oh, sorry, do you have
a phone charger I maybe could borrow?

249
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,942
- Uh, just a moment.
- Thank you.

250
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,121
They said you needed socks.

251
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,209
-I'd prefer if you put them on for me.
-I should?

252
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,503
You're my sibling.

253
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,257
Um, right.

254
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,266
Okay, just bear with me.

255
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,159
It'll be just a little longer. Sorry.

256
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,289
Huh?

257
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,295
They didn't have
any normal sleeping socks?

258
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,254
What's that?

259
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,965
You couldn't find proper bed socks
that were more plain?

260
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,676
-I prefer my belongings to look ordinary.

261
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,554
What's funny?

262
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,556
Um, oh, nothing.

263
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,518
You claim you prefer ordinary things,
but it's strange

264
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,646
because you're not
an ordinary girl at all.

265
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,776
Did you know… sleeping socks sometimes
make you sweat more during the night?

266
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,778
That can make you feel colder.

267
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,446
So these will be better for you.

268
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,573
Anyway, the other socks were
old-men socks,

269
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,949
so pink was the best option.

270
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,963
So, by the way, what's your name,
my fake sibling?

271
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,047
Who, me?

272
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,763
Uh, that's personal information.

273
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,616
KOOK SU-JIN

274
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,869
Hey, Kooksu.

275
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,205
Hey, when did you begin smoking?

276
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,206
Huh?

277
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,125
I don't smoke, okay?

278
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,668
Why do you ask?

279
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:06,380
My mom's friend said to tell you
to forget about the tutoring gig.

280
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,758
-What?
- You jackass!

281
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,302
She asked me to confirm
that you're not a smoker three times,

282
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,846
I told her you don't over and over.

283
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,098
But then, she told me
she had picked up your scarf,

284
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,599
and it reeked of cigarettes.

285
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,156
I can't believe this happened.

286
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,450
All that money just gone.

287
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,754
YOUR ITEM HAS BEEN DELIVERED

288
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,892
Hi, Won-jun.

289
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,522
Did you have breakfast yet?

290
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,524
If not,
why don't we share a meal together?

291
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:11,320
Wait, uh…
Hey, is that my package by any chance?

292
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,990
Oh.

293
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:20,954
What did you buy, huh?

294
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,165
It's something super cushy, right?

295
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,542
No, but why would you sit
on someone else's package?

296
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,545
Oh, I'm starving right now.
So what should we get?

297
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,005
I'm going inside now.

298
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,055
Hmm?

299
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,769
And that was the day
she started waiting for me.

300
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,153
- Oh!
-Hi, Won-jun. Have you had breakfast yet?

301
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,239
There's a tteokbokki place.
Let's go, yeah?

302
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:57,825
Hey, Won-jun!

303
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,622
Let's share a combo meal.

304
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,999
-Won-jun! Come on! Let's eat!

305
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,348
She's driving me crazy.

306
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,021
Oh, crap, she's here.

307
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,439
Good evening.

308
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,235
Uh, good evening.

309
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,613
If you're here to do some laundry,
go ahead. Don't mind me.

310
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,015
Uh…

311
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,985
Oh! Uh, oh, this?

312
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,237
I had bought this for my friend
as his birthday present.

313
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,156
He let me borrow it,
but I need to return it.

314
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,783
And I only had it on that day
because it was super cold

315
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,410
and the fleece lining kept me warm.

316
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,369
Was I speaking?

317
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,747
-I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
- I won't.

318
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,958
You said you're not a fan.
So you're not a fan.

319
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,553
You dress well
for a civil engineering major, you know?

320
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,681
Does your girlfriend
help you choose your outfits?

321
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,308
No, I don't have one yet.

322
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,897
I'm hungry. Should we grab something?

323
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,527
Um… well, there's something
I wanna ask first.

324
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,156
Mmm… so are you, um,

325
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,783
maybe falling for me?

326
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,826
Because it's starting
to feel like you are.

327
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,957
If so, please don't fall for me.

328
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,084
Really,
it's making me uncomfortable, okay?

329
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,638
What's so funny? Why are you laughing?

330
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,183
Won-jun, you're hilarious.

331
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,897
Ah, it's been a long time
since I've laughed.

332
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,402
-Hey.
-Yes?

333
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,364
I won't end up falling for you.
It's never happening, okay?

334
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,408
Well, that was unnecessary to say.

335
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,538
Let's just hang out.
I wanna be your friend, okay?

336
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,541
Oh, you do? But why?

337
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,126
Because I don't have any here.

338
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,587
Well, uh…

339
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,881
Oh, um, well,
the whole downstairs is all girls.

340
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,591
You can ask one of them to be your friend.

341
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,344
Downstairs? The entire floor is all mine.

342
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,974
Wow, you're pretty loaded.
Now I very much wanna be your best friend.

343
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,809
You mean it?
I can call you whenever I want?

344
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,019
Uh, you can't, no.

345
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:13,520
You're a tough nut to crack.

346
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,730
Yes, I suppose that's true.

347
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,942
I guess there's no hope then.

348
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:22,154
If a superfan or stalker attacks me
and I die, it'll be all your fault, hmm?

349
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,741
-Wait, but how would it be my fault?
- The sun's coming up.

350
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,617
I have to make a wish now.
Stop bothering me.

351
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,369
Now hold on.
Who was bothering who first?

352
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,971
I can't.

353
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,557
- Hey.
-Huh?

354
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,851
You forgot your underwear.

355
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,770
Huh? Uh…

356
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,075
I really wish I could move out.

357
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,296
Hmm?

358
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,141
Kim Jin-ju!

359
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,100
Jin-ju!

360
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,519
- Hey, Jin-ju!
- Sorry we're late.

361
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,062
-Let's eat.
- Is it good?

362
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,482
Uh, what does "meh" mean?

363
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,863
Lee Won-jun.

364
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,242
-Hey.
-Oh.

365
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,537
You didn't hear?
I was calling you.

366
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,498
-I forgot to give back your scarf.
-You can hold onto that.

367
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,500
No, it's okay. It smells like cigarettes.

368
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,502
-Ah.
- Oh.

369
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,756
Hey, let me take a look for you.

370
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,477
Mmm, you got it.

371
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,648
See you later.

372
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,108
Mm-hmm.

373
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,361
- Who was that? Who was that?
-What? Who?

374
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,864
-Who is he?
-Oh, stop. Just someone I know.

375
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,449
Too cute to just be someone.

376
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,618
It looked like you guys
definitely had chemistry.

377
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,578
"Just someone I know."

378
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,334
Can't you just tell her I don't smoke?

379
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,711
This friend I have…
Ah! No! What am I saying?

380
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,338
This strange girl at my place…

381
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,840
Ah, man, I don't smoke, okay?

382
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,509
Already?

383
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,845
She found a tutor?

384
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,889
Ten total.
That'll be 70,000 won, please.

385
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,059
-There you go. Thank you.
- Yes, thanks.

386
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,337
PART-TIMERS WANTED
RECRUITING STAFF MEMBERS FOR CAFÉ 1890

387
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,048
Hello, sir.

388
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,387
- Take it down.
-What?

389
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,222
You better take it down.

390
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,432
Oh, can I not hang these flyers here?

391
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,894
Don't you know you need a little stamp
like this, and it's not free.

392
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,105
You think you can post stuff
without permission, huh?

393
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,423
Tutoring? That's a piece of cake.

394
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:56,136
Ladies and gentlemen,
Yangjin's top brain! Our greatest tutor!

395
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,471
Lee Won-jun!

396
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,472
Whoo!

397
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,475
So I'll come visit, okay?

398
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,604
What for? Don't forget to take
the organic pumpkin juice with you.

399
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,314
It's in the refrigerator, okay?

400
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,150
Hey, Won-jun!

401
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,109
Huh?

402
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,570
If you get a girlfriend, send pics, okay?

403
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,447
Get back inside! It's freezing!

404
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,741
And make sure
you take your medicine on time!

405
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:35,717
Oh!

406
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:40,096
MATH TUTOR

407
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,474
Hmm?

408
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,604
Um, yes, hello?

409
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,731
Hello? Are you there?

410
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,860
Hello.
I got your phone number from your flier.

411
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,029
Yes. Yes. How can I help you?

412
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,073
By any chance, I was wondering

413
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,741
if you would be able to

414
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,745
go out for a meal with me sometime?

415
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,916
Hey!

416
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,001
MATH TUTOR

417
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,931
Are you still mad?

418
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,724
Not at all.

419
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,518
You're still mad. I can totally tell.

420
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,771
Hey, you can be mad at me.
I wanna see what you're like.

421
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,107
Although, I don't know why you're angry.

422
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,651
Didn't you put the fliers up
so people would give you a call?

423
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:36,986
Doona, listen.

424
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,950
Are you, like, crazy bored or what?
Is this some kind of joke or something?

425
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:46,121
You can do almost anything you want to
because you have all the money and time

426
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,580
and don't need to work like I do.

427
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,749
You don't have to care
about how you live your life.

428
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,959
Congratulations.

429
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,838
Guess what, though. Not everyone
has the same luxury as you do.

430
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,298
I desperately need a job
and need to study hard for my career.

431
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,425
Don't you get it?

432
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,969
I have so much on my plate at the moment.

433
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,720
So if you have any ounce of decency,

434
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,890
can you just leave me alone and stop
following me around like a lost girl.

435
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,437
I don't find any of this
the slightest bit amusing.

436
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,400
That was disappointing. Seriously.

437
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,318
I expected more, Won-jun.

438
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,612
You're pretty terrible at…

439
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,197
at getting mad, hmm?

440
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,950
But I understand everything.

441
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,487
-Oh.

442
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,537
Uh, hello?

443
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,378
Miss Doona, are you here?

444
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,466
Um… how about we get a meal
sometime in the near future?

445
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,301
Like, um, whenever you feel like it.

446
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:07,053
And I'll treat you.

447
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,682
Well, when I get a tutoring gig.

448
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,648
-Oh jeez. My goodness.

449
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:36,541
The presumed value of Vb
is pointing downwards,

450
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,835
so we calculate it as a negative value.

451
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,005
Under the condition
that the aggregate force equals zero,

452
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,966
Vb comes out to 75 newtons.

453
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,969
Now, we'll move on to the bending moment.

454
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,180
To calculate that, we need to calculate
the aggregate bending moment

455
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:54,684
that applies to point B under
the condition of the equilibrium equation,

456
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,644
The aggregate bending moment
at point B is zero.

457
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,105
A positive direction
means a clockwise direction.

458
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,567
Let's look at all the individual
bending moments being applied to point B.

459
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,529
The reaction force of 120 newtons
applying to point A

460
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,823
rotates clockwise in relations to point B.

461
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,075
Therefore,
we leave it as a positive direction.

462
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,829
Since the reaction force of
the triangle above is directed downward,

463
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,456
it rotates counterclockwise…

464
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,207
-I'm hungry. Let's eat.
-Huh? Um, now?

465
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,418
Well, you said whenever, remember?

466
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,086
And I wanna eat now.

467
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,380
…newtons on 120 times three

468
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,883
in relation to point B,
so we can write it like so.

469
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,469
As for the weight of the triangle above,

470
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,804
the area of the triangle translates to…

471
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:36,059
Well, um, I think we might need to wait
until after class is done.

472
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,896
…the distance between
the point of action and point B,

473
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,106
where, in the case of a triangle,
the point of action…

474
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,274
So what are we gonna eat?

475
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,799
Ever notice not everyone
recognizes you in public?

476
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,758
Hmm.

477
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,679
Dressed like I am now,
a lot of people don't recognize me at all.

478
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,390
Remember you didn't, huh?

479
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,227
Well, that's because, um,
it felt so divorced from reality.

480
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,361
From now on, I'll call you.

481
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,279
Is that all right?

482
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,115
Well, actually,

483
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,033
sure, if it's urgent.

484
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,136
So listen, just in case,

485
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,847
don't fall for me either, all right?

486
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,181
Who, me?

487
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,810
I don't think
that's going to be an issue at all.

488
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,606
I guess we'll see.

489
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,741
Life always has
its unexpected twists.

490
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,668
You once said to me

491
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,631
that you and I
come from two completely different worlds.

492
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,936
That you never could've imagined
we would ever cross paths.

493
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:15,968
So to find ourselves
sitting side by side was purely by chance.

494
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,012
Or maybe even an act of destiny.

495
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:31,609
RECENT CALLS

DOONA

498
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,995
You may be right
that we met by chance.

499
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:43,913
LEE DOONA

500
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,135
But I'm still happy…

501
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,598
you were the one I met.
