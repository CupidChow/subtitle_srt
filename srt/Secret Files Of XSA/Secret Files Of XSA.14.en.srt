00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,790
A bomb?

3
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,000
Thanks.

4
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,790
This is a pendant of Lady Liberty.

5
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,240
It symbolizes freedom.

00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,240
Please get your license.

9
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,280
What are these electronic parts for?

10
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,240
Gotta check them out.

11
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,740
(Police)

12
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,860
Get off work early and visit your mom.

13
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,120
I know.

14
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,500
Sir, routine inspection ahead.

15
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,270
Please get your license and registration.

16
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,460
Boss, done.

17
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,150
If you can't handle your job,

18
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,870
just get lost!

19
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,910
Fine, I will.

20
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,710
You do your job, and I'll do mine.

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You reckless fool!

22
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm a grown-up man now.

23
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,710
I'm ready to fight

24
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,400
for you on the frontlines.

25
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,000
From now on, I'll follow your lead at work.

26
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,190
But in life, you need to listen to me

27
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,120
and get back in shape.

28
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,470
Okay, I'll listen to you.

29
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,310
Really?

30
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,560
You promise?

31
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,470
I promise.

32
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,750
Here, let's pinky swear.

33
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,800
Okay.

34
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,220
Keqing,

35
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,310
Dad passed away.

36
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,190
In this world,

37
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,560
I have no family left.

38
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,440
I stayed here all night,

39
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,000
lay down all night,

40
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,040
and cried all night.

41
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,870
No matter how I acted out,

42
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,630
no one in the house

43
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,070
even scolded me.

44
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,180
Keqing,

45
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,700
meeting you for the first time

46
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,300
was the biggest surprise of my life.

47
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,780
It's like fate smiled on me.

48
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,620
I still clearly remember

49
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,740
the hotel room number where we met.

50
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,340
If I could make a wish,

51
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,940
I would wish I'd met you sooner.

52
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,660
Maybe everything would be different.

53
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,460
Keqing,

54
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,580
in this world,

55
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,340
the only person I can trust

56
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,740
is you.

57
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,180
Why?

58
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,980
Because you made me feel something real.

59
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,740
But I lied to you.

60
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,340
It doesn't matter.

61
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,340
I've been to that Japanese eatery.

62
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,620
Keqing,

63
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,740
promise me,

64
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,700
you'll never leave me,

65
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,460
okay?

66
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,500
Jin,

67
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,780
I don't need to stress
Azure One's importance.

68
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,980
Lin Yasheng is too young,
and he's not a tech expert,

69
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,660
while Gao is

70
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,260
too old to keep up with the development.

71
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,980
Although you stepped down
from the administrative role

72
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,570
and I've figured out the explosion,

73
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,050
I'll report to the board...

74
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,260
Come in.

75
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,340
Jin, that's all for today.

76
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,700
I need to meet a friend.

77
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,540
I'll take my leave then.

78
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,820
Thank you, Deputy Mayor Jiang.

79
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,900
I trust you'll handle things well.

80
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,540
Thanks, I will.

81
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,180
Okay, see him off.

82
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,500
We're such a big company,

83
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,380
but Mr. Lin's memorial is so low-key.

84
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,000
This is kinda pathetic, isn't it?

85
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,290
The board wanted to keep it simple

86
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,850
since Azure One is at a crucial stage.

87
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,340
Alright, get back to work.

88
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,860
Mr. Gao,

89
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,780
you've been really good to Mr. Lin.

90
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,340
Even real brothers aren't that close.

91
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,740
Shoulong and I worked together
for over 20 years,

92
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,180
side by side, to get here.

93
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,340
I never thought

94
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,700
he'd passed away just like that.

95
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,490
Mr. Gao,

96
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,260
now that Mr. Lin's gone,

97
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,420
no one here has more experience
or reputation than you.

98
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,430
You need to lead everyone

99
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,060
and keep moving forward.

100
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,820
Has Deputy Mayor Jiang's
schedule been confirmed?

101
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,860
Isn't that the board's decision?

102
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,780
What does Deputy Mayor Jiang
have to do with this?

103
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,860
Shoulong Group has been

104
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,270
personally supported by Deputy Mayor Jiang.

105
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,430
His opinion carries serious weight

106
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,990
with the board.

107
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,940
Plus, he's the one who

108
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,460
pushed through the new energy project.

109
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,820
The whole future of
Shoulong Group rides on this.

110
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,060
So you tell me, does he
have something to do with this?

111
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,180
Where's Vice President Jin?

112
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,580
He's at the city hall.

113
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,500
(Jincheng Municipal Government)

114
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,420
Gao, have a seat.

115
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,140
Deputy Mayor Jiang,

116
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,260
please help Shoulong Group.

117
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,020
What's wrong, Gao? Take your time.

118
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,250
Since President Lin passed away,

119
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,820
Shoulong Group's been leaderless

120
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,820
and in chaos.

121
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,050
Gapung is watching us closely.

122
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,900
I'm worried if this keeps up,

123
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,860
the whole Shoulong Group could be ruined.

124
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,820
Right now, we need someone

125
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,790
who can stabilize the situation.

126
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,580
Do you have any ideas?

127
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,980
I just saw Jin Chuan here.

128
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,460
Technically, he's the best expert we have.

129
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,300
But in management,

130
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,190
especially dealing with Gapung,

131
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,470
I'm not sure he's right for Shoulong.

132
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,500
Alright, I understand.

133
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,690
I'll have the board to consider it carefully.

134
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,020
Deputy Mayor Jiang, I...

135
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,660
Do you have a good candidate?

136
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,740
Not at the moment.

137
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,180
Actually, I did think about Jin Chuan,

138
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,940
but after thinking it over and over,

139
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,460
I don't think he's
the right fit for the role.

140
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,700
Okay, I've got it.

141
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,940
I'll suggest it to the board.

142
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,260
Okay.

143
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,020
Then, that's it for today?

144
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,420
Okay, I'll take my leave.

145
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,340
(I don't think I get a chance
based on Jiang's response.)

146
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,420
(Viper)
Pull yourself together.

147
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,260
It just got started.

148
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,980
(First-Aid Center)

149
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,460
(Operating Room)

150
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,420
My precious girl's out there,

151
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,100
doing such dangerous work.

152
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,420
Tell me, what mother

153
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,260
wouldn't be scared to tears?

154
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,540
Tang Tang.

155
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,610
Ma'am, are you looking for something tangy?

156
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,380
Take care.

157
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,060
Aren't your national security
office jobs 9-to-5?

158
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,940
How come you're working late now?

159
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,540
It's so late at night.

160
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,780
If you're hiding something,
I won't let it go.

161
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,700
Dig in.

162
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,260
You're not eating?

163
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,100
You made me lose my appetite. I'm not eating.

164
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,540
Seems like we both have secrets

165
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,740
and things we have to bear alone.

166
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,780
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,540
It's all my fault.

168
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,980
(Stairwell) (Operating Room)

169
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,780
Thank you.

170
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,020
That day I got back to my apartment,

171
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,060
I saw Mom had cooked me
a whole spread of dishes.

172
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,380
Every time she comes,

173
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,820
she can't help but refold all my clothes,

174
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,700
even the uniform I've been hiding.

175
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,750
Now, looking back,

176
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,260
she must've known everything all along.

177
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,170
I was the one kept in the dark.

178
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,830
I didn't even know when she retired,

179
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,970
and I even forgot

180
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,340
she lives alone too.

181
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,730
I used to think she was

182
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,020
annoying when she came to me.

183
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,980
She just wanted more time with me.

184
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,300
I guess

185
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,180
she already knew what my work was like.

186
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,900
She just never asked.

187
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,690
I can't even imagine

188
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,740
if she came to the convenience store

189
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,810
to tell me about her breast cancer.

190
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,520
But I didn't dare call her Mom.

191
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,860
(Operating Room)

192
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,700
Aren't mothers all the same?

193
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,580
They know everything.

194
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,980
Wanted to buy candy for her grandson?

195
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,340
How'd she know
if I would have a boy or a girl?

196
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,140
Shanshan,

197
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,500
it's close.

198
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,580
What's close?

199
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,460
Close to catching the culprit.

200
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,220
When your mom gets better,
spend more time with her.

201
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,100
Then, you can decide on having a boy or girl.

202
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,820
It won't be late.

203
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,460
I can't even with you.

204
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,420
Boss, we're just one part short.

205
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
Then we can assemble it.

206
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,660
Section Director Xu,

207
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,690
we've provided customs
all the legal paperwork.

208
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,100
Any similar electronic parts

209
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,220
will be held temporarily.

210
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,540
(Electronic Parts)
Good.

211
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,380
Please take a look.

212
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,140
These electronic parts

213
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,350
may seem ordinary on their own,

214
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,500
but once assembled,

215
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,980
(Bomb Sketch)

216
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,250
they form a bomb.

217
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,660
A bomb?

218
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,660
Well, judging by its size,

219
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,460
the blast radius shouldn't be large,

220
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,110
still controllable.

221
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,400
(Bomb Type Analysis)
But what kind of bomb is it?

222
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,140
(Cutaway diagram)
That depends on the missing piece.

223
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,060
So, what is that?

224
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,700
Hard to say.

225
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,780
Tell Feijiang to hold that thing.

226
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,060
And track Peng Yonghui.

227
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,900
Yes.

228
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,860
Where is it?

229
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,700
It's being held.

230
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,900
Being held?

231
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,460
Customs said the paperwork didn't check out.

232
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,780
Can you pay me now?

233
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,380
Get lost.

234
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,420
Boss, the last part was held by customs.

235
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,780
Why?

236
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,060
For some paperwork problem.

237
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,220
That's not the real problem.

238
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,620
I'm afraid this way won't work.

239
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,940
We can't use this method anymore.

240
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,580
It'll be tough to get it in.

241
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
There's another option.

242
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,020
We can use 3D printing
with some special materials.

243
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,260
But we'll need

244
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,220
an industrial-grade 3D printer.

245
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,700
I'll take care of that.

246
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,300
You prepare the paperwork.

247
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,380
I'll get the printer.

248
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,020
Okay, I'm on it now.

249
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,180
Deputy Mayor Jiang,

250
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,630
we'd really appreciate your support
as Shoulong Group moves forward.

251
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,620
Personnel decisions

252
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,940
need to go through the board.

253
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,190
Let's see Mr. Lin off first.

254
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,660
Thanks.

255
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,460
Everyone, stay strong and take care.

256
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,700
Yasheng,

257
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,300
you've got a long road ahead.

258
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,420
Do your best.

259
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,500
Thanks.

260
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,490
What's going on here?

261
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,020
Don't you get it yet?

262
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,820
Young Mr. Lin might be taking over.

263
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,340
Seriously?

264
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,340
I never thought

265
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,950
they'd choose me as president.

266
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,300
I know

267
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,260
you're not interested in this now,

268
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,220
but you can't run from it.

269
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,490
Whether you're in or out,

270
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,740
it makes no difference.

271
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,500
You may not care about Shoulong,

272
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,340
but don't you care about

273
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,380
your father's wish?

274
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,100
Yeah,

275
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,540
my dad's gone so suddenly.

276
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,780
He didn't even get to tell me

277
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,820
what to do next.

278
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,340
Right now,

279
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,420
I'm just worried someone might

280
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,060
take advantage of the chaos.

281
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,380
I think

282
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,700
it's best to back up the most important data

283
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,860
of the company.

284
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,820
Keep it in your own hands.

285
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,140
If something goes wrong,

286
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,140
you'll be prepared.

287
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,260
Class is over.

288
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,380
Stand up.

289
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,380
Goodbye, teacher.

290
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,220
Goodbye.

291
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,020
(It's 3D printed and ready for delivery.)

292
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,860
Sir, all done.

293
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,220
Good job.

294
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,580
I have a gift for you.

295
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,340
This is a pendant of Lady Liberty.

296
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,820
It symbolizes freedom.

297
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,340
Got it?

298
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,180
Yes.

299
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,740
Go find your mom.

300
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,420
Go get the stuff back.

301
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,340
No screw-ups this time.

302
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,420
Cause a stir if needed.

303
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,340
Yes, boss.

304
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,380
(Longhorn)

305
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,660
Feijiang.

306
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,100
Boss, Firer's on the move.

307
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,420
Firer's on the move.

308
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,490
Yalong, update Thunderbolt.

309
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,340
On it.

310
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,220
Danni, alert everyone.

311
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,060
Copy.

312
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,890
(SAD's Firer located. Butterfly
to lead tracking. Apprehend if needed.)

313
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,020
Move out!

314
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,580
Get Lu up.

315
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,580
Time to roll!

316
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,940
I just got off shift and laid down.

317
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,900
Wake up, stay sharp.

318
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,260
Access Skynet. Locate Peng Yonghui.

319
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,340
Yes.

320
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,920
(Name: Peng Yonghui, Codename: Firer,
Note: Member of SAD)

321
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,100
Found him.

322
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,860
Turn right ahead.

323
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,900
Copy.

324
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,940
What are you doing?

325
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,660
I came in the back door.

326
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,420
Spider, Ant, cover the other exits.

327
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,620
Stand by to pick up them.

328
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,900
Lu, back up Feijiang.

329
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,740
Roger that.

330
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,780
Got a reservation?

331
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,860
We're from National Security.

332
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,340
So what? I'm security too.

333
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,740
Everyone needs a ticket.

334
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,180
Get him a ticket.

335
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,180
Come here.

336
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,420
We're from the National Security Bureau.

337
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,820
We're here for a suspect.

338
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,460
Just say you want in for free.

339
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,900
No shame in that.

340
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,420
(National Security)
Take a good look.

341
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,660
Open your eyes!

342
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,060
Sorry, sorry, I just...

343
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,460
Did this guy go inside?

344
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,700
There are too many customers.
I don't remember.

345
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,540
Why don't you...

346
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,740
Let's go.

347
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,780
Sorry. Sorry.

348
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,420
Hello, boss?

349
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,580
Boss?

350
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,180
It's noisy and crowded in here.
Hard to find him.

351
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,820
Alright, got it.

352
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,580
Watch it closely.

353
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,900
Yes.

354
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,180
Hey handsome, are you alone?

355
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,340
Well, me too.

356
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,900
Hello? I'm here.

357
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,860
Where are you?

358
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,800
I'm at the bar counter in the back.

359
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,820
No, in the booth. Hurry over.

360
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,060
There you are.

361
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,260
It's the locker key.

362
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,740
Can I go now?

363
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,340
Join me for a drink.

364
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,980
I don't drink.

365
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,300
You don't?

366
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,220
Then I won't.

367
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,420
Let's hit the dance floor.

368
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,460
Come on.

369
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,820
Come on, let's go.

370
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,060
Let's go.

371
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,620
Look at you.

372
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,620
What's wrong with you?

373
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,060
Feijiang, close the net. Keep civilians safe.

374
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,940
Tell Thunderbolt to

375
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,060
fall back. Don't blow cover.

376
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,180
Got it.

377
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,420
(Don't expose. Pull back.)

378
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,740
You out here playing with toy guns?

379
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,300
Are you serious?

380
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,460
Firer's out. Follow him.

381
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,900
Feijiang,

382
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,500
it's the last day of three years.

383
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,380
Stay safe.

384
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,900
Copy. Thanks, boss.

385
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,980
Lu, find his contact ASAP.

386
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,540
Copy that.

387
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,220
Pull up the locker footage.

388
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,500
Yes.

389
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,380
(Camera)

390
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,500
Too many people.

391
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,260
Which one is Firer's contact?

392
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,340
Zoom in on this.

393
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,700
That's gotta be him.

394
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,780
Yalong, back up Lu.

395
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,620
Yes.

396
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,380
(HongXing Express)

397
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,580
There he is.

398
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,780
You take there. I'll go here.

399
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,500
Stop! Police!

400
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,020
Don't run!

401
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,340
- Get over here!
- Who are you?

402
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,820
- Get over here!
- Wait, who are you?

403
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,380
Now, over here!

404
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,300
Stand straight. Don't move.

405
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,180
What do you want?

406
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,740
Take a good look.

407
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,700
We're from JNSB.

408
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,940
What were you doing at the nightclub?

409
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,300
I... I didn't go to the nightclub.

410
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,360
You're still lying?

411
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,270
Where'd you put the locker bag?

412
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
I was just delivering it.

413
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,600
What's in it?

414
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,440
I don't know.

415
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,880
Seriously, I really don't.

416
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,710
I'm a designated driver.

417
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,890
I took this side gig

418
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,340
for extra money.

419
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,860
You had no idea what you were delivering?

420
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,900
Show me the order record.

421
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,980
Hurry up.

422
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,590
Over here.

423
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,020
(Delivery Details)

424
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,700
Danni, check it out.

425
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,540
Who placed this order?

426
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,780
Mark it as completed.

427
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,700
Done.

428
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,740
Confirmed. It was Gao Jianguo.

429
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,370
Bring the courier back for questioning.

430
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,180
- Let's go.
- What for?

431
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,580
- Just go.
- What's happening?

432
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,340
I didn't do anything illegal.

433
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,010
Since Gao Jianguo blew his cover,

434
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,820
if it checks out,

435
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,340
take him in.

436
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,780
Boss, I'm back.

437
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,700
The stuff's fine.

438
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,540
Great, start assembling right now.

439
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,700
Yes.

440
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,140
Are you Gao Jianguo?

441
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,780
We're from JNSB.

442
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,500
(National Security, Hu Feijiang)

443
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,580
Officers, why am I being held here?

444
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,900
What does this mean?

445
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,660
You don't know

446
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,460
why you're here?

447
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,140
I just know

448
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,100
I've got a lot on my plate right now.

449
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,000
I know Shoulong Group's dealing with

450
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,420
both internal and external crises.

451
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,300
I need to go back and fix them.

452
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,180
If you keep me here,

453
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,940
it'll cause huge losses for the Group.

454
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,340
Gao Jianguo,

455
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,860
sounds like you care a lot about

456
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,100
Shoulong Group.

457
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,420
Of course I do.

458
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,340
It's my company, for God's sake.

459
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,900
What...

460
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,700
What do you want from me?

461
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,620
Vice President Gao.

462
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,540
Take a look at these photos.

463
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,340
They look familiar, don't they?

464
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,700
Of course they are.

465
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,980
Then I assume you won't forget

466
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,540
how Shoulong Group grew from a small factory

467
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,980
to what it is now.

468
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Vice President Gao,

469
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,500
you once contributed to the domestic economy

470
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,220
and technology development.

471
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,660
You're a veteran CPC member.

472
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,860
We hope you'll cooperate with us.

473
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,620
Lu, Feijiang,

474
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,540
Gao Jianguo's mindset is shifting.

475
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,860
Keep following that thought.

476
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,580
Alright, let's get started.

477
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,860
Start what?

478
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,460
I really don't know

479
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,460
what exactly you want to know.

480
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,820
Start confessing your crimes.

481
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,500
I have nothing to confess.

482
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,700
Gao Jianguo,

483
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,700
looks like I need to educate you

484
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,420
on the basics of our laws.

485
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,060
Our laws are based on

486
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,860
solid evidence, not just confessions.

487
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,860
We don't

488
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,940
detain people without cause.

489
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,140
You can stay silent

490
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,940
and not say a single word,

491
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,260
but the evidence'll tell us what you've done.

492
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,980
What did you send to Matt?

493
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,380
You know the answer.

494
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,180
We're giving you a chance,

495
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,860
a chance to earn some redemption.

496
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,940
Did you think,

497
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,540
after dealing with Jin Chuan and Lin Yasheng,

498
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,060
you could sit comfortably

499
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,740
as the president of Shoulong Group?

500
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,660
I admit it.

501
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,900
I just wanted to control Shoulong Group.

502
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,300
I just didn't want it

503
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,540
to fall into the wrong hands.

504
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,740
Gao Jianguo,

505
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,340
you've got one minute

506
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,180
to tell us everything you know.

507
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,100
Otherwise, like we said,

508
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,140
you'll never need to say anything.

509
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,740
I really have nothing to confess.

510
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,820
Enough!

511
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,540
Is this the hard drive
you smashed in the stairwell?

512
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,940
You thought smashing it

513
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,420
would erase the evidence?

514
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,620
You underestimated the modern tech.

515
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,380
We've recovered all the data.

516
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,020
Gao Jianguo,

517
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,980
take a look at this one,

518
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,500
this one,

519
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,710
(Classified Photo Information)
this one,

520
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,140
and this one.

521
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,540
Did you send this information abroad?

522
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,740
Do you realize

523
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,020
what you've done could destroy

524
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,620
the entire Shoulong Group?

525
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,900
You've betrayed your colleagues,

526
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,740
your family,

527
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,540
your beliefs,

528
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,900
and your motherland!

529
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,900
I knew it.

530
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,860
I knew this day would come.

531
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,500
I just didn't expect it

532
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,660
to come so soon.
