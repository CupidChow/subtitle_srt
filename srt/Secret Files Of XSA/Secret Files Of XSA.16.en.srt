2
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,430
This belongs to China.

3
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,800
No one's taking it.

4
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,460
=Episode 16=

5
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,560
Are you alright?

6
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,920
I'm fine.

7
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,690
What happened?

8
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,590
Section Director Xu said it's a new bomb,

9
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,430
probably an EMP type.

10
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,870
Not much harm to people,

11
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,510
but it can destroy

12
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,080
all electronics within the blast radius.

13
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,800
Azure One Data Center.

14
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,630
Go take them.

15
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,520
Seal all exits of the base. Go!

16
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,500
(Zhongjing Base Control Center)

17
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,100
(MSS)

18
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,150
Oh no. Everything's ruined.

19
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,310
Who was the last one here?

20
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,360
Bai Keqing.

21
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,310
Lin Yasheng said she downloaded all the data.

22
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,240
Stop!

23
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,030
Stop! Stop!

24
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,640
- What's wrong?
- MSS.

25
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,990
(National Security, Lu Chen)
I need your car.

26
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
But I'm taking it in for repairs.

27
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,390
Seriously?

28
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,510
Bai Keqing has all the data.

29
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,560
We must get it back.

30
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,800
Move aside.

31
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,750
What's going on here?

32
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,200
Why can they leave, but we can't?

33
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,050
Why can they leave?

34
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,160
Those cars won't run.

35
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,390
I'll try that motorcycle.

36
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,390
There are two exits here.

37
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,310
Let's split up.

38
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,660
(Ambulance)

39
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,560
Any leads?

40
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,300
We're checking every intersection.

41
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,870
No suspicious vehicles so far.

42
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,400
Don't move!

43
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,750
Boss, we have a problem.

44
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,860
I caught them, but the laptop's damaged.

45
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,200
Boss? Boss!

46
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,600
Let me use your phone!

47
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,320
Please.

48
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,750
Shura.

49
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,910
So, who are you?

50
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,200
I'm an MSS officer.

51
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,200
What's your relationship with Huo Jun?

52
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,870
Good girl,

53
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,390
no wonder you're my daughter.

54
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,080
You guessed right from the start.

55
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,360
MSS,

56
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,840
National Security.

57
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,670
Seriously? Again?

58
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,750
Do you really think

59
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,840
you can take down Shura?

60
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,840
Dream on!

61
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,480
You did that to Huo Jun?

62
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,600
What a shame.

63
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,790
He's a poor guy.

64
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,960
MSS sent him to work with

65
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,510
Middle East intelligence.

66
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,200
But thanks to our infiltration,

67
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
the Middle East Intelligence Agency

68
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,480
exposed Huo Jun's true identity.

69
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,320
I was there the day

70
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,120
he was poisoned.

71
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,120
He was lucky,

72
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,080
at least

73
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,150
he survived.

74
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,360
What a pity. He's young

75
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,000
and brilliant.

76
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,910
And now it's all ruined.

77
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,750
True.

78
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,080
You'd sell out anything.

79
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,600
In this world, that's how

80
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,870
the intelligence game works.

81
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,030
China's Ministry of State Security

82
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,630
might be airtight,

83
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,080
but agencies in other countries? Not so much.

84
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,790
We're all players here.

85
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,750
Whoever gets exposed first

86
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
loses the game.

87
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,570
And losers must admit defeat!

88
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,510
You're wrong.

89
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,480
On our frontlines,

90
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,080
there are thousands of
young people like Huo Jun.

91
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,790
To them, this is war, not a game.

92
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,790
That's the biggest difference

93
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,600
between us.

94
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,910
We're willing to give our lives

95
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,390
for our country.

96
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
But you?

97
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,480
You only see profit.

98
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,120
Do you know why

99
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,870
you keep getting caught by us these years?

100
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,670
Because you don't even know

101
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,120
who or what you are fighting for!

102
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,480
Huo Jun used to be

103
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,150
Shura's biggest threat.

104
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,460
That's my highest praise for him.

105
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,440
I'm not sure if you're as good as him.

106
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,890
I've said enough.

107
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,200
This is my last courtesy to MSS.

108
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,750
Huo Min,

109
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,320
this is your end!

110
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,160
Watch out!

111
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,190
Keqing,

112
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,670
who is he?

113
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,150
How did my dad die?

114
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,670
Keqing,

115
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,750
I'm fine.

116
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,910
You should go.

117
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,150
No, I can't.

118
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,630
- Go!
- I'm not going.

119
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,480
Go! Go!

120
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,600
Go! Now!

121
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,560
Leave me alone.

122
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,480
Go!

123
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,660
(Zuidao Izakaya)

124
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,790
Our people will be here soon.

125
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,670
You can't stall for long.

126
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,150
We both have our own missions.

127
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,360
I have no other choice.

128
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,800
You were too late.

129
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,950
Even if you kill me,

130
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,720
you won't make it in time.

131
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,120
I don't show mercy to criminals.

132
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,790
I once thought I'd never
show mercy to my opponents.

133
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,830
What if you had a second chance?

134
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,680
You know, he's waiting for you.

135
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,880
It's too late now.

136
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,110
Where's the USB?

137
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,240
Not on me.

138
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,920
Lin Yasheng's been poisoned. Fugu toxin.

139
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,040
Go save him now.

140
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,470
Watch her closely.

141
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,160
This belongs to China.

142
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,000
No one's taking it.

143
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,470
Move!

144
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,330
Move!

145
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,400
Huo Min!

146
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,640
He won't get far. Save Lin first!

147
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,260
(MSS)

148
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,310
Wong Wai Shing! Freeze!

149
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,880
He's poisoned by fugu.

150
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,720
Get alcohol and a knife.

151
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,740
Can you handle it?

152
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,860
There's no time. I'll have to do
an emergency tracheotomy.

153
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,440
Since joining SAD,

154
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,750
I've practiced this
more times than I can count.

155
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,200
The toxin in Shirako varies by season.

156
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,570
You'll need to cut open the trachea.

157
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,670
Right here,

158
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,350
make a cut about the size of your thumb.

159
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,160
Then act fast,

160
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,590
really fast.

161
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,160
Otherwise, your brain won't
get enough oxygen, and you'll...

162
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,620
(Filmed under professional supervision.)

163
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:48,060
(This is a dangerous action. Do not imitate.)

164
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,920
Huo Min?

165
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,300
(One week later)

166
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,830
Who is it?

167
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,550
Sorry, are you okay?

168
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,310
How could I be okay? It hurts like hell.

169
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,790
Where?

170
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,640
Here, right here.

171
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,750
Yes, right here.

172
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,540
It hurts so bad.

173
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,110
I need some comfort.

174
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,110
This is really bad.

175
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,920
I'll never have a girlfriend.

176
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,440
I need some comfort.

177
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,790
You're a real chatterbox.

178
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,680
Alright, I'll comfort you.

179
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,920
You're taking the lead, huh?

180
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,790
You...

181
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,310
You're really good at playing the rascal.

182
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,720
But if I say it,

183
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,350
I'll do it.

184
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,700
Something's happening.

185
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,110
I think they're awake.

186
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,110
You guys wanna peek?

187
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,280
Absolutely.

188
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,670
Who's going in?

189
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,010
- You go.
- You go.

190
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,850
No way!

191
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,640
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

192
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,960
Loser goes.

193
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,350
- Alright.
- Okay.

194
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,530
Come on, let's do it.

195
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,880
You're so boring.

196
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,000
You bored? No one's making you join us.

197
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,310
Rock, paper, scissors.

198
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,200
Didn't you think it was boring?

199
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,000
You... You go.

200
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,200
Hurry up.

201
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,270
It's not a good idea.

202
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,720
Don't chicken out. Come on.

203
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,590
Come on. Go, go, go.

204
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,040
Come here, you guys.

205
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,790
Let me see. Let me see.

206
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,920
Keep it down. They'll hear you.

207
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,070
He's holding her. He's holding her.

208
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,550
Hi, ma'am.

209
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,350
She's Captain's mother.

210
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,550
- Hi, ma'am.
- Hi, ma'am.

211
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,030
Ma'am, I heard your surgery went great.

212
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,110
You're Tang Tang's
chubby boyfriend, aren't you?

213
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,160
Stop it.

214
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,720
Ma'am, I...

215
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,750
Shanshan and I were acting. It was fake.

216
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,390
Was it?

217
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,440
So, what is real?

218
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,400
That couple in there.

219
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,240
They're definitely real.

220
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,000
I never thought

221
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,790
I could save your life

222
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,110
by cutting you once.

223
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,920
Now, all I've got left

224
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,480
is this scar.

225
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,680
Is this "letting me win"?

226
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,400
What else do you want?

227
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,200
What do you want?

228
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,160
Keqing.

229
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,880
Who is he really?

230
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,480
How did my dad die?

231
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,350
These are for my dad, right?

232
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,590
Give them to me.

233
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,750
Dad!

234
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,270
Doctor! Doctor!

235
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,550
Due to investigative needs,

236
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,200
we'll take you for identification
and evidence collection.

237
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,110
Given your cooperative attitude

238
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,310
and complete confession,

239
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,360
and that victim Lin Yasheng
has suffered physical and mental trauma,

240
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,350
it's been approved

241
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,750
for you to see Lin Yasheng.

242
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,200
We'll be present

243
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,170
when you're inside.

244
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,880
No physical contact.

245
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,240
Okay.

246
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,270
I'm late.

247
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,000
What are you doing here?

248
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,640
Haven't I suffered enough already?

249
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,290
Yasheng, I'm sorry.

250
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,790
You and I are different.

251
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,750
Your father left you,

252
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,880
but he left his love with you.

253
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,960
What about me?

254
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,160
I have no feelings.

255
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,350
I'm just a tool under my father's control.

256
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,550
I couldn't treat you

257
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,640
like an enemy,

258
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,240
but I couldn't give myself to you either.

259
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,880
What I want now is

260
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,820
a chance to make things right.

261
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,920
You're avoiding it.

262
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,110
You do have feelings.

263
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,270
You've just been using them.

264
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,640
Feelings?

265
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,590
That's something I don't deserve.

266
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,200
We won't see each other again.

267
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,070
Maybe that's the hardest price

268
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,310
I have to pay.

269
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,340
Yasheng,

270
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,270
I'm sorry.

271
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,160
Bai Keqing.

272
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,750
Bai Keqing!

273
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,070
You caused my dad's death.

274
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,510
I'll never forgive you.

275
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,740
You think redemption comes easy?

276
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,460
Life's a long road.

277
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,640
Let's suffer through it.

278
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,920
Let's suffer through it together!

279
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,350
Comrades,

280
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,750
the Azure One case

281
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,310
has achieved a major breakthrough.

282
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,310
The Publicity Department

283
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,510
will release nationwide updates,

284
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,720
including the progress of
Shoulong Group's clean energy project,

285
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,960
and the cause behind the explosion.

286
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,790
You'll be commended for your contributions

287
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,110
to national security.

288
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,070
However, just like before,

289
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,550
your names won't be disclosed.

290
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,030
But the title of "unsung heroes"

291
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,260
belongs to all of you!

292
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,660
(Absolute Loyalty to the Party,
Willing to Be Unsung Heroes.)

293
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,070
All members of Task Force 901,

294
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
please rise

295
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,200
for your commendation.

296
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,640
March forward.

297
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,590
Halt. About face.

298
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,110
Dress center.

299
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,880
Eyes front.

300
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,110
Report!

301
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,070
Huo Min, Meng Li, Task Force 901,

302
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,960
back on duty!

303
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,140
(Meng Li, Officer of Reconnaissance Sector,
JNSB. Codename: Dove)

304
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,570
Can you do this?

305
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,760
Come on.

306
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,590
Zhao Jizheng trained you all. Impressive.

307
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,240
You always show up at key moments.

308
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,790
I hereby announce,

309
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,960
with ministry approval,

310
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,790
Task Force 901 is awarded...

311
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,220
Leader of Task Force 901...

312
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,200
Director!

313
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,270
Zhao Jizheng, reporting.

314
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,150
Master.

315
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,550
The master always

316
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,680
appears at crucial moments.

317
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,130
Are all Task Force 901 members accounted for?

318
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,110
Yes.

319
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,320
Fall in!

320
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,550
Yes, sir!

321
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,840
I hereby announce,

322
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,280
Task Force 901 is awarded

323
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,670
a collective second-class merit.

324
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,240
Stand up!

327
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,110
Absolutely loyal to the Party.

328
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,150
Willing to be unsung heroes!

329
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,230
Absolutely loyal to the Party.

330
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,280
Willing to be unsung heroes!

331
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,480
Salute!

(National Security Bureau Honor Badge)

333
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,840
Come on, put it on.

334
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,710
Let's take a photo.

335
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,000
- Hurry up.
- Yay, photo time!

336
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,550
- Come on.
- Can't post it anyway.

337
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,110
Can't we just enjoy the moment?

338
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,110
- Come on.
- Take one.

339
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,190
Ready, one, two, three.

340
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,590
Master,

341
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,650
still keeping secrets?

342
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,660
Secrets again?

343
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,990
Director Zhao,

344
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,070
I cried when you left last time.

345
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,440
Show me. Cry again.

346
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,070
Secrets? Am I keeping secrets from you now?

347
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,800
Don't forget, my codename is Director.

348
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,480
Master,

349
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,510
did you tamper with the structure diagram

350
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,480
you gave me?

351
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,230
Matt is a sly fox.

352
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,190
You think he'd believe anything that easily?

353
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,480
I knew it.

354
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,630
You just wanted to test it's real or not.

355
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,550
Compare two of them,

356
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,150
and if they match, it can be confirmed.

357
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,110
If he can break one trap,

358
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,440
we'll give him two.

359
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,550
If he breaks two,

360
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,190
we'll give him four.

361
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,550
Setting a trap, huh?

362
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,840
What do we call that?

363
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,630
The importance of a plan!

364
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,590
You've all learned it well.

365
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,550
You say it all the time. Of course we know.

366
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,550
So, in Lin Shoulong's computer,

367
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,670
there was a fake diagram.

368
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,630
The one Matt's source got

369
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,670
was exactly the same as the one you gave me?

370
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,880
You guys, see? That is foresight.

371
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:56,960
So, Master,

372
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,920
when are you coming back?

373
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:03,190
Come back! Come back!

374
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,480
Coming back?

375
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,960
Back to what?

376
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,320
I've got a big international gig now.

377
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,880
Director, how about giving me a bigger role?

378
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,400
I'd love to join your gig.

379
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,590
It's a Hollywood one.

380
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,000
Then I'm in!

381
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,110
How's your French?

382
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,230
French?

383
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,720
French...

384
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,760
You all speak French?

385
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,840
That's my weak spot.

386
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,990
So weak.

387
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,800
What about you?

388
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,760
I can speak English very well,

389
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,760
but I can speak French a little bit,

390
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,590
just like "Bonjour".

391
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,670
I think he's bragging right now.

392
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,070
Totally!

393
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,720
Alright,

394
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,550
I brought you all a gift.

395
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,520
You? A gift? Seriously?

396
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,370
Baan Khun took the SAD infiltration job.

397
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,070
We caught him right after he entered China.

398
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,360
I'm also a police officer.

399
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,880
Your tricks won't work on me.

400
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,400
Just 'cause you caught me doesn't mean

401
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm playing your game.

402
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,510
Anyone who threatens our country

403
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,960
will be brought to justice!

404
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,880
You think you're smart?

405
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,840
Here,

406
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,710
take a look at this.

407
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,590
I'll come clean.

408
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,110
I'm a double agent for Shura and SAD.

409
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,800
There were two bomb triggers.

410
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,000
Matt's was fake.

411
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,110
Bai Keqing's was the real one.

412
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,230
Can we talk now?

413
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,540

Huo Min, dinner's ready.

436

Come serve the food.

Mom's calling.

438
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,510
Now, let's welcome
Deputy Mayor Jiang Jianyue to speak.

439
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,850
The success of Azure One's development

440
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,020
marks Shoulong Group's transformation

441
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,360
from a traditional energy firm

442
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,210
to a smart, renewable,

443
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,110
green enterprise.

444
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,400
Supporting new energy
firms and enterprises is the key

445
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,150
to achieving the Carbon Peaking
and Carbon Neutrality Goals.

446
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,880
I don't care what Shoulong Group chooses.

447
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,030
All I want is the result.

448
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,890
Or you won't take the blame.

449
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,400
What if Shoulong refuses to budge?

450
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:52,560
I need you to go meet the Deputy Mayor

451
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,710
right now, officially.

452
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,820
Someone will put pressure on him.
