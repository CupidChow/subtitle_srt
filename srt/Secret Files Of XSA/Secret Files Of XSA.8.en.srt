1
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,879
Your time is running out

2
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,760
Only five minutes

3
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,120
Someone must die today

4
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,919
Don't forget your current identity

5
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,120
He is a police officer

6
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,199
Who dies first

7
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,120
Sis

8
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,280
Did you find the house I asked you to look for earlier?

9
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,520
Yes, I found it.

10
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,080
It's very discreet, as you requested.

11
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,840
I used a fake ID.

12
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,039
I signed a one-year lease with the landlord.

13
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,199
I didn't let anyone know.

14
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,599
Good.

15
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,080
Sis, what's going on?

16
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,719
If Shoulong doesn't get into trouble, we definitely will.

17
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,360
I understand.

18
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,840
So we still don't know who Mat's people are.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,879
What should we do?

20
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,199
We'll know soon.

21
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,360
Boss, everything is ready. Let's go.

22
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,400
Okay.

23
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,960
Xiao Yi

24
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,199
You stay

25
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,919
Boss

26
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,479
Boss, I

27
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,280
I

28
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,759
I have been dealing with the Shoulong Group for so many years

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,439
How did Zheng Qiyi come

30
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,719
and you got this crucial material?

31
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,680
You are fellow disciples

32
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,599
and have met in Yingzhou.

33
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,120
Returning to the country at the same time again

34
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,199
Wei

35
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,400
Such a coincidence in the world

36
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,959
Boss

37
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,079
Zheng Qi and I are just ordinary schoolmates

38
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,879
We really have no collusion

39
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,000
Really, there isn't. Believe me

40
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,439
I underestimated you

41
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,600
After you learn about SAD

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,279
your life will no longer belong to you.

43
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,600
You release the materials

44
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,000
You release them and take a look

45
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,240
Do I have any connection with the Shoulong Group?

46
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,160
What use is it to release them again?

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,720
Is it worth a life?

48
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,519
Slept quite soundly

49
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,279
How about we make it quick

50
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,319
Sis

51
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Do you think if he handles this matter for Shoulong Group

52
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,000
and doesn't make it

53
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,759
will Shoulong Group be in big trouble?

54
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,120
Didn't you say you weren't colluding?

55
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,879
Didn't you say you were one of us?

56
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,639
Kill him. Only with blood on your hands can you prove you're one of us.

57
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,199
I know

58
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,319
You two usually have a very good relationship

59
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,360
How about this

60
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,000
I want him to

61
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,680
Sleep more soundly

62
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,560
Walk comfortably

63
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,000
Gone

64
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,279
Huo Min

65
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,639
I just want to tell you

66
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,600
Your time is running out

67
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,759
Only five minutes

68
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,040
Boss

69
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,839
Choose one

70
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,360
Either he dies

71
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,199
Or you die

72
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,959
Phone

73
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,639
Five minutes

74
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,639
Old Wan

75
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
You woke up, Old Wan

76
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,639
Doctor, doctor

77
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,759
What's wrong?

78
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,759
The patient woke up, the patient woke up

79
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,360
Let me take a look

80
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,399
Come

81
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,680
Look to the right

82
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,399
Okay

83
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,000
Shake hands, try it, use force

84
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,720
Can this leg move?

85
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,199
His leg was injured before

86
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
How about this side?

87
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,360
He might have had a stroke this time

88
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,839
which damaged his lower limb motor nerves

89
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,439
It's okay, he will recover slowly

90
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,040
We found a malignant tumor in his brain

91
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,759
And it has already spread

92
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,680
The patient doesn't have much time left

93
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,399
I hope you are mentally prepared

94
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,680
Understood

95
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,360
Why are there so many people at your door

96
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,680
It's late at night and it's affecting the patient's rest

97
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,040
Quickly make them leave

98
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,600
Got it

99
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,639
Old Wan

100
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,040
You finally woke up

101
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,160
Your hair

102
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,480
Hair

103
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,440
I knew you were going to wake up so I

104
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,559
deliberately washed my hair

105
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,960
Look, it's okay, right?

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,519
I regret it a bit now

107
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,159
What do you regret?

108
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,799
Regret the past

109
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,240
If I had died on the battlefield

110
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,440
At least it would have been a heroic sacrifice

111
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,159
If it just ends like this

112
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,720
that would be too pathetic.

113
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,799
What are you talking about?

114
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,399
Why are you talking about dying?

115
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,360
Let me tell you some good news.

116
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,399
Your lottery ticket might actually win, you know?

117
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
Huo Min

118
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
I like you.

119
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,039
It's because

120
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,960
I can see

121
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,720
you are not an ordinary person.

122
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,279
I said

123
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:57,799
I am someone you can trust.

124
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,440
No matter what difficulties you face,

125
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,039
you just

126
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,440
keep moving forward.

127
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,240
Leave your back

128
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,720
to me.

129
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,120
Stop talking about backs.

130
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,440
Get up and make me some bacon.

131
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,799
Okay.

132
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,559
Call me

133
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,799
Call me dad.

134
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,519
Then I'll get up and do it.

135
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,000
What time is it already?

136
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,639
Stop taking advantage.

137
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,679
You have a tight mouth.

138
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,080
You brat.

139
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,559
Dad is thirsty.

140
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Wait here.

141
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,639
I'll get you some water.

142
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,440
Wait for me to take you home

143
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,360
I am not a

144
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,559
useless old man

145
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Very soon

146
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,559
Either he dies

147
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,399
Or you die

148
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,639
I heard everything

149
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,279
I was a soldier

150
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,279
I know

151
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,720
what an enemy is

152
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,120
Huo Min

153
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,679
Now, I'll cover you

154
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,480
Dr. Liang, the patient in bed fourteen has no heartbeat.

155
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,919
Boss, that old man is dead.

156
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,399
Old Wan

157
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,720
Family members of the patient, please stay calm.

158
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,000
Old Wan

159
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,600
Old Wan

160
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,000
Old Wan

161
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,440
Family members of the patient, please stay calm.

162
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,559
Please stay calm, please stay calm.

163
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,440
Old Wan

164
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,639
Save him.

165
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,960
Stay calm.

166
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
Save him.

167
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,240
Dad

168
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,480
Dad

169
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,679
Dad

170
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:33,799
Dad

171
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,080
Dad

172
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,960
The Japanese cuisine here

173
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,039
is the most authentic in the area.

174
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,879
I searched for a long time to find it.

175
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,080
Please

176
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,279
He's the owner here.

177
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,879
Here he comes again.

178
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,360
My friend wanted to surprise me.

179
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,120
I understand.

180
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,600
It seems to suit your taste.

181
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,519
To be honest, this is my first time here.

182
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,440
It feels nice.

183
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,159
But when it comes to Japanese food,

184
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,600
I can't tell what's good, only what's bad.

185
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,440
But I can see the good in you.

186
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,480
However, I have noticed

187
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,879
that you are not someone without ideas.

188
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,080
Why do you pretend to be a playboy?

189
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,879
You figured that out.

190
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,879
I wonder when the Shoulong Group will collapse.

191
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,879
If I believed you,

192
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,960
I should have doubted

193
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,720
your purpose for inviting me into the game.

194
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,200
The Shoulong Group is my father's lifeline.

195
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,039
Even if I'm unwilling,

196
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,519
I have to endure until he retires.

197
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,159
Business varies in size,

198
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,240
but my father is there.

199
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,519
As his child, I must stand behind him.

200
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,399
Receive protection and also give it.

201
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,440
And it must be unconditional.

202
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,879
Isn't that right?

203
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,480
Makes sense.

204
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,960
I bet you'll regret it in the end.

205
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,639
It's out, it's out.

206
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,799
That old man's death and Shoulong Group

207
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:42,879
Are they directly related?

208
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,159
Tell us, is it?

209
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,840
We will find a way for you.

210
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,600
Huo Min said, everyone has been called over.

211
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,559
Don't speak recklessly.

212
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,600
We have already investigated.

213
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,360
Wan Nian is a retired soldier.

214
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,600
He is also a lonely old man.

215
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,600
He has been taken care of by Mr. Huo.

216
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,720
But Wan Nian's death has nothing to do with Shoulong Group.

217
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,360
It has no relation at all.

218
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,000
You say it has no relation, so it has no relation?

219
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,639
How do you prove it, right?

220
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,720
Sir,

221
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,279
Speaking recklessly carries legal responsibility.

222
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,759
However, although Shoulong is not responsible,

223
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,919
Out of humanitarian concern,

224
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,159
We are willing to let the old man have a dignified departure.

225
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,159
Of course, as long as Mr. Huo agrees.

226
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,039
Huo Min, don't make things too embarrassing.

227
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,559
If things escalate,

228
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,720
The coroner will have to perform an autopsy.

229
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,639
The old man's body will be cut up and messy.

230
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,200
It won't look good.

231
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,120
Shoulong Group is giving money.

232
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,320
Is giving money to settle the matter, right?

233
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,840
Today, everyone counts.

234
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,639
No one can escape.

235
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,000
If I were you, I would pick up the money.

236
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,039
Because this money can still be used at your funeral.

237
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,559
I didn't expect this kid to be so ruthless.

238
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,279
But he didn't just kill that old man.

239
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,079
He also knocked out the person watching him.

240
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,920
That's your own business.

241
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,599
The transfer request you submitted last time,

242
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,440
I have already submitted it for you.

243
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,400
The organization has indeed arranged a way out for you.

244
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,480
The matter with Shoulong has already caused a death.

245
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,960
Do I still need to leave?

246
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,799
We're all people who need to escape.

247
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,279
Isn't an honorable retirement good?

248
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,480
This is my territory.

249
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:51,279
I leave when I want, I stay when I want.

250
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,359
I make the decisions.

251
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,599
Stop being stubborn.

252
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,920
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

253
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,240
You think you can just wipe your mouth and leave after eating.

254
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,480
You need to clean up after yourself.

255
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Don't forget I still have my gun by your side.

256
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,079
You know very well who the gun is pointed at.

257
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,079
If you don't clean up properly,

258
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Then I'll have to erase everything.

259
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,960
And start over.

260
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,119
Including you.

261
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,119
Killing her now won't help.

262
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,880
Don't forget your current status.

263
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,680
You are a lawyer.

264
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,720
Do you want to break the law knowingly?

265
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,720
She left.

266
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,799
She left, she left.

267
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
I know.

268
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,720
Even if I didn't come today,

269
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,519
you wouldn't really crash into her.

270
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,359
But if you trust me,

271
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,799
wait a little longer.

272
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,160
The punishment she deserves

273
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
I will return it to her intact on your behalf.

274
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,759
Huo Min

275
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,039
Meng Li

276
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,599
You can talk now, you can talk now, Meng Li

277
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
Wait for me, wait for me

278
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:01,839
I'll be right there

279
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,839
Mom, the food you made is really delicious.

280
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,079
I ate it all.

281
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,119
I want to go home tomorrow.

282
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,079
You know things are better at home, right?

283
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,519
But tomorrow I need to go for a medical check-up first.

284
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,359
Let me know when you come back.

285
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:33,279
Huo Min

286
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,039
Meng Li

287
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,119
I immediately

288
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:56,319
recognized your voice

289
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,519
Do you know?

290
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,200
I really regret it.

291
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,279
What I mean is,

292
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,359
If I had known it would be so hard for you to call me,

293
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,960
I would have chosen a shorter name.

294
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,920
Meng Li

295
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,839
I often think

296
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,680
if we switched identities

297
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,880
the current situation

298
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,759
might be better

299
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:03,839
I

300
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,359
We

301
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,519
Let's break up.

302
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Superior

303
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,119
Already

304
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,839
approved

305
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,720
Mengli

306
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,960
Everything

307
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,400
will get better

308
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,480
Your revenge

309
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,079
I will definitely help you avenge it

310
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,759
Everyone is here.

311
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,079
Let me explain the task first.

312
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,559
The boss instructed.

313
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,200
From now on,

314
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,319
everyone stays in the company and gets ready.

315
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,079
We will go to the Lifeng Hotel together.

316
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,680
Why are we going there?

317
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:18,559
Taking advantage of the chaos at Shoulong Group,

318
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,680
we obtained the core data of "Blue One".

319
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,079
It can be transmitted over the network.

320
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,119
All data of "Blue One" has anchors.

321
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,480
Uploading online will expose it.

322
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,039
It can only be handed over face-to-face.

323
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:37,680
Alright.

324
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,880
Everyone, stay alert.

325
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,559
Why are there so many people today?

326
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,160
What does this mean?

327
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,079
It means our business is doing well.

328
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,359
Just a moment.

329
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,440
It shows that the events of ten thousand years have a great impact on Shoulong.

330
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,119
And then?

331
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,319
These people can only grab a bite at the convenience store.

332
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,279
A leader is a leader.

333
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,400
Boss.

334
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,440
Take care.

335
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,319
Business is good.

336
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,200
Perfect timing, come help.

337
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,319
Help me pack the coffee.

338
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,720
You are the major shareholder behind the scenes

339
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
This store is all yours

340
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,319
Shouldn't you lend a hand?

341
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,319
Get to work

342
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,160
You look a bit like a capitalist

343
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,480
What are you doing?

344
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,000
Stop!

345
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,359
Stop! Don't run!

346
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,960
The one in black clothes and a sky blue hat

347
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,000
It's not him

348
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,240
I already said, it's the one wearing the sky blue hat.

349
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Colorblind.

350
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,920
Aren't they all blue?

351
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,200
Aren't they all the same?

352
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,240
What now?

353
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,400
Do they have to wear a bow for you to tell them apart?

354
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,920
Why do you always have to argue?

355
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,480
I'm not arguing.

356
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,039
Your negligence let them escape.

357
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,960
Boss, you just saw it.

358
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,759
Every day it's these small-time thieves.

359
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,720
Now another fish has been bitten to death.

360
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,079
The bait is also gone.

361
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,279
Is it time to reel in the net this time?

362
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,559
I had no choice but to retrieve the bait.

363
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,680
I was afraid she would escape.

364
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,160
As for the rest,

365
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,920
We've been casting the net in circles before.

366
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,079
Now everything is ready.

367
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,319
We just need the final push.

368
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:10,559
Also,

369
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:13,680
Do you think in this dark current sea area,

370
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,839
there's only this one parrotfish?

371
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:20,640
There might be batfish, tigerfish, or giant sharks.

372
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,680
Work has come in.

373
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,759
Welcome

374
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,839
West A 6333G entry

375
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,240
The target has arrived and entered the elevator.

376
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,359
Received, Group A is in position.

377
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,200
Welcome

378
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,440
Welcome

379
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
West A OR555 entry

380
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,559
The target has arrived.

381
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:58,000
The target is in position, but the others' locations are unknown.

382
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,720
Check all the hotel surveillance and find them.

383
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,640
Yes.

384
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,720
Is it done?

385
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,000
What's going on?

386
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:42,480
Boss, there's a signal jamming device in the upper area.

387
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,599
Military classified

388
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,240
We need some more time to break through

389
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,119
How long will it take

390
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,079
Approximately

391
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,680
Fifteen minutes

392
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,400
As soon as possible

393
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,279
Yes

394
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,160
Director, the signal has been blocked

395
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,079
The actor has disconnected

396
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,799
It's very likely exposed

397
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,319
Something's wrong

398
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,160
Where are you going?

399
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,119
Follow me.

400
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,519
Hold on, let me check.

401
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,279
Hand over the phone.

402
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:04,559
Here

403
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,359
Sis

404
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,400
Sis

405
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,840
Do we really need to make it so grand?

406
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,719
Grand?

407
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,199
Do you know why I called you here?

408
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,360
Join me

409
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,320
Let's have fun, let's get excited

410
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,519
Yes

411
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,719
Let's go

412
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,239
Boss, there's a situation.

413
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,079
Traffic officer, what's the matter?

414
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,320
Hello, officer.

415
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,800
Someone reported that you parked illegally.

416
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,159
Please show your driver's license.

417
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,719
Be ready to move at any time.

418
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,400
Okay.

419
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,599
Come on, come on.

420
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,239
You can't park here.

421
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,000
Please move your car quickly.

422
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,239
I'm just waiting for someone, I'll leave in five minutes.

423
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,599
There's a parking lot not far ahead.

424
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,719
You can park there.

425
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,440
Old Lu, let's go.

426
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,760
Someone is counter-surveilling.

427
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,719
Are you moving or not?

428
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:13,960
If you don't move, I'll issue a ticket.

429
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,480
No, no, no.

430
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:15,880
I'll go, I'll go, I'm leaving now.

431
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:17,800
Leaving immediately.

432
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,280
Boss, I've already driven away Matt's men.

433
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:28,920
Chief, any further and we'll be out of signal range.

434
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,159
We must leave.

435
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
We've been discovered.

436
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,239
Old Lu, keep them circling within signal range.

437
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,880
You two continue to hack the surveillance.

438
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:37,719
Okay.

439
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,119
Boss, why are you here?

440
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,400
The situation has changed. How are things on your end?

441
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,199
Someone went inside.

442
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,440
But we don't know their identity yet.

443
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,880
We can't access the surveillance footage right now.

444
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,599
We need to quickly determine the situation inside.

445
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:43,320
Sit

446
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Sit down

447
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,519
Sis Li

448
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,920
Didn't you say there were important guests today?

449
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:56,559
No rush

450
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,599
Sit

451
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,079
How about this

452
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,320
As for me

453
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,559
Today, I'll let you watch

454
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,480
a good show

455
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,880
Hello, room service

456
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,079
Do you need cleaning?

457
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,760
Please come in

458
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,280
You two make a choice.

459
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,440
Which of these two dies first?

460
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,039
Sis, um...

461
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,440
Who are they?

462
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,639
You're asking me?

463
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,480
I-I-I...

464
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,039
I don't know who they are either.

465
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,440
Do you know them?

466
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,559
I don't know them either.

467
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,519
Boss, why do we have to kill?

468
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,280
Someone has to die today.

469
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,320
Who dies first?

470
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,079
Huo Min

471
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,360
What do you think?

472
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,119
Really want to kill

473
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,519
Men, I cherish and protect women.

474
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,599
At this moment, you still distinguish between men and women?

475
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,159
Han Yao

476
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,199
What do you think?

477
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,280
I

478
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,159
Sis, that

479
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,000
I'll definitely listen to you.

480
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,239
Whoever you say to kill, I'll kill.

481
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,039
Interesting.

482
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,159
Since we can't decide,

483
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,280
let's get rid of them all.

484
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,440
Listen to my command

485
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:14,920
One

486
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,079
Two

487
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,360
Three

488
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,159
Don't move

489
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,960
I can't keep acting

490
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,760
The bedroom doesn't need cleaning

491
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,519
Boss

492
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,719
I admit

493
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,760
I have been with Matt

494
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,079
But do you want to know

495
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,000
who he is

496
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,320
No, no

497
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,199
Huo Min

498
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,639
What, what do you mean who am I

499
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,599
What are you talking about, I am

500
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:26,840
What's going on

501
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:29,480
Boss

502
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,239
He is a cop

503
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,760
I am a cop

504
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,880
You are slandering me

505
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:35,800
Sis, you know he

506
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,039
He has always held a grudge against me

507
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,280
He wants to use you to get rid of me

508
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,519
I am a cop

509
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:41,000
Huo Min, I can't believe you came up with this

510
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,119
Why don't you say

511
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,639
you are Matt's undercover agent

512
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,320
I admit, I have been with Matt

513
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:46,719
Do you dare to admit who you are

514
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:49,559
No, what am I supposed to admit

515
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:51,079
Sis, sis, did you hear

516
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,280
He admitted it himself

517
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,559
Enough

518
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,559
I've played along with you for so long

519
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,320
I knew this wasn't that simple

520
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,639
What I want is

521
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,519
for you to reveal yourselves

522
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:02,039
Boss

523
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,840
I clearly told you

524
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,559
Matt told me to take you out

525
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,079
I will take your place

526
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,639
But today, this cop won't die

527
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,039
We both have to die

528
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,039
No, Sis

529
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,840
Be-be-believe me

530
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:35,880
Sis

531
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,960
I-I really don't know, Sis

532
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:39,639
They are not Mat's people

533
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,039
You know this too

534
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,760
Is it so glorious to be one of Mat's people?

535
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:46,840
Fine, I'll let you know now

536
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:49,159
How those who betray me die

537
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:50,119
Sis

538
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,719
The surveillance footage cannot be retrieved in a short time.

539
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,559
We need to quickly determine the situation inside.

540
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,800
Where is the actor?

541
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:03,800
The connection is lost.

542
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:05,599
The last message informed us

543
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,719
at the Lifeng Hotel.

544
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,840
Can we ask the higher-ups to contact them one last time?

545
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,280
They usually contact through a single line.

546
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,039
Send him another message.

547
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,920
No one will know what it means.

548
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,960
We can only take a risk and try.
