2
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,960
Boss,

3
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,920
what...what's this?

4
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,840
It's a gift for Azure One.

5
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,870
If you make one more sound,

6
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,030
I'll kill him right away.

7
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,030
We're the police, please open the door.

8
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,620
=Episode 15=

9
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,470
I know.

10
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,400
I know this day would come.

11
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,910
Just didn't expect it

12
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,800
to come so soon.

13
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Xiaolong,

14
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,390
the hard drive just got back
was fixed already?

15
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,030
You're so amazing now.

16
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,080
You're in tech too,

17
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,360
shouldn't you know that?

18
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,960
Fixing hard disks is a breeze for us.

19
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,470
As long as it's not shattered,

20
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,190
we can recover key data.

21
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,470
Look how pleased you are.

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,780
How did you two get in touch?

23
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,360
I went abroad for
a scientific research exchange conference.

24
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,460
Matt introduced a girl to me.

25
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,360
Then she slept in my room.

26
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,870
The next morning,

27
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,150
he barged in.

28
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,710
You can't have been threatened by them

29
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,960
over this matter until now.

30
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,280
But the girl is dead now.

31
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,590
He killed her right in front of me.

32
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,910
Matt's been using her death to blackmail me.

33
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,910
He even said he'd frame me.

34
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,840
He also mentioned

35
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,150
that Shoulong Group will
pivot toward new energy.

36
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,710
He said us traditionalists

37
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,430
are bound to be marginalized.

38
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,520
Shoulong's foundation
has always been rooted in

39
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,390
traditional petrochemical energy..

40
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,160
Why push for a new energy plan?

41
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,040
This will ruin Shoulong.

42
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,560
I don't want my hard work

43
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,740
with years of effort and foundation

44
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,670
to be destroyed so easily.

45
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
Plus,

46
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,430
that girl's issue.

47
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,360
I had to agree.

48
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,040
What have you done for SAD?

49
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,950
I gave them Sin's negotiation schedule.

50
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,430
Also,
the Zhongjing Chip Base's structure diagram

51
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,720
was provided by me.

52
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,920
I used the 3D Printer

53
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,390
to make a component.

54
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,750
Do you still have the 3D files?

55
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,070
I deleted all data from the PC.

56
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,430
The group's 3D Printer

57
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,190
might have some traces.

58
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,000
Xiaolong,

59
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,600
retrieve the 3D files immediately.

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,650
Send them to Section Director Xu
in tech department.

61
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
Alright.

62
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,070
Do you know the consequences?

63
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,510
I know.

64
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,310
At first,

65
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,480
I convinced myself it was for the company.

66
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,600
But I got deeper and deeper.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,360
Now there's no turning back.

68
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,560
I confess.

69
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,190
Submit to the law.

70
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,700
(Shoulong Group)

71
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,310
Is everyone here?

72
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,270
All key department heads are present.

73
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,830
Vice President Gao...

74
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,040
Let's not discuss this issue.

75
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,120
Now, I announce an important decision.

76
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,630
After board consultations,

77
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,430
Lin Yasheng will be Shoulong's new president.

78
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,870
Jin Chuan will be reinstated to his post,

79
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,240
assisting Lin Yasheng with the transition.

80
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,830
Let's welcome President Lin to speak.

81
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,560
It's not an official speech,

82
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,040
just a casual chat.

83
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,240
Many might not know this person beside me.

84
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,070
Bai Keqing,

85
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,190
a top PR expert.

86
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,830
Now, I announce

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,920
my first appointment since taking office.

88
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,480
Appointing Bai Keqing

89
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
as a senior advisor for Shoulong Group,

90
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,120
fully involved with negotiations

91
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,240
between Shoulong Group and the Gapung.

92
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,680
President Lin Yasheng.

93
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,380
Next, I'll arrange tech staff

94
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,190
to collect your facial data.

95
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,190
To replace President Lin's info.

96
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,950
This grants you top access at Zhongjing Base.

97
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,870
Within the Shoulong Group,
only when you are present,

98
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,270
by using your facial data

99
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,310
and the authorization card given.

100
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,390
Then you can view all data

101
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,120
from the core server room in Zhongjing Base.

102
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,270
And you?

103
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,390
Just like everyone else,

104
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,830
only can see

105
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,070
part of the authorized info.

106
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,710
Okay.

107
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,510
Vice President Jin,

108
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,600
before the next negotiation,

109
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,720
I need a deep dive into
Azure One's situation.

110
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,800
Could you arrange that?

111
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,920
Tomorrow, I'm about to visit Zhongjing Base.

112
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,030
Miss, your delivery is here.

113
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,750
Your delivery, Miss.

114
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,000
The stuff you left in my bin.

115
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,240
I found it.

116
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,440
Are you ready?

117
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,630
I've cleared Matt's doubts about you.

118
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,840
Now we have all the components.

119
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,600
I suggest him starting at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

120
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,000
Matt must not have anticipated this move.

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,840
Go on.

122
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,000
Fresh vegetables are here.

123
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,750
You're making me forget

124
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,790
the old overbearing you.

125
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,630
Isn't being ordinary person good?

126
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,080
Ordinary?

127
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,870
I think you mean normal person.

128
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,000
This life is really nice.

129
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,600
And it's so nice that

130
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,440
I wish this could last forever.

131
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,790
Dying for it would be worth it.

132
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,600
Keqing,

133
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,440
can I ask you a question?

134
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,910
Can your question

135
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,240
wait until tomorrow?

136
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,550
Why?

137
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,390
Because

138
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,600
I don't want to answer it today.

139
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,030
Put off the question until tomorrow.

140
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,960
Is that okay?

141
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,390
When did you become someone

142
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,150
who avoids problems?

143
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Since

144
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,510
I fell in love with

145
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,240
a big problem.

146
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,000
Huo Min.

147
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,470
Hui.

148
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,910
Hand over your phone.

149
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,160
Phone.

150
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,080
What's up, Hui?

151
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,030
Just do it.

152
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,600
Why so much talk?

153
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,200
Hurry up.

154
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,820
Let's go.

155
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,270
Boss has a task, gather now.

156
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,750
What task is so urgent?

157
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,790
Just go.

158
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,630
I'll change clothes.

159
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,910
Change clothes later.

160
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,240
Captain Luo.

161
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,200
Based on recent information,

162
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,720
we finally understand it all.

163
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,870
We always thought

164
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,120
it was a traditional bomb.

165
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,750
But now with the missing part added,

166
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,150
we realize

167
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,510
(JNSB)
if we assemble these components,

168
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,030
it will become a new type of bomb.

169
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,790
Targeting electronic components
within a certain range.

170
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,660
From a chip perspective,

171
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,750
its damage is catastrophic.

172
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Danni.

173
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,320
Coming.

174
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,150
Contact Thunderbolt now.

175
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,390
Figure out Matt's crew's time and place.

176
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,510
- Yes.
- Let's go.

177
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,840
Who?

178
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,040
Firer.

179
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,510
Boss.

180
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,150
Everyone's here.

181
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,510
Boss,

182
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,360
what...what's this?

183
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,550
It's a gift for Azure One.

184
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,420
No issues, Boss.

185
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,120
From now until the action,

186
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,150
no one are allowed to leave.

187
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,750
Got it.

188
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,160
Understood.

189
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,550
(Ten hours left)

190
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,580
(Must get the message out)

191
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,990
Come back.

192
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,240
Come back.

193
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Where do you come from?

194
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,670
Staying up late at night.

195
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,240
Scaring my little baby.

196
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,720
Can you...

197
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,440
Can you control your dog?

198
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,670
Which room are you from?

199
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,480
Stop making noise, or I'll call the police.

200
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,920
Quiet, or I'll call the police.

201
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
Try calling the police.

202
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,200
Call cops and I'll kill you.

203
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,320
Enough.

204
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,920
Head back.

205
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,630
Come back.

206
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,920
Any news from Thunderbolt?

207
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,150
Are you okay?

208
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,280
Bro.

209
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,640
Bro.

210
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,590
Can I ask a favor?

211
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,590
Can I borrow your phone?

212
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,880
For what?

213
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,350
To order some food.

214
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,240
I haven't eaten yet.

215
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,960
Looks like no one else has either.

216
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,810
Tomorrow...

217
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,160
Ordering food this late?

218
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,960
Aren't we working all day tomorrow?

219
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,240
Can't work with an empty stomach.

220
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,160
Hungry?

221
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,440
I'm really hungry.

222
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,430
Alright.

223
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,840
Go ahead and eat.

224
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,760
Bro, I'm going to boil some water.

225
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,880
Here, bro.

226
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,680
I got a perm.

227
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,880
Sorry, bro.

228
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,920
Didn't I ask you to behave yourself?

229
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,810
I'm sorry, bro.

230
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,000
I just accidentally scalded him.

231
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,200
So I...I'll buy him medicine right now, okay?

232
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,240
I'll buy drugs for him now.

233
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,440
Shut up.

234
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,720
Quiet, or I'll call the police.

235
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,680
Come here.

236
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,670
If you make one more sound,

237
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,000
I'll kill him right away.

238
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,350
It really hurts.

239
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,030
If you die, you will not hurt.

240
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,640
Be quiet.

241
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,440
Boss,

242
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,680
why bring him on this mission?

243
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,720
Close the door.

244
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,880
The reason I sent him to
infiltrate Shoulong Group

245
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
is to take the fall for us.

246
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,790
He's Chinese.

247
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,960
Back then,
he had a huge slowdown with Shoulong Group

248
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,070
over environmental issues with Han Yao.

249
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,480
So he has motive and reason to risk it.

250
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,880
In this way, the alliance country will avoid

251
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,510
a lot of international pressure.

252
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,750
Got it.

253
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,080
Bro,

254
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,750
I'm sorry, really sorry.

255
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,270
- I'm really not...
- Get lost!

256
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,480
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

257
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,880
Get lost, just get lost!

258
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,480
Hello, please open the door.

259
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,680
Please open the door.

260
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
Police.

261
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,790
Police is here.

262
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,400
Open the door, it's the police.

263
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,200
Anyone is at home? Open the door, please.

264
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,240
We're the police, open the door.

265
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,160
We're the police, please open the door.

266
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,550
- Ma'am.
- What's up?

267
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,400
Someone complained your dog's noisy.

268
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,070
I'm the disturbance?

269
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,880
Who's spreading these lies?

270
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,640
It was their arguing over there

271
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,310
that scared my baby.

272
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,040
Why spread false rumors?

273
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,070
If you're brave, come out.

274
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,400
Come out, come out and tell me.

275
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,510
What lies? What lies?

276
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,440
I called the police.

277
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,270
Where did you get that stray dog?

278
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,370
Always causing a ruckus.

279
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,280
Isn't it true?

280
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,830
- Don't talk nonsense!
- Nothing I can do.

281
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,240
- Stray dog?
- Can't I call cops?

282
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,160
Dare to say it to cops?

283
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,000
Come down and say it!

284
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,520
Enough.

285
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,450
Talk about your dog first.

286
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,510
Does it have a dog license?

287
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,680
Although this dog

288
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,550
was picked up outside,

289
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,270
but look, it's clean.

290
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,040
See, it's so well-behaved.

291
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,270
Keep an eye on it tonight.

292
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,720
Take it to the police station tomorrow
to complete procedures.

293
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,640
Alright, alright.

294
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,240
Don't sleep tonight.

295
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,070
Sit in the room.

296
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,270
Feijiang,

297
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,550
it's been over eight hours.

298
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,480
You...hold on.

299
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's been all night.

300
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,030
We must prepare for the worst now.

301
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,880
Sir,

302
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,750
table for four.

303
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,590
What to eat, Boss?

304
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,240
I'll take care of the ordering.

305
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,750
Sir, what do you have?

306
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,550
Noodles, buns.

307
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,920
It's been swollen all night.

308
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,350
- Hurts a lot..
- Bear it.

309
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,010
Noodles are quick, and buns are ready.

310
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,520
Everything's almost done.

311
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,270
Can I go to hospital and check it later?

312
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,480
No need. Just eat.

313
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,240
Four bowls of noodles, one basket of buns.

314
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,830
Wait.

315
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,920
It's Thunderbolt.

316
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,110
What did he send?

317
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,460
(Azure One Base, 10 a.m.)

318
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
The blue color code.

319
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,820
Azure One Base. Let's go.

320
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,200
Hurry.

321
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,800
Hurry.

322
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,270
Boss, one more bowl of noodles.

323
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,560
- No more.
- Okay.

324
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,910
Let's go.

325
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,830
I'm not full yet.

326
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,400
It's fine, I'll just get another.

327
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,310
Time to go.

328
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,550
Hurry up.

329
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:34,460
(Shoulong Science-Based Industrial Park)

330
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,920
Young Mr. Lin, this way please.

331
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,760
Yasheng.

332
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,160
Hope I'm not late.

333
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,350
Didn't drive today?

334
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,680
It's an important place,

335
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,270
so I didn't want to trouble anyone.

336
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,790
Parked my car outside.

337
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,640
I said to pick you up, but you refused.

338
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,280
Let's go.

339
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,680
Young Mr. Lin.

340
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,820
Only President Lin
had visited Zhongjing Base before.

341
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,030
Last time I came here,

342
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,000
you stopped me.

343
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,400
After that, my dad died.

344
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,240
Sometimes I wonder

345
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,680
if you did it on purpose?

346
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,110
Zhongjing Base is a top secret unit.

347
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,590
Please hand over phones

348
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,510
and electronic devices before enter in.

349
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,550
This way, please.

350
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,790
Hello, please go through security.

351
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,400
Turn around, please.

352
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Young Mr. Lin,

353
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,590
this area is for

354
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,440
monitoring Zhongjing Chip production.

355
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,880
The production line is

356
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,350
fully AI robot-operated.

357
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,680
We've passed lab tests,

358
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,640
ready for small-scale production.

359
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,790
Is this the Zhongjing Chip known

360
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,840
as Nuclear Fusion Energy Little Sun
in the industry?

361
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,960
That's right.

362
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,510
The Zhongjing Chip is the core technology
of Azure One.

363
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,070
It can carry out clean energy's

364
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,160
fission production, conversion, and storage.

365
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,270
And can also reduce

366
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,160
losses from traditional
energy machines using.

367
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,880
Promoting Azure One

368
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
can greatly improve our environmental state.

369
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,240
Of course,
all of these are highly confidential.

370
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,310
I understand.

371
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,590
Gapung's new energy tech is mature.

372
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,370
Once they have the Zhongjing Chip,

373
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,030
it will surpass us and capture the market

374
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,790
like taking a shortcut.

375
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,660
Traditional oil competitors

376
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,920
definitely want to destroy them.

377
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,640
Right?

378
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,590
Seems you really did your homework.
