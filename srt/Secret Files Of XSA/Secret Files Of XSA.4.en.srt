1
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,680
Dedicate everything for the faith of the alliance

2
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,519
Dedicate everything for the faith

3
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,800
We are the Black Eye Alliance SAD

4
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,199
China Headquarters

5
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,960
Is there a death penalty here?

6
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,080
Okay

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,280
I'll tell you

8
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,560
They are SAD

9
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,400
Southeast Asia Democratic Front Alliance

10
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,960
Which is the action team of the Black Eye Alliance

11
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
The person I contacted is called Li Guang

12
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,879
He was the one leading the team just now

13
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,879
They told me

14
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,080
To smear the stuff on the towel

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,319
But they didn't tell me it would kill people

16
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,599
They promised that after it's done

17
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,680
They said they would give me a lot of money

18
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,840
And send me out of this country

19
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,159
I didn't expect this guy

20
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,840
to be quite a man

21
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,280
If my girlfriend got caught

22
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,560
I'd be even more of a man than him

23
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,719
Do you have a girlfriend?

24
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,120
You have

25
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:54,479
Hello

26
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,960
Leader, Shi Qian and Huo Min are with us

27
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,159
Huo Min's girlfriend Meng Li has been arrested

28
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,840
Do you think we should contact the embassy next?

29
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,919
For assistance

30
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,520
Okay, the approach is correct

31
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,719
We must protect Chinese citizens

32
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,199
Huo Min and Meng Li's personal safety

33
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,439
Make haste

34
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:13,479
I will coordinate with the relevant departments to resolve the subsequent matters

35
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,560
Understood

36
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,439
Old Lu, Flying General

37
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,839
I have just contacted Director Zhao

38
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,720
He said he will contact the relevant departments

39
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,079
Go in.

40
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,680
The officer said

41
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,920
Your boyfriend killed someone.

42
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,480
As long as we can find out where he is,

43
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,360
we'll let you go.

44
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,319
Little girl

45
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,480
Say what you know

46
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,480
Or don't blame us

47
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,120
For not knowing how hard we hit

48
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,560
Try it

49
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,160
Officer

50
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,000
Thank you

51
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,480
Sir, we have a discovery.

52
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,120
Someone said they were seen at Yingzhou Hot Springs.

53
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,199
Gather everyone, let's move out.

54
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,439
This is the Central Police Department's Criminal Investigation Division.

55
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,040
Let Ban Kun listen, this is Huo Min.

56
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,959
Sir, it's Huo Min.

57
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,319
Come back.

58
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,920
Huo Min, when are you coming to turn yourself in?

59
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,560
I'm here, I'm right outside your police station.

60
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,439
Let's go.

61
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,160
What's wrong, Huo Min?

62
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Do you still want to resist arrest at the police station entrance?

63
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,560
He is the real murderer. I want to see Meng Li.

64
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Bring him in.

65
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,040
Meng Li

66
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,920
You all stay outside and keep watch.

67
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes, Officer.

68
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,759
Take them out.

69
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,560
No one can come in without my orders.

70
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,199
Yes, Officer.

71
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,800
I knew it was you from the sound of your footsteps.

72
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,600
Yes, I'm here. It's okay.

73
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,000
They didn't hurt you, did they?

74
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,000
I must say, you are really bold.

75
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,759
You even came here on your own.

76
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,720
Ban Kun

77
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,439
Officer Ban Kun

78
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,480
I have already told you the truth about this matter.

79
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,399
This matter is

80
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,279
a murder planned by SAD.

81
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
He knows he can testify for me.

82
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,080
He and that female cleaner

83
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,519
have already been bribed by SAD.

84
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,039
They provided two types of poison.

85
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,320
These two poisons are harmless when separate.

86
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,360
The female cleaner

87
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,879
put one type of poison in the water pipe.

88
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,000
He put the other type of poison on the towel.

89
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,399
When these two poisons mix together,

90
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,960
they form a neurotoxin.

91
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,440
He can testify for me.

92
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,240
Hey, tell him.

93
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,840
Yes.

94
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,840
They killed the female cleaner.

95
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,639
Now they want to kill me to silence me.

96
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,720
So,

97
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,519
you know a lot about SAD.

98
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,000
SAD.

99
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,639
I've only met one person named Li Guang.

100
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,559
I haven't seen the others.

101
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,639
Who else was involved in your plan?

102
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,320
Yes, I think

103
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,799
there might be someone else.

104
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,840
Right here in this police station.

105
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,559
Hi, buddy

106
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,120
I already told him everything

107
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,279
Don't move

108
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,240
You

109
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,759
You are from SAD

110
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,000
Do you have evidence?

111
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,360
Who would believe a suspect?

112
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,639
Everyone will think

113
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,679
You people are ruthless

114
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,480
Killed the merchant from Sha Peng

115
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,039
And now you want to take my gun and kill me to silence me

116
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,879
I acted in self-defense

117
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,120
I must take you down

118
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,480
To deal with someone like you

119
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,600
Chinese people don't need to be ruthless

120
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,639
Meng Li

121
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,039
Meng Li

122
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,679
Sheriff, people from the Chinese embassy have arrived.

123
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,919
The higher-ups have ordered the immediate release of these two Chinese citizens.

124
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,720
Sheriff

125
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,399
The Chinese embassy in Eagle has learned

126
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,799
that the Eagle police department has unjustly detained Chinese citizens.

127
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,279
And as a lawyer,

128
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,039
my legal visitation rights have also been unjustly denied.

129
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,600
So we now demand

130
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,720
the release of the Chinese citizens.

131
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,240
We oppose illegal detention.

132
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,600
Yes.

133
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
We have already submitted all the evidence as planned

134
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,440
to the Chinese embassy.

135
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,399
The embassy is currently negotiating.

136
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:03,919
Sir, rest assured.

137
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,639
We will release Huo Min immediately.

138
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,919
Ambulance! Ambulance!

139
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,919
Ambulance

140
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,480
No, we can't let them go. They attacked the police.

141
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,960
Chief, there are media present. Be mindful of public image.

142
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,519
We can't let them leave.

143
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,600
The boss is one of Li Yunfei's people.

144
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,399
What? One of Li Yunfei's people?

145
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,240
Now the Chinese embassy and the Shapeng embassy

146
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,919
have both intervened.

147
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,440
What should we do next?

148
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,840
Blame him for everything.

149
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,559
This one is ruined.

150
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
The patient's body is still okay

151
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,240
She needs more rest

152
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,559
Meng Li

153
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:01,559
Meng Li

154
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,600
Meng Li

155
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,559
Meng Li

156
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,720
Meng Li

157
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,600
Mengli, you woke up.

158
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,639
Doctor, doctor, she woke up.

159
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,919
Mengli.

160
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Mengli.

161
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,159
How do you feel?

162
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,720
Coconut

163
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:39,360
Coconut milk ice cream

164
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,320
Take a look and see if you recognize him

165
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,159
Coconut milk

166
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,279
Coconut milk ice cream

167
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,639
The external injury damaged the nerves in the brain's language function area

168
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,320
causing her to be unable to speak now

169
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,919
Her consciousness is very clear

170
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,159
but she can't express herself

171
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,879
So she can only say one sentence

172
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,799
For her

173
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,519
this sentence must be very important

174
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,919
Doctor

175
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,720
Can she recover?

176
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,320
It will take time

177
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:46,240
I have now arranged for the best lawyer friend in Eagle State

178
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,720
They will do their utmost

179
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,559
to get the highest compensation for Meng Li

180
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,600
I am not confident in the medical conditions here

181
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,039
When Meng Li's condition improves

182
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,080
I will take her to a better hospital

183
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,320
Senior Brother, thank you

184
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,519
You don't need to thank me

185
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,840
I am not doing this for you

186
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,920
Huo Min

187
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,440
I don't know what has happened to you in the past two years

188
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,359
But since you still call me Senior Brother

189
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,400
There are some things I want to talk to you about

190
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,359
Are you still Meng Li's boyfriend

191
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,960
Meng Li has been in Eagle State for so long

192
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
Why haven't you come to see her

193
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,279
Did you know yesterday was Meng Li's birthday

194
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,680
Is this how you celebrated her birthday

195
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,680
You saw the diagnosis report, right

196
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,279
Severe soft tissue contusion

197
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,640
Two fractures and three bone cracks

198
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,880
Severe concussion

199
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,440
Don't you feel guilty

200
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,160
Huo Min

201
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,160
As your Senior Brother

202
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,759
There are some things I still need to say to you

203
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,480
Listen to my advice

204
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,759
Don't go after that dirty money

205
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,960
Stop earning it

206
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,519
You studied law

207
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,599
Don't forget that

208
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,480
Be nicer to Meng Li

209
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,480
Take care of yourself

210
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,680
How is your girlfriend?

211
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,559
Family of the patient

212
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,079
This was taken out of her ear yesterday

213
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,519
Thank you

214
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,880
It's a receiver

215
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,079
She is a foley artist

216
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,200
She has this habit

217
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,240
You are from SAD.

218
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,799
Do you have evidence?

219
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,519
Who would believe a suspect?

220
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,680
At that time, everyone will think

221
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,680
you people are ruthless.

222
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,359
You killed the merchant from Shapeng Country.

223
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,039
And you want to take my gun and kill me to silence me.

224
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,240
I acted in self-defense, I had to take you down.

225
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,799
We have evidence now.

226
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,119
Hand it over to the Chinese Embassy now.

227
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
With this,

228
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,880
we can convict Ban Kun.

229
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,559
Is there a death penalty here?

230
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,119
You messed up such a small task.

231
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:32,440
How can the alliance trust you?

232
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,279
As the person in charge of the entire Asia region,

233
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:38,000
If it weren't for Li Ge's people interfering,

234
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,839
the organization would have to reconsider your and Li Ge's positions.

235
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
What?

236
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,039
At this time, no mistakes are allowed.

237
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,160
Don't mess up our big plan.

238
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,799
Think carefully about what to do next.

239
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,160
Get up

240
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,839
Get up

241
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Did you guys eat at the hotel's buffet?

242
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
You didn't ask us when we were eating.

243
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,400
Did you spend your own money?

244
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,599
Is that the main point?

245
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,720
It's a pity if you didn't eat, you know.

246
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,680
You eat.

247
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,960
Boss, is yours tasty?

248
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,000
Over at the embassy,

249
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,599
we got some photos kept by the police.

250
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,279
These were taken by Huo Min's camera.

251
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,839
What kind of photography is this? Am I really that fat?

252
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,680
More than that.

253
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,759
I told you.

254
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,920
Our work never involves coincidences.

255
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,000
Go back and investigate him.

256
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,200
Go back and investigate.

257
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,880
His girlfriend is still in a coma in the hospital.

258
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,400
It's not the time for you to fight with him.

259
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,960
You've quickly developed a brotherly bond.

260
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Not really.

261
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,240
Even if it's work,

262
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:56,200
we don't need to be so strict.

263
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,720
We should show some humanity.

264
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,200
This is my work habit.

265
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,440
I know you have concerns.

266
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,799
Let's execute first.

267
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,319
Let's talk about that buffet.

268
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,519
Did you eat?

269
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,240
Come, come, come.

270
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,039
I want an ice cream.

271
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,319
What flavor?

272
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,440
Strawberry flavor.

273
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,119
Your ice cream

274
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,440
Enjoy

275
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,000
Thank you

276
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,920
Hello

277
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,599
Would you like to try coconut milk ice cream?

278
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,279
Two cups

279
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,640
Your ice cream

280
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,960
Coconut milk is lactose-free, so you can have it.

281
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,079
The food at that airport shop is quite good.

282
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,559
I knew it was you just by the sound of your footsteps.

283
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,160
Yes, I'm here. It's fine.

284
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,119
Sir, your ice cream

285
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Why are you here?

286
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,319
Boss, that's too much.

287
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,119
Early in the morning,

288
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,200
you're taking the blame alone and charging ahead.

289
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,519
What's up?

290
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,319
Are you really planning to make some people pack up and leave?

291
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:38,559
You're the leader now, and you're doing all the work.

292
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:39,960
What are we supposed to eat?

293
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,759
Didn't leave, right?

294
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,359
Let's talk business.

295
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,599
This person is highly suspicious.

296
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,200
Let's follow the procedure to investigate.

297
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,599
Then report to Zhao Younan.

298
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,640
If you don't keep up,

299
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,519
you'll only get the leftovers.

300
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,920
Don't worry, I've already arranged for Yalong and Dani to start investigating.

301
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,440
He's here.

302
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,359
What are you doing?

303
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,680
You come to see me every day.

304
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,119
No, I don't.

305
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,480
What's wrong with you?

306
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,759
I'm fine.

307
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,720
What's wrong with you?

308
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,799
Why are you running? You run.

309
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,839
I'm fine too.

310
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,559
Why are you running? You run.

311
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:46,839
Sit down.

312
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,960
What's your name?

313
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
Er Bing

314
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,160
Er Bing

315
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,720
So, is Da Bing your brother?

316
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,759
I wish I had a brother.

317
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,680
Why are you asking this?

318
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,519
Brother, it's nothing.

319
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,559
Then tell me, why are you called Er Bing?

320
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,680
Because my mom was playing mahjong.

321
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,680
She drew an Er Bing tile.

322
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,920
She won with a pure straight.

323
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,359
She got so excited that she gave birth to me.

324
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,640
Really? Don't fool me.

325
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,880
Winning with Er Bing.

326
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,440
What are they exchanging?

327
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,599
I can't see clearly.

328
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,359
Can you get closer?

329
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,039
No, I can't.

330
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,640
There's no hidden spot inside.

331
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,839
We'll be exposed if we go in.

332
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:42,640
Brother Shen

333
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,559
Is there any food in the car?

334
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,119
I'm hungry. Take whatever you want.

335
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm not a child anymore.

336
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,839
What's the use of this?

337
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,759
What's the use?

338
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,039
This is called a weapon, understand?

339
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,039
Imported.

340
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,440
If anyone messes with you in the future, you mess with them.

341
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,319
What if it's not as powerful as you said?

342
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,759
If it's useless, come find me.

343
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,720
What's the point of finding you?

344
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,680
What's the point of finding me?

345
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,759
Find me and I'll fill you in.

346
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,839
Sit properly.

347
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,400
You can do it.

348
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,920
Er Bing, Er Bing

349
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,880
Hurry up

350
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,599
Go

351
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,400
Er Bing

352
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,680
I have a tough task for you

353
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,039
Tomorrow at three o'clock in the afternoon

354
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,400
Xin Chuan Public Welfare Center Square

355
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,119
Did you hear that?

356
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,559
I'm not going

357
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,680
You're not going?

358
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:16,839
A money-making job, and you're not going?

359
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,880
What time?

360
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,319
Three in the afternoon

361
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:19,799
Where?

362
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,279
Xin Chuan Public Welfare Center Square

363
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:23,920
Got it

364
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,240
Three o'clock, remember

365
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,559
Go ahead

366
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,319
Follow them

367
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,720
Got it

368
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,799
I have a water gun too.

369
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,039
I want to play with you.

370
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,599
You can't play with us.

371
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,279
Can you lend me some money?

372
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,000
Why?

373
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,880
I promised my friend to bring back a gift.

374
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,519
Thanks.

375
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,200
Boss, he went in.

376
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,759
Let's wrap it up.

377
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,640
Why is this empty? What's going on?

378
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:04,599
Huo Min

379
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,839
Sis Yi

380
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,440
You're back

381
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,720
And about that leave request

382
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:11,880
Come with me first

383
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,400
Come in

384
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:29,960
Take a look, how does it feel?

385
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,039
Boss, let me explain first.

386
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,279
This mission is indeed because of me

387
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,920
I just wanted you to dig up some dirt

388
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,200
I really didn't expect you to almost

389
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:39,640
The ancestral grave of the Yingzhou Police Department has been dug up.

390
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,880
I asked you to handle legal affairs, it's a waste of your talent.

391
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,839
I didn't complete the task assigned to me by the organization.

392
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,480
Punish me, I'll accept whatever you decide.

393
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:51,599
Sit down.

394
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,400
From now on, your office will be on the second floor.

395
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,720
This is what you deserve.

396
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,039
This

397
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,480
is no different from before, still the legal department.

398
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,720
On the surface, yes.

399
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:16,960
With this card,

400
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,079
you can freely enter and exit the second floor from now on.

401
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,240
This second floor

402
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,160
is the core area of our company.

403
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,839
Thank you, boss.

404
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,039
Huo Min,

405
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,079
I really want to know

406
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,440
how much you have learned about SAD through this.

407
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:39,960
SAD's influence in Eagle Continent is quite significant.

408
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:41,359
They sent a lot of people this time.

409
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,400
It's all for Lin Shoulong and Jia Tenglongqi.

410
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,559
What's the situation with their people?

411
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,640
They're just a bunch of

412
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,880
reckless thugs.

413
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,880
Now I need to reintroduce you to

414
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,920
the real name of our organization.

415
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,160
We are the Black Eye Alliance, SAD.

416
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,720
China Headquarters.

417
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,799
So why do they want to

418
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,079
Why do they want to kill you, right?

419
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,599
The reason is very simple.

420
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,079
We are in the same organization,

421
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,599
but our positions are different.

422
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:14,440
I know.

423
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,800
You are still brooding over your girlfriend's matter.

424
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,960
But for our great mission,

425
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:21,360
some sacrifices are inevitable.

426
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,239
This

427
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,880
is the organization's test for you.

428
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,400
Congratulations.

429
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,760
You passed the test.

430
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,159
Now I will introduce you to

431
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:36,400
the core members of our organization.

432
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,000
This is Wei.

433
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,760
He has contributed a lot to our organization.

434
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,320
This is Han Yao

435
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,119
He brought our organization

436
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,320
a lot of prestige

437
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,400
Brother Yao

438
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:19,880
Yang Xiaoyi

439
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,960
My family

440
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,440
I tell her everything

441
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,760
Hello

442
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,559
Welcome to join us

443
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,880
Have a seat

444
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,000
This is a celebration banquet prepared for you.

445
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,079
Of course.

446
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:50,239
It is also a rallying banquet for our next operation.

447
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,039
Next operation.

448
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:57,400
The headquarters has not given us any way out.

449
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,519
So you need to be careful.

450
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,880
In one week,

451
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,519
we will present the headquarters with a gift

452
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,199
heavier than the one given to Jiateng Longqi.

453
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,159
Everything is ready, we can start at any time.

454
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,599
What is this?

455
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,519
This is a dish we prepare for every new member.

456
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,960
A special dish.

457
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,519
Shirako.

458
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,320
It's from a pufferfish.

459
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,280
The ovaries.

460
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:30,519
This thing is poisonous.

461
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,000
The toxin in shirako

462
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,960
varies with the seasons.

463
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,480
Maybe

464
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:38,360
the pufferfish ovaries you're eating

465
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:40,159
aren't poisonous.

466
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,719
How can we tell if it's poisonous or not?

467
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:46,760
There's no way to tell.

468
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,119
Even if you get poisoned, don't worry.

469
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,039
As long as you're tough enough,

470
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,559
the toxin might break down within eight hours.

471
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,119
You must cut open the trachea.

472
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,880
I've already prepared everything.

473
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,480
Right here.

474
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:02,840
Make a small cut, about the size of a thumb.

475
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,599
And you have to be quick.

476
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,079
You must be fast.

477
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:09,000
Otherwise, the brain will be deprived of oxygen and...

478
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,239
Will die

479
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,679
Either die or become foolish

480
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:16,239
Huo Min

481
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,760
Our organization is like this pufferfish

482
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,280
It contains deadly poison but appears harmless

483
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,559
At critical moments, we must fight desperately

484
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,480
For our beliefs

485
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:30,440
We disregard life and death

486
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,320
Come

487
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:38,119
Belief above all

488
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,079
Belief above all

489
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,239
Belief above all

490
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,559
Belief above all

491
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,320
This is not bad.

492
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,480
How about another serving?

493
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,599
Threw up, huh?

494
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:46,280
This is just the first meal.

495
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,599
The food here

496
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,199
isn't that good.

497
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,559
Remember

498
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,679
Although our alliance's time

499
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,639
has a time difference with here

500
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,880
but now we will witness under the alliance's time

501
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,239
to take an oath

502
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:20,639
I swear to dedicate everything for the alliance's faith

503
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,280
I swear

504
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,360
to dedicate everything for the faith

505
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:29,639
to dedicate everything for the alliance's faith

506
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,719
to dedicate everything for the faith

507
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,079
to dedicate everything for the alliance's faith

508
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:10,079
Have you gained weight recently?

509
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,039
Stop talking about dieting all the time.

510
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,599
Ladies, a cup of coffee for everyone.

511
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,199
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.

512
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,840
No need, no need, no need.

513
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,840
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.

514
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,519
So you won't say I'm stingy all the time.

515
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,280
Boss, we are working on such a big project in Yingzhou.

516
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,559
And you only treat us to a cup of coffee each from the convenience store.

517
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,920
Isn't that stingy?

518
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,239
Everyone sit down, sit down, sit down.

519
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,840
Come on, come on, quickly, everyone sit.

520
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,199
Today, I'll use water instead of wine.

521
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,679
To toast you with two cups.

522
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,559
The first cup,

523
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,800
is for your excellent job in protecting Shoulong this time.

524
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,360
You did an outstanding job.

525
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:47,440
Cheers.

526
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,800
Thank you, boss.

527
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,960
And the second cup,

528
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,559
is my self-punishment.

529
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,440
President Jia's assassination is my responsibility.

530
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,280
Without President Jia,

531
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,840
Jiang Shanghong has become the acting president.

532
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,079
This person is not very good.

533
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,920
And he doesn't have a good relationship with us.

534
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:11,920
So, your next task

535
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,880
will be even more difficult.

536
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:15,880
But it's okay.

537
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:19,639
Gain experience and learn from mistakes.

538
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,239
Prepare in advance and strike at the heart.

539
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,519
SAD will definitely act again.

540
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,840
We will wait here for them.

541
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,639
From now on, this place

542
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,519
will be your new base.

543
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Director

544
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,039
This organization cares too much about us.

545
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,000
This isn't a place to work.

546
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,119
This is practically my home.

547
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,000
Isn't your home in the car?

548
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,039
From now on, that will be my old home, okay?

549
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,599
Master, do you mean

550
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:03,079
we should keep an eye on the Shoulong Group from here?

551
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:05,400
Isn't this place the closest to the Shoulong Group?

552
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,519
Yes.

553
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:08,880
So, where is this place?

554
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,440
Convenience store.

555
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:13,519
Yes, a convenience store, a convenience store.

556
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:14,960
Isn't it more convenient?

557
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,960
But we interacted with so many of them in Yingzhou.

558
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,440
Won't we be recognized?

559
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,639
Don't worry about that.

560
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,239
I installed a facial recognition device at the entrance.

561
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,880
In simple terms, it scans faces.

562
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
I input all the information

563
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,280
of everyone related to you.

564
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:32,199
As soon as this person enters the door,

565
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,159
you will receive an alert.

566
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,559
Director

567
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:40,119
Where should we put our equipment?

568
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,239
Come.

569
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,199
Wow, it's so big down here.

570
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,880
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming

571
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,880
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

572
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,320
Director Zhao, you even prepared beds for us.

573
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,039
Are you asking us to stay here?

574
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:11,320
Wu Yalong, that's our place.

575
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,559
This is quite suitable for working out.

576
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:13,960
This is our place now, right?

577
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:15,760
The colors are too messy.

578
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,960
Leave it to me, boss.

579
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:18,280
I'll organize it well for you in a bit.

580
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,199
Master, let's start working.

581
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,159
Okay.

582
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:26,840
Hurry up and tidy up.

583
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,039
We still have a mission later.

584
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,679
Come, let me check for you.

585
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,599
If I had known you were doing a physical exam today,

586
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,880
I wouldn't have bothered.

587
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:37,039
Don't your hands feel numb?

588
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:37,960
Numb hands, that's because

589
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:40,480
I scratched too many lottery tickets too hard.

590
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:41,920
Then you should definitely get it checked, hurry up.

591
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,840
Slow down

592
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,400
Can I walk fast with this leg?

593
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,679
Look, look

594
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,400
Are you sick? You've exposed yourself

595
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:50,280
This leg of mine

596
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:52,599
It was blown up on the battlefield back then

597
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,800
Decades have passed, and nothing has happened

598
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:57,119
People

599
00:43:58,159 --> 00:43:59,960
As long as there's no problem here

600
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,400
Then you're a good person

601
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,400
Slow down, slow down

602
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,840
Still checking?

603
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,119
Hurry up

604
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,719
Er Bing, make sure to remember today

605
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,639
Keep an eye on him, complete every check

606
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:13,320
Got it?

607
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,079
It's up to you

608
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:14,960
Hmm

609
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,840
Lawyer Huo

610
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,320
I recognize you, you are that

611
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,800
security guard, security team leader, security team leader

612
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,519
Let me introduce myself again

613
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,239
Luo Shanshan
