=Secret Files Of XSA=

2
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,280
Do you have some kind of unspeakable secret?

3
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,640
If I told them,

4
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,790
they'd be scared to death.

5
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,800
You nearly ruined Shoulong Group.

6
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,120
These noodles are good.

7
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,000
Not only do police officers have guns.

8
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,000
Officer Huo?

9
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,940
=Episode 12=

10
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,080
I heard about what happened with Jin Chuan.

11
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,590
Feels a little hasty.

12
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,750
You'd better look into it more.

13
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,870
Good for you, PR legend, always

14
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,150
seeing through people.

15
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,560
Public relation and public security...

16
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,590
Kinda the same vibe, huh?

17
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,680
But there's one person
I really didn't see through.

18
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,190
That's you.

19
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,150
What?

20
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,310
Even you have off days?

21
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,800
This is actually quite simple.

22
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,430
Can you help me out, mighty one?

23
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,400
Sure.

24
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,710
Miss Tang,

25
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,310
if you're free, let's grab a bite tomorrow.

26
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,360
No problem.

27
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,630
Actually, I also want to
apologize for Lin Yasheng's

28
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,630
recklessness.

29
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,030
How about we let him treat us?

30
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,310
No problem.

31
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,800
I hope he'll do it, not just say it.

32
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,470
- I'm off, then.
- Bye.

33
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,310
See you tomorrow.

34
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,520
When will Mr. Lin finish his meeting?

35
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,710
He should be finishing up soon.

36
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,280
Everyone, please have some water.

37
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,310
Water?

38
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,910
We can't just force Mr. Jin to resign

39
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,750
just to satisfy the higher-ups.

40
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,750
Sorry, everyone.

41
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,520
I'm submitting my resignation to the board.

42
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,680
This wasn't a rash decision.

43
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,000
It's due to health reasons.

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,950
I've thought it through carefully.

45
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,800
Mr. Lin talked with me as well.

46
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,630
So, I've decided

47
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,310
to step down from administrative duties

48
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,360
and continue focusing on research.

49
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,830
Here's the thing.

50
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,240
The work Jin Chuan was responsible for

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,430
will now be taken over

52
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,870
by Gao Jianguo, Vice President Gao.

53
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,920
Anyone have objections?

54
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
If not,

55
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,000
let's get back to work.

56
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,640
Okay.

57
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,560
Yasheng.

58
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,950
I've told you.

59
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,390
I'm still digging into

60
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,190
the video thing.

61
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,680
We have a narrow window for this.

62
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,390
Jin Chuan stepped down

63
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,520
from his administrative duties
for this reason,

64
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,160
so he could focus all his energy

65
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,080
on Azure One.

66
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
Alright.

67
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,560
Son.

68
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,240
You've improved.

69
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,600
You're doing a good job.

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,840
By the way,

71
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,920
Dr. Fan mentioned

72
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,720
you haven't had a check-up in a while.

73
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,360
Go when you have time.

74
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,160
Everyone at Shoulong is so busy.

75
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,870
If anything happens to you, I won't

76
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,830
have time to take you to the hospital.

77
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,350
Dad.

78
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,750
Don't worry.

79
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,190
I'll do my best.

80
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,920
I've got a saying for you.

81
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,350
Go ahead.

82
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,830
Good kids are raised with praise.

83
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,750
Captain Luo!

84
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,630
Well, look at you.

85
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,680
Stop it.

86
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,480
It's all your fault.

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,560
You're so fierce. I'm so scared.

88
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,510
You got this, Captain Luo?

89
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,240
You made me dress like this.

90
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,920
Why do we have to meet here?

91
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,630
Forget whether I wanted to say no.

92
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,630
In that danger, did I even have a choice?

93
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,560
What's she up to, really?

94
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,310
Look at you.

95
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,510
You're so special.

96
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,930
Just like me, no filters, no holding back.

97
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,270
But it's perfect.

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,720
It gives us a reason to get close to her

99
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,900
and learn about her relationship
with Lin Yasheng.

100
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,480
Did you get anything?

101
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,190
Using the webcam you gave me,

102
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,480
I tracked down the manufacturer
and the Taobao shop.

103
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,870
I contacted the seller.

104
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
He's a college student.

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,670
He used his real ID to buy it.

106
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,600
Someone anonymously told him online to get

107
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,720
a part-time job at this restaurant,

108
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,070
and he likely planted the camera

109
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,190
during one of his shifts.

110
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,070
When was it?

111
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,130
After the negotiation with Gapung.

112
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,230
So it wasn't Jin Chuan who leaked it.

113
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,830
So who's been trying to throw us off?

114
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,800
What are they up to?

115
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,430
Let's just get going.

116
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,310
You sure it's the right place?

117
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,360
You don't know the lives of the rich.

118
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,750
What are you doing?

119
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,390
What do you mean? I'm pursuing you.

120
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
Cameras everywhere. Keep it professional.

121
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,390
But you haven't won me over yet.

122
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,930
Why treat them to dinner?

123
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,400
And at this place?

124
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,790
Is this even a place to eat?

125
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,510
But right now,

126
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,240
I'm a bit hungry.

127
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,280
Here they come.

128
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,680
Young Mr. Lin.

129
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,630
Waiter, water please.

130
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,870
Yes, sir.

131
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,870
Is this drinkable? Get me bottled water.

132
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,750
Yes, sir.

133
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,590
Cold, please.

134
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:18,790
Yes, miss.

135
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,000
Chill out.

136
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,150
Excuse me, sir.

137
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,630
Here's your cold bottled water.

138
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,080
I don't know yet.

139
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,840
When did you two first meet?

140
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,990
- A long time ago....
- Not long...

141
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,670
Actually,

142
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,080
I noticed her

143
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,480
when I worked at XCC.

144
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Back then, I used to

145
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,080
stop by her convenience store,
hoping to "run into" her.

146
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,150
She was quite aloof.

147
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,000
She ignored me.

148
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,750
So, that cute little convenience store

149
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,550
is run by Miss Tang alone?

150
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,120
It was my first time there.

151
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,240
I never really noticed it before.

152
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,240
Even the colors of the products

153
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,120
are neatly arranged.

154
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,150
What an interesting convenience store.

155
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,630
Why did you open it in such a remote area?

156
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,750
Because the rent's cheaper there,

157
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,980
and the Shoulong Group,

158
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,480
a huge company, is next door.

159
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,000
So, are Shoulong's employees
your only customers?

160
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,440
Is Shoulong that remote?

161
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,080
Not at all.

162
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,870
Why are you so curious
about her convenience store?

163
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,720
Then what should I be curious about?

164
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,550
Get some fresh air.

165
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,000
We'd like to order.

166
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,910
Got any leads on Jin Chuan's case?

167
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,840
You don't need to worry about details.

168
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,510
He didn't leak it, did he?

169
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,320
No.

170
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,270
Keqing totally called it.

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,790
A woman's instincts really cracked the case.

172
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,550
Are we investigating or not?

173
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,630
Yes, we are.

174
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,030
I hate being lied to.

175
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,030
This one's tasty.

176
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,270
Thank you.

177
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,320
Lin Yasheng is really nice to you.

178
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,360
Him being nice doesn't matter,

179
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,270
as long as it's real.

180
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,800
What about you?

181
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,960
He's been chasing you for a while, right?

182
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,000
Doesn't matter how long,

183
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,910
as long as it's real.

184
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,440
But I can tell,

185
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,630
you have feelings for him.

186
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,720
Whether he's won your heart,

187
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,390
that

188
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,030
I can't tell yet.

189
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
But we both

190
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,150
have problems we can't face.

191
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,320
What kind of problems?

192
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,600
Do you have some kind of unspeakable secret?

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,630
Are you two...

194
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,150
You're good at scaring people.

195
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,790
Look at them.

196
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,280
They're having so much fun.

197
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,000
They're like two kids.

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
Yeah.

199
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,080
Bye, Young Mr. Lin.

200
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,150
Bai Keqing

201
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,600
is really hard to read.

202
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,960
For a moment there,

203
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,270
I almost let my guard down.

204
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,960
You said it takes three years
to know someone.

205
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,270
Isn't it a bit early to say that?

206
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,120
Yeah.

207
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,150
We haven't known each other long.

208
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,750
Doesn't matter how long,

209
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,360
as long as it's real.

210
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,150
That's Matt.

211
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,720
He doesn't know about Jin Chuan resigning.

212
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,390
I'll use this chance to take credit

213
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,550
and invite him for a meeting.

214
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,150
Hi, Matt.

215
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,320
Huo Min, you've wanted to meet me, right?

216
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,670
I know a good place. Let's meet there.

217
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,120
Hello?

218
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,790
I'm here. Where are you?

219
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,270
Go down the alley to your right.

220
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,120
Okay.

221
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,870
Keep going straight.

222
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,720
Make a right at the first turn.

223
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,790
Keep going straight.

224
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,600
Turn left at the next corner.

225
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,120
Bro,

226
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,320
where are we rushing to?

227
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,750
You'll see.

228
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,440
Here are your noodles.

229
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,000
Coming right up.

230
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,230
Boss?

231
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,440
Are you Viper?

232
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,480
Have you tried the noodles?

233
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,960
They're so good.

234
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,240
Have more if you like them.

235
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,550
The next one's on the house.

236
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Well, we're full today.

237
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,440
Come back another time.

238
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,360
It's okay.

239
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,720
Boss,

240
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,750
can I add a seat here?

241
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,630
No way.

242
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,600
Please find him another seat.

243
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,960
Sure. No problem.

244
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,910
Come sit over here, by the door.

245
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,550
I'll bring you the noodles.

246
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,840
Mom.

247
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,550
Grandma's waiting too, you know.

248
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,840
He's my boss.

249
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,670
Your boss?

250
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,670
You haven't worked in years.

251
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,080
You have a boss?

252
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,200
Come here.

253
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Let me introduce you.

254
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,480
He really is my boss.

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,080
He's good to me.

256
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,320
- Really?
- Of course.

257
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,240
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

258
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,320
Okay. Good.

259
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,480
If you like it, I'll get you some more.

260
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,870
Good.

261
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,630
You silly kid.

262
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,960
Honey,

263
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,870
son's boss is here!

264
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,960
I enjoy dealing with smart ones.

265
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,680
I'm not smart. I'm dumb.

266
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,070
Your mom

267
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,680
is smarter than you.

268
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,590
Boss.

269
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,200
Boss.

270
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,290
Boss.

271
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,470
B... boss.

272
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,200
It's a mess back here. I haven't cleaned up.

273
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,260
There's no room to move.

274
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,720
Can you come back later?

275
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,000
Let me clean up first.

276
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,320
School's out.

277
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,760
Jun.

278
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,350
You still here?

279
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,480
It's pouring. Where's Dad?

280
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,510
I don't know where he is.

281
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,440
Have a seat, anywhere you like.

282
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,240
Boss, he's my big brother.

283
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,440
He had a head injury as a kid, so...

284
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,420
Hi, I'm Huo Min's colleague.

285
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,800
Huo Min is...

286
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,330
my younger brother.

287
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,370
Are you...

288
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,620
a police officer?

289
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,960
But you don't have a gun.

290
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,800
Jun.

291
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,750
Not only do police officers have guns.

292
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,830
Officer Huo?

293
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,000
Boss, that's not funny.

294
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,260
Jun, I'm a lawyer.

295
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,160
My friends are police officers.

296
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,000
Got it?

297
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,740
The ones eating and drinking here are cops.

298
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,950
- What?
- I'm a lawyer.

299
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,110
Why are you all in the yard?

300
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,270
Come on in.

301
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,200
This is my husband.

302
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,920
Let's go inside. I'll whip up

303
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,110
some dishes.

304
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,830
Are you really dumb, or just pretending?

305
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,510
He's dumb.

306
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,960
Can't you see? He's not right in the head.

307
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,550
- Yes.
- I'm telling you.

308
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,680
I'll show you.

309
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,760
There's a photo of police officer...

310
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,650
Jun!

311
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,670
You're talking nonsense!

312
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,380
Nonsense!

313
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,840
It's okay, it's okay.

314
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,550
Don't cry.

315
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,830
Don't take him seriously.

316
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,200
You believe what he says?

317
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,110
Our kid's not all there.

318
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,120
It's alright, it's alright.

319
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,570
It's a total wreck in here.

320
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,480
Not good.

321
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,160
I'm really sorry.

322
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,400
Please go have some tea.

323
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,880
It's such a mess here.

324
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,310
And it stinks.

325
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,550
Come on, dear.

326
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,640
Go tidy up the room inside.

327
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,530
Hey you, look after your brother.

328
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,790
There's nothing

329
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,160
in there.

330
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,990
Look at you...

331
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,070
You can't watch that.

332
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,070
Please don't watch it.

333
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,640
Alright.

334
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,500
No shame in saying it.

335
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,790
He's a grown-up man.

336
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,900
I was trying to help him
with his personal needs.

337
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,170
You...

338
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,240
You dirty old man!

339
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,740
Why are you hitting me?

340
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,910
How could you do
something like this at home?

341
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,820
How dare you do this!

342
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,030
Dad. Mom.

343
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,350
How dare you!

344
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,480
It's even your first time here.

345
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,620
I'm sorry about this.

346
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,550
Sorry, Matt. Don't be mad.

347
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,270
I'm sorry this had to happen.

348
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,880
Come anytime for noodles. It's on me.

349
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Anytime you want it...

350
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,620
Didn't you say the backyard's a mess?

351
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,440
I don't see any mess.

352
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,510
What I saw was a good show.

353
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,960
Well, Matt,

354
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,720
my dad's always like that.

355
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,110
Please don't mind him, okay?

356
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,830
I don't care about your tricks.

357
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,200
If you mess up my plans,

358
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,350
this noodle shop...

359
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,400
I got it.

360
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,270
Look, I know

361
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,680
I caused you trouble

362
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,400
back when I worked for Li Ge.

363
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,240
I admit that.

364
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,270
But from now on, I, Huo Min,

365
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,790
am on your side. Don't worry.

366
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,160
I'm not like Li Ge.

367
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,310
This is Firer.

368
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,160
You'll be working with him on the next task.

369
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,960
Bro,

370
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,270
what task?

371
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,070
You will see.

372
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,480
These noodles are good.

373
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,200
Don't be scared.

374
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,270
It's okay.

375
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,350
Mom's here. Don't be scared.

376
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,740
I felt something's off when they showed up.

377
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,520
It's all my fault.

378
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,790
I didn't hide the photo.

379
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,480
Your brother found it.

380
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,920
Mom, it's okay.

381
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,200
We'll hang it somewhere else.

382
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,480
Hang it again? Really?

383
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,590
Haven't we had enough trouble?

384
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,400
Why not just hang a black-and-white one?

385
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,410
So, they tried to scare me?

386
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,030
They don’t know what my two sons do.

387
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,030
If I told them,

388
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,440
they'd be scared to death.

389
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,040
Min.

390
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,720
I'm not...

391
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,720
a fool.

392
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
You are...

393
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,550
a police officer.

394
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,160
Yes,

395
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,440
I'm a police officer.

396
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,550
I'm a police officer.

397
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,630
I'm a police officer.

398
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,530
We're police officers.

399
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,960
We're police officers.

400
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,000
We're police officers,

401
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,460
all of us.

402
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,680
Short hair.

403
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,110
A bit of a mustache.

404
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,270
Nothing else.

405
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,270
Looks like this?

406
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,440
Good for you.

407
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,030
I was so vague, and you still drew it.

408
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,880
Amazing!

409
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,140
Is it him?

410
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,110
No.

411
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,720
Not him either.

412
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,360
Nope.

413
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,310
That's him, Peng Yonghui.

414
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,270
Peng Yonghui?

415
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,680
No border entry or exit records.

416
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,350
He must've been hiding out here for a while.

417
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,400
So what are Matt and Peng Yonghui up to?

418
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,110
- Hi, sir.
- Hello.

419
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,960
Hey, fellow townsman.

420
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,110
Have you eaten?

421
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,400
You haven't? Let me get...

422
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,240
I've eaten.

423
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,310
I was just asking you.

424
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,350
I'm busy with my work here.
No time to eat.

425
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,240
Perfect. I made some dishes.
Let's eat together.

426
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,110
You're so kind.

427
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,270
But I'm really busy here.

428
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,160
I'll help you finish up, then we can eat.

429
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,070
Let's finish this up.

430
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,200
(Member's Day)
Where should I put this?

431
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,800
Jiang,

432
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,440
I told you to change the bulb that day.

433
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,580
This isn't a bulb issue.

434
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,190
It's the voltage. I'll fix it later.

435
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,790
You just looked at it and figured it out?

436
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,200
I work as an electrician there.

437
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,520
It's a piece of cake to me.

438
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,390
No problem.

439
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,880
Zhu, go get some chopsticks.

440
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,720
Okay.

441
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,750
Please, have a seat.

442
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,160
Come on, boy. Sit down.

443
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,590
Wow, it must be tasty.

444
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,750
In that company,

445
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,550
I handle all the circuits.

446
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
I even manage the circuits

447
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,030
in the big boss's office.

448
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,720
The big Boss?

449
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Lin Shoulong?

450
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,790
Most people can't even get in.

451
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,920
Me? I go in anytime.

452
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,830
I went there twice last week.

453
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,790
Twice last week?

454
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,110
Why?

455
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,070
For maintenance.

456
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,880
Dig in, you guys.

457
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,550
Boy, have some meat.

458
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,790
Bro, you eat,

459
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,830
I need to use the restroom.

460
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,590
Here you go, boy.

461
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,080
- Here, eat up.
- Thanks.

462
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,260
(Shoulong Group)

463
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,460
(Utility Room)

464
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

465
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,160
I applied for it before.

466
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,200
The security team?

467
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,350
- Yes.
- The stuff is all in there.

468
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,270
Find it yourself.

469
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,160
Thanks.

470
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,090
Both repairs were for
the automatic curtain box.

471
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,540
The first time was two weeks ago.

472
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,750
The second time was yesterday.

473
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,020
Same technician, Zhao.

474
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,110
What could be in this?

475
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,000
Could be anything.

476
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,960
We need more info to narrow it down.

477
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,680
Look.

478
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,350
The curtain box is too close to Lin Shoulong.

479
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,160
It needs to be placed

480
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,550
and removed discreetly.

481
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,720
They must have a detailed plan.

482
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,000
Zhao is definitely involved.

483
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,840
Feijiang,

484
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,480
go bring in Zhao for questioning.

485
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,160
Boss,

486
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,830
I'll go.

487
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,650
Maybe I should check
Lin Shoulong's office again.

488
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,420
(Jincheng City Detention Center)

489
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,720
Do you know what this is?

490
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,000
Yes, it's a curtain box.

491
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,750
Did you install it in Lin Shoulong's office?

492
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,240
Yes.

493
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,680
Do you know what's inside it?

494
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,030
No.

495
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,240
You installed something

496
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,680
in Lin Shoulong's office
without even knowing what it was?

497
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,550
This thing is suspected
of leaking confidential info.

498
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,720
It could cause you a criminal offense.

499
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,590
If you don't tell us the truth,

500
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,830
how can we help you?

501
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,790
I'll come clean.

502
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,480
A friend from my hometown approached me

503
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:29,680
and said their company wanted to
get inside info from Shoulong Group

504
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,830
to sell to foreign research institutions.

505
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:38,160
He gave me a curtain box
with a covert recorder in it.

506
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,820
He said if I could install it
in the boss's office,

507
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,860
I'd get 50,000 yuan as a reward.

508
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,040
50,000 yuan.

509
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,680
All that for 50,000 yuan.

510
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,310
Why did you change the curtain box later?

511
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,350
Well,

512
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,420
the company leak was a big scandal,

513
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,410
so much so that even a VP resigned over it.

514
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,900
I was worried that they'd trace it to me,

515
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,920
so I found a way to take it out.

516
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,510
Where is it?

517
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,340
In my toolbox, in the electrical room.

518
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,510
Officer,

519
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,590
please don't let my boss know.

520
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,590
I have family to feed.

521
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,030
If my boss finds out, I'll be fired.

522
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,640
I'll return the money. Please.

523
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Please, officer, I'm begging you.

524
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,350
Zhao,

525
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,960
do you realize that, out of little greed,

526
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,240
you installed this device

527
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,880
and nearly ruined Shoulong Group?

528
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,590
I checked the cleaning records.

529
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,070
Someone cleaned the outer windows

530
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,000
on the day the curtain box broke.

531
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,960
Check it out.

532
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,640
I took a photo of

533
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,830
the window frame of Lin Shoulong's office.

534
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,870
Look at this angle.

535
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,800
See anything strange?

536
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,640
So, you mean...

537
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,590
Well? Have you found anything?

538
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,040
Yalong?

539
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,240
Yes.

540
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,750
This is a recording device.

541
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,550
If your assumption is correct,

542
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,880
all our clues align now.

543
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,750
Someone damaged the curtain box on purpose,

544
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,680
quickly contacted Zhao,

545
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,960
and replace it with

546
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,880
a curtain box containing a covert recorder.

547
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,400
All these "coincidences"

548
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,110
prove this is a long-term setup.

549
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,830
Too bad. It's been over two weeks.

550
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,000
That cleaner must be long gone.

551
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,550
But look at this device.

552
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,510
It's quite refined.

553
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,640
This is a top-tier spy gear,

554
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,350
super rare and hard to get.

555
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,510
Does it still work?

556
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,920
Why?

557
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,350
You want to sell it?

558
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,400
You got a better idea?

559
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,510
Danni, get me a Torjan.

560
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,520
Okay.

561
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,720
Yalong, plug it in.

562
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,560
Got it.

563
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,510
Boss, done.

564
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,340
(Loading)

565
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,550
Boss, will they really access this file?

566
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,550
Let's wait and see.

567
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,820
(Success)

568
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,400
They received it?

569
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,660
(Error)

570
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,920
Looks like they caught on.

571
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,960
It's okay.

572
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,830
You were quick with it.

573
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,310
They're just more cautious.

574
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,200
Should we think of another plan?

575
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,510
This is out of

576
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,510
your unit's jurisdiction.

577
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,350
I'll report to higher-ups.

578
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,440
Have the bureau

579
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,510
fill Lin Shoulong in.

580
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,380
(SHURA: Destroy all.)

581
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,300
(FIRER)

582
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,980
I think we've been exposed.

583
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,980
Clean up the source of the covert recorder.

584
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,350
You handle it personally.

585
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,720
But the plan here...

586
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,590
You'll go dormant. Wait for orders.

587
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,930
Understood.

588
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,200
I'll find a chance

589
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,690
to disappear from here.

590
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,540
(Shoulong Group)

591
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,400
The city authority gave us an ultimatum.

592
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,070
I've gathered you here

593
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,350
to talk about our next step

594
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,830
on the negotiations with Gapung.

595
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,070
See if we can work out something better.

596
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,110
From the way Gapung's acting,

597
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,880
they're going all in this time.

598
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,840
All they want is a satisfying answer.

599
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Maybe we just

600
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,480
work with the current terms

601
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,110
and keep talking with them.

602
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,800
Are you scared

603
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,920
or just spineless?

604
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,530
Watch your mouth.

605
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm still your elder.

606
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,960
Even if we agree to their terms,

607
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,800
what if they make unreasonable demands?

608
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,710
Are we

609
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,590
just going to keep giving in?

610
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,440
We've found the source of the leak.

611
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,670
As long as we stay sharp,

612
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,840
I believe

613
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,880
Gapung will back off.

614
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,360
I'm also filling in for VP Jin.

615
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,710
I've got two roles on my shoulders.

616
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,440
Let me talk to them.

617
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,920
If anything goes wrong in the future,

618
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,070
let me be the one

619
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,960
history blames.

620
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,190
Don't say that.

621
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,960
This concerns national tech security.

622
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,150
Can you bear the blame?

623
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,000
Chief Wei's calling.

624
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,630
You all take a break.

625
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,000
I'll be right back.

626
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,300
Are you okay?

627
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,580
I'm fine.

628
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,580
Chief Wei, this is Lin Shoulong.

629
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,880
Mr. Lin, just so you know,
Director Zhao has retired.

630
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,210
I'll take it from here.

631
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,780
We've confirmed the source of the leak.

632
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,490
It originated from your office.

633
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,730
Someone planted something in your office.

634
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,460
The whole company has been

635
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,940
looking for this for a long time.

636
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,180
Even Jin Chuan had to step down from
his administrative role because of this.

637
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,420
I never thought

638
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,020
it would come from

639
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,220
my own office.

640
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,860
We know how the info got out,

641
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,820
but not who's behind it yet.

642
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,540
We're still investigating.

643
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,500
So please, keep this under wraps for now.

644
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,300
Don't tell anyone else.

645
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,060
Secretary Song.

646
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,260
Mr. Lin.

647
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,620
Drop everything you're working on

648
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,820
and draft a report on the Azure One leak...

649
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,620
Mr. Lin, I...

650
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,420
I'll handle it myself.

651
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,900
Off you go.

652
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,060
Mr. Lin! Mr. Lin!

653
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,260
Slow down.

654
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,100
Be careful.

655
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,300
Mr. Lin, hold it there.

656
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,700
- Dad.
- Mr. Lin.

657
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,220
- Hurry.
- Make way!

658
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,740
Don't let anyone know about this.

659
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,580
Where's Lawyer Zheng?

660
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,900
Zheng Qi is on a business trip.

661
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,300
Dad?

662
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,140
Hurry up.

663
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,540
Dad.

(Surgery Status: Lin, Male, In Surgery)

666
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,940
What's going on here?

667
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,900
Mr. Lin is in surgery.

668
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,620
Shoulong Group is facing
internal and external crises.

669
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,100
Mr. Lin is under a lot of pressure.

670
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,820
We're partly to blame.

671
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,740
We haven't paid

672
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,460
enough attention to his health lately.

673
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,300
With Shoulong and people like you,

674
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,780
the pressure on him is even greater.

675
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,740
As his son, you didn't care about him.

676
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,900
How can outsiders like us help?

677
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,980
Watch your mouth.

678
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,260
Now you admit you're an outsider?

679
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,260
We're in the hospital.

680
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,100
Watch your tone.

681
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,300
(Operating Room)
Calm down, Young Mr. Lin.

682
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,700
Doctor, how is he?

683
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,540
The surgery was successful,

684
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,900
but he's still not stable.

685
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,300
He's not out of danger yet.

686
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,500
He'll need to stay in the ICU for now.

687
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,540
He needs complete rest during this time.

688
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,460
Don't disturb him.

689
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,620
Let's head back to the office.

(Lin's sick. It is an opportunity.)

693
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,020
Take care.

695
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,020
- Yes?
- You seen Huo Min?

696
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,980
I got back from a business trip.

697
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,580
Yasheng was supposed to pick me up,

698
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,060
but I can't reach him at all.

699
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,890
He never stands me up.

700
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,100
Something must be wrong.

701
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,030
So I came here.

702
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,740
Do you and Huo Min

703
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,940
know anything?

704
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,380
Huo Min hasn't contacted me.

705
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,300
Try asking someone at the company?

706
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,100
He always reached out to me first.

707
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,580
Now I can't reach him.

708
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,580
I'm really worried.

709
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,780
How about this?

710
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,580
If Huo Min gets in touch, I'll let you know.

711
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,380
Tang Tang.

712
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,550
Ma'am, are you looking for something tangy?

713
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,140
This one's my grandson's favorite.

714
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,600
How can you say it's always out of stock?

715
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,380
We got a fresh batch this morning.

716
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,070
Will two bags be okay?

717
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,940
Tang Tang, Yasheng's father is in hospital.

718
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,850
How's he doing now?

719
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,700
I'm not sure.

720
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,760
I'll go see him now.

721
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,420
You have a grandson?
You look too young for that.

722
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,620
Shouldn't I have one?

723
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,540
No, never mind.

724
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,780
Take care.

725
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,740
(Xizhao Provincial People's Hospital)

726
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,660
Hello, I'm at the hospital now.

727
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,780
Lin had a heart attack.

728
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,780
He's in ICU now.

729
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,380
- A heart attack?
- Yes.

730
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,300
Anything suspicious?

731
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,820
You think someone's behind this?

732
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,460
Gaa Tang Lung Cai was killed.

733
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,540
Lin's been tough during negotiations,

734
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,380
and then he had a heart attack.

735
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,660
That's no coincidence.

736
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,540
And think about it.

737
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,020
They bugged Lin Shoulong's office

738
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,180
and managed to dodge our tracking last night.

739
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,580
There must be a mastermind.

740
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,340
So these things must be connected.

741
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,260
Stay at the hospital.
I'll have someone look into it.

742
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,160
Got it.

743
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,620
You know what?

744
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,500
A few days ago, Dad said to me:

745
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,740
"Son,

746
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,900
you're doing a good job."

747
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,420
Do you think...

748
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,180
maybe he sensed something?

749
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,660
Nonsense.

750
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,540
It means your dad approves of you.

751
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,900
But you have issues with Shoulong.

752
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,020
You hate it.

753
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,260
You hate how it takes up all your dad's time.

754
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,660
But what could you do?

755
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,200
Right now, your dad can't
step away from Shoulong.

756
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,140
If the negotiations fail,

757
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,620
it'll always weigh on him.

758
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,940
Now he's sick.

759
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,500
He can't take it anymore.

760
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,460
He's exhausted.

761
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,780
Why can't he give it to someone else?

762
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,820
After everything that's happened,

763
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,100
who can he really trust?

764
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,260
The only person he trusts

765
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,620
is you.

766
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,020
If I were you,

767
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,460
I'd go negotiate myself.
