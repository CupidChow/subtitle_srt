00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,000
This morning

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
at the Palm Leaf Hotel in this city

3
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,880
a murder occurred

4
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,400
According to police information

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,319
the victim is

6
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,239
Jia Tenglongqi, president of the Ming Shu Heavy Industry Chamber of Commerce in Shapeng

7
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,439
came to Eagle Continent

8
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:21,480
to discuss cooperation with Lin Shoulong, president of China's Shoulong Group

9
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,640
The Ming Shu Heavy Industry Chamber of Commerce is a core member of the Ming Shu Group in Shapeng

10
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,280
It has now become the most influential smart energy enterprise representative in Asia

11
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,519
Its new energy production line

12
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,040
especially its compressor technology, has reached world-class standards

13
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,359
The Ming Shu Heavy Industry Chamber of Commerce has always been committed to global business expansion

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,680
especially cooperation with countries in the Asia-Pacific region

15
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,519
China's Shoulong Group started with weaving

16
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:01,359
gradually developing into an international enterprise focusing on refining, petrochemicals, polyester new materials

17
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,280
and the full industrial chain development of textiles

18
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,560
In recent years, it has rapidly transformed

19
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,960
deeply investing in the new energy industry

20
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,639
achieving remarkable results in a short time

21
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,719
An insider revealed

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,680
that the new energy project discussed by the two companies in Eagle Continent

23
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,680
could even affect the global landscape

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,159
And this murder case may be related to the new energy project

25
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,479
Currently, a suspect has been detained by the police

26
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,840
Help! Someone, help!

27
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,639
The suspect's name is Huo Min.

28
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,520
Chinese nationality, 29 years old.

29
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,840
He is a legal officer for a non-profit organization.

30
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,879
No criminal record.

31
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,120
Entered the country yesterday morning.

32
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,280
He came to Yingzhou for tourism and to visit relatives.

33
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,759
His girlfriend works here.

34
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,039
This is the test report. The evidence is conclusive.

35
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,879
Officer, when can I leave?

36
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,680
Say something, officer.

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,560
Chinese, speak Chinese.

38
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,680
Quiet.

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
Chinese.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,039
Huo Min

41
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,759
Chinese

42
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,319
What are you doing in Eagle Continent?

43
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm here to find my girlfriend.

44
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,879
I haven't done anything wrong.

45
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,840
Do you know this person?

46
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,840
No, I don't.

47
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,279
Then why were you at the crime scene?

48
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,600
I was looking for a restroom at that time.

49
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,839
Liar.

50
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,519
Why did you kill Jia Tenglongqi?

51
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,360
Murder

52
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,560
You got it wrong, officer

53
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,079
I didn't kill anyone, I didn't kill anyone, officer

54
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:45,560
I didn't kill anyone

55
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,120
Quiet

56
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,079
I didn't kill anyone

57
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,279
Be honest

58
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,720
Still trying to argue, huh?

59
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,560
Jia Tenglongqi fell right in front of you

60
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,439
You killed him

61
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,399
President

62
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,040
Help, someone help!

63
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,959
You

64
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,800
You killed Jia Tenglongqi

65
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,000
I know the laws of your country.

66
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,120
You are now a law enforcement officer.

67
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,600
You have no evidence, you are trying to entrap me, do you know that?

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,040
You are trying to entrap me, do you know that? You are trying to entrap me.

69
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,240
Are you talking to me about the law?

70
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,199
I am telling you.

71
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,560
On the towel you handed to Jia Tenglongqi.

72
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,240
We found toxic substances.

73
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,879
And your DNA.

74
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,279
You said I have no evidence.

75
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,360
I ask you.

76
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,120
How long have I been here?

77
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,959
I know.

78
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,480
What I am saying.

79
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,839
Cannot be used as evidence.

80
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,680
But I still want to say.

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,680
Because I am going to sue you.

82
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,720
I am going to sue you for entrapment.

83
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,639
Listen to me carefully.

84
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,480
I was looking for the restroom at that time.

85
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
I was stopped by someone.

86
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,839
He stopped me.

87
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,360
I had no choice.

88
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,800
Excuse me, sir.

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,879
It's not convenient here right now.

90
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,439
What is going on here?

91
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,560
President

92
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,920
President

93
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,399
You

94
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,160
Help! Someone, help!

95
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,040
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

96
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,079
Stop! Don't move!

97
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,680
For the next 24 hours

98
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,319
you cannot leave the hotel.

99
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,000
I will have someone follow you.

100
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,759
Who are you really?

101
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,200
Welcome to Jinzhou Voice.

102
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The State Council Information Office released

103
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,440
the white paper "China's Energy Development in the New Era."

104
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,240
The white paper systematically introduces the historic achievements

105
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,720
of China's energy revolution since the 18th National Congress.

106
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,320
It comprehensively explains the major policies and measures

107
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,879
of China's energy security development strategy in the new era and new stage.

108
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,679
It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding to domestic and international communities

109
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,120
of China's energy policies and development status.

110
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,960
However, since the trade war friction,

111
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,200
Western countries have been blocking and restricting

112
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,320
China in the field of new energy technology,

113
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,519
sanctioning our new energy enterprises,

114
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,279
while hyping and attacking our energy and environmental issues.

115
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,120
Wang Esq.

116
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,639
It's you again.

117
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,759
Come out.

118
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:03,840
Come

119
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,039
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

120
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:19,679
I'm really sorry

121
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,600
What are you doing?

122
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,759
Can you keep an eye on it?

123
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,639
I'm really sorry, sorry.

124
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,799
Goodbye.

125
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,480
Is it this one?

126
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,759
You can scan either code.

127
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,519
Show me after you scan it, boss, boss.

128
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,519
The usual, huh?

129
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,279
Sure, sure, one pound of peach crisps.

130
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,320
Half a pound with milk, half a pound without milk.

131
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,200
Business is pretty good today.

132
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,279
It's okay, it's okay.

133
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,080
It's all thanks to your support.

134
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,480
Sent to Lao Wan

135
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,240
Hurry up

136
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,320
Okay

137
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,679
What are you doing? What are you doing?

138
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,080
I ruined my pants

139
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Do you know him?

140
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,320
This kid is here every day

141
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,679
Always playing pranks

142
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,320
So young and already up to no good, right?

143
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,679
Stand still

144
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,720
Listen to me

145
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,320
Come find me tomorrow to get your pants

146
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,120
Fix my pants for me

147
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,120
Did you hear me?

148
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,039
You don't have to fix these pants

149
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,919
Handsome, let it go, he's just a kid

150
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,559
If you catch me, I'll fix your pants

151
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:12,120
Kids just love to be mischievous.

152
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,279
Uncle, have you eaten?

153
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,039
You are here.

154
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,039
Lawyer Huo, you are here.

155
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,919
Kill.

156
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,759
Brother Dong

157
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,919
Look

158
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,600
This fan is higher than the hand

159
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,960
Eyes on the elbow

160
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,120
It's starting, Uncle

161
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,320
Huang Xi, hurry up

162
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,799
Everyone, come quickly

163
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,080
This is for the square dance competition.

164
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,120
In a while, you can gather at the central square.

165
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,240
Grandson

166
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,840
Last time I went on a blind date

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,279
I was scammed out of money

168
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,120
Did you help me look into it?

169
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,759
I already reported it to the police for you.

170
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,639
Next time you want to go on a blind date, tell me.

171
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,960
Don't use those weird mobile apps, okay?

172
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,480
Losing money this time is a small matter.

173
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,600
Oh, it's a small matter.

174
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,720
What is a big matter then?

175
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,480
What do you think is a big matter?

176
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,600
Getting kidnapped is a big matter.

177
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,080
Exactly, exactly.

178
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,919
Just a little bit more.

179
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,120
And you would have been fooled.

180
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,120
Come on, everyone hurry up.

181
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,000
Time's up, almost forgot.

182
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,320
The results are out.

183
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,000
Lao Wan, did you win?

184
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,840
Maybe this time we'll win.

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,159
Win five bucks.

186
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,120
Don't be sarcastic.

187
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,840
Look, it's past again.

188
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,080
This broken clock.

189
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,600
It's never been reliable.

190
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,000
Old Wan.

191
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,960
My son is back.

192
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,840
This one is yours.

193
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,559
Oh.

194
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,440
I'll take this one.

195
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:55,960
Alright.

196
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,000
We'll split it in half when we meet.

197
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,399
Once I figure out this lottery ticket,

198
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,960
if it really wins big,

199
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,480
we'll split it fifty-fifty.

200
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,519
Money.

201
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,519
Yeah.

202
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,879
Split it with me.

203
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah.

204
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,159
Why are you so good to me?

205
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,000
Why, why, why?

206
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,200
Why so many whys?

207
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,519
I have no children in my life

208
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:16,799
Now that I'm old

209
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,639
I just want a son to take care of me in my old age

210
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,240
Even a godson would be fine

211
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,960
I think you would be great

212
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,519
If it were someone else, I wouldn't want it

213
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,600
I really admire you

214
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,440
You're already so old

215
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,519
And still so narcissistic

216
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Call me dad

217
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,559
You haven't won yet

218
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,720
Taking advantage of you here

219
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,919
People are divided into groups

220
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,039
Things gather by type

221
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,200
We are the same kind of people

222
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,679
The same kind, right

223
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,639
What kind

224
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,200
The same kind can be used

225
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,080
The same kind can be utilized

226
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,440
The same kind can be reused

227
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,879
Just say what kind we are

228
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,559
Can be trusted

229
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,000
Can be trusted

230
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
Yes

231
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,080
Just like trusting you

232
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,919
Then there will be money to use

233
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,000
Right?

234
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:00,879
You brat

235
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,759
I wish you

236
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:02,759
I wish you win the big prize soon

237
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,600
I'm waiting

238
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,440
Thanks for that

239
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,759
Pinky promise

240
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,440
Eat less

241
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,960
I'm going to prepare for the square dance competition, okay

242
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,200
Today we are going to talk with everyone

243
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,759
About things closely related to life

244
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:16,960
New energy

245
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,879
Hey handsome, what is this new energy?

246
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,679
Is it useful or not?

247
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,960
Our family now commutes

248
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,960
In a new energy electric car

249
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,399
Tian Niu, approach the target.

250
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,840
Tian Niu, received.

251
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,360
Driver, please go faster.

252
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,360
We're in a hurry.

253
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,840
There's a huge traffic jam ahead.

254
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,000
If you want to be quick,

255
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,600
you can switch to the subway ahead.

256
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,559
Stop the car.

257
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,440
Are you crazy?

258
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,840
Are you in such a rush to reincarnate?

259
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,840
Butterfly, Butterfly

260
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,759
The target is on the bridge

261
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:10,799
The target is on the bridge

262
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,159
Ant, follow

263
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,679
Butterfly, butterfly, my position is invalid

264
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,519
Butterfly, butterfly

265
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,200
The target is heading towards Jiuhua Market.

266
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,240
People are gathering.

267
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,000
Keep following closely.

268
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:51,840
Butterfly, butterfly

269
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,919
The ant followed

270
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,160
Butterfly, butterfly

271
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,240
My position is invalid

272
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,119
Target

273
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,960
The target is gone

274
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,039
Quick, request support

275
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,880
Don't worry

276
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,920
Xiaolong, Dani

277
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,759
Pull up all the surveillance in this area

278
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,799
Yes

279
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,440
Boss

280
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,000
The target is in Zone C

281
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,880
Mantis, Brother Spider, you go in together

282
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,839
Brother Spider received

283
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,680
Attention all teams

284
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,720
It has been confirmed

285
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,799
Rod has stolen the top-secret information of "Blue One"

286
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,559
It is a sample of a metal catalyst

287
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,440
It is very important

288
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,519
Make sure to intercept the sample

289
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,839
The target may be armed

290
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,200
Stay safe

291
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,720
Sorry

292
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,359
You thug

293
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,160
I'm sorry, excuse me

294
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,240
Shameless

295
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,920
Longhorn beetle

296
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,079
Floral shirt, gray pants, white shoes, behind you

297
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,359
Move aside, move aside

298
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,039
Move aside, move aside

299
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,440
Move aside, stop

300
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,200
Move aside, stop, get out of the way

301
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,720
Stop

302
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,559
It's falling, it's falling

303
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,079
Make way

304
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,920
The square dance competition is about to start.

305
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,240
Our charity's image ambassador.

306
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,440
Teacher Dong Yao has already arrived.

307
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,559
Later, those things

308
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,480
like rice, flour, and water need to be prepared properly, okay?

309
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,759
Don't give too much when you give, okay?

310
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,759
Especially since eggs are quite expensive, did you hear?

311
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,039
Teacher Han Yao is here.

312
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,880
Hello everyone, hello.

313
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,240
Teacher Han Yao is so handsome.

314
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,799
Hello, Teacher Han Yao.

315
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,799
So enthusiastic, so enthusiastic.

316
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,119
Huo Min.

317
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,319
Huo Min.

318
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,559
Huo Min.

319
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,799
Hey.

320
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,640
Shall we rehearse first?

321
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,640
After rehearsing, we will finish the competition.

322
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,480
Our teacher Han's autograph and group photo.

323
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,720
It must be arranged.

324
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,440
Okay?

325
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,119
Okay.

326
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,920
I promised you.

327
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,960
Huo Min.

328
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,039
Coming.

329
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,519
Brother Dong

330
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,039
How much longer until it ends?

331
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,200
Let me check.

332
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,720
There are two, three, four groups here.

333
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,160
And there are four or five groups on the way.

334
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,400
About seven or eight groups in total.

335
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,039
It should end around two in the afternoon.

336
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,519
What are you up to?

337
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,960
Two o'clock.

338
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,400
And

339
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,759
Why are they all old men and women?

340
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,039
That's how it is, Brother Dong.

341
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,759
Many of them came because of your reputation.

342
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,279
Mainly because you're giving out that award.

343
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,000
No, no, what I mean is

344
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,400
They definitely came for you personally.

345
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,480
For photos, right?

346
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,359
And autographs.

347
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,119
That's right.

348
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,599
Ten o'clock

349
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,839
Leave on time

350
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,519
Brother Yao, ten o'clock is a bit too much

351
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,799
How about we make it twelve o'clock

352
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,759
Give me two more hours

353
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,839
Just two hours, okay

354
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Because we need to eat in between

355
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,880
Plus travel time, it might be a bit rushed

356
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,160
The main thing is

357
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,920
The main thing is they are all your mom fans

358
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,599
Do you know

359
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,799
They have been rehearsing for a long time

360
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,759
If you leave

361
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,079
I really don't know who to give the award to

362
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,480
I don't care if they are dad fans

363
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,519
Or mom fans

364
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,319
I must leave at eleven o'clock

365
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,599
If no one is giving the award, you can do it

366
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,240
Don't you just like being everyone's favorite

367
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,799
Brother Yao, don't you think you're teasing me a bit

368
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,799
There is this situation

369
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,400
I have reported this event to the boss

370
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,240
You know?

371
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,759
So if anything happens

372
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,200
It will be hard for me to explain

373
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,079
That's how it is

374
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,960
I'll take a call

375
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,920
Wei, I'm going to the bathroom first.

376
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,519
Get lost.

377
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,240
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

378
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,000
Get me some paper, okay?

379
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,519
Is this enough?

380
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,839
Who are you?

381
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,759
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

382
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,440
Xiaolong

383
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:22,440
Do you have any?

384
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,759
No, boss.

385
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,640
Dani

386
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,079
No.

387
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,559
Attention all teams

388
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,279
Quickly proceed to the central square to continue tracking

389
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,559
Immediately access the surveillance near the central square

390
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,440
Yes

391
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,839
I'm going

392
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,599
My car

393
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,759
My car

394
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,119
Huo Min

395
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,839
Auntie is fine

396
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Keep dancing, keep dancing

397
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,759
The target switched to a motorcycle.

398
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,440
Snail, go for support.

399
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,960
Got it.

400
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,240
Let's go.

401
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,240
Seatbelt.

402
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:44,559
Drive slowly.

403
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,759
Brother Chen, stop him.

404
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,839
No, our mission is to retrieve the sample.

405
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,880
If the sample is damaged, the mission will fail.

406
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,720
What should we do then?

407
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:21,680
Hold on for now.

408
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,160
Snail

409
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,880
The target is heading to the Cross River Bridge

410
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,400
The target is heading to the Cross River Bridge

411
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,519
Understood, holding on

412
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,680
Notify all brother units to assist in interception

413
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:45,079
Enlarge the image of the car behind.

414
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,240
Yes.

415
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,839
Snail, stop him.

416
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,599
Got it.

417
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,880
Hold on tight.

418
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,000
Command Center

419
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,119
We have already intercepted the target at the bridge across the river.

420
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,119
Requesting support

421
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,799
Got it!

422
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,480
Don't jump, don't jump

423
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,319
I'm calling for support

424
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,599
Watch the bag

425
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:07,359
Boss

426
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,880
The target just jumped into the river and escaped.

427
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,160
Tian Niu also jumped in after him.

428
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,119
Did you intercept the sample?

429
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,240
It's here.

430
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,119
Let's take it back and have the experts examine it first.

431
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,000
Okay

432
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:27,759
Keep looking

433
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,160
for that beetle

434
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:32,920
and the gun

435
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,440
Where is Rod's bag?

436
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,200
Over there.

437
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,240
Nothing else.

438
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,599
Snail, check it out.

439
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,960
The owner of the motorcycle the target escaped on.

440
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,160
Okay.

441
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Director Zhao

442
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,759
Thank you very much for your help

443
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,079
If you hadn't intercepted the sample

444
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,039
Our "Blue One" would have been truly ruined

445
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,799
This is just the beginning

446
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,640
I have plans for the upcoming matters

447
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,039
Okay

448
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,920
It's all my fault. I shouldn't have given him the chance to jump.

449
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,920
No, I'll continue searching in a bit.

450
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,160
We've searched both upstream and downstream, but found nothing.

451
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,319
The enemy must have designed a thorough support plan along the river.

452
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,279
Maybe there's another consideration from above.

453
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,640
He definitely can't escape to the west.

454
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,119
Director Zhao

455
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,960
Everyone is here, right?

456
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,039
Come on, Luo Shanshan.

457
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,200
Let's review today's operation.

458
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,559
It has been confirmed that what was intercepted from Rod is

459
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,480
a sample of Shoulong Group's "Blue No. 1".

460
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,720
However,

461
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,279
Rod still managed to escape.

462
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,160
The enemy had support and a plan.

463
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,960
Your quick response successfully retrieved the sample.

464
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,799
That's commendable.

465
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,599
But it still didn't meet my expectations.

466
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,920
We need to thoroughly review.

467
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,079
Of course,

468
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,039
this guy is cunning.

469
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,759
But that being said,

470
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:07,640
where is your contingency plan?

471
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,400
What about the four sentences I taught you?

472
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,880
Observe quietly

473
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,319
Focus and think deeply

474
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,440
Master it thoroughly

475
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,920
One

476
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,720
Complete it in one go

477
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,839
Isn't this all common knowledge?

478
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,039
Continue

479
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,400
This is the owner of the motorcycle that Rod rode.

480
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,400
I think his behavior is somewhat suspicious.

481
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,759
Perhaps

482
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,599
we can find some clues from him.

483
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:38,920
Do you know

484
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,680
how many eyes

485
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,839
are watching Shoulong

486
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,200
and "Azure One"?

487
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,920
Let me emphasize again,

488
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,359
"Azure One"

489
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:52,279
is a major classified research project in our country.

490
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,880
To put it bluntly,

491
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,599
whether our people can breathe fresh air

492
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,559
and get rid of the dependence on oil

493
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,640
oil.

494
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,400
So you mean

495
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,039
if this technology succeeds,

496
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,039
in the future, for people like us who love driving,

497
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,279
it won't matter how we drive.

498
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,640
Let me put it this way,

499
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:14,559
if this technology is applied to cars,

500
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,400
it will be cheaper than both gasoline and electric cars.

501
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,440
You could say this technology

502
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,599
will soon put us far ahead in the world.

503
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,880
So the metal catalyst that Rod stole,

504
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,039
what is it used for?

505
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:30,279
It is the most critical part of this technology.

506
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,119
That's good

507
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,200
that we got it back.

508
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,680
However,

509
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,720
such an important item,

510
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,480
they failed to steal it this time,

511
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,440
they will definitely try to get it from somewhere else.

512
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,960
Everyone

513
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,200
To curb Shoulong Group's new energy technology development

514
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:54,240
some countries are using trade wars

515
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,000
to impose a technology blockade on us

516
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:58,880
In this situation

517
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,799
Shoulong can only take a detour

518
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,640
and cooperate with Shapeng Country on technology

519
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,759
We are about to

520
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,720
start the first round of negotiations in Yingzhou

521
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,000
Please watch

522
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,960
These are the core members of Shoulong participating in this negotiation.

523
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,960
An anti-China organization supported by the Black Eye Alliance.

524
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,519
Called SAD.

525
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,079
They have already targeted the Shoulong Group.

526
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,800
If this espionage attempt fails,

527
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,920
they will definitely make a move at the negotiation table.

528
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:28,360
I ask you to be prepared.

529
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,239
Disguise yourselves as bodyguards.

530
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,239
Protect the Shoulong Group.

531
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,519
Crush their conspiracy.

532
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,480
Everyone,

533
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,519
protect your identity information.

534
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,440
Act according to the situation.

535
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,639
Prepare contingency plans.

536
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,079
Yes.

537
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,840
Are you there?

538
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,000
Are you online?

539
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,119
Are you there or not?

540
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
What do you think?

541
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
You're still at the office.

542
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
How do you know?

543
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,440
I heard it.

544
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,519
I just heard your chair hit the box.

545
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,840
What? Non-profit organizations are starting to pay overtime now?

546
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,000
Do you think it's easy for me?

547
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,920
I finished work, but I'm still at the office for a while.

548
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Just to save some electricity at home, you know.

549
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,800
How's it going? What's the situation over there?

550
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,960
Everything is fine.

551
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
But,

552
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,719
I guess it's going to get busy soon.

553
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
Me too.

554
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Wait a moment.

555
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,079
Hey, boss.

556
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,760
About my motorcycle today,

557
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,039
Does it count as dying in the line of duty? Does it count as a work injury?

558
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,079
What do you think?

559
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,599
Who told you to get a crappy little motorcycle?

560
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,360
You can't even handle such a small task. The signal is bad, boss.

561
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,960
Can you be more reliable? The signal is bad. I'm hanging up.

562
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,280
A new dungeon is about to open.

563
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,880
There will be a lot of good loot.

564
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,199
It's said that the boss is very tough.

565
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,000
Be careful.

566
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,800
Don't worry.

567
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,519
Dear fans,

568
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,559
Dear family,

569
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,239
Just now, the Shoulong Group led all their employees

570
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,280
to conduct a quality development training here.

571
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,519
After they left,

572
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,639
they left so much trash behind.

573
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,280
Such a big bag can't even hold it all.

574
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,519
And the most ironic thing is,

575
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,239
look here,

576
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,599
"Using new energy to create green mountains and clear waters"

577
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,519
this banner

578
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,320
is hanging right above all this trash.

579
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,400
To be honest,

580
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,320
I am really very angry right now.

581
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,440
That's all for today's show.

582
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,360
I am Han Yao.

583
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,559
Boss, um,

584
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,400
I'm sorry I'm late.

585
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:49,039
I ran all the way here.

586
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,239
I hope I didn't miss anything important.

587
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
You missed something big.

588
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,320
I'll go get to work.

589
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,360
Wait,

590
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,519
go back to fixing the car.

591
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,480
It's fine, it's not important, boss.

592
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:00,320
You rest, I'll go work.

593
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:02,960
Brother Yao,

594
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,960
Sis, how did I do?

595
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,519
Pretty good.

596
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,559
But the level of smearing isn't enough.

597
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,519
Dump those two bags of trash on the ground for me.

598
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,400
Then take a few more shots.

599
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,039
Edit in the shots full of trash.

600
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:18,920
Got it, boss.

601
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,360
Give it to me.

602
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,639
What's wrong, Sis?

603
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,039
I'm feeling down.

604
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,360
You know about what happened yesterday, right?

605
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,719
Ah.

606
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,559
Originally, they had already obtained

607
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:35,199
the top-secret information of Shoulong Group's "Azure No.1"

608
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,519
but there were some unexpected issues

609
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,599
What kind of issues?

610
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,320
Now, Shoulong Group

611
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,519
is sending people to Yingzhou to negotiate with the Shapeng people

612
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
If this negotiation succeeds

613
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,239
their new energy technology will be put into production immediately

614
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,480
If things continue to develop this way

615
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,239
we will definitely be at a disadvantage

616
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,360
Because yesterday's operation failed

617
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,239
headquarters has clearly instructed the Yingzhou branch to take over this matter

618
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,519
We won't be given any tasks

619
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,480
We don't know anything

620
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,239
It will be even harder to handle in the future

621
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,360
Sis, do you mean to say

622
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,559
that I should go and interfere a bit

623
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,079
Yes

624
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,480
Although this time it's abroad

625
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,280
It's not something we can intervene in

626
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,239
But I don't want to casually

627
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,320
hand over the opportunity to Matt

628
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,280
The face we lost before

629
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,480
This time, find an opportunity to regain it in front of the headquarters

630
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,280
Boss

631
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,400
I'll go.

632
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,239
Get lost.

633
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,519
Brother Yao, listen to me.

634
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,639
It's like this.

635
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,360
You really didn't see the situation at yesterday's event.

636
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,239
Those fans...

637
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,400
I couldn't stop them.

638
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,280
There were too many.

639
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,320
Brother Yao, your influence is too big, right?

640
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,239
But I'm different.

641
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,039
No one knows me, right?

642
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:41,639
Secondly,

643
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,280
I said it's possible.

644
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,519
Brother Yao is already on the

645
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:46,199
Shoulong Group's blacklist now.

646
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,480
Have you been to Yingzhou?

647
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,119
You think it's a charity event center.

648
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,239
Those old men and women

649
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,599
You bring some peanuts

650
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,280
and you can gather information.

651
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,519
Get lost.

652
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:56,480
Brother Yao, this...

653
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,239
You're looking down on people.

654
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:59,480
Boss,

655
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,280
My girlfriend is in Yingzhou.

656
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,400
And think about it,

657
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,519
I studied law, right?

658
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,360
I told you to get lost.

659
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:06,960
Can you do it?

660
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
I must do it.

661
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,760
He really can't do it.

662
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,599
Sis,

663
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,599
Listen to me.

664
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,400
Look at me first, look at me.

665
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,440
Move aside, move aside

666
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,239
Like this

667
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,400
Do I look like a tourist like this?

668
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,880
Then I'll just take a photo as a tourist, right?

669
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
I'll send the photo back

670
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:25,079
Then headquarters won't say we acted on our own

671
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,760
Right?

672
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,320
Alright, I'll think about it

673
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,480
Got it, Sis

674
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,400
Take care

675
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,920
You always fight for every opportunity.

676
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,920
Let me tell you,

677
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,639
After you get there,

678
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,840
it won't be as simple as collecting garbage.

679
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,559
Bootlicker.

680
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,960
Brother Dong Yao.

681
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,920
Take care.

682
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Dear fans,

683
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,320
Dear family,

684
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,519
Today, I'm in the public forest on the outskirts of our city. Please take a look.

685
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,440
Director Wei.

686
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Director.

687
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Did you see that?

688
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,480
Our opponents are starting to make moves.

689
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,320
These kinds of videos appear almost every month.

690
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:16,480
The public relations department of Shoulong Group can handle it themselves.

691
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,440
This Xinchuang Charity Association is just

692
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:23,400
the representative in China supported by SAD.

693
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,320
They are making big moves in Eagle Continent.

694
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,000
There will definitely be more significant actions.

695
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,079
In view of this case,

696
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,599
we have established the 901 task force.

697
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,239
We have drafted three contingency plans.

698
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,519
Please review them later.

699
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,559
This case is of great importance.

700
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,480
We must ensure everything is flawless.

701
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,280
How is the mole you planted inside their organization?

702
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,280
It has been in place for over two years.

703
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,239
Code name

704
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,480
is Actor.

705
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,199
The early warning intelligence is outstanding.

706
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:01,559
Obtaining the enemy's internal list is all thanks to him.

707
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,159
Completing this mission

708
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,920
he is crucial.

709
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,840
He deserves recognition.

710
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:09,679
Continue to utilize the insider's role.

711
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,000
You handle the confidentiality scope.

712
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:18,679
The tea is good.

713
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,079
How many brews do you drink a day?

714
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,880
Three brews.

715
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,679
Boss

716
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:34,800
Do we really need to make it this grand?

717
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:38,559
Grand?

718
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,840
This is way too grand, isn't it?

719
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,880
You've been with me for so long

720
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,599
Do you know what kind of organization we are?

721
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,719
Absolutely, Boss

722
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,599
We are an

723
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,239
environmental organization focused on public welfare

724
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,760
Every plant and tree in nature

725
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,480
is cared for by us

726
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,960
Although I am just a prospective lawyer

727
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,599
I have the responsibility and duty to become

728
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:59,280
a true "green" advocate for nature

729
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,840
Well said

730
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,320
Every single plant and tree

731
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,960
every inch is important to us

732
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,599
Should we use it sparingly?

733
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,639
Yes.

734
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,599
Use it sparingly.

735
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,159
Boss

736
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,679
The person you asked me to meet before

737
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:30,800
What is their background

738
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,599
Everything I am about to tell you

739
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:43,599
must not be revealed, otherwise

740
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:45,599
Do you see

741
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:47,519
it's all for you

742
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,360
Understood
