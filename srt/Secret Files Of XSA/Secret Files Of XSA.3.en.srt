1
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,319
Jia Tenglongqi collapsed right in front of you.

2
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,120
It was you.

3
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,639
You killed Jia Tenglongqi.

4
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,759
I know the laws of your country.

5
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,000
You are now a law enforcement officer.

6
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,039
You have no evidence.

7
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,520
You are trying to entrap me, do you know that?

8
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,919
You are trying to entrap me, do you know that? You are trying to entrap me.

9
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,599
Are you talking to me about the law?

10
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,120
Let me tell you.

11
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,400
On the towel you handed to Jia Tenglongqi.

12
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,039
We found toxic substances.

13
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,919
And your DNA.

14
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,080
You said I have no evidence.

15
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,759
You are very smart

16
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,319
You know how to guide and divert attention

17
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,280
Just sorry

18
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,639
We also tested the water on Jia Tenglongqi

19
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,080
The substance in the water

20
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,159
Mixed with the substance on the towel

21
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,360
It's poison

22
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,879
Hearing you say that

23
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,759
I didn't know I was so smart

24
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,479
I could come up with such a way to poison

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I could even know when he needs to pee urgently

26
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,280
Why couldn't I escape at that time

27
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,879
I couldn't get away myself

28
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,879
You think you didn't?

29
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,840
Maybe you could have escaped in the chaos

30
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,560
You just didn't know

31
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,560
Our police were also at the hotel

32
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,479
You also know it's maybe

33
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,080
You are just speculating

34
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,520
I touched the towel

35
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,280
That waiter also touched the towel

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,159
The bodyguard also touched the towel

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,039
You go ask them

38
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,039
You reminded me.

39
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,120
I almost missed the most important suspect.

40
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
That is you, who happened to be at the hotel.

41
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,800
Sure

42
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,879
A cornered dog will jump over the wall and start framing the police

43
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,879
You want to frame me

44
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Are you crazy

45
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,000
Sir, time's up

46
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,839
Huo Min

47
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,560
I warn you

48
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,279
Before we meet next time

49
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,920
we will place you under surveillance

50
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,879
you are not allowed to leave Eagle State

51
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,519
not allowed to leave the country

52
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,360
our police will monitor you 24 hours a day

53
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,199
next time

54
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,160
next time it will be me

55
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,560
bringing embassy personnel to find you

56
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,040
We will contact the embassy for you.

57
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,720
When will you let me go?

58
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,360
I want to go to the bathroom.

59
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,759
I don't want to pee in the wrong place again.

60
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,439
Roshan, we have reached an agreement with Yingzhou.

61
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,920
We are invited to participate in international intelligence cooperation.

62
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,920
There is a mole in the Yingzhou police department.

63
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,759
Now they have given us certain authorization.

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,160
You need to handle it flexibly and cooperate to find out the truth.

65
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,720
The embassy replied.

66
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,720
Huo Min is being detained at

67
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
the guesthouse where he is staying under surveillance.

68
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,439
That guesthouse is located

69
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,079
next to the Jinsha Hotel where we stayed before.

70
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,000
What does the boss want us to do?

71
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,680
There are enemies in the Yingzhou police, which is unfavorable for "Blue One".

72
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,240
The superiors instructed us to follow up.

73
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,000
Should we contact Huo Min?

74
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,000
The boss said to protect Lin Shoulong.

75
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,720
To understand the reason for Jia Tenglong's murder.

76
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,040
We must find Huo Min to understand the situation.

77
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,519
What is this guy doing in Yingzhou?

78
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,759
He came to visit his girlfriend.

79
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,839
His girlfriend's name is Meng Li.

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,279
She works here as a foley artist.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,120
According to the data,

82
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,160
she started dating Huo Min in college.

83
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,199
This guy started dating quite early.

84
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,480
Be cautious and keep your identity confidential.

85
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,079
It's over.

86
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,240
As soon as I heard you say that, boss, I knew

87
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,600
we won't be able to return home anytime soon.

88
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,759
But it's also good.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,959
If we don't get to the bottom of this,

90
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,439
I won't be able to enjoy any delicacies back home.

91
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,720
Meng Li

92
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,319
Senior Brother

93
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
What a coincidence

94
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,040
I saw your car outside

95
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,560
You're spending your birthday alone in a foreign place

96
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,800
Feeling a bit lonely, right?

97
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,519
Thank you, Brother Bai

98
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:20,920
Aren't you going to invite me?

99
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,639
I'm about to return to the country

100
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,439
Return to the country

101
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,959
Shoulong Group sent me a job offer

102
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,680
Congratulations, Lawyer Zheng

103
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,079
In that case, in future work

104
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,040
You might inevitably have some friction with Huo Min

105
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,480
You know, his Xin Chuan Charity Association

106
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,199
Has always been at odds with Shoulong Group

107
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,920
But you know me

108
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,199
I only focus on the matter, not the person

109
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,480
Huo Min always sticks to principles

110
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,720
Isn't that the basic quality of law students?

111
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,879
Let's not talk about this

112
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,120
Today is your birthday

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,120
Let's celebrate properly

114
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,160
Brother Bai

115
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,000
I guess Huo Min should be coming to pick me up soon

116
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,040
Huo Min

117
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,879
He came to Yingzhou

118
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,160
Why isn't he here to celebrate your birthday with you?

119
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,839
Don't you know him yet?

120
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,120
Work always comes first

121
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,079
I

122
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
You don't look like a couple

123
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,519
Thank you for your kindness, Brother Bai

124
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,079
I have something to do, I'll leave first

125
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,200
How's the investigation going?

126
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,879
Preliminary judgment

127
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,960
Time of death was four hours ago

128
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,200
Based on the marks on the body

129
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,399
Cause of death is mechanical asphyxiation

130
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,360
There are signs of struggle at the scene

131
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,000
Four hours ago

132
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,120
Let's go

133
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,519
Latest news from our station

134
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,600
This morning

135
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,039
A murder occurred at the Palm Leaf Hotel in our city

136
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,240
There has been a new development

137
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,559
Police, based on evidence left at the scene

138
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,480
Arrested a Chinese national with the surname Huo

139
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,759
The man is 29 years old

140
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,200
He is a legal counsel for a Chinese non-profit organization

141
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,240
No

142
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,639
Give it to me

143
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,840
Computer

144
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,480
Can anyone speak English?

145
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,039
Is it okay?

146
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,679
I'm begging you.

147
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,399
I'm begging you

148
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,120
Excuse me, sir.

149
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,159
It's inconvenient here right now

150
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:27,960
to use the restroom

151
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,000
Sorry for the inconvenience

152
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,600
Officer Bankun

153
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,279
You finally arrived

154
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,919
I have an important situation to report to you

155
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,840
I was there at the time

156
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,120
I just went to the female cleaner's house

157
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,279
Unfortunately

158
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,240
When I found her, she was already dead

159
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,120
So she's dead

160
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,919
Does that mean I'm off the hook, officer?

161
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,960
I have an alibi, officer

162
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,000
Murder to silence

163
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,360
You aren't afraid of us investigating at all

164
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,879
Has anyone contacted him?

165
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,360
It seems it was all planned

166
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,559
Speak

167
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,679
Who are your accomplices?

168
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,919
Where are they?

169
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,440
I told you

170
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,639
I have no accomplices

171
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,720
I don't know what you're talking about, officer

172
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,759
I investigated you

173
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,000
You are a member of a Chinese public welfare organization

174
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,919
Because of the pollution issue

175
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,759
You've always been at odds with Shoulong Group

176
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,480
In your camera

177
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,399
There are photos of you secretly taking pictures of Lin Shoulong and Jia Tenglongqi

178
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,840
How do you explain this?

179
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
How do you explain this?

180
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,639
How do you explain this?

181
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,200
Officer

182
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,440
Let go of me

183
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:02,960
I told you everything

184
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,879
Speak.

185
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,720
I admit it.

186
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,159
This time, I came

187
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,559
I did come for the Shoulong Group.

188
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,919
I just wanted to get some dirt, really.

189
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,279
To make some money.

190
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,639
That Jiateng Longqi you mentioned,

191
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,919
I don't even know him, officer.

192
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,000
That cleaner you mentioned,

193
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,320
could he be a scapegoat?

194
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,039
Because I think

195
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,720
that bodyguard is the most suspicious.

196
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,480
I saw him with the drug in his hand.

197
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,080
After he touched the towel,

198
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,200
he touched my hand.

199
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,519
He put the drug on the towel.

200
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,519
Really.

201
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,559
What makes you say that?

202
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,279
I wanted to tell you as soon as you came in.

203
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,799
He touched my arm, right here.

204
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,360
Look.

205
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,679
And there's still some of the drug on my clothes.

206
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,759
Take it for testing now.

207
00:12:58,759 --> 00:12:59,399
Take it for testing.

208
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,559
Sure

209
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,519
We have physical evidence

210
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,039
The motive is clear

211
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,639
The evidence is complete

212
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,679
You are the murderer

213
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,279
Take him away

214
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,039
Officer

215
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,399
Don't move

216
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,360
Get up

217
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,879
Immediately

218
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,240
First floor gate

219
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,399
Hurry, chase them!

220
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,519
The leader is Huo Min

221
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,879
Get him in the car

222
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,879
Who are you?

223
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,919
Why are the police chasing you?

224
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:37,720
Why are the police chasing me?

225
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,399
I also want to know why the police are chasing me.

226
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,879
Open the door.

227
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,039
Let him ask the police himself.

228
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,120
No, no, no.

229
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,919
We will ensure your safety.

230
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,360
I don't even know who you are.

231
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,080
How can you ensure my safety?

232
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,039
Can you introduce yourself?

233
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,159
Is it that difficult?

234
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:03,960
Okay

235
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,960
Can I stop asking?

236
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,279
I'll go to the police station myself

237
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,840
I want to die knowing the truth

238
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,519
Go down

239
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,919
Tell us the truth

240
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,799
and we will take you to the embassy

241
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,000
to apply for overseas protection

242
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,679
Speak up

243
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Who are you really

244
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,480
Hurry up and come over

245
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,559
Get in that car and go

246
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,679
Lin Shoulong's people

247
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,159
It seems you really are

248
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,879
security sent by the Shoulong Group

249
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,840
You know about Jia Tenglong's death

250
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,039
Come over and investigate

251
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,279
I understand

252
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,840
You are here for retaliation

253
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,000
Then you really are just a

254
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,440
unlucky person here for a free trip

255
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,360
Attention everyone, attention everyone

256
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,000
The suspect's vehicle is passing through

257
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,279
Heading east on Jalan Road

258
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,120
Just passed through Tunnel No. 4

259
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,759
Notify nearby police forces to assist in blocking

260
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,200
Follow, follow, chase

261
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,120
Roger

262
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,200
It's that car

263
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,759
It's right ahead

264
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,679
Quick, follow

265
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,759
Someone is chasing

266
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,919
Hold on tight

267
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,960
The current situation is

268
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,799
that the female cleaner is already dead.

269
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,799
His bodyguard

270
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,279
The really strong bodyguard

271
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,759
He is the most suspicious

272
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,759
Anyway, you can send me to the police station

273
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,039
Then it will be over quickly

274
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,039
How will you catch the bodyguard once he leaves the country

275
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,200
How to catch him

276
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,319
Boss, something's wrong.

277
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,519
They're biting very tightly.

278
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,240
May I ask if it's because of this?

279
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,079
May I ask if it's because of this?

280
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,799
This is that...

281
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,319
Electronic handcuffs, right?

282
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,559
Why didn't you say it earlier?

283
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,279
It's not too late to say it now.

284
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,720
Fasten your seatbelt.

285
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,680
Split into different cars

286
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,400
Turn around and cut them off from the side road

287
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,039
You really think I'm a bus

288
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,319
Chased every day, by everyone

289
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,400
Intelligence analysis

290
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,119
This matter endangers our national interests

291
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,640
To protect "Blue One" and Lin Shoulong's safety

292
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,599
We must investigate thoroughly and crush the enemy's plot

293
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,680
Protect the safety of Chinese citizens

294
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,000
Hand

295
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,039
No need, I'm sitting steadily

296
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,599
Hold it yourself

297
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,880
Alright

298
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,400
Security personnel of major groups

299
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
So, if any of you have a divorce in the future

300
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,839
Or need consultation on retirement issues

301
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,480
You can come to me

302
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:04,440
I'm a legal advisor

303
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,640
I can give you a 20% discount

304
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,640
I think we can skip the 20% discount

305
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,559
I can give you a bone fracture

306
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,759
Stop the car

307
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,480
Flying General

308
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,839
How can there be two tracking signals?

309
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,039
I don't know, sir.

310
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,720
Split up and pursue.

311
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,279
Yes.

312
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,720
Let's go.

313
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,599
Here

314
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,000
Impossible

315
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,599
The dock is already sealed off

316
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,640
No ships are going out to sea

317
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,359
Police, everyone in the car, get out immediately.

318
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,599
Everyone, get out right now.

319
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,079
Or we will start shooting.

320
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,880
I don't believe he can fly

321
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
Did you catch up?

322
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,839
Caught up, but this location is fake.

323
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,200
Let's go

324
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,400
You underestimate me

325
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,839
Do you think you can escape like this?

326
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Is it this one?

327
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,880
No.

328
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,160
This one.

329
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,440
No

330
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,039
This

331
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,279
It's him, it's him

332
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,240
Shi Qian

333
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,880
38 years old

334
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,440
5th Dan in Karate, 7th Dan in Kendo

335
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,559
Formerly served in the police department's SIT

336
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,920
What's your name, handsome?

337
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,279
Hu

338
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,720
I want to borrow this.

339
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,640
Fat Brother

340
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,880
I want to borrow this.

341
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,960
I really have an urgent matter.

342
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,599
Thank you.

343
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,160
Don't mess around, we're watching.

344
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,960
Yeah, yeah.

345
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,599
You're really something.

346
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,359
At a time like this, you're still playing games?

347
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,799
You're too carefree.

348
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,359
The new dungeon requires a team, you know.

349
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,440
Need a team.

350
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,039
What is he doing?

351
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:26,680
Playing a game.

352
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,599
Something happened.

353
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,960
Lend me your phone.

354
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,640
Lend me your phone, quickly.

355
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,720
Thank you.

356
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,440
Why are you arresting me?

357
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,359
You should ask your boyfriend.

358
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,720
Surveillance

359
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:07,839
Hello

360
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,920
Who are you?

361
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,759
It's Huo Min.

362
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,039
Why is it you?

363
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,039
We found it at your girlfriend's house.

364
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,680
We found the same toxin as on the towel.

365
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,960
We now suspect

366
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,359
you and your girlfriend conspired.

367
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,400
Kill Jia Tenglongqi

368
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,559
You're talking nonsense

369
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,480
If you don't want your girlfriend to suffer

370
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,559
You should turn yourself in at the police station

371
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,880
I want to say something to my girlfriend

372
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,839
Just one sentence

373
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,079
Alright, no problem

374
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,400
No tricks

375
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,480
Go ahead

376
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,759
Happy birthday

377
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,160
Don't worry

378
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,440
It's gone

379
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,240
Hello, Huo Min

380
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,880
Hello

381
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,039
Hello

382
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,920
Where is the locked location?

383
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,680
Something's wrong, Chief

384
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,799
His phone has been specially modified

385
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,359
These locations are fake

386
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,400
Brother, can I borrow your car?

387
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,559
You're really pushing it, aren't you?

388
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,599
Do you know where the embassy is?

389
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,359
I'm not going to the embassy.

390
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,160
I'm going to the police station.

391
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,599
You can't go to the police station.

392
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,240
Stop!

393
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,359
Boss, did you see that?

394
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,440
This is the power of love.

395
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,759
You need to hurry up.

396
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,759
If you want to surrender, we won't stop you.

397
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,319
But, Huo Min,

398
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,960
don't waste everyone's time.

399
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,599
You are wasting my time.

400
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,480
Ban Kun captured my girlfriend, I need to save her.

401
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,519
Boss.

402
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,000
Should I just knock him out?

403
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,079
And throw him into the car directly.

404
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,000
You think you can do it?

405
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,440
I can do it.

406
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,319
This doesn't seem like a wild approach.

407
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,920
You can't even beat me

408
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,160
Wake up

409
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,640
Stop

410
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,519
At least your girlfriend went to the police station

411
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,839
Not a bandit hideout

412
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:46,839
Ban Kun isn't targeting you

413
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,319
He wants the real culprit

414
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,359
Get in the car when you're done fighting

415
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,200
Don't act like a street performer

416
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:54,559
Hey, senior brother

417
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,960
You're more familiar with Yingzhou's laws

418
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,200
I want to ask you for a favor

419
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,079
Okay, okay

420
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,160
Thank you

421
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,039
The current task

422
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,680
Is to try to find out the truth

423
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,960
We have the same goal

424
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,160
So next

425
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,640
I hope you maintain a cooperative attitude

426
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,200
Happy cooperation

427
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,839
I have already used our network

428
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,519
To find the hospital where Jia Tenglongqi is

429
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,799
Shi Qian is no longer there

430
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,680
What about the recent exit records

431
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,000
The police are closely monitoring this case

432
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,720
He probably wouldn't dare to leave the country rashly

433
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,119
That means he's in Yingzhou

434
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,359
He must have a hiding place

435
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,720
I know a local seafood vendor

436
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,440
Should I ask him

437
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,640
Hmm

438
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,119
You security guards really have a wide network.

439
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,640
You even know seafood vendors.

440
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,640
It's security.

441
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,079
Do you understand security?

442
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,319
Speaking of wide networks,

443
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,720
That can't compare to you.

444
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,599
Hello.

445
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,799
Help me check on someone.

446
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,160
His name is Shi Qian.

447
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,359
Welcome to Eagle Continent Hot Springs

448
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,880
Flying General

449
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,440
Are you sure he's in here?

450
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm sure

451
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,039
Someone saw him take a taxi here half an hour ago

452
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:34,119
He hasn't come out since he went in

453
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,319
Half an hour

454
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,440
Could he have already left through the back door?

455
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,279
Once inside a place like this

456
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,400
It's probably not easy to get out in half an hour

457
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:45,119
I had someone check

458
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,519
This hot spring doesn't have a back door

459
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,279
There's only the main entrance

460
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,039
This guy is pretty cunning

461
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,279
He even found a place where they don't dare to install cameras

462
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,480
This place isn't big but has many sections

463
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,480
Alright

464
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,000
Old Lu, you take this area

465
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,799
Okay

466
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:58,839
Flying General, this area

467
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,680
I'll take this area

468
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,359
Boss

469
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,920
It seems like this is a

470
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,279
men's bath

471
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,200
I

472
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,400
I, I know

473
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,920
Until the real culprit is caught

474
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:14,920
I'm still a fugitive

475
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,200
I can't go anywhere, right?

476
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:20,920
Then we're going in

477
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,599
Sorry to trouble you two

478
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,759
Excuse me, how much is this?

479
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
This one?

480
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,519
Three dollars.

481
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,440
Sis Li, lend me some money.

482
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,640
Sorry, miss, miss.

483
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:26,839
Lend me some money, please.

484
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:28,480
Why?

485
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,759
I promised my friend to bring a gift back.

486
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,880
Don't worry, I'll definitely pay you back.

487
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,160
Thank you

488
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:50,880
Sis

489
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,480
How about I go in and take a look for you?

490
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,640
Your two little brothers

491
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,599
I can't run away

492
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,319
With just one door, I definitely can't escape.

493
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,359
Alright.

494
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,480
But you need to remember,

495
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,920
if you want to return home safely,

496
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,920
don't try any tricks.

497
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,039
Thanks.

498
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,519
Excuse me, sir

499
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,559
This area is not available right now

500
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,480
I need to use the restroom

501
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,640
Please wait a moment

502
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,160
Stone Coin

503
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,279
What are you doing here?

504
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,720
Shouldn't you be at the hospital with your boss?

505
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,640
I remember you

506
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,480
That

507
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,359
Chinese person outside the restroom door

508
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,920
Mention China

509
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,319
You dare

510
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,039
Move aside

511
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,279
Move aside, move aside

512
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:45,640
Move aside

513
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,359
Come here, come here

514
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,519
Stone Coin

515
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,880
Don't come in

516
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,519
Alright, I'm leaving

517
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,760
You really went all out this time.

518
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,239
If he dies today, I'm telling you,

519
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,440
we'll both be murderers.

520
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,800
This guy is a martial arts expert.

521
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,840
If I don't take action,

522
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,800
your fate will be the same as Jia Tenglongqi.

523
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,159
I say, you,

524
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,360
why are you everywhere?

525
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,599
I happened to run into him as soon as I came in.

526
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,519
What can I do?

527
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,679
In Jinzhou,

528
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,440
was it also a coincidence?

529
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,280
Don't move

530
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,239
Don't move

531
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,639
Chinese

532
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,840
Nice kick

533
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,880
Sneak attack

534
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,519
Let's try again

535
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,440
Mr. Shi Qian, Mr. Shi Qian

536
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,519
How about we talk

537
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,320
Talk like this

538
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,719
Or talk like this

539
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,800
I'm a lawyer, I'm different from them

540
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,880
I speak reason

541
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,960
What do you want to talk about

542
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,559
This is the situation now

543
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:10,000
The police say I killed Jia Tenglongqi

544
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,840
But you know who the real killer is

545
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,599
Right?

546
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,880
You touched me here at that time.

547
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,519
You left the poison on my clothes.

548
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,519
What if I take you to the police now?

549
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,400
I should be cleared, right?

550
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,480
Why couldn't it be you yourself

551
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,239
who put the poison there

552
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,880
and then framed me?

553
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,559
The poison would embed in the skin.

554
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,400
Get your finger tested.

555
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,559
It can be detected immediately.

556
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:43,360
You

557
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:45,480
You

558
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,480
And you

559
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:54,719
If you three want to survive

560
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,400
you better leave quickly

561
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,440
Let me go

562
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,960
Making such a big commotion

563
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:04,760
They will be here soon

564
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,920
Who are they

565
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,039
Do you want to know

566
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,679
Wait a little longer

567
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,880
When you die

568
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,960
You will know

569
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,360
Sorry

570
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,519
This way, please

571
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,599
Hello, sir

572
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,920
Is there anything I can help you with

573
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,960
Fei Jiang discovered three suspicious individuals

574
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,119
One of them

575
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,800
is the driver from SAD who previously followed us

576
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,039
Immediately evacuate with the team

577
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,800
Help

578
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,079
Don't touch me

579
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:16,760
I'm telling you

580
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,159
The female cleaner is already dead

581
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,320
Do you know why they asked you to come here?

582
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,639
Try sending you out

583
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,039
Flying General

584
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,320
Go

585
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,239
Hurry

586
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,400
Hurry

587
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,599
Hurry up

588
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,400
Don't be too harsh

589
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:37,800
I got this, you go ahead

590
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,639
Okay

591
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:40,400
Let's go

592
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,480
Hurry up

593
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,440
Boss

594
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,360
Don't move

595
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:08,960
Where is Fei Jiang

596
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:09,639
What about the back

597
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,320
You go

598
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:12,079
Go

599
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,119
Go

600
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,440
I'll go over there.

601
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:33,000
Be careful

602
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,519
Huomin is looking for you.

603
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,280
Hello

604
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,800
Huo Min

605
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,239
I just applied for a lawyer meeting

606
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,559
They rejected it.

607
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,960
Also, Meng Li was taken to the Yingzhou police station.

608
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,960
Who are they?

609
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,639
What exactly happened? Tell me!

610
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:34,000
Someone is catching up from behind.

611
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,519
These people are all armed with guns.

612
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:47,280
Do you think they are here to save you

613
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,360
or to kill you?

614
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:52,480
Do you want to take a gamble?

615
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:54,840
Fatty, stop the car.

616
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,079
Hand him over to the people behind.

617
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:56,840
Okay.

618
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:59,320
No, I'll talk, I'll talk.

619
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:14,840
Alright, I'll tell you.

620
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:17,960
They are SAD.

621
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:24,559
Southeast Asia Democratic Front Alliance.
