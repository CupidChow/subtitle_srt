(Xizhao International Airport)

3
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,310
Wang Lin?

4
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,230
Are you here for travel or business?

5
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,450
Business.

6
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,780
(Wang Lin)

7
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,080
Is there any problem?

8
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,530
No problem.

9
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,980
=Episode 10=

10
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,580
The mourning river chokes its flow.

11
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,660
The green mountains stand as proof.

12
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,820
Who dares claim their silence?

13
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,660
The land itself echoes their names.

14
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,140
Absolute Loyalty to the Party.

15
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,660
Serve as unsung heroes.

16
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,060
Absolute Loyalty to the Party.

17
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,620
Serve as unsung heroes.

18
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,900
Absolute Loyalty to the Party.

19
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,300
Serve as unsung heroes.

20
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,980
Jun.

21
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,140
School's out.

22
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,900
School's out.

23
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,380
Who is he?

24
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,740
He's my teacher. Here for a home visit.

25
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,380
You bombed the test.

26
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,820
Hide the broom.

27
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,980
It was an open-book exam
on Ideology and Morality. Remember?

28
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,180
Don't be scared. I'm here for you.

29
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,340
I'm not scared.

30
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,060
Did you forget me,

31
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,220
your old friend?

32
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,260
We used to play games together.

33
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,500
Like catching spies.

34
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,260
We were on the same team.

35
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,540
We made a great team back then,

36
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,900
countering every move.

37
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,100
Rainbow calling Thunderbolt.

38
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,780
(Huo Jun, a former officer at JNSB,
former codename: Thunderbolt)

39
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,460
Rainbow calling Thunderbolt.

40
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,540
Thunderbolt.

41
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,060
I'm Thunderbolt.

42
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,820
I... am...

43
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,820
Thunderbolt.

44
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,220
Rainbow to Thunderbolt.

45
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,580
Rainbow to Thunderbolt.

46
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,780
We've captured all the spies.

47
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,340
I'm Thunderbolt.

48
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,340
I am...

49
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,140
Jun.

50
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,740
It's okay. It's okay.

51
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,140
I'm here. I'm here, Jun.

52
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
I'm right here.

53
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,180
I'm here. I'm here, Jun.

54
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Master,

55
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,580
what really happened to Jun back then?

56
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,560
Your brother's code name was Thunderbolt.

57
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,420
He was undercover overseas for six years.

58
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,380
His opponent was powerful.

59
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,180
They had bribed the local authority.

60
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,660
Jun was betrayed by a third party.

61
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,340
Who was it?

62
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,740
Shura.

63
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,900
Shura.

64
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,500
They're also involved in the Shoulong case.

65
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,220
I have to go.

66
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,260
Remember,

67
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,500
they already know who you are.

68
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,460
You're out in the open,
and they're hiding in the dark.

69
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,390
You'll be exposed.

70
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,240
I don't care.

71
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,700
I'm the best fit for this.

72
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,220
I have to go.

73
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,380
Who goes and how

74
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,580
is up to the bureau.

75
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,260
I've been battling SAD.

76
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,780
Why are you looking for someone else?

77
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,180
Remember,

78
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,020
you're a national security officer.

79
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,500
The country has invested so much in you.

80
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,900
Your life doesn't solely belong to you.

81
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,380
Follow orders.

82
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,420
Do you know why I like playing mahjong now?

83
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,220
Sitting here like this means

84
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,900
there's no big trouble at home.

85
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,730
(Huo Yingming, a former officer at JNSB)
No big trouble?

86
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,020
All of us sitting here? No trouble?

87
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,780
Someone's definitely
about to be in big trouble.

88
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,700
That'd be me.

89
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,020
I never win when I play

90
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,100
mahjong with your family.

91
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,700
This way of playing

92
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,500
is called "Battle to the End," right?

93
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,340
Exactly.

94
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,060
Weird, isn't it?

95
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,940
Some people run fast,

96
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,980
they're willing to run,

97
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,620
but they never win.

98
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,060
Yes, "Battle to the End".

99
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,020
I'm pretty good at it.

100
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,660
Ignore the boss's advice, and you'll be

101
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,860
playing mahjong alone.

102
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,620
You gotta play by the rules.

103
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,260
Otherwise, the whole game

104
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,860
(Situ Yu)
falls apart.

105
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,940
(a former officer at JNSB)

106
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,900
Got a winning hand?

107
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,100
Just one tile away.

108
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Go ahead, then.

109
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,220
Don't move. Stay still.

110
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,300
I'm making a kong.

111
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,700
You're doing this on purpose, huh?

112
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,300
I play fast and often, so I win more.

113
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,100
But one big loss, and you're

114
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,980
off the table.

115
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,920
Wins and losses are part of the game.

116
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,980
But there's one thing to remember.

117
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,610
We have to win.

118
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,600
- Right?
- Exactly.

119
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,900
Couldn't agree more.

120
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,820
Arrow nocked, tiles on the verge.

121
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,140
Adapt and act, that's how you emerge.

122
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,140
You're the boss.

123
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,180
Whatever you say goes.

124
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,980
Who cares about the chase?

125
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,340
North Wind wins.

126
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,220
Hold on.

127
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,460
Don't move.

128
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,820
I win.

129
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,580
Look at this kid.

130
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,940
We can't beat him now.

131
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,700
Zhao,

132
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,700
even though we're veteran officers,

133
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,250
we can't beat this kid at majhong.

134
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,280
This kid? He's just a dumb-dumb.

135
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,500
Promise me...

136
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,620
Catch Li Ge.

137
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,140
And...

138
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,660
my position...

139
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,580
has...

140
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,180
(Han Yao)

141
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,580
Calling Viper (Matt).

142
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,180
Who are you?

143
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,100
I'm Huo Min.

144
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,940
How did you get in touch with me?

145
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,140
Through Han Yao.

146
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,820
Li Ge set him up and killed him.

147
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,540
Don't contact me again.

148
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,900
Li Ge has been captured now.

149
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,820
But I can get you what you want.

150
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,660
You know what I want?

151
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,800
Structure Diagram of Azure One Lab.

152
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,620
Then what do you want?

153
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,780
I want a person.

154
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,580
Who?

155
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,940
Baan Khun.

156
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,260
The Task Force 901

157
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,650
(Steadfast for the Party)
has demonstrated

158
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,900
(Relentless for the Mission)
excellent

159
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,860
professionalism and the skilled qualities

160
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,860
of national security officers
during the operation

161
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,140
to dismantle SAD
and against the XCC in China.

162
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,900
To boost morale,

163
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,060
the bureau's decided

164
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,380
to commend every

165
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,700
team member internally.

166
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,180
Additionally,

167
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,700
you should continue follow up
on Azure One's development

168
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,640
and closely monitor the upcoming negotiations

169
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,620
between Mitsuba Heavy Industries Ltd.
and Shoulong Group.

170
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,940
Yes, sir!

171
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,160
Alright, sit down.

172
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,300
Today, we also have a personnel announcement.

173
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,980
Comrade Zhao Jizheng has served for 33 years.

174
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,820
Due to health reasons,
he can't continue frontline work.

175
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,540
His medical retirement request
has been approved.

176
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,260
Zhao,

177
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,380
come up and say something.

178
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,380
This doesn't feel right.

179
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,820
Even if there's an reassignment,

180
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,860
they wouldn't just pull someone

181
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,180
mid-operation.

182
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,340
Unless...

183
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,660
Unless what?

184
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,740
Unless you're the Chief? Cut it out.

185
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,420
Comrades,

186
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,740
although we've

187
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,940
successfully dismantled

188
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,810
SAD's operations in China,

189
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,160
Shura remains a strong and professional

190
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,300
foreign enemy.

191
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,540
They are an old enemy,

192
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,600
a particularly tough one.

193
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,600
I hope that

194
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,180
under Captain Luo's leadership...

195
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,180
Lu Chen.

196
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,060
Hu Feijiang.

197
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,540
Rise to the challenge

198
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,180
and complete this mission.

199
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,140
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

200
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,940
Comrades,

201
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,780
in the upcoming missions,

202
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,260
I may no longer fight

203
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,140
alongside you.

204
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,100
Because the bureau

205
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,980
has approved

206
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,620
my medical retirement.

207
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,420
I'm retiring.

208
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,740
Although I retire from duty,

209
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,780
my loyalty

210
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,660
and my beliefs

211
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,220
will never retire.

212
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,180
Comrades,

213
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,660
when you return victorious,

214
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,180
I'll celebrate it for you.

215
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,060
Because what you carry

216
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,340
is the mission of the nation.

217
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,860
Many people

218
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,420
may never know your names

219
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,900
or the things you've done

220
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,260
in silence.

221
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,780
But in my heart,

222
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,700
I'll always remember.

223
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,860
I'll never forget.

224
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,900
Normally,

225
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,820
you salute me cause I'm the director.

226
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,740
But today,

227
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,780
I salute all of you.

228
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,060
(Shoulong Group)

229
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,660
MHI Ltd. sent you

230
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,380
(Kong Sheung Wang)
to visit Shoulong Group following

231
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,560
(Acting President of MHI Ltd.)
the approval of the EIA.

232
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,420
Mr. Kong,

233
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
we warmly welcome

234
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,900
your positive cooperation.

235
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,830
If I may speak frankly, Mr. Lin,

236
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,180
our company is in a difficult position

237
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,910
regarding this partnership with Shoulong.

238
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,200
Additionally, due to
President Gaa's accident,

239
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,100
I was suddenly appointed.

240
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,750
I'm under huge pressure, inside and out.

241
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,140
So this time,

242
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,270
I hope you'll show sincerity

243
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,800
and quickly help us reach an agreement.

244
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,200
Sure.

245
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,500
Please, have a seat.

246
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,860
I've been quite concerned

247
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,300
about President Gaa.

248
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,100
To help move our collaboration forward,

249
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,460
we're willing

250
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,240
to raise our initial offer price

251
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,380
by another 10%.

252
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,130
How does that sound?

253
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,760
It seems there's still quite a gap

254
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,770
between our price expectations.

255
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,260
If it's only a 10% increase,

256
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,380
it wouldn't worth

257
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,280
the risk for us.

258
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,080
Our offer is already

259
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,750
the highest on the international market.

260
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,710
What you're referring to

261
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,820
applies to standard business deals.

262
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,590
But Shoulong Group

263
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,520
is a specialized, tech-driven enterprise.

264
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,980
And energy compression is
our proprietary technology.

265
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,460
If we lease the equipment,

266
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,830
what's to stop others from cracking it

267
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,140
or even copying it?

268
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,940
Chinese wisdom

269
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,460
is truly impressive.

270
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,180
Mr. Kong,

271
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,550
there's a saying:
"Give an inch, take a mile."

272
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,670
For the same letter of intent
in black and white,

273
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,540
who's pushing it forward with sincerity,

274
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,170
and who's just being pushy?

275
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,380
Chinese people are wise,

276
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,660
but our wisdom

277
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,630
is built on our own foundation.

278
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,580
There's another saying in China:

279
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,420
"You can't see a gentleman
through the eyes of a petty man."

280
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,540
Shoulong Group truly

281
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,620
respects intellectual property.

282
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,990
If you don't even trust that,

283
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,750
then there's no point

284
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,190
in continuing talks.

285
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,170
You don't need to act indifferent.

286
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,700
Recently, we came across

287
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,100
some Azure One data.

288
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,780
We all know

289
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,970
(Structure Diagram of Azure One)
you need that equipment,

290
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,940
and we're the only supplier

291
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,940
who can sell it to you.

292
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,330
Besides, when it comes to
energy compression technology,

293
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,250
you don't seem to hold much leverage.

294
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,540
This technology is
our core proprietary secret.

295
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,130
Your approach

296
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,980
has already gone far beyond
business practices.

297
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,700
If we were able to access it,

298
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,660
then it's hardly a secret anymore.

299
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,660
All we're asking for is

300
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,500
open and honest negotiations.

301
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,820
If you offer the right price,

302
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,180
there's no need for us

303
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,900
to go back and forth on this.

304
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,380
Well then, I'll take my leave.

305
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,720
Mr. Lin, are you alright?

306
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,820
Get me the medicine. Quick.

307
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,110
Go and tell JNSB.

308
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,620
Now.

309
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,620
Li Ge's mission failed.

310
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,220
SAD currently has no operations in China.

311
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,780
From this point on,
I'll take command personally.

312
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,620
(Peng Yonghui, member of SAD,
codename: Fireworker)

313
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,740
I'll follow the plan.

314
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,400
Intel from our guy inside Shoulong says

315
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,860
their talks with Gapung fell through.

316
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,340
Moreover,

317
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,140
Shura is interested in Azure One.

318
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,500
Have they started moving?

319
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,490
We need to pick up the pace.

320
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,180
Did you get the stuff?

321
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,940
It's in progress.

322
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,940
What about Huo Min?

323
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,140
Did you find anything?

324
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,980
So far,

325
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,300
it matches everything we know.

326
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,700
Send him into Shoulong Group.

327
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,780
Why do we trust him?

328
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,460
In our line of work,

329
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,180
trust is just lip service.

330
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,660
So, what's your plan?

331
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,940
He sent me a copy of

332
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,380
Structure Diagram of Azure One.

333
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,780
I haven't verified if it's real yet.

334
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,020
You want to test it out?

335
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,780
Someone's got to do it.

336
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,980
It's also a chance

337
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,580
to see if he's really trustworthy.

338
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,020
I'll keep tabs on him.

339
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,100
Wire him some intel funds.

340
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,060
Make him write a letter
of guarantee and record a video

341
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,540
as proof of his treason.

342
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,300
Don't worry.

343
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,020
If he makes a wrong move,

344
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,820
we've got ourselves a perfect decoy.

345
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,660
See you.

346
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,300
What now? You chickening out?

347
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,540
What did we just say?

348
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,860
Just do it.

349
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,340
Come on, bark.

350
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,380
Do it.

351
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,820
Woof, woof, woof.

352
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,460
Can't hear you.

353
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,580
Squat and bark again.

354
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,740
Louder!

355
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,260
Woof, woof, woof.

356
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,740
Louder!

357
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,140
Woof, woof, woof.

358
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
Anyone else?

359
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,700
Anyone else?

360
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,720
Young Mr. Lin.

361
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,330
Let me give it a shot.

362
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,900
Seriously? You again?

363
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,090
Wanna make a bet?

364
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,220
What can you bet against me?

365
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,900
If you win,

366
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,040
I'll stream myself barking like a dog, okay?

367
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,690
If you lose, you owe me a favor.

368
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,460
Young Mr. Lin has plenty of dogs,

369
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,940
ain't missing you.

370
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,140
Go chill somewhere else.

371
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,740
You chickening out, Young Mr. Lin?

372
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,900
Forget it. Let him play by himself.

373
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,780
Let's go.

374
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,900
Young Mr. Lin, don't chicken out.

375
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,700
Compete with him.

376
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,540
Compete! Compete!

377
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,500
Forget it, forget it.

378
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,340
Compete!

379
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,620
You? You want to bet with me?

380
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,940
Let's bet then.

381
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,660
See that top spot? If you lose,

382
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,580
jump down from there.

383
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,100
You dare?

384
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,460
Let's find out.

385
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,500
Come on!

386
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,260
On your marks. Ready? Go!

387
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,460
Go for it!

388
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,900
You've got this, buddy!

389
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,900
Keep it up! Keep it up!

390
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:30,820
Go! Go! Go!

391
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,940
Hey, you're cheating!

392
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,420
It is strategy, got it?

393
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,780
Young Mr. Lin! Go!

394
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,700
Push through!

395
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,300
Nice, bro!

396
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,580
You nailed it!

397
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,300
Young Mr. Lin, are you okay?

398
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,340
Go away.

399
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,580
Darn it.

400
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,980
Why do I run into this psycho?

401
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,660
Young Mr. Lin,

402
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,380
Shoulong made me lose my job.

403
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,140
I want to join Shoulong.

404
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,540
That's what you want from me?

405
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Alright.

406
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,430
But let me warn you.

407
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,540
Getting into is the easy part.

408
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,410
Staying in, though,

409
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,740
depends on your luck.

410
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,780
This is yours.

411
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,900
(National Security Honor Badge)

412
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,740
In a hurry. Gotta go.

413
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,580
Where to?

414
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,420
Work.

415
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,060
Work? Where are you working?

416
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,540
Shoulong.

417
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,740
Huo Min,

418
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,220
did you even talk to me first?

419
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,940
Getting too into the role-play, huh?

420
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,500
You forgetting who you are?

421
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,740
Captain Luo, you're overthinking this.

422
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,980
You work for MSS.

423
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,420
You should follow orders.

424
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,220
Who's been chosen by Master for Shoulong?

425
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,060
You?

426
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,220
Lu Chen? Hu Feijiang?

427
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,820
Or someone from another city?

428
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,900
I've been worked at XCC for two years.

429
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,930
Do you know how long it takes

430
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,990
in Shoulong to lower

431
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,340
the guards of those foreign forces?

432
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,580
Can Azure One afford to wait?

433
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,770
My current position

434
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,660
gives me the easiest access to the storm.

435
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,140
So, is that all you're after?

436
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,380
You joined Shoulong

437
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,700
to get close to Shura, find the mastermind,

438
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,780
and avenge Thunderbolt.

439
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,100
I admit I've got my own reasons,

440
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,540
but I know keeping Azure One on track

441
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,220
is the top priority.

442
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,220
Huo Min,

443
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,260
this is not a negotiation.

444
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,980
I'm afraid you'll fail the mission.

445
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,860
Your life is yours,

446
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,540
but your duty belongs to the country.

447
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,020
If you keep being this stubborn,

448
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,780
I'll have to pull you out.

449
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,660
Thunderbolt's life

450
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,820
doesn't belong to the country?

451
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,100
- That's not what I meant…
- Why are you stopping me?

452
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,380
If you insist, then I don't want this.

00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
Captain Luo,

455
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,340
I hope you trust me.

456
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,060
And Chief Wei has approved it.

457
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,340
I'll join the convenience store operation.

458
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,760
Goodbye.

459
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,420
Nice car.

460
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,860
Don't crash my car.

461
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,260

(Legal Affairs Department)
Here's your ID badge.

464
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,740
Legal Affairs?

465
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,020
I thought I was joining PR.

466
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,100
Nope.

467
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,300
The notice we got

468
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,460
says Legal Affairs. This way, please.

469
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,180
Perfect, it's right in my field.

470
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,940
Lawyer Zheng,

471
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,340
he is the new colleague.
His name is Huo Min.

472
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,940
No need for an intro.

473
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,520
Junior, you do have some connections.

474
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,300
Attention, please.

475
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,340
I don't need to

476
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,460
introduce him to you, right?

477
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,450
Our paths have crossed. Old acquaintance.

478
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,760
He's the former legal advisor for XCC,

479
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,490
also my junior.

480
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,530
No matter what happened before,

481
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,470
now that he joined Shoulong,

482
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,660
he's seen the light
and made the smart move.

483
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,620
Welcome him, everyone.

484
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,140
Thank you all. This is too much.

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,460
Looking forward to working with you all.

487
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,260
Who'll mentor you?

488
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,420
Yu!

489
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,220
Come here.

490
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,060
Lawyer Zheng.

491
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,140
You passed the bar exam?

492
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,620
Just did.

493
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,820
She'll mentor you then.

494
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
No problem, senior.

495
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,340
Me?

496
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,370
I'm just an intern.

497
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,380
That's fine.

498
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,180
Right, junior?

499
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,860
That's fine.

500
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,220
Go on, get to work.

501
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,780
Wait a second.

502
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,980
It's your first day at work.

I just don't get it.

505
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,420
He just got back from the XCC, and now

506
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,940
he's working at Shoulong.

507
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,820
Is he allergic to our work or something?

508
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,900
What's he thinking?

509
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,040
If you two are really this free,

510
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,540
why not go join him?

511
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,260
Can I borrow your baskets later?

512
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,580
Sure.

513
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,300
Good borrowers get second chances, right?

514
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,860
Two hundred RMB per use, deal?

515
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,380
That sounds fair.

516
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,460
But I might borrow it twice.

517
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,060
Keep an eye on her.

518
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,700
Just a heads-up,

519
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,180
don't ever cross the boss.

520
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,100
You know what's worse than crossing

521
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,580
a national security officer?

522
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,780
Crossing a female officer?

523
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,260
Nope. Crossing a fat officer.

524
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,180
Bro, you're stepping on my foot.

525
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,980
Sorry, sorry, my bad.

526
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,170
Sorry, senior staff only.

527
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,890
Young Mr. Lin, please.

528
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,820
You're that, uh…

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,340
Bai Keqing, the PR legend, right?

530
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,840
I've seen you on TV. It is you.

531
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,410
And you're...

532
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,020
What? You two know each other?

533
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,030
Sorry, he must've mistaken me
for someone else.

534
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,140
Do I look like one of your friends?

535
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,300
A little bit, yeah.

536
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,580
Then he must be quite handsome.

537
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,110
You just got here
and you're already slacking off

538
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,720
and hitting on a girl?

539
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,220
Alright then, let's get to know each other.

540
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,420
Come on.

541
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,230
You beat me last time.

542
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,180
Today, I'm giving you another shot.

543
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,320
Whoever beats him gets

544
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,540
a year-end bonus equal to 12 months' salary.

545
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,680
Then I'd feel bad if I won.

546
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,580
Come on, show us. Let's see

547
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,400
how handsome you are.

548
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,850

549
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,140
see?

550
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,740
He's quite handsome.

551
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,530
I gotta go.

552
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,580
Alright, stop it!

553
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,160
Keqing.

554
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,580
Hold on.

555
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,240
Don't move!

Say no more.

561
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,540
I've retired.

562
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
But since the decision's been made,

563
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,100
whatever comes,

564
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,060
you'll face it with him.

565
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,210
Let the leader handle it.

566
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,540
Isn't that your tradition?

567
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,780
What did you say? Who should handle it?

568
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,460
The leader, of course.

569
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,820
I'm no leader anymore.

570
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,530
I've retired,

571
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,260
and I'm safely landed.

572
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,650
I hope you all land safely too.

573
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,230
As the captain,

574
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,810
I should take the responsibility.

575
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,700
And more than that,

576
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,390
for someone like Huo Min,

577
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,700
I'd rather have him as a teammate

578
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,780
than an opponent.

579
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,010
Honestly,

580
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,700
you three and Huo Min

581
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,640
are the finest officers I've ever trained.

582
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,700
But you're about to face a huge storm.

583
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,980
Whether it's external or internal,

584
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,060
visible or hidden,

585
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,270
there will always be hands
reaching out to grab you.

586
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,860
You must stay vigilant.

587
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,290
You need to...

588
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,260
Observe in silence.

589
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,660
Focus with intent.

590
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,660
Know it by heart.

591
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,080
- And strike swiftly.
- And strike swiftly.

592
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,540
I'm speechless.

593
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,220
What do you mean?

594
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,260
You're kicking me out?

595
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,290
How long are you planning to relax?

596
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,660
That's classified.

597
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,420
If it's classified, then I'm relieved.

598
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,680
Alright then, I'm off.

599
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,910
Seriously, you're not gonna

600
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,020
tell Huo Min you're leaving?

601
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,740
He's barely keeping it together.

602
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,540
You think he has time to
care about a retired old man?

603
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,100
Please tell him.

604
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,820
Since he chose this path,

605
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,780
he shouldn't turn back.

606
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,100
That old man must be talking about himself.

607
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,630
Huo Min will be at the base soon.

608
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,660
Yalong, Danni,

609
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,900
get his info into the system.

610
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,020
- Yes.
- Yes.

611
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,300
Come on in.

612
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,020
First time down here, huh?

613
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,900
Not bad. You guys got this all set up.

614
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,060
Everyone's here.

615
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,660
Hey, bro,

616
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,900
you were more buff last time I saw you.

617
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,140
You've lost weight. Gotta work out more.

618
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,340
Hi, everyone.

619
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,660
Hello.

620
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,740
You've got a lot of gear here.

621
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,740
Must use a lot power,

622
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,740
like those flickering

623
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,700
lights up there.

624
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,500
Our National Security lights

625
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,860
aren't like any other lights.

626
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,940
They need personality.

627
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,060
Exactly. Gotta match the vibe of the place.

628
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,500
But where is that "guiding light"?

629
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,340
A double meaning, huh?

630
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,420
"Guiding light"?

631
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,220
See, the "guiding light" shines through.

632
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,100
Lin Shoulong provided massive

633
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,300
personnel data from Shoulong.

634
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,980
Everyone's searching for clues.

635
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,340
We're screening all staff

636
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,260
with possible access to the internal secrets.

637
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,900
Captain Luo, I'm lactose intolerant.

638
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,660
Next time, no milk in my coffee, please.

639
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,140
That's my coffee.

640
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,820
It's fine. I don't mind.

641
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,740
I need to tell you something.

642
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,090
Captain, how about I treat you all to dinner?

643
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,500
No need.

644
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,910
Take it easy. You gotta
find a work-life balance.

645
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,260
Finish the work first.

646
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,100
I know work is important.

647
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,940
Just a suggestion...

648
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,810
Move it.

649
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,790
See? The captain's being captain,

650
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,820
all serious and focused.

651
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,620
Here you go.

652
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,900
(National Security Honor Badge)

653
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,420
This might be the last one you ever get.

654
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,900
Wait, what... what?

655
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,130
Why is this the last one I get?

656
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,360
Look, it suits me so well.

657
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,540
Just say something uplifting.

658
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,380
I've noticed

659
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,300
you're pretty cold-blooded.

660
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,260
You didn't see Zhao off yesterday.

661
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,020
I thought

662
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,460
Zhao's just leaving temporarily,

663
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,300
right?

664
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,740
Can you just...

665
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,980
watch it?

666
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,300
You almost spilled all over me.

667
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,980
Perfect. Come with me.

668
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,140
Take it off.

669
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,140
She said take it off.

670
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,420
Guess I've got to suck it up...

671
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,420
Hurry!

672
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,980
Try it on yourself.

673
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,580
Try on clothes? Why?

674
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,580
If you don't want another punch,

675
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,340
you'd better get close to Lin Yasheng.

676
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,050
But his rich kid hangouts
are totally different

677
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,700
from where a legal advisor would go.

678
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,620
Financial status is power too,

679
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,460
right?

680
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,940
Here.

681
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,020
Didn't you say you liked that car?

682
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,860
It's fine,

683
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,980
kinda suits a top lawyer like me anyway.

684
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,100
Here's some info on Lin Yasheng
from entertainment reporters:

685
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,660
his favorite store to shop at,

686
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,270
his favorite color and fabrics,

687
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,780
go-to restaurant,

688
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,860
usual seat,

689
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,820
even the dish he takes seconds of, and

690
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,860
the one he never touches.

691
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,100
It's all right here.

692
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,300
Memorize it.

693
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,220
It'll help you get close to him faster.

694
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,580
How is this any different from a gold-digger?

695
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,820
The difference is,

696
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,860
when Young Mr. Lin gives

697
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,420
you pricey gifts, they get confiscated.

698
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,420
And if anything you take from here

699
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,620
gets dirty or damaged,

700
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,220
you pay full price.

701
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,180
Then I'm out.

702
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,020
I'll end up owing more than I make.

703
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,900
Take a look at this.

704
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,500
She's Bai Keqing.

705
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,300
Lin Yasheng has been
trying hard to win her over.

706
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,700
But her attitude toward him

707
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,780
has been lukewarm at best.

708
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,860
So, Bai Keqing's the key to

709
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,460
getting in with Lin Yasheng.

710
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,140
Bai Keqing...

711
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:11,020
What? Do you two have history?

712
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,780
What are you talking about?

713
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,960
Now I finally know

714
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,420
why I always get beat up.

715
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,940
You know what?

716
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,100
I'm just a living witness.

717
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,500
Every time Lin Yasheng sees Bai Keqing,

718
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,300
he's like a peacock spreading its tail.

719
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,170
Here, memorize it.

720
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,580
No need. It's all in my head.

721
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,180
You memorized it all?

722
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,220
It's just a piece of cake.

723
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,820
Alright, let's have some fun

724
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,380
and test him.

725
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,780
I'll go first.

726
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,820
If Lin Yasheng, heir of Shoulong Group,

727
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,650
invites you to French cuisine,

728
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,660
do you go with a double-breasted or

729
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,540
single-breasted suit?

730
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,500
Answer quickly.

731
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,180
For a fancy pants rich kid like him,

732
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,200
single-breasted suit

733
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,710
for French dining is not his scene.

734
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,330
How many ribs on a gent's umbrella?

735
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,460
Which hand does he hold it in?

736
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,320
Twelve ribs

737
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,700
and always the right hand.

738
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,300
I've got one,

739
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,540
not about Lin Yasheng,
but about Lin Shoulong.

740
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,860
Is Lin Shoulong's car

741
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,660
turbocharged or supercharged?

742
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:09,340
It's an old model Audi A8, turbocharged

743
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,790
with a V12 engine,

744
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,260
fuel consumption 14.6 liters.

745
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,340
Charcoal-grilled shrimp,
mineral salt or sea salt?

746
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,700
Charcoal-grilled shrimp,
mineral salt or sea salt?

747
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,260
How about next time we eat it

748
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,690
I peel one for you to try?

749

00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:58,821
