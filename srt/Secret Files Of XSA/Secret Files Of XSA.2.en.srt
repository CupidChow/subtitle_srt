1
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,799
Everyone knows, right?

2
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,840
China Shoulong's new energy plan

3
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,039
Their promotion speed is too fast

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,800
We must make them stop.

5
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,680
Why are we entangled in the new energy sector?

6
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,240
Can't we approach it from other angles?

7
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,360
Crippling their economy

8
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,639
is the most effective method right now.

9
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,280
More importantly,

10
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,599
making their environment worse and worse

11
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,479
isn't that good for us?

12
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,120
But China has strict controls on technological security.

13
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
If we attack forcefully, won't we alert them?

14
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,560
China is not easy to deal with now.

15
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,000
How about we take it slow?

16
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,439
Many of our actions

17
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,439
have been intercepted by China's national security.

18
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,240
They are becoming harder to deal with.

19
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,120
We still need to be careful.

20
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,560
Shoulong Group's "Azure One" has been kept under wraps until now.

21
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,520
If we hadn't used compressor technology to choke them,

22
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,120
I'm afraid by the time this new energy comes out,

23
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,280
we would still be in the dark.

24
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,599
We need to be bolder.

25
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,800
Do you know?

26
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,599
China is far ahead in many fields.

27
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,560
If they succeed in the new energy sector again,

28
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,800
we're finished.

29
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,000
Go inform SAD.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,400
This time, their operation against Shoulong

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,080
must succeed.

32
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Okay, got it.

33
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,400
China imports millions of tons of crude oil from us every day.

34
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,879
imports millions of tons of crude oil.

35
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,039
But if "Blue One" succeeds,

36
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,759
we'll become beggars.

37
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,039
Bring them down at all costs.

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,680
Faith above all.

39
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,720
Everything I am about to tell you

40
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,759
must not be leaked out.

41
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,839
Otherwise,

42
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,800
see that?

43
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,639
It's all for you.

44
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,639
Understood.

45
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,040
These are the representatives for the negotiations

46
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,759
Representative of Shoulong Group, Lin Shoulong

47
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,879
Representative of Shapeng Country, Jia Tenglongqi

48
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,800
So tell me, boss, which side should I mess with

49
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,759
In the face of profit

50
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,040
There is no distinction between people and animals

51
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
Is there still a side to choose

52
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,879
Kid

53
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,199
It's you again

54
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,120
What are you doing?

55
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,800
Didn't you ask me to come get the pants?

56
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,800
Wait

57
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Don't move

58
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,000
Kid

59
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,720
Come here

60
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Stop

61
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,879
I'm not going to hurt you

62
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,839
Come here

63
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,759
I didn't expect you to have some integrity

64
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,680
Sit down, don't run

65
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,800
This is for you

66
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,759
No

67
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,839
Take it

68
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Let me tell you

69
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,879
Brother is going on a business trip abroad this time

70
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,800
Tell me what gift you want, I'll buy it

71
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,680
I'm not a child

72
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,879
Why are you running? You run

73
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,279
I have already informed the Shoulong Group

74
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,959
All security arrangements for the trip to Yingzhou

75
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,480
Will be fully handled by you

76
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,279
Make sure to have a good plan

77
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,960
You arrived in Yingzhou.

78
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,480
Yes, I just got to Yingzhou.

79
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,919
How did you know?

80
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,919
The new instance has opened.

81
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,679
You would definitely come.

82
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,360
Mr. Lin, please wait a moment.

83
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,480
Mom, I want to eat coconut milk ice cream.

84
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,799
Coconut milk is lactose-free, you can eat it.

85
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,399
The taste of that shop at the airport

86
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,480
is pretty good.

87
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,879
You are the best.

88
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,080
You remember my lactose intolerance.

89
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,759
I'm telling you, if we complete this task

90
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,720
don't even mention promotions or raises.

91
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,639
Look at that guy wearing a hat.

92
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,440
Isn't he the guy who had his motorcycle stolen in Jinzhou?

93
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,759
What a coincidence.

94
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,399
There are no coincidences in our work.

95
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,639
Pay more attention to his movements when we get there.

96
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,039
Okay.

97
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,639
I miss you too.

98
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,639
Mr. Lin.

99
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,960
Let's hang out together next time when we're free.

100
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,879
How about I come to see you after we complete the task?

101
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,039
We haven't seen each other for so long, right?

102
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,879
Sure.

103
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,919
I miss you too.

104
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,759
Mr. Lin, let's stick to the original plan.

105
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,919
Stick to the original plan.

106
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,159
Okay.

107
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,720
Already caught up.

108
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,679
Feint and then return.

109
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,240
The net is already set.

110
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,720
Understood.

111
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,039
Zack, you follow.

112
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,639
Coming.

113
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,919
Has a tail

114
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,919
Just hang it up.

115
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,799
Mr. Lin

116
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,240
It's okay

117
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,679
Mr. Lin, please rest here for a while.

118
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,679
Okay.

119
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,840
Mr. Lin, please rest here for a while.

120
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,960
Hello, I have a room reservation.

121
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,679
I need your passports.

122
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:15,960
Okay.

123
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,879
Here you go

124
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,279
Thank you

125
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,720
You're welcome

126
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,840
I'll handle it myself, okay

127
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,360
Hello, are there any available rooms?

128
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,320
One moment.

129
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,799
Sorry.

130
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,440
Please rearrange the rooms for me.

131
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,240
Which room should be rearranged?

132
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,759
All of them, thank you.

133
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,799
Please wait a moment.

134
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,240
Is the eleventh floor okay?

135
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,759
Have a pleasant journey

136
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,720
Hello

137
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,039
Do you have a reservation?

138
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,919
No, do you have a room with a south-facing window?

139
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,840
Yes, we have rooms with different themes

140
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,000
Which one would you prefer?

141
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,799
The cheapest one

142
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,320
Are you sure you want the cheapest one?

143
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,639
We have many options

144
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,960
No, thank you. Okay

145
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Please show your passport. One moment

146
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,879
Chinese

147
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,000
Have a pleasant journey.

148
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:32,000
Thank you.

149
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,200
Are you kidding me?

150
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,080
Is this a prison-themed room?

151
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,000
Why is there a wall in front of the window?

152
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,679
Do you want to change rooms?

153
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,799
What's the difference?

154
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,720
The price difference.

155
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:11,919
No, thank you.

156
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,759
Let's get to work.

157
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:19,360
They hired a professional security company

158
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,799
It seems they spent a lot of money

159
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,000
They have plenty of money

160
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,720
We have plenty of people

161
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,399
Alright

162
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,919
Look, look

163
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,000
You really put in a lot of effort

164
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,440
Didn't we all change rooms?

165
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,720
Why are there still so many?

166
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,679
All the rooms must be monitored

167
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,919
We should have chosen a different hotel

168
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,840
You should have changed jobs

169
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,639
How is it? Done?

170
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,440
You can let them in now

171
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,919
Okay

172
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,039
Mr. Lin

173
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,320
As expected of a professional security company

174
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Thank you for your hard work

175
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,279
It's our duty

176
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,200
However

177
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,799
We still need everyone to hand over their phones

178
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,679
During the negotiation period, communication

179
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,879
will be done through our dedicated local network

180
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,799
Alright

181
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,000
This negotiation was not easy to come by

182
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,000
Everyone should cherish it

183
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,759
and also increase security awareness

184
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,840
Therefore, all our actions

185
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,799
must follow Captain Luo's instructions

186
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,799
Isn't it a bit dark in here?

187
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,680
What's wrong with you?

188
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,400
During the time in Eagle State, whether it was day or night,

189
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,720
For everyone's privacy and safety

190
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,640
let's pull the curtains.

191
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,839
Did you hear that?

192
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,240
Sorry.

193
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,720
In broad daylight

194
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,759
You're just afraid that others can't see you, right?

195
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:29,920
Hey, boss

196
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,440
What's the situation over there?

197
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,000
Keeping an eye on it

198
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,519
Keep a close watch

199
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,799
Alright, don't worry

200
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,720
Today is another busy day.

201
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,039
Sir

202
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,799
Hello, are you also Chinese?

203
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,720
Yes

204
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,000
What a coincidence, I am also Chinese.

205
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,759
Are you here for tourism or...

206
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,680
Miss, excuse me

207
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,960
Take your time eating

208
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,920
Taking a photo

209
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,359
Sorry, I don't understand.

210
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,880
Just one.

211
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,480
Hello, sir

212
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,039
Sir

213
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:40,799
This is us

214
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,839
Sir, hello, hello

215
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,680
Please, please, can you take a picture for us?

216
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,519
We are not convenient

217
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,440
It's just me and the child, sorry

218
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Just one, just one

219
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,640
Please, please

220
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,680
Thank you

221
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,480
Come, Lin Hao

222
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,599
How about I do it instead

223
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,680
Sorry

224
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,720
Lin Hao, over here

225
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,920
Thank you

226
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,759
Grandpa, Grandpa

227
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,720
Mom asked me to thank you

228
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
Little one, thank you.

229
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,000
President Jia, I was just about to call you.

230
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,000
Tomorrow at ten in the morning I...

231
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:38,839
Wait a moment.

232
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,640
Who is it? Come in.

233
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:45,839
Captain Luo.

234
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
President Jia.

235
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,200
Sorry, I have an urgent matter right now.

236
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,920
I'll call you back in a bit.

237
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,680
Alright, alright.

238
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,720
You can speak now.

239
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,440
What is that?

240
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,240
A bug.

241
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,680
A bug.

242
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,640
But...

243
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,559
I was just about to tell President Jia.

244
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,839
About the time and place of tomorrow morning's meeting.

245
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,039
Then this...

246
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,119
What should we do?

247
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,720
It's okay, just follow the original plan.

248
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
Chairman Jia

249
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,640
Sorry, I had something to deal with just now.

250
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,160
Chairman Jia, I am officially informing you now.

251
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,440
Tomorrow at 10 AM

252
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,960
there will be a meeting at the Yingzhou Bay International Conference Center.

253
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,440
I will pick you up then.

254
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,880
Alright, see you there.

255
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
Alright, goodbye.

256
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,519
Boss

257
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,920
Tomorrow at ten o'clock at Yingzhou Bay International Conference Center

258
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,400
Very good

259
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,039
Set up the fishing net

260
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,960
Use a dense net for the big fish

261
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,920
Boss, no problem.

262
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,759
Boss, it's still the same group from yesterday.

263
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,400
Ignore them.

264
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,759
Proceed according to the plan.

265
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,240
Got it.

266
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,279
We are about to enter the action intersection

267
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,359
Everyone, get ready

268
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,720
Roger that

269
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,839
Roger that

270
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,839
I'll take the right, you take the left.

271
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,079
Got it.

272
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,880
Fei Jiang, what's the situation on your side?

273
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,279
Boss, I'm keeping them hanging here.

274
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,880
Good, just keep them circling around.

275
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,160
Old Lu

276
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,279
Don't drive too fast, let them keep following.

277
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,000
Understood

278
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,920
They went to pick up the Shapeng people.

279
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,960
Alright, let's cast an empty rod first.

280
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,119
First, go to the front desk and ask. Yes.

281
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,920
I need to check the guests who checked in yesterday.

282
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,599
Named Jia Tenglongqi.

283
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,720
I'll check.

284
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,599
Okay.

285
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,880
Is it them?

286
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,839
Yes.

287
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,920
I am Ban Kun, the chief inspector of the Criminal Investigation Department at Yingzhou Police Station.

288
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,000
We received a tip-off

289
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,559
suspecting you of hiding drugs.

290
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:26,319
Please cooperate with the investigation.

291
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,599
This is simply absurd.

292
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,359
Are you suspecting me?

293
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,400
We just got off the plane today.

294
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:43,920
Is customs just for show?

295
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,559
It won't take much of your time.

296
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,759
Please come this way.

297
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:53,359
Sorry, you are framing us.

298
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:56,640
This is an unreasonable request.

299
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,799
Sheriff, it's the wrong person.

300
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
Everyone, stop.

301
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,880
Let's split up and search.

302
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Trash

303
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Sorry

304
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,799
President Jia

305
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,480
President Lin

306
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,839
We finally meet

307
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,319
President Lin, thank you for your reminder

308
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,519
Mountain barriers

309
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Our cooperation has not come easily

310
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,440
Alright, please

311
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,680
Open the door! Open the door!

312
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,880
What's going on?

313
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,759
Boss, why didn't they go inside?

314
00:27:59,079 --> 00:27:59,839
Are they messing with us?

315
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,319
They decided to negotiate in the car.

316
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,160
What

317
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,920
Just in case

318
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:09,000
I also planted an insider among the Shapeng people

319
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,319
This morning, on them

320
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:13,440
I installed listening devices

321
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,960
It seems their skills are still too shallow

322
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,400
Switch to the monitoring channel

323
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,319
Chairman Jia

324
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,880
Let me introduce

325
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,799
This is the security consultant

326
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,680
we invited for this negotiation

327
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,839
Hello

328
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,240
Hello

329
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,440
We are truly grateful to you

330
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,839
for withstanding immense pressure from the West

331
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,920
and sincerely cooperating with us

332
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,119
We at Mingshu are with

333
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,279
great sincerity in doing this

334
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,680
"Blue One"

335
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,640
will be a project that benefits all of humanity

336
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,640
We are very willing to join hands with you

337
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,720
to contribute to energy transition and environmental protection

338
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,920
I have always believed in one principle

339
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,920
which is to have a kind heart

340
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,920
the result will always be perfect

341
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,799
This is what we Chinese often say

342
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,640
Truth, Kindness, and Beauty

343
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,759
Since we have Truth, Kindness, and Beauty here

344
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,759
let's begin

345
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,759
What are we waiting for if we don't start now

346
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:05,839
Is it okay now?

347
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:07,799
Please wait a moment.

348
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,920
Lu Chen

349
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,000
Alright.

350
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,640
What's going on?

351
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,880
Boss, they used signal jamming equipment.

352
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,720
It's done.

353
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,839
Chairman Jia,

354
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,039
Given the confidentiality of "Azure One",

355
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,680
we sincerely hope that your side

356
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:39,880
can have absolute trust in our Shoulong Group

357
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,720
and not get involved

358
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,759
in any technical decisions.

359
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,920
This cooperation method

360
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,640
has been basically approved in our internal meeting.

361
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,960
However, there are quite a few opposing voices.

362
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,839
Especially Jiang Shanghong.

363
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,920
So after signing the letter of intent,

364
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,799
we must implement it quickly.

365
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,000
including the environmental assessment report and all procedures.

366
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,440
Don't worry, I will push it forward with all my efforts.

367
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,759
Now it's possible

368
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,680
Regarding our last meeting

369
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,119
where we jointly expressed our views

370
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,799
we reached a consensus

371
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,599
on signing the cooperation agreement

372
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,279
which started off well

373
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,079
As for the next steps

374
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,640
we will discuss them in detail

375
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,960
As long as we have good intentions

376
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,799
the outcome will surely be perfect

377
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,240
Boss, what should we do next?

378
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:53,920
Don't panic, they will still have big trouble.

379
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,960
Chairman Jia

380
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:19,880
I look forward to seeing you again after today

381
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,400
We must have a good gathering then

382
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:24,000
Definitely, definitely, don't worry

383
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,279
Goodbye

384
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:25,839
Goodbye

385
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,640
President

386
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,039
The police are still in the hotel. We are being watched.

387
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:49,440
There will be trouble.

388
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,119
Go directly to your room and pack your things.

389
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,599
Then wait for me at the airport.

390
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,240
Yes.

391
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,680
You two, split up and act separately with me now.

392
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,799
Yes.

393
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:32,960
Captain Luo

394
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,039
This negotiation went very smoothly

395
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:39,880
and we completed the task ahead of schedule

396
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,319
We are very grateful for your meticulous arrangements

397
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,799
So our next step

398
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,720
No need to be polite, Mr. Lin

399
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,720
We will take you to the airport now

400
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,680
I will handle your luggage later

401
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Wasn't the flight scheduled for tomorrow?

402
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,119
Given the current situation

403
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,799
I suggest you return home as soon as possible

404
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,640
I have already arranged a passenger plane

405
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,839
It should be in position now

406
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,880
President

407
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,599
Restroom

408
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,320
Didn't find it here, let's look over there.

409
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,360
President, please wait a moment.

410
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,719
Boss, Shoulong's people have come out.

411
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,800
Since they have already successfully negotiated,

412
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,159
then we have no choice but to fight to the end.

413
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,639
Boss, they started biting people.

414
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:25,880
Are you okay?

415
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm fine.

416
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,079
Old Lu, shake them off.

417
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,840
Sit tight

418
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,760
Fasten your seatbelt, Mr. Lin.

419
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,280
His driving skills are fine, don't worry.

420
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,880
Old Lu, there's a fork in the road ahead.

421
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,199
The rightmost road is not yet open.

422
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,280
Rush through and shake them off.

423
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,159
Don't worry

424
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,119
I was holding back just now

425
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,079
Now

426
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,239
We're taking off

427
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
Sir, excuse me

428
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,480
It's not convenient here right now

429
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,440
Public restroom

430
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,039
Yes

431
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,400
Please wait a moment

432
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,039
Please wait a bit

433
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
That one over there should be fine

434
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,840
Of course

435
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,000
Call Lin Hao

436
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,800
It's connected

437
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,360
Lin Hao

438
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,239
The police have been watching us

439
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,599
You need to be extra careful

440
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:11,800
President

441
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,599
What happened

442
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,239
Get out quickly

443
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,840
What's going on

444
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,199
What happened

445
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,159
What's the matter

446
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,000
Waiter, hey

447
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,800
What's going on

448
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,159
Sorry

449
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,960
Hurry up and leave here. Leave.

450
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,880
President

451
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,440
President, President

452
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,559
Help! Someone, help!

453
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,960
Help! You

454
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,480
It's not me

455
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,440
It's not me

456
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,039
Don't touch me

457
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,000
Don't touch me, don't touch me

458
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,199
Don't move, don't move

459
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,159
Don't move, let go

460
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,159
Raise your hands

461
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,639
Squat down

462
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,480
Squat down

463
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,400
What happened?

464
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,199
He killed my boss.

465
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,159
They entered the airport through a special passage

466
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,360
We cannot enter

467
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,920
Sir, special pass

468
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,239
Thank you

469
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:50,480
Lin Xi

470
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,199
Lin Xi

471
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,320
The incident happened suddenly, a bit urgent

472
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,519
The car was driven a bit fast

473
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,400
But it's safe here

474
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:02,159
The way you drove the car

475
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:05,079
Did you treat it like a sports car?

476
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,039
You really scared me

477
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,159
You might as well send me directly to Shoulong

478
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,800
I can fly a plane too, want to try?

479
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,760
No, thanks

480
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,880
Alright, thank you

481
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,559
No, no

482
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,000
Safe travels

483
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,920
Thank you

484
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,920
Goodbye

485
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,480
Move aside, move aside

486
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,239
What's wrong?

487
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,000
President

488
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,440
President

489
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,000
President, President

490
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,719
What happened here?

491
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Brother Lu

492
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,679
Are you not planning to leave?

493
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,199
Why are you in such a hurry?

494
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,840
Look at the time now.

495
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,440
Young man, you really are...

496
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:32,800
Don't be in a rush.

497
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,159
There's still an hour left.

498
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,360
Let me calculate for you.

499
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,119
Twenty minutes to get you to the airport.

500
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,559
Twenty minutes to board.

501
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,320
The remaining twenty minutes.

502
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,159
Take a short vacation.

503
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:47,199
At the hotel.

504
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,039
You don't understand this.

505
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,159
For people like us who drive long-term,

506
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,159
Having no gas pedal or brake underfoot,

507
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,559
That's a vacation.

508
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,519
Where?

509
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,119
It's not important.

510
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,599
Something happened.

511
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,400
There's an operation.

512
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,320
Just received intelligence.

513
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,239
Jia Tenglongqi was assassinated at the hotel.

514
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,400
A Chinese citizen named Huo Min was arrested.

515
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:08,960
No way, not even twenty minutes.

516
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:14,280
Young man, don't be in such a hurry.

517
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,519
Let's go.

518
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:17,639
Wait, wait for me.

519
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
I haven't put on my shoes yet.

520
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:20,880
Wait for me.

521
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,559
Why did you kill Jia Teng Longqi?

522
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,480
Murder

523
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,760
You got it wrong, officer

524
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,360
I didn't kill anyone

525
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,800
I didn't kill anyone, officer. I didn't kill anyone

526
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,400
Quiet

527
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:41,280
I didn't kill anyone

528
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Be honest

529
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:45,920
Still trying to argue, huh?

530
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,599
Jia Teng Longqi fell right in front of you

531
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,400
It was you

532
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,920
You killed Jia Teng Longqi
