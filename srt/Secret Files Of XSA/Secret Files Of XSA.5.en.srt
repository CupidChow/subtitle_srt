1
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,400
Hey, Fireworker

2
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,560
Where's the boat? If we don't leave now, it'll be too late.

3
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,360
There won't be a boat.

4
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,080
Are you messing with me?

5
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,199
Shut up.

6
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,639
If I hadn't helped you last time,

7
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,400
you would have been caught by National Security.

8
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,560
Your final task is in the woods behind you.

9
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,840
If you fail again,

10
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,360
someone will definitely come to get you.

11
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
Also,

12
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,759
your family will join you on the journey.

13
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,080
Fang Esq.

14
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,520
I recognize you

15
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,599
You are that

16
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,000
Security, Security Captain, Security Captain

17
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,759
Let me introduce myself again

18
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Luo Shanshan

19
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,240
So, Captain Luo, who is in charge of security today?

20
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,520
Thank you.

21
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,759
I didn't properly thank you for the Eagle State incident.

22
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,400
Speaking of Yingzhou, I have something to ask you.

23
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
Last time in Yingzhou,

24
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,720
you exchanged a couple of moves with my colleague.

25
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,399
Your skills are impressive.

26
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,240
Where did you learn free fighting?

27
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,480
Could you recommend it to me?

28
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,079
Old Wan

29
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,600
You taught me those are called free fighting

30
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,519
Yes

31
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,600
Back in the days in the army

32
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,639
Alright, alright

33
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,199
Those things of mine

34
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,720
He taught me all of them, you know

35
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,920
Here, although there are many old men and women

36
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,759
But indeed, there are hidden talents

37
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,399
I think it's not hidden talents

38
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,519
It's more like hidden and undisclosed

39
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,360
Okay

40
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,959
I think we will

41
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,639
Definitely have the chance to spar again

42
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,680
No, no, no, you guys are professionals

43
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
How dare I spar with you

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,920
My bag

45
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,759
How are you? Are you okay?

46
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,720
I'm fine, I'm fine. She got away.

47
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,680
Did you get a good look at the person who snatched the bag?

48
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,199
Around 28 or 29 years old.

49
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,639
About the same height as her.

50
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,279
A woman, and she was injured.

51
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,240
A woman?

52
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,279
Yes, she disguised herself as a man.

53
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,480
Be careful when you're looking for her.

54
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,680
What kind of bike was she riding?

55
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,800
She was riding a...

56
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,639
Just a mountain bike.

57
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,279
Look, there's a residential area over there.

58
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,680
And there's a mall over there.

59
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,600
If I were the bag snatcher, I'd definitely go to the mall.

60
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
Because there are more people.

61
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
Towards the mall, a woman with an injury on her left hand.

62
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,800
How about it? Nothing valuable in the bag, right?

63
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,079
Not really.

64
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,000
Just some important data on the phone.

65
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,800
Do you have a backup?

66
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,399
Can I borrow your phone for a moment?

67
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,319
Hey, Xiao Su

68
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,959
I lost my phone, can you help me handle it?

69
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,959
Okay

70
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,560
My colleague said they can help me retrieve it from the cloud

71
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,680
That works

72
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,759
Last time in Eagle State, I helped you once

73
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,959
Today you helped me once

74
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,360
We're even now

75
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,839
Wait a minute, wait a minute

76
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,279
I ran around for you because of this

77
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,240
You should at least say thank you

78
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,759
Fine, forget I said anything.

79
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,439
Is your hand okay?

80
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,600
It's fine, just a scratch.

81
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,000
That guy has some skills.

82
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,480
In terms of reaction and observation skills,

83
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,959
combat ability and analytical skills,

84
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,040
almost no one on our team can match him.

85
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,240
When I shook hands with him just now,

86
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
his palms were covered in calluses.

87
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,600
They must be from long-term training.

88
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,279
He doesn't seem like a lazy person.

89
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,879
or a petty legal advisor.

90
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,279
More importantly,

91
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,360
he,

92
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,199
he must have realized I am a woman just now.

93
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
So when we were sparring,

94
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,360
he hesitated for a moment.

95
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,399
He didn't strike.

96
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,639
Let's observe more.

97
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,439
Really, there's no need to look, boss.

98
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,240
Look, it's just a scratch.

99
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,399
I wasn't talking about you.

100
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,439
I'm going to change clothes.

101
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,319
Thank you, boss.

102
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,759
Thank you, boss.

103
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,480
Boss, there's a situation.

104
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,360
Boss, he blocked the screen.

105
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,360
It's okay.

106
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,720
Continue monitoring the communication content on his phone.

107
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,159
One week later.

108
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,639
We need to send a gift to headquarters.

109
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,320
A gift heavier than what we gave to Jiateng Longqi.

110
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,360
It turns out to be a military-level confidentiality procedure.

111
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay.

112
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,320
Alright

113
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,159
The time is

114
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,799
3 AM every day

115
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,639
The duration is

116
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,759
Ten minutes each time

117
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,440
Boss intercepted an image

118
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,159
This date

119
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,320
isn't it next Monday?

120
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,799
I have an urgent situation to report.

121
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,320
Alright, go ahead.

122
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,799
By the way, the actor just obtained

123
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,679
the action plan and timing for this SAD operation.

124
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,799
Okay.

125
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,080
You two have worked hard. I'll head back to the office.

126
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,799
Noodles are here.

127
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,399
Thanks.

128
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:08,720
Old Wan

129
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,000
I knew you'd be here.

130
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,600
How was the inspection today?

131
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,799
Any issues?

132
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,159
What issues could there be?

133
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,879
You even had someone watch me.

134
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,360
Where did you find that kid?

135
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,360
He's as stubborn as you.

136
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,759
Old Wan

137
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,639
Boss

138
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:29,879
One bowl, please.

139
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,759
One bowl, please.

140
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,919
Spicy beef noodles.

141
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Extra chili oil.

142
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,279
Sure, no problem.

143
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,759
You always eat this?

144
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,919
Of course, I do.

145
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,039
Here, try this.

146
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
I made some braised dishes.

147
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,919
How is it?

148
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,360
It's okay.

149
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,480
It has to be.

150
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,039
You've always been bragging about your cured meat.

151
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,159
When will you let me try it?

152
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,759
Don't rush about the cured meat.

153
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,039
It has a special recipe.

154
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,279
Thanks, boss.

155
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,720
What's wrong? Work not going well?

156
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,519
What kind of work could I have?

157
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,519
Just messing around.

158
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,960
You might fool others.

159
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,879
But you can't fool this old soldier.

160
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
In this world,

161
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,200
some people just live

162
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,159
harder than others.

163
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,320
Take someone like you, for example.

164
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,559
What difficulties could you face?

165
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,840
It's not something we old folks

166
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,120
can even imagine.

167
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,879
Difficult.

168
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,279
As difficult as winning the lottery?

169
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,799
This...

170
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,440
Some things

171
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,919
you might not be able to tell me.

172
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,720
Some things you might not want to tell me.

173
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,279
But remember,

174
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,120
I am someone you can trust.

175
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,440
No matter what difficulties you face in the future,

176
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,639
as long as you are willing,

177
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,000
just charge forward.

178
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,279
Leave your back to me.

179
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:05,840
How about it?

180
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,440
Keep bragging.

181
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,279
What do you mean by bragging?

182
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,799
Let me tell you,

183
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,639
I don't ask for much,

184
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,679
I just hope that when I leave, I won't be so lonely.

185
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,960
Having you, my godson, by my side,

186
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,879
I just want to hear you call me

187
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,080
Dad.

188
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,320
Come on, call me Dad.

189
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,000
Then I really don't dare to eat this braised meat.

190
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,399
You're taking advantage of me so much.

191
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
What do you mean by taking advantage?

192
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
You brat,

193
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,360
You have no conscience.

194
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,480
Have I ever made you pay for those peach pastries?

195
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,639
And for eating these noodles,

196
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,080
When have I ever made you pay?

197
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,919
I understand, so this time, right?

198
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,000
Boss,

199
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
Check, please.

200
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:50,960
Alright,

201
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,559
With the little money you earn,

202
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,279
Boss, don't listen to him.

203
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,600
You can't take his money.

204
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,919
The usual rule.

205
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,879
It's really hard to get you to call me Dad.

206
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,600
You brat, you're really tight-lipped.

207
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,039
Come back, come back

208
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,840
Mom, why are you here?

209
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,200
Don't joke around with me.

210
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,120
Aren't you all supposed to work nine to five in the National Security office?

211
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,159
How come you've learned to come and go early and late?

212
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,720
What time is it?

213
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,080
If you are hiding something from me,

214
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,120
I won't forgive you.

215
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,120
Tell the truth, what were you doing so late?

216
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,240
Work.

217
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,399
Are you living together with this chubby guy?

218
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,480
How is that possible?

219
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,600
What are you thinking?

220
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,799
What do you mean, what am I thinking?

221
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,679
Then why do you sometimes not come home at night?

222
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,840
Where do you go?

223
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,919
You're just trying to fool me.

224
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,480
What's going on with you?

225
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,480
Come here.

226
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,519
Come here.

227
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,720
The usual rules, let's start.

228
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,599
Mom, you are a TV producer.

229
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,599
Not from the Discipline and Inspection Committee.

230
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,759
Are you doing it or am I?

231
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,279
Look, it's expired.

232
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,279
Look, this has been expired for several days.

233
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,680
Look

234
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,680
Two months

235
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,400
Can we still eat this after two months?

236
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:49,240
Expired food is not edible at all.

237
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,759
Come on, keep it coming. What is all this?

238
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,759
Cabbage, pork, carrots

239
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,200
Chicken, shrimp, dumplings

240
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,640
I feel guilty saying the word "frozen"

241
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,079
How long has it been

242
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,400
How long has it been

243
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,640
These colorful things look so nice

244
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,839
Nice

245
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,279
Can expired food be eaten?

246
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,519
It's all thrown away.

247
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,720
What's this?

248
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
This can't be thrown away.

249
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
This is the hard drive I need for studying.

250
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,880
You put the hard drive in the fridge to freeze?

251
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,079
Mom, I'm hungry.

252
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,680
I'm worried for you.

253
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,839
Hurry up, go, go, go.

254
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,160
Clean up your personal hygiene.

255
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,200
Go on, go on.

256
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:38,720
Hey, driver

257
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,559
Could you please get me some hot water?

258
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,799
Sure, sure

259
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,000
Your cup is quite big

260
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,319
Thank you, thank you, thank you

261
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,200
Just a moment

262
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,000
Here you go

263
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:51,559
Thank you, thank you

264
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,079
Careful, it's hot

265
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,599
Thank you, thank you, thank you

266
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,359
With this cup of hot water

267
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,799
I can stay awake tonight

268
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,920
It's the end of the month

269
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,279
I've been driving for a long time

270
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,880
I'm really tired

271
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,839
I totally understand

272
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,559
I used to drive a taxi too

273
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,799
It's fate, it's fate, it's fate

274
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Thank you so much

275
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,599
I didn't even buy anything from you

276
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,519
It's okay, it's okay

277
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,920
Next time, buy more drinks

278
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:12,839
Thank you, thank you

279
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,319
Alright, alright

280
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,000
Take care

281
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,519
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

282
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,559
If you get tired on the road, take a nap

283
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,559
Stay safe

284
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,319
Thank you

285
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,440
Let's eat

286
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,079
Aren't you eating?

287
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,880
I'm too angry to eat

288
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:26,960
I'm not eating

289
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,480
Why don't you stay here tonight?

290
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,519
Can anyone even stay in this messy place?

291
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,640
I'm really getting old

292
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,400
Did some work, I'm exhausted

293
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,400
I have things to do early tomorrow

294
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,720
I need to hurry back and sleep

295
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,880
Alright

296
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:45,640
Bye

297
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,839
Hurry up and go

298
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,200
Old lady

299
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,160
Let's not pick it up tomorrow

300
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,440
If the leader finds out

301
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,559
I'll lose my job

302
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,839
I won't pick up your money

303
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
It's enough for your son to get married

304
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,319
Alright, alright

305
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,960
If you fail again

306
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,720
someone will definitely come to get you

307
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,599
also

308
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,079
your family will join you on the journey

309
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
What are you doing? Stop!

310
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,319
Security! Security!

311
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,519
Someone ran inside!

312
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,680
Old man, come back quickly!

313
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:41,920
Don't run!

314
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,039
Stop!

315
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,079
Stop!

316
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,839
Stop!

317
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,279
Don't run!

318
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,519
Stop!

319
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,279
Stop!

320
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,400
Why are you running after them?

321
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,200
Old woman

322
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,240
Hello

323
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,000
Director, Shoulong is in trouble

324
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,079
Hello

325
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,559
The accident that occurred early this morning

326
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,000
has resulted in 3 deaths and 17 minor injuries.

327
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,039
After the accident, relevant leaders from the municipal committee and government

328
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,680
rushed to the scene immediately.

329
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,960
At the scene, firefighters discovered

330
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,839
a couple responsible for waste disposal.

331
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,240
Before dying, the elderly man desperately protected his spouse beneath him.

332
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,279
The moment the two embraced

333
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,839
was forever frozen by the flames, bringing tears to one's eyes.

334
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,039
According to relevant personnel,

335
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,880
this explosion

336
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,519
was caused by the explosion of a chemical factory storage tank.

337
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
The cause of the accident is still under further investigation.

338
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,000
"Blue One"

339
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,079
is gone just like that.

340
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,200
There must be something wrong here.

341
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,079
This explosion was caused by foreign personnel.

342
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,279
The police are currently investigating with full force.

343
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,359
We can only say to the public that it was

344
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,839
a storage tank explosion.

345
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:51,680
Mr. Lin

346
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,119
Foreign personnel

347
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,599
happened to coincide with our

348
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,720
server upgrade timing.

349
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,920
This arrangement

350
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,240
is known to only a few people in the entire group.

351
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,960
Only a few people, right?

352
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,119
Are you saying

353
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,559
that among those present, the ones with the authority to know

354
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,079
are all suspects, right?

355
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,720
What I mean is

356
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,400
whoever has been opposing our new energy project

357
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,079
is the most suspicious.

358
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,079
Vice President Jin

359
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,240
"Blue One" has encountered a problem.

360
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,160
You're not the only one worried.

361
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,359
I believe everyone here feels the same.

362
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,880
We all feel the same.

363
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,920
Mr. Lin

364
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,440
Since such a big incident has occurred,

365
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,119
the Shapeng people will definitely take advantage of it.

366
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,319
I suggest

367
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,720
finding a reason to postpone the negotiations.

368
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,680
You are still thinking about canceling it.

369
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:39,200
You

370
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,079
Don't we know what you are thinking?

371
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,960
What benefit do you get from canceling it?

372
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,079
You're just arguing for the sake of arguing.

373
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,319
Enough.

374
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,160
Everyone here knows

375
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,799
"Azure One"

376
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:54,160
is a major confidential scientific project developed by our group under the commission of the state

377
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,279
is a major confidential scientific project

378
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:00,039
The supervising leaders have already specified

379
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,759
that on December 20th at the international summit

380
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,720
we will announce to the world

381
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:08,359
Deputy Mayor Jiang has also given us a military order

382
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,160
If we can't get through this crisis now

383
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:13,240
then Shoulong Group

384
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,599
That's the end of the road.

385
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,519
Immediately activate the emergency plan

386
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,720
Jinchuan

387
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,680
Lead the technical department to cooperate with the fire department

388
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,160
Conduct a thorough inspection of the factory area

389
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,480
Check for any remaining flammable or toxic materials

390
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,839
Okay

391
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,880
Jianguo

392
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,759
Coordinate with the public security department

393
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,440
Conduct a thorough investigation into the cause of the accident

394
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,480
Got it

395
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,400
Your legal department

396
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,559
Must handle the compensation for injured employees and their families

397
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,799
Yes, yes

398
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,680
Is everyone clear?

399
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,880
Clear

400
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,200
Meeting adjourned

401
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,240
Mr. Lin, are you okay?

402
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,240
Mr. Lin

403
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:13,839
It's an old problem.

404
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,119
You are

405
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,920
I am the new lawyer from the legal department.

406
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,000
My name is Zheng Qi.

407
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,839
Okay, okay.

408
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,839
Why does it smell so strongly of herbal medicine?

409
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,200
Director Zhao, this is yours.

410
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,279
Hmm.

411
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,680
What's wrong with you?

412
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,119
I'm preventing illness before it happens.

413
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,720
Your stomach is still not well.

414
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,279
I'm

415
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,039
preventing potential illness.

416
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:53,319
So you're just looking for trouble when there's none?

417
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,480
I understand, I understand.

418
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,160
This is just like what you always tell us.

419
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,519
We need to make plans in advance.

420
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,119
You're being cautious in times of peace.

421
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,759
The leader didn't teach you to flatter like this.

422
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,240
Is everyone here?

423
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,960
Let's start.

424
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,599
The public security department has intervened in the explosion case at the Shoulong factory.

425
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,039
Because the initial investigation involves foreign organizations and personnel.

426
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,759
The comrades from public security

427
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,519
have already reported the foreign-related clues to us.

428
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,400
Is there any abnormal situation?

429
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,079
This is before the explosion.

430
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,200
Some footage from the surveillance sent back to the cloud.

431
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,480
Rod

432
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,440
We asked the relevant departments to conduct a screening.

433
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,279
This person is indeed Rod.

434
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,079
His family received help from SAD

435
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,559
and successfully emigrated abroad using refugee policies.

436
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,960
But he himself was deported several times for illegal immigration.

437
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,400
It should be from that time

438
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,720
that he started working for SAD.

439
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,640
What is he holding in his arms?

440
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,640
Look at this shape.

441
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,119
It should be a drone.

442
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,400
The important thing is

443
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,359
the timing of this drone's takeoff.

444
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,720
The Shoulong factory area

445
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,240
has always had very strict blocking measures.

446
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,920
But because of a system upgrade this past week,

447
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
there is a ten-minute break every day.

448
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,480
And the specific time of the break

449
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,599
is only known to Shoulong's core executives.

450
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,279
This drone

451
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,160
took off right at the beginning of the break.

452
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,920
But because we received the information in advance

453
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,559
and informed the Shoulong Group,

454
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,079
they changed the break time.

455
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:23,640
So this drone couldn't fly in.

456
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,559
The timing was too precise.

457
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,839
Then Li Ge must have planted a mole in Shoulong.

458
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,759
This mole's level should not be low.

459
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,039
Didn't the actor say before

460
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,079
that they should execute this plan a week later?

461
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,240
to carry out this plan?

462
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,799
Could it be

463
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,920
that this was a trap set by Li Ge from the beginning?

464
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,839
Then wouldn't our actors be in danger too?

465
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,720
It seems now

466
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,400
someone wants to catch a turtle in a jar.

467
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,960
Why don't we stay the same to adapt to all changes?

468
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,799
Let's take this opportunity to observe

469
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,279
and see what forces are fishing in troubled waters behind the scenes.

470
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,039
Oh no, it's burnt.

471
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:12,960
Oh

472
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,960
How is it?

473
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:34,119
Did you enjoy the fireworks show?

474
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,160
It was quite good.

475
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,960
You should have received the email from headquarters by now.

476
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,119
Sorry about that.

477
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,160
Made you busy for nothing these days.

478
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,319
When did you plant someone here?

479
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,920
Didn't you also send someone to Yingzhou to cooperate with me?

480
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,599
There's a saying

481
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,119
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

482
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,200
What you did is called

483
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,119
Seeking revenge for every slight.

484
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,079
"Blue One" is already destroyed.

485
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,480
Your office is useless now.

486
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,640
Matt,

487
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,680
This is my territory.

488
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,720
Everything you know about this place

489
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,799
was imagined by foreign media for you.

490
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,240
You want to bring down the Chinese.

491
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,200
You don't understand internal and external coordination.

492
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,599
It's like playing with fire and getting burned.

493
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,039
So now I sincerely invite you

494
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,839
to treat this explosion

495
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,680
as an opening ceremony.

496
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,720
Let's make money together.

497
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:24,960
Since when do you get to decide how the money is split?

498
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:31,640
Your greed has kept you from understanding one thing.

499
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,759
Clearly, I helped you out of a tight spot.

500
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,119
You really think you're useful.

501
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,960
Do you think you have the right to negotiate?

502
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,759
Call everyone up.

503
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,640
This newly written article.

504
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,640
Have a few influencers quickly repost it.

505
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,839
All official accounts.

506
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,480
Repost all these explosive images.

507
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,559
Old Yang, Old Yang, Old Yang.

508
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,759
Did you buy the trending search?

509
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,160
Have you contacted those MCN companies?

510
00:30:59,279 --> 00:30:59,960
Currently contacting them.

511
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,759
Shoulong is in complete chaos.

512
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,559
Sis.

513
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,319
You say you are working so diligently.

514
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,440
I just want to know if you are doing it for me.

515
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,519
Boss.

516
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,119
Weren't we supposed to act a week later?

517
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,440
Isn't this a bit sudden?

518
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,440
Sudden?

519
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,559
If I weren't so sudden.

520
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,039
How could I know.

521
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,039
There is a mole in the company.

522
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,039
Do you know why I like this fish?

523
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,000
It is naturally fierce.

524
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,680
Starting from the juvenile fish's tooth-growing phase,

525
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:58,039
throughout the process of becoming an adult fish,

526
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,599
they exhibit mutual biting behavior.

527
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,319
To make them grow bigger,

528
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,279
and live longer,

529
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,480
I have to remove their sharp teeth.

530
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,079
Pull them out one by one

531
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,559
You try it

532
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,640
Me

533
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:20,720
It's poisonous.

534
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:28,039
Boss, let me try

535
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,519
Sure

536
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,519
Okay

537
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:51,839
Relax, why are you so tense?

538
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,079
But you need to be careful.

539
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,440
If you get bitten by this fish's poisonous fangs,

540
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,319
it could be fatal.

541
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,759
I pulled out its teeth

542
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,759
so that they

543
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,440
can grow bigger and live longer

544
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,440
to eventually be served on my table

545
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,200
Hello everyone, I am reporter Dong Dong

546
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:38,720
The explosion at the Shoulong factory produced a large amount of harmful gas

547
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:41,000
It quickly spread, causing secondary disasters in the surrounding area

548
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,519
Residents in the area clearly noticed an unusual smell in the air

549
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,200
They experienced discomfort in breathing and their bodies

550
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,319
The reporter learned from relevant ecological departments

551
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,640
The gas produced by the explosion is not lethally toxic

552
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,279
But it can still cause physical discomfort

553
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,720
Residents in the vicinity are advised

554
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,000
to go to the hospital early if they notice any abnormalities

555
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,400
What are you looking at

556
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,759
I am looking at the mole

557
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,039
Which eye of yours sees me as one

558
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,480
I think you look like one

559
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,200
No one should accuse anyone

560
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,280
It's still uncertain who is human and who is a ghost

561
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,199
bootlicker

562
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,880
Everyone, don't rush, we

563
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,679
Don't rush, don't rush

564
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Believe that our Xinshuai Group charity will help everyone

565
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,880
Line up properly, line up properly

566
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,840
Old Wan

567
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,480
Slow down, slow down

568
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,960
Thank you, first one

569
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,280
Slow down, slow down, slow down

570
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,639
Come, slow down, slow down, slow down

571
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,280
Alright, alright, slow down, slow down, slow down

572
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,760
Don't push, don't push

573
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,760
Okay, slow down

574
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,840
You slow down

575
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
Did you finish packing your things?

576
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,960
You don't know

577
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,840
Such a big thing happened last night

578
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,239
I couldn't sleep well all night because of it

579
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,639
When people don't sleep well, their memory gets worse

580
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,079
Wait

581
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,519
Lottery ticket, I forgot the lottery ticket

582
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,719
You're only going for two days, why take the lottery ticket?

583
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,639
No, no, no

584
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,320
Hurry up, hurry up and go

585
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:05,960
What if it wins?

586
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,119
Old Wan, why aren't you leaving yet?

587
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,239
No, I forgot the lottery ticket

588
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,920
I have to get the lottery ticket

589
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,079
Why bother with the lottery?

590
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,199
Even if you get it, you won't win.

591
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,239
Hurry up, let's go.

592
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:13,920
You know,

593
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,480
Huang Xi, watch your mouth.

594
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,719
Keep an eye on the settlement point, make sure nothing goes wrong.

595
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,039
Huang Xi

596
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,679
You

597
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,280
How are you? Are you okay?

598
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,199
I'm fine, I'm fine.

599
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,199
I'll come find you later.

600
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,159
Okay.

601
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,079
Thank you for your hard work, Master.

602
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:00,960
The channel number is three

603
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,199
All departments are unified

604
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,679
Although near the settlement point

605
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,559
many of our brother units are providing support

606
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:08,519
but stirring up trouble under the guise of charity

607
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,199
is the usual practice of the Xinchuan Charity Association

608
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:11,519
You should also keep a close watch

609
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,960
You eat.

610
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,079
Here's a tent for you.

611
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:19,559
Okay, thank you.

612
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:20,280
Come, Auntie, come.

613
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,719
Everyone, remember to wear your masks properly.

614
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,159
Is there anything wrong with your health?

615
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,280
If there is, we have a medical station.

616
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,559
Alright, sign here.

617
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,039
Little sister, why aren't you wearing a mask?

618
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,760
Look, the pollution is so severe now.

619
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,199
I'll make one for you.

620
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,960
Watch.

621
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,320
Everyone, come and see. Look.

622
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,400
Xinchuan Charity treats us well.

623
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,519
Everyone, clap, clap, clap, clap.

624
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,159
It's the right thing to do.

625
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
Our Xinchuan Charity,

626
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,719
will definitely implement disaster relief effectively.

627
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,000
We are definitely not putting on a show.

628
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,559
Thank you, thank you.

629
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,320
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

630
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,519
Come on, continue, continue.

631
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:53,320
Auntie, come.

632
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,400
Lin Xi.

633
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,679
We're here.

634
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,519
Yes.

635
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:04,199
The colleagues from the PR department have invited some journalists.

636
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,119
They want to take some photos of you representing our Shoulong Group.

637
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,000
Photos of the donated items.

638
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,079
Please take a look.

639
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,440
You go ahead.

640
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,199
Is it appropriate for me to go?

641
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,599
Aren't you part of Shoulong?

642
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,639
Yes.

643
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,679
You go ahead.

644
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,679
Understood.

645
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,199
President Lin.

646
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,719
Did you see that?

647
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:30,199
The one in the middle, the good dancer.

648
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,880
Arrange a meeting with her for me.

649
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,760
Understood.

650
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,360
Someone's been beaten to death.

651
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,679
Someone's been beaten.

652
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,679
Someone's been beaten to death.

653
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,920
So violent.

654
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,639
Let go, let go.

655
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,840
What is this? Did you take it?

656
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:50,960
President Lin, he stole our stuff.

657
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,760
Let go.

658
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,000
Uncle

659
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:58,920
Are you okay?

660
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:04,440
Do you know what you stole?

661
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,119
It's relief supplies for the disaster victims.

662
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:08,719
I know.

663
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,639
But I'm also a disaster victim.

664
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:13,440
Since these things are meant for us,

665
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,719
why can't I take them?

666
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,880
Everyone, isn't that right?

667
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,880
We can take them, we can take them.

668
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,679
But we need to take them in an orderly manner.

669
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,000
I see you're strong and healthy.

670
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,880
You're not someone who needs help.

671
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,559
You have hands and feet, waiting for others to feed you.

672
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,800
Do you have any ambition?

673
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,320
Come back.

674
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,719
Who are you calling unambitious?

675
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:34,920
Their Shoulong Group is incredible.

676
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,960
They can classify us into different ranks.

677
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,559
Why do you say I'm unambitious?

678
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,559
I say you're unambitious.

679
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,559
Why do you say I'm unambitious?

680
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
What's going on, what's going on, what's going on?

681
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,199
Everyone, you don't know who he is, right?

682
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,639
Let me introduce him to you.

683
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,159
This person

684
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,480
is the heir of Shoulong Group.

685
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,800
Lin Yasheng.

686
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,079
Are these supplies for us?

687
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,199
What else?

688
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,840
Everyone, take a look

689
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,800
at what they sent us

690
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:07,719
Cigarettes

691
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,159
What kind of things are these

692
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:10,119
Why

693
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,559
Do they think we haven't inhaled enough toxic smoke from the explosions

694
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,000
that they personally came to give us more

695
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,199
Isn't that right, everyone

696
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,920
Yes

697
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:17,920
What do you mean

698
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,239
Our Shoulong Group

699
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,639
is sincere towards everyone

700
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,119
We hope everyone understands

701
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,320
Understand more, understand more

702
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,159
Who understands you

703
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,039
Alright

704
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,440
Our Shoulong Group

705
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,559
How do we usually treat you

706
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,480
We have boosted the local economy

707
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,239
and supported many families

708
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,599
Today's supplies

709
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:37,199
Take them if you need them

710
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,480
If you don't need them, I'll take them all back

711
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,119
Don't go, don't let him go

712
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,519
What attitude is this

713
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:46,039
Go, go, go, what attitude

714
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,039
Go

715
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,039
What attitude, you can't leave

716
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:52,920
Look

717
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,000
Leave it to me

718
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:54,960
Hurry back

719
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,519
What attitude

720
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:58,079
What attitude

721
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:03,920
What's up?

722
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,280
Something happened over there. Go check it out.

723
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:06,159
I know.

724
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,159
How did you know I was here?

725
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,039
I guessed.

726
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,840
Over there.

727
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:11,519
Why are you following me?

728
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,039
A cigarette

729
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,239
I don't want it, okay?

730
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,719
I don't want it

731
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,000
I don't want it

732
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,599
It's broken

733
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,440
Run

734
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,440
Are you okay?

735
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,079
I'm talking about your watch

736
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,400
Go

737
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,679
Get up

738
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,480
Be gentle

739
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,320
Are you sure you saw him steal something?

740
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,840
Ah

741
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,840
I won't go over there

742
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:23,599
Why

743
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,320
So afraid to see the police, committed a crime?

744
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,639
I committed stupidity

745
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,719
I shouldn't have saved you from Yingzhou

746
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,039
Lin Yasheng, right?

747
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:33,360
Your attitude just now was also a problem, be careful

748
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,559
Take a look, sign here

749
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,400
Officer, this is what he stole

750
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,400
This is the evidence

751
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,960
Take a look, is it him?

752
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,480
That's right, it's him

753
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:42,559
And you are

754
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,639
I acted bravely for a just cause

755
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,400
Thank you for that

756
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,199
We'll take this back to the station as evidence

757
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,639
You guys wait over there for a moment

758
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:48,599
You, come here

759
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,840
Stand properly

760
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,519
What's your name?

761
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,400
Big companies are different

762
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:55,400
The cigarettes aren't cheap

763
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,840
That's right

764
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,800
After all, it's Shoulong's reputation

765
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,760
Can you buy cheap things to give?

766
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,239
Thank you

767
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,840
You are the one

768
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,440
Always giving us trouble

769
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,719
Some environmental organization that tarnishes Shoulong Group

770
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,320
Your Shoulong Group

771
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,599
Do I need to tarnish it?

772
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,679
What do you mean?

773
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:19,840
This car is nice

774
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,679
Where are you going?

775
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,079
Where I'm going is none of your business.

776
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,079
Just go.

777
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,199
Go.

778
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,480
Come, come, stand here.

779
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,840
Er Bing, it's nothing.

780
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,239
Brother Tiger just wants to ask you for a favor.

781
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,920
Brother Tiger, I really don't want to do this anymore.

782
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,039
Don't worry.

783
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,880
Just go and see your old friend.

784
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,599
Here, Brother Tiger has something for you to hold.

785
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:57,159
What is this?

786
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,480
I don't want it.

787
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,119
Take it.

788
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,519
Keep this on you, understand?

789
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,639
If you do well, Brother Tiger will reward you.

790
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,079
If you don't, you'll be punished.

791
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,199
Got it?

792
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,000
Got it?

793
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,280
Got it.
