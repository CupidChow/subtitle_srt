Lin.

00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,000
Azure One is a national-level project.

5
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,400
Even top leaders
are keeping an eye on it.

6
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,520
If you negotiate like this with the Gapung,

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,740
(Deputy Mayor of Jincheng, Jiang Jianyue)

8
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,800
just dragging it out,

9
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,590
they might replace us with another company.

10
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,890
All our efforts over the past two years
will be wasted.

11
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,150
Deputy Mayor Jiang,

12
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,610
you know my temper.

13
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,310
These Gapung people

14
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,190
are clearly holding us by the throat.

15
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,590
I just can't accept that.

16
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,630
You've always been too stubborn in life.

17
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,240
That works for technology,

18
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,680
but running a business isn't that simple.

19
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,520
Start high, counter low.

20
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,680
Just make a small compromise.

21
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,630
When it comes to tech exchange,

22
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,910
there's still room for negotiation, right?

23
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,590
But the Gapung's intentions
are not that simple.

24
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,290
If we make concessions now,

25
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,360
there will be no way
to remedy it in the future.

26
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,770
Deputy Mayor Jiang

27
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,080
is also for the good of Shoulong Group.

28
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,190
Alright,

29
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,750
I'll give you one week.

30
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,870
Find out who leaked the information,

31
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,080
or keep negotiating with the Gapung.

32
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,220
I don't care

33
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,560
what choice Shoulong Group makes.

34
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,680
What I want is the result.

35
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,360
Otherwise, the consequences
are not something you can bear.

36
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,080
President Lin.

37
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,910
Just listen to advice.

Rock salt or sea salt
for Charcoal-Grilled Shrimp?

Rock salt or sea salt
for Charcoal-Grilled Shrimp?

41
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,190
How about next time we eat it,

42
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,830
I'll peel it and let you try?

43
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,630
Huo Min,

44
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,860
that day I biked over to test you.

45
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,910
You were pretending to play dumb?

46
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,840
Your acting skills

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,790
are really bad.

48
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,360
My acting is bad?

49
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,240
Ant.

50
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,710
Coming.

51
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,000
Based on Lin Yasheng's preferences,

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,870
which one would you pick?

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,400
That.

54
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680
If I were you, I'd choose this one.

55
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,390
Why? Is there a difference?

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,830
Lin Yasheng likes blue.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,240
You better start learning hard.

58
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,070
Colors are also very finely divided.

59
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,150
Be more mindful.

60
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,100
Huo Min.

61
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,280
I'm officially assigning you a task now.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,120
Starting now, you'll enter ShouLong Group

63
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,870
to uncover the mole
from Shura and SAD within the group.

64
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,360
Our task force will
fully support your mission.

65
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,470
From today, your code name will

66
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,510
change from actor to...

67
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,480
Wait, wait, hold on.

68
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,430
I hope you'll give me

69
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,400
a mighty and imposing codename, alright?

70
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,310
You're so resilient.

71
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,520
How about "Cockroach"?

72
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,080
Fine, that's fine.

73
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,120
You are so talkative.

74
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,480
Should be called "Cricket".

75
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
"Cricket" is also fine.

76
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,180
You can easily infiltrate enemy camp
and be so active.

77
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,300
How about "Flea".

78
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,490
"Flea".

79
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,430
What a terrible name!

80
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,390
No, no, let's...

81
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,120
He hates being in sunlight so much.

82
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,620
He should be called

83
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,070
"Earthworm".

84
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,160
Isn't that right, Boss?

85
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,270
Actually, I think they're all acceptable.

86
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Can't we just stop?

87
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,050
Can't we stop always...

88
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,240
There is a name.

89
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,430
I've got a name.

90
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,800
You will definitely like it.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,430
This belongs to you and your family.

92
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,450
Take good care of it.

93
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,680
Starting today, your codename is

94
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,180
"Thunderbolt".

95
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,510
Thunderbolt, copy that.

(Shoulong Group)

97

The Zhongjing Chip
is Azure One's Core Secret.

98
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,950
We control every piece of its data

99
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,720
within strict access limits.

100
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,560
But...

101
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,910
The Gapung people are using it

102
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,360
to negotiate terms with me at the table.

103
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,750
There's only one explanation for this.

104
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,800
It means someone

105
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,580
within our core senior management

106
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,890
leaked information.

107
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,630
President Lin is right.

108
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,510
We need to get to the bottom of this.

109
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,530
Otherwise, none of us will feel secure.

110
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,430
Our country entrusted us
with this critical task.

111
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,950
We've all signed binding pledges

112
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,480
and confidentiality agreements.

113
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,870
This isn't just an ordinary leak.

114
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,020
It's illegal to disclose
the country's core secrets

115
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,930
to overseas entities.

116
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,040
This is a serious crime.

117
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,040
Everyone involved in this matter

118
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,380
from top to bottom,

119
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,070
including myself,

120
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,570
must be thoroughly investigated.

121
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,480
We all must comply with
"Law on Guarding State Secrets".

122
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,720
Anyone who leaks
the Zhongjing Chip's secrets,

123
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,120
whether intentional or accidental,

124
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,280
will face legal consequences.

125
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,870
President Lin is right.

126
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,720
An incident like this

127
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,360
is a serious matter for Shoulong Group.

128
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,930
The investigation cannot be delayed.

129
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,510
I propose that

130
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,950
anyone involved in chip technology

131
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,480
must fully cooperate with the investigation.

132
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,310
Vice President Gao makes a valid point.

133
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,750
No matter who oversees

134
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,800
this investigation.

135
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,800
I hope everyone here

136
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,630
will cooperate unconditionally.

137
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,200
Investigation work is a thankless task.

138
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,030
President, let me handle it.

139
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,960
Let Lin Yasheng take charge.

140
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,030
Why does it have to be me?

141
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,120
I don't need your approval.

142
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,870
But my position...

143
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Save the pointless talk.

144
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,560
Alright,

145
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,360
I can investigate.

146
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,240
But I get one thing straight.

147
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,480
I'm not like President Lin.

148
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,000
He's kind and forgiving.

149
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,840
When I handle things,

150
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,750
I'm impartial and unyielding.

151
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,550
Within a week,

152
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,720
you must give me the results.

153
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,960
Meeting's over.

154
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,060
(Shoulong Group)

155
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,820
(VIPER)

156
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,000
Seems that President Gao won't take my call.

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,960
You...

158
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,270
Didn't we agree?

159
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,360
You're supposed
to answer my calls immediately.

160
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,420
Did you forget?

161
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,030
Stop coming to my house casually.

162
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,870
I'm not as casual as President Gao.

163
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,120
Your wonderful performance last time.

164
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,510
Your wife hasn't seen it, right?

165
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,590
You...

166
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,390
Gao,

167
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,390
who is this person?

168
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,240
It's nothing.

169
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,000
Go back to sleep first.

170
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,720
What exactly happened?

171
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,200
I told you to go back.

172
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,550
Go inside.

173
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,790
Now, the Azure One base

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,960
has been classified top secret.

175
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,240
Last time, I barely managed to get

176
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,630
the gap time for upgrading Azure One.

177
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,380
But you guys actually made such a big scene.

178
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,080
Now, Lin Yasheng

179
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,600
is someone who plays by his own rules.

180
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,480
If you need more information,

181
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,270
I really can't do anything more.

182
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,080
Last time, to meet President Gao's demands,

183
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,670
we ended up losing a life.

184
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,080
If you can't meet my demands now,

185
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,600
you'll have to pay me with your life.

186
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,510
Matt, you...

187
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,750
Seems President Gao's forgotten

188
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,960
the fate of the person
who slept beside you last time.

189
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,510
Fine.

190
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,030
My biggest obstacle right now is Jin Chuan.

191
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,030
If you can take him down.

192
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,800
Got it.

193
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Goodnight.

194
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,790
Sit down!

195
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,540
(Six months ago, a Southeast Asian country)

196
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,600
I love you.

197
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,030
Thank you. Goodbye.

198
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,320
I want to stay with you tonight.

199
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,240
No.

200
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,150
I want.

201
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,030
No.

202
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,960
Get out!

203
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,240
The girl was pushed out.

204
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
What do we do now?

205
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,750
It's your turn.

206
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,440
Faith is a prime.

207
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,840
Who's there?

208
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,910
House keeping.

209
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,240
Sir, this bottle of soda

210
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,120
prepared especially for you
by the house keeping.

211
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,510
Come in, please.

212
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,790
President Gao,
you're indeed still vigorous in your old age.

213
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,390
How much do you want?

214
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,320
Relax, President Gao.

215
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,630
I guarantee this matter
won't spread domestically.

216
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,270
Nor will it reach Shoulong Group.

217
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,870
Who exactly are you?

218
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,840
What exactly do you want?

219
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,300
In recent years, Shoulong Group

220
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,840
has been shifting to new energy.

221
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,270
As someone from traditional energy,

222
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,480
you're bound to be marginalized, right?

223
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,670
We're all just doing our part.

224
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,270
Vice President Gao's contributions
to Shoulong

225
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,750
over the years are obvious to all.

226
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,000
But that's all in the past now.

227
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,870
Otherwise, how could a Vice President

228
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,080
attend such an insignificant seminar?

229
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,790
In the future, on the new energy track,

230
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,750
will there still be a place for you?

231
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,270
I've already fulfilled my historical mission.

232
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,670
Never thought about it.

233
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,480
Never thought about changing tracks?

234
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,080
Why not bring your experience at Shoulong

235
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,440
and join SAD as a consultant?

236
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,600
Let me be honest with you,

237
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,390
Shoulong Group is the result of

238
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,790
twenty years of hard work
by Lin Shoulong and me.

239
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,550
No matter what the terms you offer,

240
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,000
I'll never leave Shoulong.

241
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,150
I understand
President Gao's loyalty to Shoulong.

242
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,150
But if I drop this major bomb,

243
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,670
do you think you can still stay in Shoulong?

244
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,120
It's just a matter of personal conduct.

245
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,420
At worst,

246
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,640
I get suspended.

247
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,570
How about this instead?

248
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,240
No need for suspension

249
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,080
and I'll keep your secret forever.

250
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,320
As long as you give me what I want.

251
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,670
What do you want?

252
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,360
Azure One.

253
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,120
That's absolutely impossible.

254
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,390
That's a crime.

255
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,910
It's treason!

256
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,960
President Gao,
you may misinterpret SAD's purpose.

257
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,080
Business operations have no ties to politics.

258
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,080
However,

259
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,000
when it comes to crime.

260
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,360
What are you going to do?

261
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,630
Faith is a prime.

262
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,910
Stop it!

263
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,600
You stop it!

264
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,000
Stop it now! Stop it!

265
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,720
I'm afraid you've committed this crime.

266
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,060
(Fresh Fruits)

267
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:06,060
(QingZhou Express)

268
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,880
Hello, teacher.

269
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,720
Hello.

270
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
What's the status of the other parts?

271
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,550
Customs checks are strict.

272
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,160
Some are still on the way.

273
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,810
Keep a close eye on it. No mistakes allowed.

274
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,520
Come in.

275
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,710
Mr. Kevin, can we start the class?

276
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,550
Yes, we can.

277
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,390
Alright.

278
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,940
(Chairman of Shura China region,
Wong Wai Shing)

279
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,830
I want you to stay in China
for the time being.

280
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,790
Make sure to win this through negotiation.

281
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,720
What if Shoulong refuses to cooperate?

282
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,700
We have already obtained some data,

283
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,690
but the core information
is still at Zhongjing Base.

284
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,960
If we don't find a way
to get the most crucial thing,

285
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,110
even if we can fool Lin Shoulong,

286
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,070
we can't deceive ourselves.

287
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,750
You need to prepare a backup plan.

288
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,550
Right now, I want you to act officially

289
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,700
and meet with the deputy mayor.

290
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,620
Have him put some pressure on Lin Shoulong.

291
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,240
Of course,

292
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,790
our team needs to pick up the pace.

293
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,640
If Lin Shoulong

294
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,000
still refuses to cooperate with us,

295
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,400
then we'll have to take it ourselves.

296
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,310
Then he has no reason to exist.

297
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,110
Sorry,

298
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,480
the food I cook myself

299
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,880
is only eaten by two kinds of people.

300
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,510
One is my guest.

301
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,960
One is my family.

302
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,590
Understood.

303
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,270
You know my father's health condition.

304
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,180
(Shoulong Group)

305
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,000
The entire Shoulong Group relies on him.

306
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,880
If anything happens to him,

307
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,270
what will happen to Shoulong Group?

308
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,310
Wait for him to come to you.

309
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,200
Should I move the hospital to our doorstep?

310
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,030
How about I set one up at Shoulong for you?

311
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,160
Young Mr. Lin,

312
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,070
the person has been brought over.

313
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,640
Who is she?

314
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,880
Forget it, forget it.

315
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,010
Young Mr. Lin,

316
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,340
it's me, Xiao Ya.

317
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,070
Don't you recognize me?

318
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,300
Are you still upset about

319
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,240
what happened with Han Yao?

320
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,440
Han Yao's issue has nothing to do with me.

321
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,820
I didn't want you to misunderstand me.

322
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,000
Shoo.

323
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,440
Young Mr. Lin,

324
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,960
busy right now?

325
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,110
Keep going.

326
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,160
- Young Mr. Lin.
- Step aside.

327
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,030
Young Mr. Lin.

328
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Why you're so clueless?

329
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,400
Which firm are you from? Hurry.

330
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,800
Keqing.

331
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,830
What you just saw

332
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,400
is not what you think.

333
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,960
That's your private matter.

334
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,480
It's none of my business.

335
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,790
I'm here to say goodbye.

336
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,240
Goodbye?

337
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,200
Where are you going?

338
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,000
Shoulong's PR crisis is resolved.

339
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,660
My work here is done.

340
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,480
As for your private matters, I can't help.

341
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,790
Keqing.

342
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,790
What do you mean my private matters?

343
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,550
You know what.

344
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,680
Your work isn't finished yet.

345
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
You can't leave unless I allow it.

346
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,590
And

347
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,270
from now on,

348
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,830
I am your private matter. Got it?

349
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,960
Lin Yasheng.

350
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,510
You're overthinking this.

351
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,550
Young Mr. Lin,

352
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,790
please mind your position.

353
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,590
Whether I leave or not isn't up to you.

354
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,410
Is it really that big of a deal
to jump off a building?

355
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,590
Are you out of your mind?

356
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,280
What are you talking?

357
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,920
Have something cold,
you need to calm down now.

358
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,550
Might even cure that stubborn heartache.

359
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,880
I must be crazy,

360
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,310
wasting time arguing with you here.

361
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,920
Just a rich man's problem, huh?

362
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,590
Always chasing after things

363
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,510
that money can't buy, isn't it?

364
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,510
How about you tell me?

365
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,720
And I'll give you some advice.

366
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,270
Here's a piece of advice for you.

367
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,510
Mind your own business
and you'll avoid trouble.

368
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,200
So you're asking for it?

369
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,270
In my world,

370
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,590
money solves everything.

371
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,670
Look, you're already loaded.

372
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,200
Keeping a girl shouldn't be hard.

373
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,840
I think

374
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,440
you can find her something to do.

375
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,750
Something important.

376
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,160
The more important, the better.

377
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,160
Seeing each other every day,

378
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,590
she'll naturally like you, right?

379
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,350
Eating, always eating.

380
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,510
Lin really found me a big task.

381
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,590
Then hurry up.

382
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,080
Tough enough to take hits?

383
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,400
I'm asking, can you take hits?

384
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,000
Again?

385
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,880
Young Mr. Lin, where were you?

386
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,070
Do you have any tissue?

387
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,910
No tissue here.

388
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,950
I'll go find some for you.

389
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,450
Young Mr. Lin.

390
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,350
Well done, I'll return it later.

391
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,800
Him.

392
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,350
Assign him to my investigation team.

393
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,680
And change his clothes immediately.

394
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,270
Starting today,

395
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,520
Huo Min will fully assist with investigation

396
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,600
about the leak incident.

397
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,510
Secretary Guo,
update us on the current progress.

398
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,030
(Azure One leak Analysis)

399
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,440
Within our group, eleven individuals

400
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,790
have access to

401
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,270
the core secrets of Azure One.

402
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,640
(Leak sources, External, Internal)
Six are administrative staff.

403
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,590
Five are technical staff.

404
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,310
We've worked tirelessly, day and night,

405
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,240
and conducted a thorough,
meticulous investigation.

406
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,760
The result is

407
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,510
none of them have any issues.

408
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,480
Have you checked everyone?

409
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,680
There are still two people left.

410
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,520
Who are they?

411
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,430
President Lin.

412
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,790
And Vice President Jin.

413
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,550
These two executives
haven't been checked yet.

414
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,440
Check them. They must be investigated.

415
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,480
I've said it before. No exceptions.

416
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,000
Young Mr. Lin,

417
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,930
actually, there are still two missing.

418
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,070
That's impossible.

419
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,070
We've done a thorough screening.

420
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,270
Don't speak hesitantly.

421
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,640
One is Gao Jianguo,

422
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,750
and the other is Bai Keqing.

423
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,640
Bai...

424
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,880
Miss Bai.

425
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,000
What's wrong with Miss Bai?

426
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,030
No, what I mean is

427
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,370
we don't have a valid reason,

428
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,160
so it's hard to investigate.

429
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,620
Here's the thing, Young Mr. Lin.

430
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,740
Vice President Gao has always
handled chemical and oil projects,

431
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,160
so he's been against spending a lot

432
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,700
on those new energy projects.

433
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,350
Based on this motive,

434
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,320
he's the most likely
to sabotage the negotiations.

435
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,370
Now, back to Bai Keqing,

436
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,550
before the incident happened,

437
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,960
she interviewed and investigated

438
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,510
some key technical staff.

439
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,590
So, I think

440
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,400
she could have accessed some secrets.

441
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,880
I suggest

442
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,790
we add both of them

443
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,640
to the investigation list.

444
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,400
So, should we check Miss Bai or not?

445
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,240
Check, we must check.

446
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,790
It has to be done.

447
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,590
Turn Shoulong upside down.

448
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,510
And I don't believe we can't find
who leaked the information.

449
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,270
Investigate me?

450
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Yes, Miss Bai.

451
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,880
You may not leave for now.

452
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,510
Huo Min,

453
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,160
I've always think you're quite extraordinary.

454
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,590
Miss Bai,
please don't make things difficult for me.

455
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,070
I'm just working for someone else.

456
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,840
Besides,
you signed confidentiality agreement.

457
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,510
Just cooperate a little, alright?

458
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,790
Tell me, who sent you?

459
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,740
No one sent me, really.

460
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,070
What's going on?

461
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,540
Who told you to bother Miss Bai?

462
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,960
It was you.

463
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,880
I asked this guy

464
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,790
to investigate the company's recent leak.

465
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,680
Who would've thought

466
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,510
he'd come looking into you?

467
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,880
Miss Bai, I don't suspect you.

468
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,140
I'm just following the routine.

469
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,000
Keep it professional.

470
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,270
Do you really want me to stay that much?

471
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,070
Just following the routine.

472
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,880
Seems I won't be leaving today.

473
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,500
Is that so?

474
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,530
Alright.

475
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,680
This is the recording
from the last interview.

476
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,030
Take your time with the investigation.

477
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,680
But at least let me know
what you're looking into.

478
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,510
Actually, we mainly want to check

479
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,510
if your interview

480
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,550
involved any actions
leading to leaks back then.

481
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,270
It's nothing much.

482
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,590
Keqing, how about we talk somewhere else?

483
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,000
Alright.

484
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,200
Keep an eye on my suitcase for me.

485
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,790
I've checked on Bai Keqing.

486
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,110
Nothing special about her.

487
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,930
The stuff she brought

488
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,520
is only enough for a quarter.

489
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,450
I think she doesn't plan
to stay in China long.

490
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,710
Also, that lady named Xiao Ya,

491
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,120
do you know Lin Yasheng
asked me to handle her?

492
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,470
Based on Lin Yasheng's character,

493
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,940
who knows what he might do.

494
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,350
Anyway, you guys keep an eye on it.

495
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,440
No need to remind us.

496
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,280
We've done all the dirty work
Lin Yasheng assigned to you.

497
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,830
Wow.

498
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,650
The organization is even covering gossip now?

499
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,250
Based on our background check,

500
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,830
Xiao Ya is sent by another foreign org.

501
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,310
to approach Lin Yasheng.

502
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,200
Is there any vinegar?

503
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,800
Why is everything so complicated?

504
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,030
To approach Lin Yasheng? Really?

505
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,920
How can they be so sure

506
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,350
that Lin Yasheng will date Xiao Ya?

507
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,810
Clearly, they've put in a lot of effort.

508
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,960
This woman has had cosmetic surgery.

509
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,030
Completely tailored to
Lin Yasheng's preferences.

510
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,640
Moreover, during this period,

511
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,090
his social accounts are flooded

512
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,450
with ads about this girl group.

513
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,200
It's hard for him not to notice.

514
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,160
Why don't we just send her abroad?

515
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,070
Then our task will be done, right?

516
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,550
Besides, Lin Yasheng

517
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,550
has always been Shoulong Group's eldest son.

518
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,790
He's seen more intelligence agents than me.

519
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,200
So, anyone getting close to him

520
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,270
and winning his trust

521
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,000
is definitely not as simple as it seems.

522
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,030
Enjoy your meal.

523
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,960
Everyone knows

524
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,310
the top ranking is the bluefin tuna.

525
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,590
Do you know what ranks second?

526
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,200
Just say what exactly are you investigating?

527
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,830
The negotiation with the Gapung
a few days ago

528
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,390
didn't go very smoothly.

529
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,720
That's because someone inside Shoulong Group

530
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,310
leaked critical data.

531
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,920
Although, it wasn't really vital information.

532
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,310
So,

533
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,400
my dad handed the issue over to me

534
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,960
to find out who leaked it.

535
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,550
So

536
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,830
do you think my dad sees me as someone

537
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,300
who are incapable of anything?

538
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,440
I actually think

539
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,920
he did this because he trusts you.

540
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,880
Your dad made many efforts
to run Shoulong.

541
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,640
He asked you to investigate,

542
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,240
because he doesn't trust anyone right now,

543
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,720
except you.

544
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,640
He believes that from the start,

545
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,310
I had nothing to do with Azure One.

546
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,640
That's why he trusts me.

547
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,840
You know what.

548
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,750
All my life, because of Shoulong,

549
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,160
everyone who approached me had a motive.

550
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,110
Either for money,

551
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,590
or for some so-called core secrets.

552
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,640
So I decided to stay far away from
these secrets.

553
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,550
Until I met you.

554
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,960
You're neither interested in those secrets,

555
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,750
nor in me, are you?

556
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,790
Who said I wasn't interested in?

557
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,000
Didn't you say it the first time we met?

558
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,160
What I want is

559
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,880
to use Shoulong to make my name in Xizhao.

560
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,510
Now she not only has earned
Lin Yasheng's trust,

561
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,590
but she has Lin Yasheng
firmly under her control.

562
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,750
Let me put it this way.

563
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,030
If Lin Yasheng is a little wolf dog,

564
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,510
then she's definitely the trainer.

565
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,400
Hope we're overthinking.

566
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,720
But if she's an enemy,

567
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,680
this could be a dangerous trend.

568
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,200
When Azure One is unveiled,

569
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,880
it'll surely shake the world.

570
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,270
By then, every report

571
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,240
will come directly from you.

572
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,480
Are you willing to stay for this?

573
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,720
So you want me

574
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,960
to openly take advantage of you?

575
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
If it's you.

576
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,510
I'm willing.

577
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,720
Ya Sheng.

578
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,590
Why bring yourself such bitter hassle?

579
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,270
It's sweet.

580
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,830
Young Mr. Lin.

581
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,960
Young Mr. Lin.

582
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,830
Something big has happened.

583
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,720
Go inside, go inside.

584
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,830
Let me tell you,

585
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,440
Jin Chuan has been anonymously reported.

586
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,480
I found this letter this morning

587
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,310
in the complaint box.

588
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,110
The letter says Jin Chuan

589
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,110
often gathers old employees

590
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,110
for meals,

591
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,880
and talks nonsense after drinking.

592
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,230
Starting today,
cancel the anonymous complaint box.

593
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,630
Switch it to real-name reporting.

594
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,000
For all real-name reports,

595
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,550
I'll offer a reward.

596
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,590
Assign Huo Min to check

597
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,710
and make sure to find something.

598
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,590
Got it.

599
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,760
I hate being led by the nose.

600
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,680
Vice President Gao.

601
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,710
Hello, I'm Huo Min from investigation team.

602
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,110
Hello, Huo.

603
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,200
Here.

604
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,360
Well, you're personally getting involved?

605
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,110
Our Shoulong Group

606
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,510
is the foundation built by a small team

607
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,670
step by step.

608
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,480
Now, we're moving into a new phase.

609
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,510
So, all our resources and talents

610
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,840
are prioritized for the new energy sector.

611
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,710
So, when major issues arise,

612
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,320
I have to personally step in.

613
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,340
So during the negotiations with Gapung,

614
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,400
you were there, right?

615
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Of course, I was there.

616
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,600
Do you think

617
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,400
that I'm the prime suspect

618
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,400
for the data leak this time?

619
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,320
No, not at all.

620
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,440
My opinion doesn't matter.

621
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,480
Sounds like you're hinting at something.

622
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,220
But it's fine on my side.

623
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,880
If you need any documents,

624
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,880
just ask my secretary to get them.

625
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,390
Alright.

626
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Zhang,

627
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,880
I'll leave this to you.

628
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,720
Okay.

629
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,190
We veteran technicians here

630
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,150
have generational skills.

631
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,630
You could say it's passed down generations.

632
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,070
Vice President Gao, let me interrupt.

633
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,800
What's difference between Azure One facility

634
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,760
and these factories.

635
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,400
Safety measures are all the same.

636
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,070
However,

637
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,400
you haven't met President Jin yet, have you?

638
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,030
No. What's wrong with him?

639
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,630
Oh, it's nothing.

640
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,710
President. Jin has always been engaged
in scientific research.

641
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,230
He's been hiding in his ivory tower.

642
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,070
The explosion occurred this time.

643
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,630
He also blames himself.

644
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,230
So he started drinking again
after years of abstinence.

645
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,550
And now

646
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,000
he drinks at every occasion
and gets drunk every time.

647
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,280
I'm worried about him,
and afraid he's too impulsive.

648
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,000
Honestly, I think

649
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,360
his obsession with Azure One

650
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,150
runs far deeper than with Shoulong.

651
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,360
Let's take another look around.

652
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,200
Okay.

653
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,110
This way, please.

654
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,000
Does President Jin often visit here?

655
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,030
Yes.

656
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,230
He comes here quite often.

657
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,510
Every time President Jin comes,

658
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,840
he sits in this private room.

659
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,670
- Okay, keep busy.
- Have a seat.

660
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,840
Alright, thank you.

661
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,070
Something's up.

662
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,880
Go and get a ladder.

663
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,030
What is this?

664
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,070
A network camera.

665
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,690
Real-time remote transmission is possible.

666
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,360
Hook it to the computer and check.

667
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,200
Okay.

668
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,550
(Camera)
Once Azure One is completed.

669
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,400
Gao Jianguo, Lin Yasheng.

670
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,070
Kick them all out.

671
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,000
Then Shoulong Group will be ours.

672
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,920
(Jin's identity uncertain)
New arrivals.

673
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,780
Price to be estimated.

674
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,440
Find a way to get the exact price.

675
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,360
Xiaolong, Danni.

676
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,920
Find all information related to Jin Chuan.

677
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,110
Review it carefully.

678
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,000
- Got it.
- Got it.

679
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,940
(Verify if Jin Chuan is Shura's mole.
Pull him in if needed.)

680
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,760
Don't let the teacher see.

681
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,260
Go, play by yourself.

682
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,280
Homework's not done yet.

683
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,760
What are you running out for? Go back.

684
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,720
Boss.

685
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,150
Operation Annihilation is counting down.

686
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,800
We don't have much time left.

687
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,110
Don't worry.

688
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,630
Everything is under control.

689
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,960
Are all the components in place?

690
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,880
The map of the Zhongjing Base Laboratory.

691
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,360
Have you verified its authenticity?

692
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,590
Everything is in hand.

693
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,510
Complacency is our greatest enemy.

694
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,480
It'll expose your weakness.

695
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,320
Even if the mission succeeds,

696
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,030
thoughts like that shouldn't exist.

697
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,100
The moment you stepped into this field,

698
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,840
peaceful days became a thing of the past.

699
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,720
Got it.

700
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,880
Prepare well.

701
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,590
Don't worry, boss.

702
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,950
Next, please.

703
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,070
Pack four A meals.

704
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,590
Zhuzhu.

705
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,920
Four A meals, one without milk.

706
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Okay.

707
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,710
Four A meals, one without milk.

708
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,000
These are yours.

709
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,840
Okay, thank you.

710
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,070
Why isn't that guy queuing?

711
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,920
Why isn't that guy queuing?

712
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,030
Got a problem?

713
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,680
Nothing.

714
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,320
`Pay for it.

715
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,550
- Everyone.
- Lawyer Huo.

716
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,480
Thanks for hard works.

717
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,400
Come on, Young Mr. Lin treats us some food.

718
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,320
That's nice.

719
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,160
I haven't eaten yet.

720
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,880
Come, have a seat.

721
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,840
Young Mr. Lin's treat feels so basic.

722
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
At least we have food.

723
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Why are you so picky?

724
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,760
Exactly.

725
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,600
Let me say something.

726
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,960
About the video,

727
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,800
everyone needs to take it seriously, got it?

728
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,710
It's not a joke.

729
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,440
If we mess it up,

730
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,320
this might be our last meal at Shoulong.

731
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,390
Ah!

732
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,190
Just joking.

733
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,360
Oh, come on.

734
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,710
But the rough words make sense.

735
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,320
- Work hard.
- Got it, got it.

736
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,360
- Where's Lawyer Zheng?
- Not here.

737
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,190
Probably reporting to Young Mr. Lin.

738
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,190
What's going on?
Just mentioned it and it's out.

739
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,920
Who left such an important thing here?

740
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,360
Forgot in the rush. I'll put it away.

741
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,550
Who told you to pocket it?

742
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,550
Keep it inside.

743
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,400
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

744
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,960
See, how hard it is to find clues?

745
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,110
My hands are even like this.

746
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,630
Can't you count this as a work injury?

747
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,060
I haven't settled the score with you.

748
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,430
Did you pay for breakfast?

749
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,040
Found it!

750
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,710
Somalia.

751
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,880
This address is obviously fake.

752
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,150
We have to examine the camera itself.

753
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,940
(Camera)

754
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,200
(Bai Keqing, 34, Senior PR Planner)

755
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,030
Hello.

756
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,510
The cashier's over here.

757
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,240
Okay.

758
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,490
(Restricted, No Warehouse Entry)

759
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,190
Huo Min.

760
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,070
Why are you coming out from inside?

761
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,440
Going after her.

762
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,480
She's mad at me, we argued.

763
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,480
You two.

764
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,600
Hello.

765
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,820
(Tang Tang)

766
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,550
Miss Tang, right?

767
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,590
I'm Bai Keqing.

768
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,510
Hello.

769
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm kind of Huo Min's...

770
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,120
- Colleague.
- Colleague.

771
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,360
Alright, you two go ahead.

772
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,030
Seems you've got a long way to go.

773
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,510
Alright,
what do you want to eat or drink today?

774
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,360
It's on me.

775
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,480
Alright.

776
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,960
Thanks for that.

777
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,550
I've heard about the Jin Chuan issue.

778
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,550
A bit rash.

779
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,630
Better double-check everything.

780
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,070
So, you mean

781
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,050
Jin Chuan isn't like that?

782
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,000
I've interviewed him before.

783
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,510
We didn't talk for long,

784
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,270
but he's not the type
to make low-level mistakes.

785
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,420
Top talents in the public relations
is indeed different.

786
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:38,750
Really sharp eye for people.

787
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,960
Public relations and public security.

788
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,030
