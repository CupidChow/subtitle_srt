(Video 6)
Footage can't be retrieved right now.

6
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,700
Need to quickly assess the situation inside.

7
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,980
What about the actor?

8
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,740
Connection lost.

9
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,820
The last update told us

10
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,740
they were at Lavande Hotel.

11
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,980
Can we ask the higher-ups
to try one last contact?

12
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,500
They communicate on a single line.

13
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,220
Send him another message.

14
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,220
No one will know what it means.

Open it.

18
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,180
Open it.

19
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,420
Hold it!

20
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,320
Check the message. Open it!

What does this mean, huh?

24
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,700
Sister,

25
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,540
I don't know why.

26
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,620
After all these years,

27
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,060
it's only now I realize there's someone

28
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,460
working as a police mole around me.

29
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,510
- No, no.
- Alright.

30
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,600

We've finished cleaning up.

35
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,860
Don't leave yet.

36
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,820
Boss, I'm heading there now.

37
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,470
Group B,
everyone to the garden to assist Actor.

38
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,710
Tech team stays behind.

39
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,010
- Copy that.
- Understood.

40
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,140
I'm moving up now.

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,660

Stop!

44
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,180
Help! Somebody help!

45
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,940
Go.

46
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,280
Well,

47
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,960
you're a police officer.

48
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,450
Is it worth it for you to risk so much?

49
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,420
Promise me...

50
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,020
You'll help me catch Li Ge.

51
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,220
And also...

Hello, hello, hey!

- Han Yao!
- Hello.

56
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,780
Can you hear me?

57
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,400
Why is it so noisy over there?

58
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,090
Hey, is the signal bad? Hello?

59
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,140

(Lavande Hotel)

61
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,420
What's going on? Did they arrest someone?

62
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,940
National Security cars?
There really are spies.

64
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,740
Boss.

65
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,660
Everyone been screened?

66
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,660
All has been evacuated.

67
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,740
Worked with Public Security,

68
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,860
we screened everyone in the hotel.

69
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,580
So far, no sign of Yang Xiaoyi or Li Ge.

70
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,020
What about before the police lockdown?

71
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,500
Could they have slipped away?

72
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,700
There was a 15-minute blind spot
before we breached the firewall.

73
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,820
Could they have run then?

74
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,330
We checked the hotel surveillance.

75
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,300
Only a small group

76
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,570
and a band left early.

77
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,510
Pull up it for me.

78
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,420
(Camera09)

79
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,460
We've thoroughly checked these people.

80
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,100
They're not Li Ge or Yang Xiaoyi.

81
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,740
Have info on this band?

82
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,340
Mantis, get the band's info from the hotel.

83
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,140
The manager said
this is the hotel's house band.

84
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,700
Why does a brass band have a double bassist?

85
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,020
Sister, are you okay?

86
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,900
Are you okay?

87
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,620
Thank you.

88
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,460
You're welcome.

89
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,060
No tails, right?

90
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,180
No tails.

92
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,380
Grab the money.

93
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,820
Grab the money!

94
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,140
Okay.

95
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,900
Let's go.

96
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,440

98
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,060
The target is heading west on Dali Road.

(Jincheng, Xizhao)

100
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,740
Copy that.

101
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,580
Found it.

102
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,620
Spotted it ahead.

103
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,620
Boss, we've located the target vehicle.

104
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,060
Track or intercept? Awaiting orders.

105
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,540
Is anyone in the car?

106
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,500
Something's off. One is missing from the car.

107
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,980
Stay on them.
Notify the action team for backup.

108
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,820
Got it.

109
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,980
(HongXing Express)

110
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,180
This path leads out of Xizhao.

111
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,700
But if they take the upper route,

112
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,220
they'll must pass through a checkpoint.

113
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,130
Taking the lower route leads to
a deserted factory with complex terrain.

114
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,340
Based on the time,

115
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,500
this spot is most appropriate.

116
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,940
They're just throwing us off.

117
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,460
Mantis, notify the Public Security.

118
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,380
Understood.

119
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,500
Everyone, gather immediately.

120
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,920
Hello, Captain Li.

121
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,660
Crime scene on the provincial road
leading out of Xizhao.

122
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,500
Request for backup.

123
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Attention all teams.

124
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,620
Confirmed that
Li Ge is fleeing towards South Village.

125
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,750
All units, move out now.

126
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,340
Surveillance shows

127
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,260
Li Ge's car last appeared in this area.

128
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,690
But this is a blind spot for cameras.

129
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,900
Terrain here is quite complex.

130
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,020
Flexible to attack or defend.

131
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,980
We must avoid alerting the enemy.

132
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,940
Split up and move.

133
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,380
Report suspicious targets immediately.

134
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,220
- Got it.
- Got it.

135
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,250
Seriously?

136
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,500
This remote place, at midnight?

137
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,100
Someone still orders food deliveries?

138
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,130
When people are anxious, they get restless.

139
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,140
Don't you crave something to eat
when you're restless?

140
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,940
Hello, ma'am, excuse me.

141
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,700
Delivery here, I'm on the first floor.

142
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,500
Leave it at the door.

143
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,310
Okay.

144
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,660
Yang Xiaoyi.

145
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,100
Boss, we've locked on the target.

146
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,040
What's the next step?

147
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,400
Lu stays, Fei Jiang retreats.

148
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,540
Understood.

149
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,680
We've located the hallway.

150
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,380
But the exact room is still unclear.

151
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,740
The area doesn't have many residents,

152
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,100
but still be careful during arrest.

153
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,380
Send someone over first.

154
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,380
I'll go.

155
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,180
Boss, an unknown car is approaching you.

156
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,380
I knew it was you.

157
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,420
So, what's the situation inside?

158
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,140
We've located the hallway,

159
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,780
but the exact room is still unknown.

160
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,220
Need someone to check out.

161
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,260
I'll go.

162
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,740
If I find her, I'll talk to her.

163
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,940
I'll try to bring her out.

164
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,460
Let me handle it.

165
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,060
Be careful.

166
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,790
With the gun in your hand, I'm safer.

167
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,840
Thanks.

168
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,460
So it's you.

169
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,890
I knew something was off.

170
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,820
You lied to me.

171
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,100
You such a traitor.

172
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,900
Go check it out.

173
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,660
Boss.

174
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,180
I'm here to send you off.

175
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,500
Everyone below is my crew.

176
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,300
I really didn't expect

177
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,620
you're so loyal to Matt.

178
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,630
Things have escalated to this point.

179
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,620
Matt won't let me go.

180
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,460
Boss.

181
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,340
You know me well.

182
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,820
I only want money. I just love money.

183
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,340
Name your price.

184
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,420
I've spent quite some time
at public welfare association these years.

185
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,620
I know the annual expenses inside out.

186
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,500
But now that you're running away, I'm stuck.

187
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,340
How much?

188
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,660
Twenty million.

189
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,940
Deal.

374
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
You mean Han Yao?

375
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,980
I've looked into him before.

376
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,460
Before his debut, he was in Sin.

377
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,740
He closely tied to the Energy Association.

378
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,780
The Energy Association's real backer

379
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,220
or the boss behind it

380
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,100
is Matt exactly.

381
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,460
So, you mean

382
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,620
Han Yao is man of Viper (Matt).

383
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,800
And Li Ge has already started doubting him.

384
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,740
How about this.

385
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,060
I use this chance to push Han Yao out?

386
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,020
Go for it. Totally doable.

387
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,220
Got it.

388
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,940
Oh, by the way, Master.

389
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,060
Captain Luo seems to be investigating me.

390
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,900
I'm aware.

391
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,940
Approved by organization.

392
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,140
Use this chance
to sync intelligence with her.

393
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,270
She's actually helping you.

394
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,260
Guess I should thank her, huh?

395
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,820
Her investigation adds credibility to you.

396
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,140
Makes the enemy believe you.

397
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,820
What do you mean?

398
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,740
Confidentiality doesn't clash with awareness.

399
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,740
An unspoken understanding, got it?

400
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,700
Boss, intercepted a photo.

401
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,420
Look, here.

402
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,450
Huo Min just took this photo.

403
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,220
This date.

404
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,380
Isn't it next Monday?

405
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,460
Last night we found a photo

406
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,660
from Huo Min's phone.

407
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,620
Turns out he was also
on the subway last night.

408
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,940
He even spotted me there.

409
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,460
Boss,

410
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,380
hacker invaded
Lavande Hotel monitoring system.

411
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,580
Enemy is counter-surveilling.

412
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,420
Don't alert him.

413
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,860
Li Ge is setting a trap.

414
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,500
Perfect, just turn their trick against them.

415
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,260
Ensure our team is safe.

416
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,340
Got it.

417
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,300
Find Han Yao's phone number.

418
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,420
Got it.

419
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,660
Right, go with the flow and give him a nudge.

420
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,300
Send him another message.

421
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,380
No one will know what it means.

423
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,060
Only to try to take a risk.

424
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,780
Open it.

425
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,180

After all these years,

429
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,140
it's only now I realize there's someone

430
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,140
working as a police mole around me.

431
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,980
So you knew we were investigating you.

432
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,780
You deliberately shared intelligence with us.

433
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,540
Pleasure working with you, Captain Luo.

434
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,460
What about my watch?

435
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,940
Are you going to fix it?

436
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,140
That's work injury.

437
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,500
Alright, I'll cover it.

438
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,660
Alright then, from now on.

439
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,020
Luo Shanshan is your immediate supervisor.

440
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,680
Go report to the convenience store base.
Time to rejoin.

441
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,880
Immediate supervisor?

442
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,260
What about you, Master?

443
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,340
I'm getting older, my health can't keep up.

444
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,180
Having you all is enough.

445
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,180
By the way, when are you going home?

446
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,140
I'll go with you to visit your parents.

447
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,020
And your brother too.

448
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,020
Maybe in a few days.

449
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,820
I want to...

450
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,580

453
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,380
We're going home.

454
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,900
That's great, we're going home!

455

Two bowls of noodles.

459
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,140
Two bowls, got it.

460
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,740
What flavor?

461
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,340
Wan's favorite.

462
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,540
By the way,

463
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,620
Wan left a lottery ticket here before.

464
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,540
Take a look, is it still valid?

Even if he won,

468
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,370
he wouldn't came there.

469
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,780
I've heard about Wan's situation.

470
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,860
You know, he once said

471
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,940
he'd give cured meat recipe.

472
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,860
This...

473
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,060
He told me the same thing.

474
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,660
But it's a pity about his cured meat.

475
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,540
I haven't even had a single bite yet.

476
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,860
These two bowls today, they're on me.

477
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,620
He always treated me before.

478
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,940
Now,

479
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,420
it's my turn to treat him.

480

we'll split it half and half.

483

The money.

484

Yeah, exactly.

485
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,620
Split it with me.

One kind of people can be retained.

If this document you gave me is real,

528
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,940
why not have a specialist deliver it?

This is just a test for me, isn't it?

536
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,820
And the purpose of the test

537
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,220
isn't about blind secrecy,

538
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,620
but about being constant vigilance.

539
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,380
Go ahead, open it.

Yeah, pour another.

559
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,940
That's excuse.

560
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,820
What's the excuse? We're happy!

561
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,140
Alright, that's it.

562
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,980
Thank you, dear.

563
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,690
(Contract signed, ready to ship.)
Smells good!

564
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,100
(Overseas task's ready, go.)
- Enough. - Having some?

565
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,980
Enough.

566
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,820
I might need to go on a business trip soon.

567
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,780
Where to?

568
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,900
Can't say.

569
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,220
How long will it be?

570
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,620
Three or five months.

571
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,620
One...

572
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,460
one or two years?

573
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,980
Dad, Mom.

574
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,500
There's a time difference.

575
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,860
Just regular work stuff.

576
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,420
Make sure you pack everything.

577
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,140
Dad,

578
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,900
Mom.

579
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,540
I also got admitted.

580
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,880
That's great!

581
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,460
Pour it in.

582
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,780
Fill them all up.

583
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,820
In the Northern Song Dynasty,

584
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,580
there was a family called

585
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,540
"Generals of Yang Family".

586
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,360
And now,

587
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,390
we have our Huo Family Army.

588
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,220
That's right.

589
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,980
The Huo Family Army.

590
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,620
Honey,

591
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,020
thank you

592
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,380
for giving me two amazing sons.

593
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,980
Two brave warriors.

594
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,980
Bro.

595
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,220
Come on, have some food.

596
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,820
Eat up.

597
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,740
When I leave this time, it's all on you.

598
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,300
Don't worry, bro.

599
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,300
Now we're colleagues,

600
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,340
so there are things we can't say anymore.

601
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,900
Do you even realize

602
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,460
what kind of path you've chosen?

603
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,660
Bro,

604
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,220
you're ahead of me, right?

605
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,820
So choice I made won't be wrong.

606
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,220
But this time, I can't give you the answers.

607
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,340
I won't let you down.

608
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,220
I'm heading out.

609
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,160
Bro,

610
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,340
let's take a photo before you go.

611
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:34,940
Wait for me to come back.

612
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,380
Bro!

613
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,180
Click.

614
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,900
(Various national intel organizations' name)
We are a covert team

615
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:03,100
that always guarding the people closely,

616
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,360
yet we remain unknown to them.

617
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,670
Our work associates with
terms of intelligence,

618
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,220
national security, anti-secession,

619
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:17,580
anti-infiltration, anti-subversion
and anti-espionage.

620
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:22,060
The situation we face is very severe.

621
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,030
Western countries remain relentless
in suppressing China.

622
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,770
Infiltration, instigation, subversion,
secession, espionage,

623
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,870
violent terrorist activities are escalating.

624
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:38,980
The enemy is constantly trying
to destabilize China.

625
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,950
Beneath the seemingly peaceful surface,

626
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:46,020
we are engaged in
a brutal struggle every moment.

627
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,410
Students,

628
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,780
(Absolute Loyalty to the Party,
Willing to Be Unsung Hero)

629
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,500
your training is about to conclude.

630
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,660
Starting tomorrow,

631
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,380
you'll head to your new positions,

632
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,980
and enter an unseen battlefield.

633
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,180
During this process,

634
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,140
some of you

635
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,540
will need to conceal your identities.

636
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,220
Some

637
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,780
will shed blood.

638
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,260
And some

639
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,860
may even sacrifice their lives.

640
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,860
But no matter what,

641
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,300
please remember

642
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,340
national interests above all else.

643
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,380
Behind you

644
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,380
stands a powerful motherland
and heroic people.

645
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,300
Great sound is silent.

646
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,860
Great form is shapeless.

647
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,140
Arise, noble spirits.

648
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,500
May heroic souls rest in peace.

649
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,740
The Long River mourns.

650
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,820
The Green Mountains stands witness.

651
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,820
Who says silence regions?

652
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,780
The rivers and mountains bears witness.

653
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,580
Absolute Loyalty to the Party,

654
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,140
willing to be unsung hero.

655
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,580
Absolute Loyalty to the Party,

656
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,140
willing to be unsung hero.

657
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,540
Absolute Loyalty to the Party,

658
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,660
willing to be unsung hero.

659
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,900
Absolute Loyalty to the Party.
