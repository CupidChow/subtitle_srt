1
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,680
Boss

2
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,080
Another bowl of noodles, please

3
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:40,919
Okay

4
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,159
Senior Brother

5
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,159
I won't eat the noodles

6
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,800
Huo Min

7
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,840
I heard you are going to represent the Xinshuai Group

8
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,439
and sue our Shoulong

9
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,159
What does the Xinshuai Group do?

10
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,319
You should know, right?

11
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,479
As for me

12
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,919
I know what I should know

13
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,240
I never inquire about what I shouldn't know

14
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,360
Li Ge has been using the banner of environmental protection these years

15
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,520
to extort many companies

16
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,759
Where is the evidence?

17
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,680
Senior Brother

18
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,599
We are all lawyers

19
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,680
Lawyer Huo

20
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,520
You can't win

21
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,240
You are up against our Shoulong Group

22
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,080
An entire elite legal team

23
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,080
I can crush you with money alone

24
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,520
What do you have to compete with me

25
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,439
Think about it carefully

26
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,520
Our Shoulong legal department has a position

27
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,280
If you figure it out

28
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,800
You are welcome to come find me anytime

29
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,639
Senior Brother

30
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,680
If I go to Shoulong, I mean if

31
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,680
Can we still be like this

32
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,840
Just sitting at this roadside stall eating something?

33
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,599
Besides,

34
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,360
I know this case is very difficult

35
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,479
But it's not impossible to win, right?

36
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,639
Mengli is coming back

37
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,039
How come you don't know?

38
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,479
But it doesn't matter

39
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,039
You just need to know

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,840
The matter in Yingzhou is related to your Xinchuan Charity Association

41
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,479
That's all you need to know

42
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,960
If Mengli finds out about this,

43
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,759
what will she think?

44
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,199
Fang Esq.

45
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,480
This is between her and me, right?

46
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,480
This noodle tastes pretty good.

47
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,920
Your total expenditure is twenty.

48
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,120
How would you like to pay?

49
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,600
Why should I pay for the noodles he ate?

50
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,360
He paid before he ate.

51
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm talking about your bowl.

52
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,040
This negotiation with Ming Shu

53
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,399
was hard-won for us

54
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,560
must not have any more issues

55
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,360
Alright, does everyone understand?

56
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,199
Understood

57
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,720
Today's negotiation

58
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,720
is our last chance.

59
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,319
Fortunately, only a few of us know the details.

60
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,839
Don't worry, Mr. Lin.

61
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,480
It's not even one o'clock yet.

62
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,720
The representative from Shapeng Country

63
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,839
will arrive at the group at two o'clock sharp.

64
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,600
Xiao Yu,

65
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,399
I remember you joined our Shoulong

66
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,160
almost ten years ago.

67
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,360
You joined the year the group transitioned.

68
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,879
I didn't expect Mr. Lin to remember.

69
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,800
It left a deep impression.

70
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,079
Back then, no matter where we went,

71
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,720
she was never late.

72
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,680
And she was always the first to arrive.

73
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,759
Yes,

74
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,600
living far away, she was afraid of unexpected situations on the road

75
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
causing delays.

76
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,000
It's better to be early.

77
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,399
Better early than late.

78
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,920
Who knows what unexpected situations

79
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,040
might occur on the road?

80
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,319
Everyone,

81
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,240
There is one hour left.

82
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,839
Everyone, stay where you are.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,399
Make sure all the pre-meeting tasks are ready.

84
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,439
Medicine Elder

85
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,279
Medicine Elder

86
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,360
Medicine Elder

87
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,240
Wei

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,279
Why are you running?

89
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,079
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,879
That day I went to your house, someone was looking for me.

91
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,639
They put something on me.

92
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
I was afraid they would hurt me. I was afraid of the pain.

93
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,079
They later gave me money, but I didn't take it.

94
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,560
You are so silly.

95
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,000
You don't even want the money they give you.

96
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,879
Let me tell you,

97
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,879
if you encounter this kind of situation again,

98
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,199
just answer whatever they ask you, understand?

99
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,360
Take care of yourself.

100
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,439
And if they give you money again,

101
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,480
do you know what to do?

102
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,560
Just take the money.

103
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,120
Why?

104
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,800
Because we will split it equally.

105
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,639
Are you really okay now?

106
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,399
I'm definitely fine.

107
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,839
Where did Uncle Wan go?

108
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,439
They all went out.

109
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,560
All went out?

110
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,519
Where did they go?

111
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,360
It seems they went to some dragon.

112
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,000
Longevity Dragon?

113
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,639
You stay here.

114
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,039
Come on, Uncle, sit down.

115
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,159
You all sit down too.

116
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,879
Everyone, listen to me.

117
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,399
Only by sitting down

118
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,720
will the Shoulong Group not dare

119
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,320
to casually drive us away.

120
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,600
We are reasonably expressing our demands.

121
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,039
In about half an hour,

122
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,519
the people from Shapeng Country will arrive.

123
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,960
The Shoulong Group wants to discuss business, right?

124
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,440
Let's show them

125
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,000
if they dare to

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,759
discuss it under the eyes of the disaster victims.

127
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Yes.

128
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,559
Please trust our Xinchuan Charity Association.

129
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,840
We will definitely help everyone.

130
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,799
Captain Luo,

131
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,480
Yesterday's media meeting

132
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,799
had almost calmed the public opinion.

133
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,240
What's happening today?

134
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,720
Feijiang, Old Lu,

135
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,120
you go to the scene and keep an eye on it.

136
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,759
Don't expose yourselves.

137
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,600
Okay.

138
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,879
By the way, last night we also found on Huo Min's phone

139
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
a photo.

140
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
This guy was also on the subway last night.

141
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
He even saw me.

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,399
This Huo Min is quite interesting.

143
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,399
He took this photo from a very tricky angle.

144
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,759
No matter what he intends to do,

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,360
our current target is to keep a close watch on the Xinchuang Charity Association and Yu Nanping.

146
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,000
From yesterday's situation,

147
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,080
it seems Yu Nanping has received counter-surveillance training.

148
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,799
Moreover, she and Li Ge

149
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,840
probably meet frequently.

150
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,440
So,

151
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,440
the information they exchanged during their meeting yesterday

152
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,159
was about the time and place of the negotiation.

153
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,120
Otherwise, they wouldn't have caused such a big commotion.

154
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,279
Don't simplify the matter just yet.

155
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,960
This photo might contain other information.

156
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,279
Let's adapt to the situation.

157
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,120
According to my habit, it won't take more than three years.

158
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,360
Don't trust anyone easily.

159
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,960
Have I been in the team for less than three years?

160
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,679
You joined the team

161
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,440
How long ago

162
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,960
Twenty-seven days left to complete three years

163
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,840
Hehehe

164
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,159
The boss means to say

165
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,320
You are about to enter the trust period

166
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,159
Keep it up, young man

167
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,879
Go, keep it up

168
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,080
Boss, we're going up

169
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,559
For this meeting

170
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,799
Our Shoulong Group has made careful preparations

171
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,399
But your side only sent one person

172
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,720
Isn't this a bit thoughtless?

173
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,960
The president had already scheduled a trip to China

174
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,360
But

175
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Shoulong Group suddenly had such a big accident

176
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,399
We have to reconsider

177
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,039
Our cooperation

178
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,879
Your side recently provided us with an environmental assessment report

179
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,200
But from the current situation

180
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,399
Such a reputation

181
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,440
It's really hard to meet our standards

182
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,000
Do you think with such public opinion

183
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,039
Your side can really pass the environmental assessment report?

184
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
How about

185
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,080
We discuss other ways of cooperation

186
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,960
Other ways of cooperation

187
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,879
We are willing to offer our compressor technology

188
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,360
And your energy chip technology

189
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,559
In exchange

190
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,879
This is absolutely impossible

191
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,320
"Blue One"

192
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,360
This is our country's classified project

193
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,480
We are not in a hurry

194
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,279
Take your time to consider

195
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,240
Brother Yao, the water is here

196
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
Quick

197
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,159
Distribute it to everyone

198
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,879
Come, come, come

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,799
Come, drink some water

200
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,200
What are you all doing here in this hot weather?

201
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,200
We are led by the Xinshuai Public Welfare Association

202
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,679
Fighting for our rights

203
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,240
Yes, fighting for rights

204
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,639
Sister, who organized you to come here?

205
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,039
Xinshuai Public Welfare Association

206
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,919
General Manager Lin

207
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,120
General Manager Gao, General Manager Jin

208
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,960
Suddenly, many people came downstairs

209
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,240
It seems like they are causing trouble

210
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,159
The security office is asking for instructions on what to do

211
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,440
Look at this situation

212
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,559
It's really strange

213
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,759
Someone is causing trouble at this time

214
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,720
Let's go down and take a look

215
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,240
Mr. Lin

216
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,320
What's going on?

217
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,600
Don't ask for now.

218
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,840
The security department comrades came up and said

219
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,440
A group of people are causing trouble downstairs.

220
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,960
Should I go down and take a look?

221
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,639
You go handle it.

222
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,960
Okay.

223
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,639
Lin Yasheng

224
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,519
See the guests out.

225
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,200
Please.

226
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,399
Dear friends,

227
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,039
Sitting here like this isn't a solution.

228
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,200
They won't dare to come out.

229
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,399
Everyone, get up, get up.

230
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,799
Shout a few times.

231
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,879
I need to breathe.

232
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,480
I need to breathe

233
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,399
I need to breathe

234
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,200
I need to breathe

235
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,519
Give an explanation

236
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,759
Give an explanation

237
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Give an explanation, give an explanation

238
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:24,360
Give an explanation, give an explanation

239
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,960
This move is quite damaging

240
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,639
Maliciously inciting uninformed masses

241
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,840
Like this

242
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,840
Handle flexibly, be careful to conceal identity

243
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,240
If it escalates, immediately notify the police

244
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,720
Let the police handle it

245
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Yes

246
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,879
Come out, come out

247
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,480
Don't pollute, give me back my clear blue sky

248
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,320
Everyone, quiet down

249
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,840
Solve the problem

250
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,559
Now, Mr. Gao will have a good talk with everyone

251
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,679
Mr. Gao

252
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,159
Hello everyone, my name is Gao Jianguo

253
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,919
I am the Vice President in charge of petrochemicals at Shoulong Group

254
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,840
Regarding this explosion

255
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,320
we have basically grasped some truths

256
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,360
we will soon cooperate with the public security authorities

257
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,679
to give everyone a clear explanation

258
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,960
Regarding your demands and anxieties

259
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,480
we completely understand

260
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,840
we are also making every effort

261
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,799
to solve these problems for everyone

262
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,720
I hope everyone can

263
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,360
use reasonable and legal means

264
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
to rationally reflect the issues

265
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,080
Please do not escalate the situation

266
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,200
Why did you sell the technology to the Shapeng people

267
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,080
Give us an explanation

268
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,279
Everyone, am I right

269
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,120
Speak

270
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,759
We and the Shapeng National Ming Shu Heavy Industry Chamber of Commerce

271
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,879
are engaged in normal business cooperation

272
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,600
Since we are talking about cooperation

273
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,840
it naturally includes the technical level

274
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,000
but it does not involve what you mentioned

275
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,559
technology trade

276
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,320
Currently, both parties regarding the cooperation matters

277
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,840
have completed preliminary consultations

278
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,440
Reached an agreement

279
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,720
Did everyone hear that?

280
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,679
They have already reached an agreement

281
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
They keep everything tightly under wraps from us

282
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,720
But they are open-hearted with the Shapeng people

283
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,519
If they don't give us an explanation today

284
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,480
Don't let them leave

285
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,879
Give us an explanation

286
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,279
Solve the problem

287
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,200
Give us an explanation

288
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,399
Give us an explanation

289
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,039
Solve the problem, solve the problem

290
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
It must be solved today

291
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,639
Who arranged for this group to come again?

292
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,480
I don't know, I didn't arrange it

293
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,399
Solve the problem, solve the problem

294
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,720
Solve the problem, solve the problem

295
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,440
Solve the problem, solve the problem

296
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,879
The problem must be solved

297
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,480
The Shapeng man is over there

298
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,519
Quick, don't let him escape

299
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,879
Hurry, hurry, don't let the Shapeng man escape

300
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,200
Security, stop them

301
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,799
Don't be impulsive

302
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,480
Xiao Wang, keep an eye on them

303
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,879
Hurry, hurry, hurry

304
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,960
Everyone, stay calm, stay calm

305
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,240
Don't let them escape

306
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,079
Sis, how did the Shapeng people get out from inside?

307
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,079
Something's going to happen

308
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,480
Retreat

309
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,880
Notify Yu Nanping to evacuate immediately

310
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,759
The security guards stopped them

311
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,119
Everyone, stay calm

312
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,599
Calm down, don't be fooled, don't be deceived

313
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,680
Calm down, stay calm

314
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,119
Everyone, stay calm

315
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,559
It's not working, boss, it's total chaos

316
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,359
Don't act impulsively

317
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:35,799
What's happening over there?

318
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,359
Han Yao

319
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,880
Are you satisfied with this mess?

320
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,200
The gun is pointed at our heads

321
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,880
Are we just going to sit and wait for death?

322
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,759
I don't want to, I'm telling you.

323
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:41,759
Han Yao

324
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,839
Quickly get your fans out of here.

325
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,079
What are you going to do with all these elderly people?

326
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,799
Mind your own business, go away.

327
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:46,519
Han Yao

328
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,240
Go, go, go, let's check it out.

329
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,599
Sorry.

330
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,880
Why are you all here?

331
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,960
We didn't want to come either.

332
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,039
In this scorching heat.

333
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,279
It was your Aunt Huang.

334
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,359
They got a sudden impulse and insisted on coming.

335
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,119
They said that Shoulong Group

336
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,519
is two-faced.

337
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,359
They don't have money to compensate the injured.

338
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,960
But they have money to serve that Shapeng Country.

339
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,799
Yes, they are frauds.

340
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,279
Who did you hear this from?

341
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,359
Your charity organization.

342
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,200
Security, are you useless?

343
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,279
Hurry, hit them!

344
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,839
Don't use force.

345
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,880
Don't use force, don't use force!

346
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,160
Hurry back.

347
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,359
Don't use force.

348
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Everyone, calm down.

349
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,119
Protect Mr. Gao.

350
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,359
Quick, protect Mr. Gao.

351
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,160
Mr. Lin.

352
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,119
Let's go first, Mr. Lin.

353
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,319
Hurry up and leave.

354
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,279
Quick, get back inside the building.

355
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,240
This is too much.

356
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,839
What's going on?

357
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,079
This is too barbaric.

358
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,160
What's going on?

359
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,200
Don't use force.

360
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,440
Old Wan, what's wrong?

361
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:07,839
Old Wan.

362
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,160
Someone come quickly, something happened!

363
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,240
Old Wan, Old Wan.

364
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,279
Someone come quickly, Old Wan.

365
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,160
Old Wan, what's wrong?

366
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,960
What's wrong, what's wrong?

367
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,400
Old Wan, wake up, Old Wan.

368
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,799
Call an ambulance, call an ambulance.

369
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,839
Hurry up.

370
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,039
Something happened, something happened!

371
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,200
This is serious, someone come quickly!

372
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,799
Why is everyone around you so unlucky?

373
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,000
Get lost.

374
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,640
Over there, over there

375
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,400
The police are here, stop fighting

376
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,440
The police are here

377
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,799
Stop fighting, stop fighting

378
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,119
Master

379
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,119
Nanping just booked a ticket to go abroad

380
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,880
I think she's going to run

381
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,079
We can't let her go

382
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,480
Inform the police about this situation

383
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,359
Keep a close watch

384
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,799
As soon as she shows up, capture her immediately

385
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:54,920
Understood

386
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Leave the rest to the police, you all retreat.

387
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,279
Go over and check, something seems to have happened there. Hurry up!

388
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,319
Immediately arrest Yu Nanping

389
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,119
Don't move

390
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,720
Who are you? What do you want?

391
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,920
We're from the National Security Bureau

392
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,880
Take them away

393
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,400
Old Wan

394
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,640
Quick, nurse

395
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,880
Old Wan, hang in there, Old Wan

396
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,400
Hurry up

397
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,839
Who is Wan Nian's family member?

398
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,160
Me

399
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:57,720
You are?

400
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,359
I am

401
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
Are you an immediate family member?

402
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,599
He is alone now

403
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,279
Can you sign on his behalf?

404
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,240
Yes

405
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,359
Alright, come

406
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,319
Here

407
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,319
What is his condition now?

408
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,039
It is intracranial bleeding caused by the impact

409
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,279
We will do our best to save him

410
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,559
Okay

411
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,359
Thank you, doctor

412
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,079
It's nothing

413
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,839
Dad

414
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,799
Dad

415
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,480
There are media reporters outside

416
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,960
Why are you causing trouble at this time?

417
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,359
Why are you going to the hospital?

418
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,559
Isn't this causing a commotion?

419
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,039
Otherwise, I'll go

420
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,599
Lin Hao, your injury is quite severe

421
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,160
Let me take you

422
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:28,880
Go, go, go

423
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,200
What can you solve by going to the hospital?

424
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:31,759
Lin Hao

425
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,079
Mr. Lin

426
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:50,519
Mr. Lin

427
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,839
Sorry, Miss Bai

428
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,440
We had an interview scheduled

429
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,960
But I have an urgent matter to attend to now

430
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,759
I guess you are heading to the hospital, Mr. Lin

431
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,400
There's no avoiding it

432
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,279
That's right

433
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,359
With your approach of facing challenges head-on, Mr. Lin

434
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:06,240
You can indeed change Shoulong's image

435
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,799
But it seems you're following the opponent's rhythm too closely

436
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,519
Miss Bai, I have reviewed your resume.

437
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,160
You are a very professional public relations expert.

438
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,279
So my professional advice to you is

439
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,599
to step out and not get entangled with Han Yao.

440
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,799
Don't forget,

441
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,680
we are one of the strongest national enterprises in Xizhao.

442
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,880
We represent high technology.

443
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,759
Even the West fears us as a competitor.

444
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,440
Why lower yourself

445
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,119
to argue with a minor celebrity?

446
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,720
My advice is simple.

447
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,839
Continue with the style you used last time with the media.

448
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,319
Act with dignity and integrity.

449
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,839
Make a positive attack.

450
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:41,599
They want compensation.

451
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,799
We can use this media attention

452
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,759
to make all the compensation public.

453
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,319
They want responsibility.

454
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,079
Then highlight our pragmatic style.

455
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,839
Also, present our new energy plan.

456
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,119
Release evidence of the West suppressing us.

457
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,680
The public's emotions need to be guided, not blocked.

458
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,839
The public relations strategies you mentioned

459
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,519
may not necessarily suit us.

460
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,599
Mr. Lin, the place you need to go now is the hospital.

461
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
The people standing and lying down

462
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:10,119
are like an undeniable natural judgment.

463
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,440
Even if you sincerely apologize now,

464
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,519
you are still standing in the defendant's seat.

465
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,240
So what is your opinion?

466
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,599
The first step is to have your son Lin Yasheng hospitalized.

467
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,480
He...

468
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,000
Miss Bai, you can do it.

469
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Alright

470
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Make sure to get plenty of rest

471
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,720
Okay

472
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,759
You guys are too ruthless.

473
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,400
You even treat your own people so harshly.

474
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,519
Are you dead?

475
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,400
You have gone too far.

476
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,880
Too far.

477
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,759
Yu Nanping is in trouble.

478
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,799
She didn't get on the plane.

479
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,359
I request to leave.

480
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,480
We have to admit that the plan failed.

481
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,839
Running away isn't the issue.

482
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,440
Now things have escalated.

483
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,599
She is going to expose me.

484
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,440
None of us are having a good time.

485
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,000
Yu Nanping has been trained.

486
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,960
At least she won't expose you in the short term.

487
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,519
If we can keep Shoulong Group busy,

488
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,480
I believe they should

489
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,480
have no time to trouble you.

490
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,559
Everyone is watching you now.

491
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:41,680
Some people might only get this one chance in their lifetime.

492
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:44,720
Think carefully about what you should do.

493
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,480
Tell Huo Min to go to the police station to get the person out.

494
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,519
Wait.

495
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,759
You go too.

496
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,759
It's a good thing you two didn't go to the scene today.

497
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,799
Let me tell you.

498
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,079
I've learned a lot.

499
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
Those uncles and aunts.

500
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:08,160
They were really desperate, they went all out.

501
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,440
Did you see that?

502
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,160
Look at how scratched up this body is.

503
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,480
You too.

504
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,920
How come you're not as good as me?

505
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:16,799
Use a bit more strength.

506
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,319
Sorry, sorry.

507
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,799
Our job is still safer.

508
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:20,920
It's safe for you.

509
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:21,759
Director Zhao.

510
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,640
Have you informed the police?

511
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,559
Yes, I have.

512
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,319
It's obvious.

513
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,920
Judging from Han Yao's subsequent behavior.

514
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,079
Besides SAD today.

515
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,880
There should be others involved.

516
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,400
Like this.

517
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,440
Send me the information on these three people.

518
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,119
As for Han Yao.

519
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,960
Should we investigate further?

520
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,200
Do you think Han Yao is the most important right now?

521
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,359
From the scene.

522
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,279
Can ordinary people use such professional sign language?

523
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,079
Which force do you think it is?

524
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Shura.

525
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,200
Shura again.

526
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,279
Working in the shadows, using others to kill.

527
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,000
Isn't this their usual trick?

528
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,440
Han Yao, why did you bring people

529
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,160
to cause trouble at the Shoulong Group's entrance?

530
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,240
It's inconvenient to say.

531
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,279
Say something, say something.

532
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,160
Stop chasing.

533
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,720
What's your attitude?

534
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,119
That's too much.

535
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,799
I don't care who is behind you.

536
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:22,880
You've caused such a mess now.

537
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,279
Can you bear the consequences?

538
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,599
Huo Min, I'm telling you.

539
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,839
I don't care who is behind you.

540
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,559
What is your purpose?

541
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,440
Now you're obstructing me.

542
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,920
Can you bear the consequences?

543
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,559
And Huo Min,

544
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,000
now it's just the two of us.

545
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,359
You don't need to act for anyone.

546
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,720
Do you know what consequences you have to bear?

547
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,559
Don't think I don't know.

548
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,279
about the deal between you and Zheng Qi.

549
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,240
How much did he give you?

550
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,359
You've been playing us around.

551
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,480
Go back and wait to be dealt with.

552
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,240
You.

553
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,240
The patient's condition is now basically stable.

554
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:14,599
But it's still hard to say if they will wake up.

555
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,559
You need to be mentally prepared.

556
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
I know.

557
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,599
Did you hear what the doctor said?

558
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,799
The condition is basically stable.

559
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:28,920
You should wake up.

560
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,240
I remember this is the first time you've been so quiet.

561
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,440
I'm really not used to it.

562
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,319
By the way, your lottery ticket is about to be drawn.

563
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,319
Do you want to

564
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,720
get up and take a look?

565
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:00,359
Old Zheng invited you to play mahjong.

566
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,599
Huang, what brings you here?

567
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,000
You didn't know I sneaked in quietly.

568
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,960
They let me in because of my age.

569
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,279
I'm here to see Lao Wan.

570
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,559
Lao Wan, are you feeling better?

571
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,640
You see, Lao Wan did it for us.

572
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,960
That's why he went.

573
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,000
Lao Wan.

574
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,000
Huang, Huang.

575
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:26,720
This is a hospital.

576
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,400
You can give this directly to the patient in bed three.

577
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,160
Okay.

578
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,319
Hello, hello.

579
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,480
I need to ask you a favor.

580
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,480
Hello.

581
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,480
Please help me give these

582
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,200
to the family of a patient named Wan Nian.

583
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,119
Wan Nian, you are

584
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,400
I'm his friend, thank you.

585
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Huang Xi, I need to trouble you with something.

586
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,119
What is it?

587
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,440
Can you help me compile a list of the injured?

588
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,519
Give me the names.

589
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,200
I won't let this go with them.

590
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,559
Alright, okay.

591
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,319
Some people can be used

592
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,119
Some people can be utilized

593
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,599
Some people can be reused

594
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,000
Just tell me which type we are

595
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,160
Can be trusted

596
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,920
Just charge forward and leave your back to me

597
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,279
I am someone you can trust

598
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,039
Call me dad

599
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,680
Haven't you won yet? Taking advantage here

600
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,880
Coconut milk is lactose-free, you can have it

601
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,720
The taste at that airport shop is pretty good

602
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,000
Call an ambulance, call an ambulance

603
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,359
Old Wan

604
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,799
Why are the people with you always so unlucky

605
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,119
Get out

606
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,759
Why are the people with you always so unlucky

607
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,200
Mr. Zheng, President Li is still in a meeting

608
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,319
Please wait a moment

609
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,759
Okay

610
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,279
This is Han Yao's information

611
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:11,039
He previously attended a performance training class

612
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,960
and then became an actor

613
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,920
Three years ago, he participated in a popular talent show

614
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,400
He was noticed by a famous director

615
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,920
and starred in a major environmental-themed movie

616
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,640
and became an environmental star

617
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,799
What did he do before that

618
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,599
He was just a

619
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,079
student at a mediocre university

620
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,480
What is his relationship with Huo Min

621
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,759
Han Yao is the ambassador of Xin Chuan Charity Association

622
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,680
He has always looked down on Huo Min

623
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,599
So that means

624
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:47,400
Xin Chuan Charity Association is not a monolith

625
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Logically, we can start from here

626
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,920
Huo Min and I are fellow disciples

627
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,839
We are closer

628
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,519
and there's nothing wrong with that

629
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,680
I just don't know what his boss thinks

630
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,759
Come in

631
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,400
Boss, Zheng Qi has arrived.

632
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,160
Take him to the meeting room.

633
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,119
Okay.

634
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,680
You two.

635
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,680
President Li has finished the meeting, please come in.

636
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,279
For a long time, our Shoulong Group

637
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,119
has been very tolerant of various statements from the Xinchuan Public Welfare Association

638
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,680
with a very inclusive attitude

639
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,759
because we are willing to accept

640
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,400
the supervision and correction from the general public

641
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,119
but this time, your Xinchuan Public Welfare Association

642
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,759
gathered and caused trouble at the entrance of Shoulong Group

643
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,160
isn't this already deviating from

644
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,680
the public welfare banner you uphold?

645
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:53,559
Shoulong Group calls this kind of public outcry

646
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,400
causing trouble

647
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:58,960
if there are any demands, we can discuss them openly

648
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,440
regarding this matter

649
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,160
you can communicate directly with Huo Min

650
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,279
he is our company's attorney

651
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,319
Attorney Huo

652
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,240
according to the materials I have obtained

653
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:11,319
the petrochemical department under Shoulong Group

654
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,759
has caused severe pollution more than once

655
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,039
including the water pollution incident three years ago

656
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,680
so this time, the factory explosion incident

657
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,279
we have also collected about

658
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,720
forty-six victims' signatures and authorization letters

659
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,039
if it's about compensation, we can negotiate

660
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,519
you can compensate for this time

661
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,599
what about next time?

662
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,839
and the time after that?

663
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,880
my client strongly wants you

664
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,400
to disclose some details of your cooperation with the Shapeng people

665
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,599
I think this probably exceeds

666
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,400
the civil responsibility we should bear

667
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,160
this is not just civil responsibility

668
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,079
it also involves the public's right to know

669
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,480
Forty-six victims

670
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,119
For your Shoulong Group

671
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,799
it might just be a small number

672
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,920
but we have the authority

673
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,920
to demand you disclose all cooperation details

674
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,200
to the public

675
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,799
Look at the following pages, lower your stance

676
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,240
then you'll understand, don't say I didn't warn you

677
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,720
Where did you get this?

678
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:17,640
Isn't gathering evidence a basic operation for a lawyer?

679
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:19,279
Then I must tell you

680
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,079
that forging evidence carries legal responsibility.

681
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,279
Do you think I would forge evidence?

682
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,680
Your demands are too extensive.

683
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,559
They involve partners from Shapeng Country

684
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,680
and some national interests.

685
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,680
This can't be resolved quickly.

686
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,599
How about this?

687
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,000
We each take a step back.

688
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,799
Shoulong Group

689
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,200
will establish a special fund in the Xinchuan Charity Association

690
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,799
specifically for treating those

691
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:52,839
families affected by petrochemical pollution.

692
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,680
What do you think?

693
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,680
Indeed, it's easy to spend other people's money.

694
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,079
That's better than having no money to spend.

695
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,559
It's better than stubbornly asking for it.

696
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,640
Anything that could potentially harm the people's

697
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,519
living conditions should be corrected.

698
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,000
Shoulong Group is no exception.

699
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,360
I see.

700
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:14,920
Goodbye.

701
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,840
After dealing with the Shoulong Group for so many years

702
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,559
this is the first time

703
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:39,159
I've seen them take something so seriously

704
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,079
Maybe too many things have happened recently

705
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,639
They probably want to keep the peace

706
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,320
Maybe

707
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:50,880
Huo Min

708
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,360
You and Han Yao work well together

709
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,559
Boss

710
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,480
How is it going?

711
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,360
Shoulong Group has already started public relations.

712
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,000
Mainly in the development of environmental technology

713
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,400
and civilian application direction.

714
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,800
Dani

715
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,800
Bai Keqin's article

716
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,280
Shoulong's dilemma: The battle of domestic and foreign technology

717
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
has been published.

718
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,320
Continue monitoring.

719
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,159
Yes.

720
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,519
Hello, Director

721
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,920
Synchronize the information about the explosion case

722
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,679
with the police as soon as possible

723
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,119
Close cooperation

724
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,719
Understood

725
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,519
Captain Luo

726
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,119
What's wrong

727
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:32,159
The video account from Xin Chuan Charity Association has some activity

728
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,119
Han Yao is currently live streaming from the hospital

729
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,480
To be honest, I am really angry right now

730
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,519
Extremely angry

731
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,280
Why

732
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,519
Because according to our understanding, the injured protesters

733
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:42,039
have been hospitalized for a long time

734
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,039
But up until now, Shou Long Group

735
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,039
Is he sick

736
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,199
I don't know if he is sick

737
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,159
I just want to ask

738
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,760
Why am I the patient

739
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,800
You are the doctor

740
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,800
Do I look sick

741
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,199
I don't look sick either

742
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,159
Come, let me check you

743
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,079
Go away

744
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:00,679
Excuse me

745
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,119
Are there any staff from Shou Long Group

746
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,119
coming to visit the patients now

747
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,760
This is patient privacy, I can't tell you

748
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,679
Alright

749
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,159
Dear friends

750
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,480
Please trust our Xin Chuan Charity Association

751
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,840
We will definitely help everyone

752
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,239
Didn't Shoulong Group say they wouldn't come?

753
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,039
We'll wait here until they arrive today.

754
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,760
Mr. Lin

755
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,480
Mr. Lin, please wait a moment, we have something to say.

756
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,119
Make way.

757
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:17,800
What are you doing?

758
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,360
Boss

759
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,280
Lin Shoulong is here.

760
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,239
Keep an eye on the scene, don't let any more trouble happen.

761
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:27,960
Let me introduce.

762
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,400
This is Mr. Lin from Shoulong Group.

763
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,039
Mr. Lin, Shoulong Group is only now coming to apologize.

764
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,159
Isn't it too late?

765
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,840
I'm here as a family member to visit the injured.

766
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,199
What are you doing here?

767
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,719
Are you treating the hospital like a stage?

768
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,679
We are here as representatives.

769
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,880
Specifically to oversee you.

770
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,039
What are you doing?

771
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,679
Don't make a fuss here, this is a hospital.

772
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,079
Yihan, come over here.

773
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:01,960
Dad

774
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,760
Dad, can I be discharged from the hospital?

775
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,400
Stay in the hospital and rest well.

776
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,880
Keqin

777
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,559
Mr. Li, I wish you a speedy recovery.

778
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,719
Mr. Li

779
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,239
I represent Shoulong Group.

780
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,559
This time, I came personally to offer my condolences.

781
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,079
My son was also injured.

782
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,880
He didn't disturb you, did he?

783
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,679
He is your son?

784
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,639
Yes.

785
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,199
Look, he is about the same age as your son, right?

786
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,079
This time, the explosion incident at Shoulong Group

787
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,280
We have also investigated.

788
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,800
It was deliberate sabotage.

789
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,920
We are currently sending people to investigate.

790
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:53,000
We aim to catch the saboteur as soon as possible.

791
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,960
But right now,

792
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,199
Shoulong Group is facing difficulties.

793
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,840
We hope you and others

794
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,960
can help us together to support Shoulong Group

795
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,559
to overcome this challenge.

796
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,239
What do you think?

797
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:12,400
Alright

798
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,920
Thank you

799
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,039
Dad

800
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,840
When you came

801
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,840
why didn't you bring me any treats

802
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,320
I'm starving

803
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,039
Brother, I have some food

804
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,800
We can eat together

805
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,800
But you have to play with me

806
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,119
Sure

807
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,679
What game

808
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,760
Rock, paper, scissors

809
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
I'm good at this

810
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,119
Yesterday, at the entrance of Shoulong Group

811
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,159
there was a mass conflict related to the explosion incident.

812
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:47,880
The police have launched a comprehensive investigation.

813
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,599
President Lin Shoulong is actively cooperating with the investigation.

814
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:53,440
He also visited the hospital to comfort the injured employees and citizens.

815
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,880
Through self-examination and correction, we found

816
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:01,320
that the problem indeed originated within Shoulong Group.

817
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,800
The serious consequences of this explosion incident

818
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,000
make me deeply distressed.

819
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,480
Deputy Mayor Jiang

820
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,639
What is your opinion on Shoulong Group's "Blue One"

821
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:15,360
What do you think about it?

822
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,239
Shoulong Group's "Blue One"

823
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,519
will start an energy revolution

824
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,880
with significant implications

825
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,239
will inevitably face Western forces

826
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,239
and their relentless suppression

827
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,440
How can we safely overcome this challenge

828
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,159
This is a historic test for Shoulong Group

829
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,280
Have some fruit.

830
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,320
Have one.

831
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Huang Xi

832
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,960
Okay

833
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,519
Meng Li

834
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,440
Lawyer Zheng is here

835
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:06,920
You guys talk

836
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,920
I'll head out first

837
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,559
I bought you a bouquet of flowers

838
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,480
How is your recovery going?

839
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,360
Still can't speak much

840
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:22,000
I saw Huo Min yesterday

841
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,880
I told him you were back

842
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:28,320
He didn't come to see you

843
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:35,320
He has been quite busy lately.

844
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:38,239
The Xinshuai Group he works for

845
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,639
is causing trouble at our Shoulong.

846
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:42,760
They even injured someone.

847
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,719
Huo Min might have been used by someone.

848
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:49,280
I'll take you out for a walk.

849
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,719
The old man's vital signs

850
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,360
are currently stable.

851
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,519
But he hasn't regained consciousness yet.

852
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,159
We need to keep observing him.

853
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:09,400
Understood.

854
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:11,360
Let me know if there are any new developments.

855
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,719
Doctor,

856
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
what are these things?

857
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:16,800
Oh, right. A friend asked me to give these to you.

858
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:17,960
A friend?

859
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:18,719
Yes.

860
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,719
What's their name?

861
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
She didn't say.

862
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,960
It was a woman.

863
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,519
Hello

864
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,519
Huo

865
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,039
Mengli

866
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,159
It's been a long time since I saw this number

867
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:16,239
You're finally back

868
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,239
Did you figure out that I'm in the hospital again

869
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,400
Something happened here

870
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,239
So

871
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,199
I might not be able to visit you for now

872
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,119
I'm sorry

873
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:39,079
I didn't expect that the situation here

874
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,000
you already knew about it

875
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,039
Look at me

876
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,320
still making you worry about me
