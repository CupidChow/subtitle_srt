1
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Take it

2
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,840
What is this thing

3
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,240
I don't want it

4
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,759
Take it

5
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,360
Put this thing on yourself, understand

6
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,520
If you do well, Brother Tiger will reward you

7
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,960
If you don't do well, I'll deal with you

8
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:51,960
Understand

9
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,719
Understand

10
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Got it

11
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,000
Grandpa, Grandpa, where is this?

12
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,879
This is in Peng Town, Shuangniu Peng Town.

13
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,719
Hu Erbing

14
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,479
Stop, don't run

15
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,039
Why are you running?

16
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,479
What are you doing here?

17
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,400
What are you hiding back there?

18
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Son sent you beef again

19
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,240
Make sure to eat it

20
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,639
What are you doing, what are you doing, what are you doing

21
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
My pants are ruined

22
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,639
Come get the pants tomorrow

23
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,159
Fix my pants, you hear me

24
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,599
Stop

25
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,879
Did you move to the resettlement area

26
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,479
Yes, with my mother-in-law

27
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,240
Are you hungry

28
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,079
Hungry

29
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,319
Brother will take you to a mysterious place, okay

30
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,759
But you have to promise me

31
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,240
You didn't see or hear anything

32
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:24,920
Got it

33
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,680
Don't talk about it outside, or there won't be a next time

34
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,480
Which mysterious place is it

35
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,360
Boss Lady

36
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,319
Boss Lady

37
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,800
I brought the things you wanted.

38
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,480
What do I want?

39
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,639
What's going on?

40
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,199
I came back for the family photo.

41
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,720
You still remember to come back.

42
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,240
It's almost mealtime.

43
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,360
Yes, I encountered something special on the way.

44
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,319
Three hundred and sixty-five days a year.

45
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,040
Today is special for your dad, and you didn't come back early.

46
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,519
Even if you came back a minute earlier, it would be fine.

47
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,040
Yes, yes, yes.

48
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,360
Huo Min is back.

49
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,600
Happy birthday to you.

50
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,319
Happy birthday to you.

51
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,560
Happy birthday to you.

52
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,519
Dad, I really encountered something special.

53
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,279
Huo family rule: don't talk about work when you enter the house.

54
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,680
Old man, I'm happy every day.

55
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,160
Happy every day.

56
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,800
Last time we took a family photo.

57
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,800
When?

58
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,000
That was when you two brothers just graduated.

59
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,040
You forgot.

60
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Whose child is this?

61
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,480
The neighbor's kid, named Er Bing.

62
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,079
Er Bing, what do you want to eat?

63
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,759
Beef noodles.

64
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,040
Old Huo, make a bowl of beef noodles.

65
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,360
Add more beef.

66
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,680
Did you hear me talking to you?

67
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,879
I asked you to make some beef noodles with extra beef.

68
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,040
Why are you pretending to be dumb?

69
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,079
Go, go, go, hurry up.

70
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,160
Got it.

71
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,639
Come, come, come, Mom.

72
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,439
It's spilled, it's spilled.

73
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,759
Come, come, come, have a seat.

74
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,120
Not bad today.

75
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,800
Your eyebrows and lips are well done.

76
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,240
They look so bright.

77
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,519
I've been doing this all morning.

78
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,199
Drawing.

79
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,199
Is it done?

80
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,240
Come, eat the noodles, Ertiao.

81
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,040
My name is Erbing.

82
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,079
Just call you Ertiao, it sounds better.

83
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,160
Come, eat.

84
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,639
Mom, give me a bowl too.

85
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,920
Try it

86
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,480
Okay, I'll try it

87
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,879
Does it taste good?

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,800
Yes

89
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,240
If you want to eat it in the future

90
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,480
Come here and mention my name

91
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,519
You can eat as much as you want, okay?

92
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,240
Yes

93
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,480
But what did you promise me?

94
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,360
Not to tell anyone

95
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,600
Look at me and say it properly

96
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,600
Not to tell anyone

97
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,639
Good

98
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,040
Sound

99
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,839
Hope

100
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,319
Voice

101
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,120
Brother

102
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,480
School is over

103
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,040
School is over

104
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,879
I failed the final exam today

105
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,959
Meng Li is sad and sick again

106
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,839
I'm here, come on, come on

107
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,439
Eat

108
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,279
Delicious

109
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,480
Tasty

110
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,920
Brother

111
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,399
Why are you so good to me?

112
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,800
Brother

113
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,439
Do you remember how we used to take exams?

114
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,480
I was really puzzled, you know.

115
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,800
Back then, you understood everything you studied.

116
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,040
You could learn anything, right?

117
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,240
But when it came to exams, your scores were never higher than mine.

118
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,879
Later, I found out.

119
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,879
You were afraid I'd fail and get scolded by mom.

120
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,959
Your little scheme.

121
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,920
You calculated the scores every time.

122
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,800
As soon as you knew you'd pass, you'd submit your paper.

123
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,079
After submitting, you'd run to our classroom window.

124
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,240
To pass me the answers.

125
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,240
You really had a way.

126
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,879
Then I moved to a different classroom.

127
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,279
No more answers to pass.

128
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,600
I couldn't score higher than you anymore.

129
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,439
You moved to

130
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,200
the sixth floor.

131
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,639
What could I do?

132
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,879
Did you forget?

133
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,240
I can fly.

134
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,279
How about I take you flying?

135
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,559
Brother

136
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,440
Flying

137
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,759
Flying

138
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,559
Flying

139
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,120
Is he your brother?

140
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,720
Yes

141
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,639
What's wrong with him?

142
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,480
He's sick.

143
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,279
What's his name?

144
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
What's his name?

145
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,360
Latest news from our station

Various environmental organizations have condemned Shoulong Group

According to the environmental organization Xinchuan Public Welfare Association

153

a relevant person in charge of Shoulong Group

154

had a physical altercation with the resettled people during the condolence visit

with the resettled people

causing the crowd to criticize

157
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,960
Is it everyone

158
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,440
Yes

159
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,080
What do you mean

160
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,559
I'll take them all

161
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:02,919
What attitude, don't let him go

162
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,240
Let's get excited

163
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,600
I told you to handle the crisis management.

164
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:32,320
Are you still being asked to create a PR crisis?

165
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,320
I believe

166
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
in solving problems my own way.

167
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,799
Do you think the Shoulong Group belongs to you personally?

168
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,279
It certainly doesn't belong to me.

169
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,240
It belongs to you.

170
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,080
If you think you can't do well here,

171
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,679
you can leave immediately.

172
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,320
I'll leave.

173
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,840
You do your thing, I'll do mine.

174
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,440
Bastard.

175
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,399
President Lin.

176
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,799
Last time you mentioned that girl group, Xiao Ya.

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,360
I've arranged everything for you.

178
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,480
Who?

179
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,360
The one in the center position.

180
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,240
That girl group, the one with the big waves.

181
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,799
As soon as she heard you were looking for her, she came right over.

182
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,799
She's waiting for you in the room.

183
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,639
Look.

184
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,639
The room key is ready for you.

185
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,240
Pour some wine for Brother Spider, girls

186
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,480
I'll take them all

187
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,320
What are you doing?

188
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,600
Drinking.

189
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,039
Drinking.

190
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,159
Fine, I'll drink.

191
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,039
Drinking.

192
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,240
Drinking.

193
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,519
Drinking.

194
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,200
Just kidding.

195
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,039
Drinking.

196
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,440
Stop looking.

197
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,600
Give it to me.

198
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,840
Brother, calm down.

199
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,879
Drinking.

200
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,320
Drinking.

201
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,360
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

202
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,159
Get out, all of you get out.

203
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,000
Get out

204
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,960
All of you, get out

205
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,840
Lin Xi is tired

206
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,159
Secretary Guo, take him to rest

207
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,759
Lin Xi, let's go back to the room

208
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,559
Stop it

209
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,399
Who are you

210
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,480
Zheng Qi, your lawyer

211
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,399
I want to sue Han Yao

212
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,399
No matter how much it costs

213
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,120
He must die

214
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,559
Must die

215
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,240
I understand your feelings

216
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,639
But now

217
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,240
The speed of public opinion spreading

218
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,200
And the seamless cooperation with the short-selling fund

219
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,759
This clearly shows someone is setting a trap behind the scenes

220
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,080
Waiting for you to jump in

221
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,679
If you really want to jump

222
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,240
You might as well jump from here

223
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,440
Jump

224
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,559
Jump

225
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,600
No matter where you jump from

226
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,000
At least make Shou Long's death less ugly

227
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,679
I don't care who dies

228
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,519
He must die

229
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,799
He should die

230
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,480
But we can't let Shou Long die with him

231
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,559
It's too late today

232
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,639
Get some good rest

233
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,360
Wait until tomorrow

234
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,679
We will find a professional PR team

235
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,200
to devise a thorough plan

236
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,879
and crush their conspiracy in one go

237
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,519
What do you think

238
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:34,799
They must die

239
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,480
Lin Xi

240
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:44,919
Lin Xi, be careful

241
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,759
He has already gone in. He has already gone in.

242
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,279
Who are you?

243
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,440
Who are you?

244
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,679
I'm not in the mood today.

245
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,360
Get out, get out, get out!

246
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,080
You want money, right?

247
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,279
Go ask my secretary outside.

248
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,559
If you don't want to die, shut up.

249
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,360
Who are you?

250
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,279
Shut up.

251
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,799
Who exactly are you?

252
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,840
Shut up.

253
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,879
Ladies, you really can't come in.

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,559
You really can't come in.

255
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,600
Move aside, make way.

256
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,399
Over there

257
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,200
No, there isn't

258
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,240
Nothing here either, sis

259
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,159
Inside, let's go

260
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:19,720
Who is it?

261
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,759
This lady says she's here to find her boyfriend

262
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,480
Maybe

263
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,639
Maybe she made a mistake

264
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,120
I think she definitely made a mistake

265
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,919
Hey, where's my boyfriend?

266
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,120
Where did you hide him?

267
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,159
Hand him over quickly

268
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,360
What's going on? Where is he?

269
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,399
Hand him over quickly

270
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,240
Yes, hand him over quickly

271
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Hand him over quickly

272
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,879
If you don't know who I am

273
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,360
I don't mind letting you know

274
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,559
What are you doing?

275
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
This lady says she's looking for her boyfriend

276
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,320
Stop talking

277
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,440
Miss Bai is a famous PR expert

278
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,200
She just returned from the Sha Peng country

279
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,399
We specially invited her

280
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,639
Sorry, ladies

281
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,320
I told you not to touch me

282
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,480
Please leave first

283
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,759
Manager Chen, right?

284
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:00,799
Yes, yes, yes.

285
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,240
I am officially notifying you now.

286
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,559
My contract with your hotel is hereby void.

287
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,240
No.

288
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
I will compensate you fully for the breach of contract.

289
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,240
Treating a guest's privacy like this.

290
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,879
I don't think you need any PR.

291
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,639
Just shut down.

292
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,159
Miss Bai, this is a misunderstanding.

293
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,720
Please reconsider.

294
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,559
We can increase the PR fee.

295
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,679
Give us a chance, please.

296
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,679
Name your price.

297
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,159
110.

298
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,960
110.

299
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:22,799
Not 110.

300
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,600
Miss Bai, please give us a chance.

301
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,000
We were wrong, we are really sorry.

302
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,960
Get out.

303
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,080
Don't leave, Miss Bai.

304
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,080
Miss Bai.

305
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,559
Is he dead?

306
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,440
You might as well have put me in a box earlier.

307
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,559
What can fit into a box

308
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,879
shouldn't it be a dead person?

309
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,799
What were those people doing just now?

310
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,600
Do you still not understand your situation?

311
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,000
It's obvious someone is targeting you.

312
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,079
The lawyer was actually right.

313
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,119
These people are truly ruthless and opportunistic.

314
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,240
Let me tell you

315
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,559
I don't know those women at all

316
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't know you either

317
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:18,839
I don't have a girlfriend

318
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,480
They are not my girlfriends

319
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,519
Do you have a boyfriend?

320
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Hey girl

321
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,039
You still have this thought now

322
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:32,880
Who are you anyway?

323
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,720
And you give me attitude

324
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,599
I play this game too.

325
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,119
But he's not very good at it.

326
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,079
People still play such low-level games?

327
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,759
Look, look here.

328
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,119
What are you looking at?

329
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,119
Why haven't you two left yet?

330
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,359
Finish this bite.

331
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,279
What are you looking at? Is there something going on?

332
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,160
Just watching the drama.

333
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,720
Look, Huo Min is daydreaming.

334
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,599
Look at this.

335
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,680
How can you earn 100,000 a month?

336
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,240
You can have luxury cars and watches overnight.

337
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,799
He's really looking at the watch.

338
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,559
Why does this watch look familiar to me?

339
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,480
Do you remember? It seems like someone wore it before.

340
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,160
Who wore it?

341
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,599
If you two don't leave now,

342
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,599
you'll be on duty all week.

343
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,599
You, eat.

344
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,200
Let's go.

345
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,200
I say, your current job

346
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,039
is becoming more and more grounded

347
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,599
You're doing quite well now

348
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,799
Young comrade

349
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,000
Have you heard this saying

350
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,160
Hold your strength, keep steady

351
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,720
Don't panic when facing anything

352
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,359
As long as the higher-ups haven't given us

353
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,440
clear instructions

354
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,000
we have to stay here

355
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,319
Don't worry, our line of work will never face unemployment

356
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,480
Is this gone?

357
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,119
Yes, yes, yes.

358
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,559
Come, come, come.

359
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,000
This is about to expire.

360
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,960
This isn't expired, it's near expiration.

361
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,799
Right, right, right.

362
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,720
Besides, eating it two days past expiration is fine, right?

363
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,720
This is still half price, right?

364
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,039
Half price.

365
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,519
Staring

366
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,480
Brother

367
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,559
I didn't order this

368
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,279
It's on me

369
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,359
You're welcome

370
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,160
Don't

371
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,200
Brother

372
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,599
From your accent, you're not a local

373
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,839
You sound like you're from Shaanxi

374
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,759
Where are you from

375
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,480
I'm from Dali

376
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,240
My home is in Xi'an

377
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,039
We're close

378
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,559
Very close, fellow townsman

379
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,279
Brother

380
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,480
Working at Shoulong, must be great

381
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
To be honest with you

382
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,680
If Shoulong doesn't make it this time

383
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,079
There will definitely be layoffs

384
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,200
I'm on the verge of being laid off

385
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:17,839
At our age,

386
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,480
we have elderly parents and young children to care for.

387
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:22,759
We need to pay the mortgage and continue social security.

388
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,599
That's a must.

389
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,200
To put it bluntly, we can't afford to get sick.

390
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,680
Young people call it striving.

391
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,200
We call it struggling for survival.

392
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,079
Brother, don't worry.

393
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,039
Life isn't easy for anyone.

394
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,359
Whether it's for our own family or for everyone,

395
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,160
we all have to struggle.

396
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:42,680
Don't worry.

397
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,599
Shoulong will definitely be fine.

398
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,039
I'm here to watch over.

399
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,920
Yes, you're here to watch over.

400
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,960
No matter how late we work overtime, there's always food. We won't go hungry.

401
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,680
That's for sure.

402
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,240
Brother, I'll bring those things to you.

403
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,200
No.

404
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,400
It's nothing, we're fellow townsmen.

405
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,119
Report the situation

406
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,200
Sis, because of the trending topic about the resettlement site

407
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,079
our charity's followers have exceeded twenty million

408
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:33,440
especially Yao's post

409
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,160
gained the most followers

410
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,960
What's going on with Shoulong?

411
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,039
Shoulong is holding a press conference tomorrow.

412
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,759
Although we weren't invited,

413
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,799
I managed to get an invitation.

414
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,440
Shoulong Group has caused such significant harm this time.

415
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,000
We need to make them pay the price they deserve.

416
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,359
So our next step,

417
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:59,279
should we let Brother Yao continue to push forward?

418
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,079
Appear on more shows.

419
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,960
Huo Min

420
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,559
Tomorrow, you should also attend the press conference

421
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,000
and file a lawsuit against Shoulong Group

422
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Can you do it?

423
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,039
What, Lawyer Huo can't handle it?

424
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,000
I can handle it

425
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
but maybe we shouldn't do it this way

426
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,839
What do you mean?

427
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,960
The lawsuit is actually quite simple

428
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,680
but Shoulong Group has their own ways

429
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,759
Because

430
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,240
if they delay every step for a few months

431
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,680
by the time we get to court

432
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:44,920
it could be over a year

433
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,319
Is there a better way?

434
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,079
The lawsuit is like a nuclear deterrent

435
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,880
but public opinion is very important

436
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,400
and right now, public opinion is in our favor

437
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,440
So, Brother Yao

438
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,759
we might need you to go out

439
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,599
make some noise, spread the word

440
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,359
Actually, Shoulong's big knife

441
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:01,640
is already hanging at the door

442
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,240
but whether we can strike it down

443
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,480
Brother Yao alone isn't enough

444
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,640
You really have the luxury of talking without feeling the pain

445
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,160
"Blue One" is gone

446
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,200
Whatever you say goes

447
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,759
If the core technology of Shoulong Group is still there

448
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,400
Then for us

449
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,079
It's a hidden danger

450
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:25,400
Yes

451
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,279
And the people and matters on Matt's side

452
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,680
I haven't settled it yet

453
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,599
Now is an opportunity

454
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,839
So what do we do now

455
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,079
Get rid of them

456
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,920
Release all the data we've collected on Shoulong Group over the years

457
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,799
Make it all public

458
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,119
Yes

459
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,200
Sis, the sooner the better

460
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,079
How long

461
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,079
Tomorrow

462
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,039
Great

463
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,519
Sis, but

464
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,680
But it might need

465
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,880
Yao, I need you to cooperate with me a bit and help me out

466
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,119
I'll cooperate with you

467
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,519
Tell me, what do you need me to do?

468
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,319
Wei, I might need to trouble you tomorrow.

469
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,440
Don't show up for now.

470
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,920
Because once you show up,

471
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,119
things might go off track.

472
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:11,880
You

473
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,519
Brother Lu

474
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,599
Can you stop bothering me?

475
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,319
You don't need to lose weight

476
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,319
You don't need to work out either

477
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:35,799
It's none of your business

478
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,039
Boss, why is Han Yao here?

479
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,240
Why is this guy everywhere?

480
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,480
Little Lin

481
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,559
Look, he's here

482
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,279
Doesn't Han Yao love excitement?

483
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,119
This time there's a good show to watch.

484
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,240
Sir

485
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,039
Hello, please show your invitation.

486
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,759
I don't have one.

487
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,039
No entry without an invitation.

488
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,359
Your Shoulong Group

489
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:58,960
Is this how you accept supervision?

490
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,240
Let me in.

491
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,559
Sorry sir, this is our rule.

492
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,839
No entry without an invitation.

493
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,400
Why can they enter and I can't?

494
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:04,119
Did you take money?

495
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,160
Or are you putting on a show?

496
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,559
Come on, start the camera, start the camera.

497
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,960
No entry without an invitation.

498
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,160
Shoulong Group is impressive.

499
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,599
Didn't expect your security to be even more impressive, right?

500
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,640
Please show your invitation.

501
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:13,519
I must go in today.

502
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,720
President Xiaolin, the show has started.

503
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
I am here representing Xinchuan Charity Association.

504
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,559
Why can't I go in?

505
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,920
No entry without an invitation.

506
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,799
Why don't you let people in?

507
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,400
Exactly.

508
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,839
No entry without an invitation, sir.

509
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,319
Xiaoya

510
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,519
This is our rule.

511
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,440
Han Yao

512
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,480
You two are actually in the same frame.

513
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:27,920
Xiaoya

514
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,880
Are you together?

515
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,839
Han Yao, who cheated first?

516
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,920
We have nothing.

517
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:33,960
There's really nothing.

518
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,519
Mr. Xiaolin is still the most thorough.

519
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,920
Look at the people I arranged.

520
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,319
How is it? Do you need me to...

521
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:43,960
Handle it yourself.

522
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,960
Mr. Xiaolin, the press conference is about to start.

523
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:51,799
When would you like to...

524
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,279
I won't be going.

525
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,400
I just came to disgust him.

526
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,240
Stop filming, stop filming, stop filming.

527
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,440
It's not what you think.

528
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,519
Xiaoya, don't go.

529
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,559
Stop filming, stop filming.

530
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,640
Wait a moment.

531
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,519
Here, zoom in.

532
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,359
Huo Min

533
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,480
Today, I am here on behalf of the Xinchuan Charity Association

534
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,240
to check out the situation of this press conference.

535
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,079
Please quiet down, everyone.

536
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,440
Everyone, please be quiet.

537
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,640
The press conference is now starting.

538
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:55,519
Please welcome Mr. Lin Shoulong, President of Shoulong Group.

539
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,119
Vice Presidents Mr. Gao Jianguo and Mr. Jin Chuan.

540
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
to meet with everyone.

541
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,839
Please welcome Mr. Lin Shoulong, President of Shoulong Group

542
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,319
to speak to everyone

543
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,559
Friends from the media

544
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,880
I am Lin Shoulong

545
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,799
On behalf of Shoulong Group

546
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:34,519
I warmly welcome you all

547
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,319
At the same time, regarding the factory explosion incident

548
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,960
the injured employees and their families

549
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,079
and the residents affected by this explosion

550
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,079
and the residents affected by this explosion

551
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,039
we express our deepest apologies

552
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:06,559
Next, everyone can ask questions freely.

553
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:07,839
Please raise your hand.

554
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,480
The person in the first row.

555
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,039
May I ask about Shoulong Group's response to the explosion at the factory

556
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,799
and the resettlement of the surrounding residents?

557
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,440
What are the further plans?

558
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,079
The relief supplies we prepared for the affected residents

559
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,920
have safely arrived.

560
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,240
The second and third batches

561
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,640
will also arrive soon.

562
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,559
Thank you.

563
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,519
Next person.

564
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,240
Second row.

565
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,279
Hello, how long will the resettlement for the affected residents

566
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,480
be sustained?

567
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,640
Our assistance will continue

568
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:50,720
until all affected residents return to their normal lives.

569
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,720
Thank you.

570
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,599
Who else has a question?

571
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
The person in the third row.

572
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,359
I have a question.

573
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,160
Who is it?

574
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,359
Everyone, please be quiet.

575
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,000
Mr. Lin,

576
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,880
what project is Shoulong Group developing exactly?

577
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,440
According to my research,

578
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,319
all previous projects of Shoulong Group

579
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,599
have serious safety issues

580
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:20,880
and pollution problems.

581
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,519
These are all in my investigation report.

582
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,720
Today, you must give an explanation.

583
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,720
What are you doing? What are you doing?

584
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,400
Don't stop him.

585
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,160
Everyone can take a close look, it's okay.

586
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,640
Indeed, over the years,

587
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,599
all traditional energy companies

588
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,240
have faced difficulties and challenges.

589
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,519
We have all experienced them.

590
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,119
It is because of this

591
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,400
that our Shoulong Group dares to bet

592
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,799
the entire fate of our group

593
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,079
on developing a cleaner new energy.

594
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,000
I won't say much here.

595
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,079
That is because

596
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,519
there are always a few people causing trouble.

597
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,240
They want our efforts to be in vain.

598
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:21,799
They want to stop our society from progressing.

599
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:25,359
So at today's meeting,

600
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:29,160
I take this opportunity to tell those people

601
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,359
Sorry, you will be disappointed.

602
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,480
Our new energy project

603
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:37,559
"Blue One" is intact.

604
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,880
No matter what other tricks you have in the future,

605
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,680
our Shoulong Group will be able to meet the challenge.

606
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,759
Good.

607
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,359
Intact

608
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,519
Do you have any other questions?

609
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,079
No, I don't.

610
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:13,039
Mr. Lin, "Azure One" is still there.

611
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,079
Why is "Azure One" still there?

612
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,559
I have already confirmed with the insider.

613
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,680
"Azure One" is indeed still there.

614
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,599
It seems

615
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,599
It's really a fireworks show.

616
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:58,079
The information could only have leaked from you.

617
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Shut up.

618
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:01,599
Your people wouldn't betray you?

619
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:04,640
If you hadn't been so eager and alerted them,

620
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,720
how could it have been a dud?

621
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,319
Since "Azure One" wasn't destroyed,

622
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,799
the people from Shoulong Group and Shapeng Nation

623
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,359
will definitely have a second negotiation.

624
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,640
Now is not the time to discuss who leaked the information.

625
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,920
The most important thing now is

626
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,240
to stop them from succeeding in this negotiation.

627
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,519
If we can't find the source of the leak,

628
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,920
we won't have another chance.

629
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,960
So this time you need to take action personally.

630
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,640
Use the most direct method to cut off all intermediaries.

631
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,000
You and I will connect directly.

632
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Get the negotiation information as soon as possible.

633
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,279
Otherwise,

634
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,160
you will also find it hard to have another chance.

635
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,160
So, you can only trust me now?

636
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,519
I don't trust you.

637
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,279
But I know

638
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,640
our goals are aligned.

639
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,279
Alright, let's discuss the terms.

640
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:51,480
Ms. Bai, can we talk?

641
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,640
My driver will be here in three minutes.

642
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,200
Let's reintroduce ourselves.

643
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,119
The heir of Shoulong Group.

644
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,640
It's been trending for several days.

645
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,079
That's right.

646
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,680
Miss Bai is a PR expert.

647
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,320
Shoulong Group has had a lot going on recently.

648
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:11,199
Miss Bai, would you be willing to stay and help us?

649
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,679
Your group has gotten involved with some powerful people.

650
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,440
I don't want to cause any trouble.

651
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,280
Miss Bai is probably the least afraid of trouble in this world.

652
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,760
The least afraid of causing trouble.

653
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,920
Then you've got the wrong person.

654
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,559
You came to Xizhao this time.

655
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,760
Surely to capture the Chinese market.

656
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,239
If you leave like this

657
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,039
it would be a complete waste.

658
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,599
In the current Xizhao

659
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,239
only the Shoulong Group

660
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,440
can make Bai Sect's name famous.

661
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,519
Do you want me to be remembered forever

662
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,519
or be infamous for eternity?

663
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,239
Anything is possible before death,

664
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,000
including you and me.

665
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,440
Miss Bai

666
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Miss Bai

667
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,639
Arrange for me to meet

668
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,159
all key figures related to the new energy project

669
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,239
I want to interview them in my own way

670
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,719
to understand the full picture

671
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,039
If Shoulong Group can withstand my verification

672
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,960
then I naturally have a way

673
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:14,280
to restore Shoulong's public image

674
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,280
No problem

675
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,079
Miss Bai, where is your driver?

676
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,280
Isn't it you?

677
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,079
Please

678
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,159
You really have a knack for this

679
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,079
How did you find such a place

680
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,119
You don't like it here

681
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:38,079
You also have a taste for this

682
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,400
Yes

683
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,400
No matter what other tricks you have in the future

684
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:49,199
Our Shoulong Group will be able to meet the challenge

685
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,480
Come, come, come

686
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,320
Let's change the place, let's change the place

687
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,519
Out of sight, out of mind

688
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,000
Okay

689
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
Actually

690
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:04,159
I really want to

691
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,360
Find a quiet place to have a good meal with you

692
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,039
Old Zhao

693
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,880
I really appreciate you this time

694
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:14,880
If you hadn't notified me to move in advance

695
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,239
Then

696
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:20,679
"Blue One" would really be finished

697
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,119
First was the public opinion attack

698
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,519
Then the economic sanctions

699
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,079
They just want to take you, this old bone

700
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,119
And tear you apart

701
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,239
It's clearly a good thing

702
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,400
but it always has to be hidden

703
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,239
guarded during the day and at night

704
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,239
and even from thieves at home

705
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,199
I understand.

706
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,800
As soon as this phone rings,

707
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,360
there's trouble again, right?

708
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,320
By the way,

709
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,559
pack it up, let's not waste it.

710
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:10,840
The time has come, I'm ready to cast the net and catch the ghost.

711
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,800
Don't forget to pack it up.

712
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,320
Having a meal with you,

713
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,320
why is it so difficult?

714
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,559
Really impressive.

715
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Boss, everything is normal

716
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,440
I have to propose a toast

717
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,760
I propose a toast

718
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,760
Thanks to General Jing, thanks to General Liu

719
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,320
With your support in the future

720
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:58,119
In Shoulong, it will be our world

721
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,320
Thanks again

722
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,079
Okay

723
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,800
Come

724
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,400
Cheers

725
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:13,440
Brother Spider's location is invalid

726
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,920
Boss, there's movement on Nanping's side

727
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:22,440
Each team leave one person, the rest support Team A

728
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,000
Have a pleasant journey

729
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,639
Lu Chen, I have arrived. Let's split up and monitor.

730
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,199
Got it.

731
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,719
I know you like me

732
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,679
but I really didn't expect you to like me this much

733
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,719
Don't look, don't look

734
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,719
I haven't left yet, I haven't left yet

735
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,159
Hello, boss

736
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,119
You finally called me back

737
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,440
What do you need from me?

738
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,800
Nothing, nothing

739
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,239
I just wanted to report to you about

740
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,440
the situation of the press conference

741
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,119
Looks like you want to leave work early, huh?

742
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,079
That's not possible

743
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,119
I'm currently on my way back to work overtime

744
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,519
If you don't believe me, listen, I'm at the subway station

745
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,559
You're flirting with girls in the subway, aren't you?

746
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:30,280
Boss, I'm at least a man

747
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,280
Can you give me some face on this matter?

748
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,480
Who are you talking to?

749
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:34,960
My boss

750
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:47,960
Let's go.

751
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,440
How is it?

752
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,519
If it weren't for me, you would have been exposed.

753
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:54,320
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

754
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,480
What are you doing?

755
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,800
Just playing the part.

756
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,679
How do you know if someone is watching you right now?

757
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:03,639
Aren't you single?

758
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,719
You're not?

759
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,599
You put Meng aside so quickly.

760
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,239
Sometimes I feel

761
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,320
being your girlfriend is really quite pitiful

762
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,400
look at you

763
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:23,199
you are standing in my girlfriend's place

764
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,639
considering things for me
