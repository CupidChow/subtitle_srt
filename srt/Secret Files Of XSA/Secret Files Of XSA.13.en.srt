00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,920
Secret filming at Azure One Base risks leaks.

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,120
I tell you to open the door!

4
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,000
If we don't agree,

5
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,190
they will end our cooperation at any time.

6
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,630
I'll kick you all out.

7
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,630
What exactly happened?

(Xizhao Provincial People's Hospital)

10
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,980
If I were you,

11
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,300
I'd go and talk in person.

12
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,220
Share your thoughts clearly with Uncle.

13
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,300
I believe you can do it.

14
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,860
Do you really trust me this much?

15
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,740
Whenever you need me,

16
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,540
I'll stand where you can see me.

17
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,380
To accompany you.

18
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,140
Hello, are you Lin Shoulong's family?

19
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,780
You can visit now.

20
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,940
Yes.

21
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,140
This way.

22
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,420
Yasheng, you're here.

23
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,700
Let's go in.

24
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,900
Sorry,
only immediate family member can enter.

25
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,540
You go inside.

26
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,860
Wait for me a moment.

27
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,980
What did the doctor say?

28
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,620
When can I be discharged?

29
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,940
Don't you see how serious this is?

30
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,500
Still wanting to be discharged,
don't you care about your life?

31
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,180
Azure One

32
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,450
is more important than my life.

33
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,210
The negotiation can't be delayed.

34
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,940
It must be done as soon as possible.

35
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,380
Alright, calm down.

36
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,340
We can't delay.

37
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,780
Stay calm, just stay calm.

38
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,540
I just don't get it.

39
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,860
What's so great about Shoulong?

40
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,420
If Shoulong Group's Azure One

41
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,260
is finished,

42
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,620
it will benefit everyone.

43
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,780
But in these past few years,

44
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,500
I've let you down.

45
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,260
Dad,

46
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,620
last time we had a good talk like this

47
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,380
should have been when I was in middle school.

48
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,660
I'm grown up now.

49
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,580
It's time for me to step up

50
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,340
and charge into battle for you.

51
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,580
Let me try handling the negotiation.

52
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,180
Weren't you not interested?

53
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,700
I'm really not,

54
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,660
even a bit annoyed.

55
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,500
But I can't just watch you

56
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,220
and Shoulong fall apart like this.

57
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,740
The difficulties Shoulong Group

58
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,420
is facing are indeed many.

59
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,140
Dad,

60
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,780
but they're not unsolvable.

61
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,020
Go ahead, tell me.

62
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,700
Lie down.

63
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,500
Close your eyes.

64
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,340
I'll talk properly.

65
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,220
Go on.

66
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,140
About the challenges Shoulong Group faces,

67
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,380
I've summarized three points.

68
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,230
First,

69
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,950
let them know Shoulong Group's strength.

70
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,260
Come in.

71
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,660
Dr. Fan, someone is here for you.

72
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,300
Dr. Fan?

73
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,140
Hello.

74
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,230
Hi.

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,220
I'm from the National Security.

76
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,900
Hello, please have a seat.

77
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,980
(National Security)
Here's my ID.

78
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,940
Please sit.

79
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,900
Thank you.

80
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,740
Here's the situation.

81
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,300
I'm here to ask you about something.

82
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,500
You performed Lin Shoulong's surgery, right?

83
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,620
Yes, I did it.

84
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,860
Was there anything unusual?

85
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,380
Unusual?

86
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,860
I mean

87
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,260
is it possible that Lin Shoulong's illness

88
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,180
was caused by medication
or human intervention?

89
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,220
Probably not.

90
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,200
I'm quite familiar with
President Lin's condition.

91
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,900
His past medical history includes

92
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,420
cardiovascular issues.

93
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,180
Recently, he's experienced

94
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,460
some mental stress
and emotional fluctuations,

95
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
triggering this acute heart attack.

96
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Here are his

97
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,380
reports and some test results.

98
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,300
You can take a look.

99
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,020
From this,

100
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,860
we can see that there's nothing unusual.

101
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,820
I need to take a photo for records.

102
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,820
Sure, no problem.

103
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,700
Thank you.

104
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,980
(Laboratory Test Report)

105
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,900
How is he?

106
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,340
My dad woke up.

107
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,700
He wants you to come in.

108
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,100
Is everything set?

109
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,100
Alright.

110
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,500
This way.

111
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,220
No issues at all.

112
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,140
Temperature's normal, take care.

113
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,180
Okay.

114
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,180
You all come.

115
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,380
President Lin, take care of yourself.

116
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,260
How are you feeling, better?

117
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,620
Much better, don't worry.

118
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,460
About this negotiation with Gapung,

119
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,260
Yasheng has done a lot of work.

120
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,650
He talked to me about it.

121
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,410
I think it makes a lot of sense.

122
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,820
Yasheng used to be a backup role

123
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,700
at the company.

124
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,060
But outsiders see clearly.

125
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,500
He understands the company's state

126
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,900
very well right now.

127
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,060
So, I think

128
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,780
he should lead this negotiation.

129
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,140
Sometimes a bold move

130
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,540
might turn out surprisingly well.

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,260
President Lin, here's the thing.

132
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,660
This negotiation is quite technical.

133
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,740
I'm worried that Yasheng...

134
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,620
Yasheng.

135
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,140
From now on, if anything comes up,

136
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,500
discuss it more with President Jin.

137
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,500
President Jin,

138
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,060
please cooperate well with him.

139
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,340
President Lin,
maybe wait until you feel better.

140
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,340
Our negotiation can be postponed.

141
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,780
President Jin,

142
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,540
I'll seek your advice later.

143
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,580
And I'll report to you
my strategies and ideas

144
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,220
about negotiating with Gapung.

145
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,770
What do you think?

146
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,420
Absolutely, I support it.

147
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,420
Alright, alright.

148
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,500
Works can be discussed later.

149
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,780
Just focus on recovery,
and take good care of yourself.

150
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,380
Thanks a lot.

151
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,340
Experts reviewed Lin Shoulong's case,

152
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,300
and found no issues.

153
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,660
I honestly didn't expect

154
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,430
Lin Yasheng would voluntarily take on
the negotiation in the end.

155
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,460
The relationship between Lin Yasheng
and his dad.

156
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,940
How should I put it.

157
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,100
It should be called
both helpless yet unbreakable.

158
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,220
He acts indifferently on the surface,

159
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,900
but actually he cares a lot about his dad.

160
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,070
Most people are like that, aren't they?

161
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,660
Since his childhood, all approached him

162
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,460
with their own motives.

163
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,140
Even if their bond isn't about
teaming up to fight enemies,

164
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,800
it should be mutual reliance to survive.

165
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,020
Don't you think

166
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,890
since Bai Keqing appeared,

167
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,750
Lin Yasheng has changed a lot?

168
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,220
Didn't you guys investigate her before?

169
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,140
Any findings?

170
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,820
The information shows Bai Keqing

171
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,590
(Bai Keqing, Gapung student)
is an orphan.

172
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,950
(Senior PR Planner)
Gifted since childhood.

173
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,390
(Gapung University)
Adopted by Gapung couple.

174
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,150
Graduated college
with continuous scholarships.

175
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,540
After her returning this time,

176
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,440
she planned to work with
an international hotel.

177
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,510
But because of Lin Yasheng,
she switched to Shoulong.

178
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,180
And made a name in Xizhao.

179
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,980
But there seems to be no issue.

180
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,020
Bai Keqing doesn't seem aggressive

181
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,680
and can easily break
the distance with people.

182
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,270
Fairly honest.

183
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,280
But,

184
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,980
her questions are always crucial.

185
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,820
Makes you feel like

186
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,780
she's not that simple.

187
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,380
A woman in love can solve cases.

188
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,620
Huh?

189
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,180
Who are you saying is in love?

190
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,100
Not me, Lin Yasheng said it.

191
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,310
But I think

192
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,760
even if she's a master of disguise,

193
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,650
we're sharp enough to notice, right?

194
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,140
While she is approaching us,

195
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,220
we're also approaching her.

196
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,870
Where are they? Not here yet?

197
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,100
Please.

198
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,540
Can you stop focusing on eating?

199
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,460
We're here to work.

200
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,220
I'm not spending public funds.

201
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,300
Besides, we're in a restaurant.

202
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,020
Everyone's eating,
just two of us staring at each other?

203
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,370
Isn't that odd?

204
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,300
Right?

205
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,860
How's the food?

206
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,820
I seriously checked this restaurant.

207
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,100
Its rank is really high.

208
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,220
The flavors are...

209
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,300
Let me give it a try.

210
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,260
You can eat,

211
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,700
but pay for yourself.

212
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,500
That's so lame.

213
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,300
Don't get stuck in negotiations.

214
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,140
Focus on Azure One's R&D Base.

215
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,740
Now it's your turn.

216
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,940
These are all yours.

217
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,060
Young Mr. Lin and President Lin
are different.

218
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,190
We're having such a formal negotiation,

219
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,620
yet meeting in a place like this.

220
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,380
Chinese Compressor Factory's data.

221
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,820
You've seen it, right?

222
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,100
Products from these OEM factory

223
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,860
are technically second-tier.

224
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,420
No comparison with our compressors.

225
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,180
We're not the top tier,

226
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,020
but we can get the things done.

227
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,060
As far as I know,

228
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,020
your group's project

229
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,860
is a national key project

230
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,540
with strict commitments.

231
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,300
If you use Chinese compressors,

232
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,870
I'm afraid the product performance

233
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,500
will have significant flaws.

234
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,740
Let me tell you,

235
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,260
I'm different from President Lin.

236
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,900
He's a perfectionist.

237
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,940
Can't accept imperfections.

238
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,460
But I can.

239
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,700
I think we can launch first.

240
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,490
Then continuously optimize

241
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,100
based on the market feedback.

242
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,860
Maybe we can even create

243
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,620
something better suited for the local market.

244
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,260
As for the timeline,

245
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,100
a day early or late,

246
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,100
I'm not in a hurry.

247
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,830
President Lin, give me ten minutes to think.

248
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,980
Twenty minutes.

249
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,380
Alright.

250
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,500
Buddy, let's go.

251
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,820
Yasheng, how's the negotiation going?

252
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,860
Feels great.

253
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,860
It'd be perfect if President Lin was here.

254
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,300
He'd be proud of you.

255
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,260
President Lin,

256
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,740
after discussing with my team,

257
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,640
we agree to make concessions.

258
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,820
No longer insisting on tech exchange,

259
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,250
but hoping for tech equity investment.

260
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,250
What do you think?

261
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,900
You should've said it earlier.

262
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,060
That's great.

263
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,420
Looking forward to your guidance
and support moving forward.

264
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,820
Thanks.

265
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,180
President Lin,

266
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,580
since we've decided to collaborate,

267
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,420
I have one more small request.

268
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,620
Go ahead.

269
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,420
I've heard Zhongjing Chip's tech

270
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,540
is suspected of
defrauding national subsidies.

271
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,020
To be cautious, we'd like a tour

272
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,740
of the Azure One R&D Base.

273
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,860
Seeing is believing.

274
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,700
It's just a temporary visit.

275
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,340
It should be possible.

276
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
After all, seeing is believing,

277
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,860
rumors will naturally fade away.

278
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,740
Young Mr. Lin,

279
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,060
I think this matter

280
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,660
should be consulted with President Lin.

281
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,420
You know my dad's health condition.

282
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,380
Let's not stress him out.

283
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,180
Just a quick visit.

284
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,820
- Just looking around.
- Right.

285
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,220
Not enter the core area, don't worry.

286
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,860
President Jin,

287
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,940
please don't destroy

288
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,860
our hard-earned agreement.

289
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,020
What's wrong? Is it tough?

290
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,580
Or is the Zhongjing Chip not ready?

291
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,740
No,

292
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,660
I'll arrange it now.

293
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,540
President Lin, looking forward to guidance
and support moving forward.

294
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,540
I'll arrange the car.

295
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,980
(Gapung heading to Azure One Base.)

296
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,020
(With covert cams and jammers.)

297
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,060
Feijiang,

298
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,140
Lin Yasheng is taking Gapung

299
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,740
to visit the Azure One R&D base.

300
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,860
Thunderbolt has found

301
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,740
Gapung probably had

302
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,210
covert cameras and jammers.

303
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,180
Secret filming at Azure One Base risks leaks.

304
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,020
Using jammers,

305
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,580
they might launch a remote attack.

306
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,740
Orders are to prevent them
from approaching the base.

307
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,660
Xiaolong, send the address to Feijiang.

308
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,500
Got it.

309
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,740
(Shoulong Technology Industrial Park)

310
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,620
Seatbelt.

311
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,700
President Lin, welcome to visit Gapung
whenever you can.

312
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,700
He's tired.

313
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,580
Nurse, I feel much better now.

314
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,260
I can be discharged.

315
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,860
Don't rush to leave.

316
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,220
Once you are here,

317
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,130
the doctor decides your discharge.

318
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,180
President Lin needs rest.

319
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,030
Step aside.

320
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,670
- President Jin.
- I have something to...

321
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,580
President Lin, something happened.

322
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,860
What happened?

323
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,740
Keep your voice down.

324
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,620
Get out.

325
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,540
Patient needs quiet.

326
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,380
Get out!

327
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,540
President Lin,
Gapung's representative suddenly

328
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,750
supposed to visit ZJ Base.

329
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,660
Young Mr. Lin has already taken them there.

330
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,620
Visiting the base?

331
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,380
The negotiation were going smoothly.

332
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,580
But the Gapung rep

333
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,340
suddenly requested to visit ZJ Base.

334
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,540
Judging by the situation, if we don't agree,

335
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,940
they will end our cooperation at any time.

336
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,780
Yasheng is worried about your health,

337
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,180
so they didn't inform you earlier.

338
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,300
But I'm really concerned.

339
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,140
No way.

340
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,260
I'd rather halt the negotiation

341
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,540
than let anyone from Gapung enter the base.

342
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,700
Call him right now.

343
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,700
(Jin Chuan)

344
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,660
He doesn't answer the phone.

345
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,820
What are you doing here?

346
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,980
Who let you in?

347
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,300
Don't worry, President Lin.

348
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,060
I'll definitely protect Azure One.

349
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,100
Get out.

350
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,900
Leave now.

351
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,420
Health is important, President Lin.

352
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,340
Rest more.

353
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,540
Lu,

354
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,980
Lin Yasheng is just one intersection.

355
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,820
How much longer?

356
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,900
One minute.

357
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,020
Sit tight.

358
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,780
(Emergency Exit)

359
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,860
Open the door.

360
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,870
Vice President Lin will tour
Gapung guests.

361
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,140
Tour?

362
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,300
Got a pass?

363
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,180
No, don't you understand?

364
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,940
The group's eldest son.

365
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,740
Lin Yasheng, Young Mr. Lin.

366
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,820
Hurry up.

367
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,780
Here's the thing,

368
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,140
we have rules here.

369
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,820
Without President Lin's special pass,

370
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,660
no one can visit freely.

371
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,060
Don't you want to work here?

372
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,850
- Hold on.
- Sir.

373
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,220
Sir.

374
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,740
Who's in charge here?

375
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,580
Me.

376
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,340
Open the door.

377
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
I can't open it.

378
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,580
Don't you know who I am?

379
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,980
You don't recognize him?

380
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,820
No wonder you got

381
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,980
President Lin hospitalized.

382
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,980
Unbelievable!

383
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,580
Go tell your leaser.

384
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,220
Vice President Jin has arranged it all.

385
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,140
Sorry.

386
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,460
Even if our leader comes today,

387
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,020
without President Lin's special pass

388
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,580
he also can't get in.

389
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,340
Open the door.

390
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,340
I tell you to open the door!

391
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,140
Hurry.

392
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,060
Can't open it.

393
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
Don't fight, don't fight.

394
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,340
Stop it.

395
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,660
President Lin, what's going on?

396
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,460
Nothing.

397
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,700
Just ran into a fool.

398
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,550
It'll be handled soon.

399
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,100
Young Mr. Lin.

400
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,500
Yasheng, I just came from President Lin's.

401
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,460
He said no one can enter the R&D base.

402
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,380
You find my dad again.

403
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,540
Haven't I told you?

404
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,660
Don't go to him for anything.

405
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,140
President Lin got kinda upset
when he heard this.

406
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,220
I'm telling you,

407
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,940
if anything happens to my dad,

408
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,700
I'll kick you all out.

409
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,300
Mr. Jiang, my apologies.

410
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,660
There's a small issue.

411
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It will be resolved soon.

412
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,500
Don't worry, don't worry.

413
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,660
With Young Mr. Lin here,

414
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,820
everything's under control.

415
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,740
Since Shoulong Group's attitude is like this,

416
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,220
what are we waiting for?

417
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,600
The terms of today's negotiation.

418
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,930
Let's discuss it another day.

419
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,470
Goodbye.

420
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,240
Wait, Jiang.

421
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,860
Can you handle this or not?

422
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,980
Didn't you see my signal?

423
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,100
Still hit too hard.

424
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,410
I thought you wanted me to
act more realistically with you.

425
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,260
Hello.

426
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,700
We've got it under control here.

427
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,980
Lin Yasheng went to find Lin Shoulong.

428
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,720
Don't know what's going on with Lin Shoulong.

429
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,900
Alright, got it.

430
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,420
Hold on, Matt's calling.

431
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,300
Gotta go.

432
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,940
(VIPER)

433
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,550
Hello, boss.

434
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,220
Half an hour? That urgent?

435
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,640
Alright, I'm on my way.

436
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,100
We'll settle this later.

437
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,860
(Jinkai International Apartments)

438
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,420
Bro, what does boss want from me?

439
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,420
Wear it.

440
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,820
Still need to wear a mask?

441
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,670
What are we doing?

442
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,820
Just wear it, no more nonsense.

443
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,460
It's not that, it's just...

444
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,940
About the money, you know?

445
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,060
Get lost.

446
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,700
Boss wants us to investigate someone.

447
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,300
To check if she's from Shura.

448
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,820
Go.

449
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,740
Who are we investigating, bro?

450
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,140
Bro, bro!

451
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,380
Just using force?

452
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,060
What else? Isn't that obvious?

453
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,140
Aren't you wearing a mask? Why worry?

454
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,540
Bro, bro!

455
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,500
No need, no need.

456
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,540
Let me do this, let me.

457
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,740
You've done this before, huh?

458
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,420
- Where you learned it?
- Forced by life.

459
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,860
Let me use it for a moment.

460
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,020
Know who to check now?

461
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,900
Copy everything.

462
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,220
Let's go.

463
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,260
(Xizhao Provincial People's Hospital)

464
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,000
Seems if Lin Shoulong is still alive,

465
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,580
all our plans will be on hold.

466
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,100
So...

467
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,500
Keqing.

468
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,900
Yasheng.

469
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,260
How's Uncle going?

470
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,660
My dad's fine.

471
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,070
Are these flowers for him?

472
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,820
I'm worried he might not like them.

473
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,540
You'd better go take care of uncle first.

474
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,780
He'll like them.

475
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,020
Alright, alright.

476
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,900
No need to say more, I get it.

477
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,020
Don't worry.

478
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,500
My dad's fine.

479
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,820
Yasheng,

480
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,580
speak properly once inside.

481
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,460
You've done really well.

482
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,820
Did the Gapung People enter?

483
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,300
You're keeping an eye here.

484
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,380
How could I let them in?

485
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,940
That's good.

486
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,340
Ready?

487
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,020
Report, we're ready.

488
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,860
This is the heart disruptor.

489
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,020
Just set it to one.

490
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,300
His heart will fail immediately.

491
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,500
No one will know.

492
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,700
If you want him to die faster.

493
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,500
The higher the value, the faster he dies.

494
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,380
You do it.

495
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,380
Take it.

496
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,780
I can't.

497
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,780
Father.

498
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,420
Useless!

499
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,020
We were set to sign today.

500
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,860
`But...

501
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,660
That's not important.

502
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,100
We can't let Azure One

503
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,300
have any risks now.

504
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,500
Shoulong,

505
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,180
Azure One.

506
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,700
Are they really that crucial?

507
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,540
Son,

508
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,860
your dad just wants to
build a national enterprise

509
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,460
that takes social responsibility.

510
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,830
Look at our Shoulong Group,

511
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,500
it's growing bigger.

512
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,020
Once Azure One succeeds,

513
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,180
it'll benefit so many people.

514
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,820
I just didn't expect

515
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,020
time flies so fast.

516
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,580
In a blink, you've grown up.

517
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,340
Dad,

518
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,900
please get better soon.

519
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,340
Azure One needs you.

520
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,420
Alright, I promise you.

521
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,580
Get well soon.

522
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,380
So I can support you
in doing what you want to do.

523
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,970
Alright, it's a deal.

524
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,530
From now on, I'll follow your lead at work.

525
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,700
But you must follow mine in life.

526
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,620
Alright, I will.

527
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,460
Listen to me?

528
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,740
Seriously?

529
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,580
Yes, I will.

530
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,860
Hurry up.

531
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,660
Come on, pinky swear.

532
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,860
Alright.

533
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,540
Dad.

534
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,420
Dad.

535
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,900
Dad.

536
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,180
Dad.

537
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,100
Dad.

538
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,220
Dad!

539
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,580
Dad!

540
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,420
Doctor!

541
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,620
Dad.

542
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,300
Doctor! someone help!

543
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,260
Useless!

544
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,320
Dad!

545
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,220
Someone, come! Dad.

546
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,460
Take the family member out.

547
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,500
Dad!

548
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,740
Doctor, save him quickly!

549
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,940
Dad.

550
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,500
Dad!

551
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,780
Dad!

552
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,380
Dad!

553
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,500
Prep cardiotonic injection!

554
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,460
Dad!

555
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,620
Dad.

556
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,260
Dad.

557
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,780
Dad!

558
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,060
What's wrong, Young Mr. Lin? What's going on?

559
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,180
Go save my dad!

560
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,060
President Lin!

561
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,500
Keqing.

562
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,700
Keqing.

563
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,540
Keqing!

564
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,980
Keqing.

565
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,260
Keqing.

566
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,660
Keqing.

567
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,580
Keqing.

568
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,060
My dad is not going to make it.

569
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,820
He's not going to make it.

570
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,100
How did this happen?

571
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,210
What exactly happened?

572
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,860
(Lin Shoulong's death seems weird,
investigate quickly.)

573
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,740
(Security Department)

574
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,900
- Captain Sha, right?
- Yes.

575
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,740
Hello.

576
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,050
I'm from National Security.

577
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,300
Here are my investigation documents and ID.

578
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,020
Retrieve all surveillance

579
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,290
for this period from hospital

580
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,540
entrances and exits as well as

581
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,140
this ward's interior and exterior.

582
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,020
May I ask what caused Lin Shoulong's death?

583
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,990
Due to the patient's extreme emotion

584
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,860
overworking the heart,

585
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,100
leading to broken blood vessels.

586
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,140
Send us Lin Shoulong's related information.

587
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,460
We need to conduct
medical and toxicology tests.

588
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,460
Hold on a moment.

589
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,660
One minute and 42 seconds.

590
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,060
Only Lin Yasheng and his son were there.

591
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,340
Bai Keqing and Lin Shoulong
didn't have direct contact.

592
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,740
Lin Shoulong wasn't agitated then.

593
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,620
In such a short time,

594
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,460
how did this happen?

595
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,180
Where was Bai Keqing
before coming to hospital?

596
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,420
At home.

597
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,580
Distance from home to hospital

598
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,290
is basically consistent with the time taken.

599
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,780
That's strange.

600
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,060
Why is SAD investigating her?

601
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,460
Did she approach Lin Yasheng with a motive?

602
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,700
The videos are all intact.

603
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,020
No one else came in.

604
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,420
Could it be

605
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,460
really an accident?

606
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,940
In our field, nothing's accidental.

607
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,460
If there is,

608
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,700
it's just pre-planned
to make people believe it.

609
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,800
Expand scope of video surveillance,
keep looking.

610
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,820
Hold on a second.

611
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,940
Lu, you keep investigating.

612
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,830
Need emergency leave!

613
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,740
What's wrong with her?

614
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,140
Did she discover anything?

615
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,980
I don't know.

616
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,020
Xiaolong, rewind and play it again.

617
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,860
Okay.

618
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,540
Come on.

619
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,500
Watch closely, everyone.

620
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,740
(Oncology Center)

621
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,540
(Inpatient Medical Record)
Breast cancer.

622
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,660
When did this happen?

623
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,830
Why didn't you tell me?

624
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,460
Didn't someone also fail to

625
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,380
tell me what she does for living?

626
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,100
Looks like we both have secrets.

627
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,220
We all have things we need to bear.

628
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,700
Alright.

629
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,740
What did the doctor say?

630
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,260
I'm doing pre-surgery tests now.

631
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,740
If surgery is needed,

632
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,860
I'll let you know to sign for me.

633
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,140
I'm sorry.

634
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,980
It's my fault.

635
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,220
It's fine, don't worry.

636
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,420
After surgery finished, it'll be okay.

637
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,180
I've raised you well already.

638
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,380
I'm the one who should cry.

639
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,620
Why?

640
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,980
Is it because it hurts a lot?

641
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,580
Silly child.

642
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,540
My own sweetheart

643
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,340
is doing a dangerous job,

644
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,020
yet hiding it from mom.

645
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,020
Shouldn't mom

646
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,420
cry out because of fear?

647
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,700
(Azure One Base structure diagram,
please receive.)

648
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,130
(Lin Shoulong is dead. If Lin Yasheng rises,)

649
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,820
(negotiation with Gapung will speed up.)

650
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,000
Class is over.

651
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,020
Goodbye.

652
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,460
Boss,

653
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,660
how's the Operation Annihilation prep?

654
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,460
Missing two electronic components.

655
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,260
What about yours?

656
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,300
Hurrying with installation.

657
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,500
Tomorrow's shipment,

658
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,800
let Huo Min pick it up.

659
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
Huo Min?

660
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,420
Can he be trusted?

661
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,100
I've verified the map he gave me.

662
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,940
No issues.

663
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,060
How's the investigation on Bai Keqing?

664
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,380
Huo Min and I have checked her place.

665
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,620
Is it related to Shura?

666
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,660
Probably not.

667
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,860
By the way,

668
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,300
this is what we found at her home.

669
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,570
Busy yourself.

670
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,940
Yes.

671
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,700
Lin Shoulong's death probe is reassigned.

672
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,700
Now we must assist Huo Min
to get the components.

673
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,980
Control involved people.

674
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,260
Whose case is this?

675
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,100
It's mine.

676
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,140
Come over here.

677
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,940
Please open it.

678
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,420
What's inside?

679
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,380
It's just a product sample.

680
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,820
I don't know
about the details.

681
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,220
My friend asked me to bring it
for a domestic client.

682
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,740
I have customs documents. Check them.

683
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,980
Where are the documents?

684
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,820
Here they are.

685
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,700
(Customs Ex & Im Declaration Form
of the People's Republic of China)

686
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,860
Alright, you can go.

687
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,100
Where is you?

688
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,460
On your right.

689
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,800
- Got the money?
- Where is the stuff?

690
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,540
Be careful, someone's watching.

691
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,180
Abort the mission! Abort!

692
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,660
Hey, cancel the order.

693
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,740
I've arrived and you want to cancel it?

694
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,100
Okay, fine.

695
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,500
Boss, we're being tailed.

696
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,980
You guys retreat. Leave the rest to me.

697
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,820
