1
00:00:58,749 --> 00:00:59,777
- Hey!
- Oh, Ma'am.

2
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:01,273
- Are you on your phone again?
- Good morning, Ma'am.

3
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:02,341
Where's Arnold?

4
00:01:02,383 --> 00:01:03,634
I don't know, Ma'am.

5
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,999
- Where's Arnold?
- I have no idea, Ma'am.

6
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,085
Oh, Ma'am! I'm sorry.

7
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,037
We're not allowed
to do that here.

8
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,352
Someone might see us.

9
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:32,229
Is anyone here?

10
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:35,544
There's no one around.
You're such a scaredy-cat.

11
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,752
I've got you.

12
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:24,315
Hey! Where are you off to?

13
00:03:24,316 --> 00:03:25,568
Where are you going?

14
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:27,319
Uh, Ma'am. Good morning.

15
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:30,297
Where’s Arnold? A guest
just got robbed outside!

16
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:31,949
I saw him inside there, Ma'am.

17
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:07,484
What are you two doing?

18
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:12,573
You know I strictly forbid staff from
getting involved with guests, don't you?

19
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:14,008
Uh, Ma’am...

20
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,201
It’s because... it was her, Ma'am.

21
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:18,561
What? Why me? It's your fault!

22
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:22,086
There's a guest outside
claiming you stole from them!

23
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:23,326
Oh!

24
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:26,238
No, Ma'am. I'm sorry.
That wasn't me, Ma'am.

25
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,377
Please don't fire me, Ma'am.

26
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:29,815
Pack up your things now!

27
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,174
- Ma'am, I need...
- Get out of here!

28
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,534
Ma'am, I really need this job, Ma'am.
I'm so sorry, Ma'am.

29
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:35,070
- Ma'am, I'm sorry...
- Just leave!

30
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:36,429
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I didn't...
that wasn't me.

31
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:39,165
Get out now!
Or I'll call the police!

32
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:43,519
No. I'll just go then.
I'm truly sorry, Ma'am.

33
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:46,506
And you?

34
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,134
You know what you did
was against the rules, right?

35
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,861
What if someone had seen you?

36
00:04:50,886 --> 00:04:54,223
Well, sis, I couldn't help it. I've
been staring at him for a while now.

37
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:56,368
He's so handsome. And
he's really good at it, too.

38
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,112
You really don't think
things through, do you?

39
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:01,029
I'm barely holding back
myself too, you know.

40
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:02,664
So just let him go back.

41
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,825
No. Rules are rules.

42
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:08,840
You're annoying. [chuckles]

43
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:26,693
- The service is taking forever.
- Right? Where is it?

44
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,937
Ma'am, I apologize for the delay.

45
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:32,073
Your service is so slow!

46
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:36,907
There are a lot of guests at the bar.
And there are only two of us working there.

47
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:39,742
What are you waiting for?

48
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:43,736
That’s a bit harsh, huh?

49
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,293
You're harsh.

50
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:51,731
If you're too lenient and nice,
they'll just get complacent.

51
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,508
I guess you have a point.
But try to be less of a terror, sis.

52
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:56,533
No way.

53
00:05:57,344 --> 00:06:00,650
So... who's going to replace
the handsome gardener?

54
00:06:01,304 --> 00:06:02,805
I already put out a call.

55
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:04,717
He has to be handsome, too!

56
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:08,018
So every time I come here, I'll
have someone nice to look at.

57
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:09,420
Of course.

58
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:10,648
Perfect!

59
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:11,716
[laughing]

60
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,937
Jason Gomez?

61
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:26,536
So, what?

62
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,097
Are you always going to look down?

63
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,118
How will you take orders from me?

64
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:37,842
You can't be glum all
the time here either.

65
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:39,755
Or have such a serious face.

66
00:06:41,597 --> 00:06:46,442
You need to... always be smiling
to keep the guests happy.

67
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:48,187
Do you understand?

68
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:50,646
Yes.

69
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:56,403
Why did you leave the rice mill?
They fired you, didn't they?

70
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:01,382
No, Ma'am. The warehouse
just closed down.

71
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:04,862
What was your job there?

72
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:11,179
All-around, Ma'am. Whatever
my boss told me to do, I did it.

73
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,051
Look at me!

74
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:40,466
Uh. Ma'am! Ma'am... I'm a hard worker.

75
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:45,645
And I don't complain either.
I'll do everything you ask of me.

76
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,316
And... Ma'am, I'm a nice person.
Ma'am. I'm a nice person.

77
00:07:56,346 --> 00:07:58,765
Okay. You can start.

78
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:01,092
Really? When?

79
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,653
- Take care of this.
- Yes, Ma'am.

80
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:04,432
Right now! Go!

81
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:06,681
Thank you, Ma'am!

82
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,867
- Ma'am, thank you.
- Congrats! Congrats!

83
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:11,236
- Thank you.
- We have someone good-looking here now.

84
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:12,562
Thank you!

85
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:46,946
Those are indoor plants.

86
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:52,036
But sometimes, you have to
take them outside for some sun.

87
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:57,836
It's like a woman...
She can’t always just stay inside.

88
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:01,426
She needs to be taken out, too.

89
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,631
What about you? Do you
have a girlfriend to take out?

90
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:08,344
No, I don't.

91
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:10,956
With how handsome you are?

92
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:17,271
You know... if you were my boyfriend,
I wouldn't let you out.

93
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:21,608
Wow. You are really so hardworking.

94
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:23,652
I've been watching you from the window.

95
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:25,603
- Yes, I have to.
- Lira!

96
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,885
- Yes, Ma'am?
- Go to the reception desk now.

97
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:29,276
Right away, Ma’am.

98
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:32,856
And why are you wearing slippers?

99
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:34,175
Ah... Ma'am?

100
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:36,039
Slippers are not allowed here!

101
00:10:36,373 --> 00:10:38,726
- I'm sorry. I don't have...
- Wear rubber shoes tomorrow, got it?

102
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,419
I don't have one, Ma'am.

103
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:43,881
Besides, I only wore
slippers at my old job too.

104
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,383
That’s ridiculous!

105
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:57,995
You've been watering that for ages.
It just rained.

106
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,632
Oh, Ma'am. I'm sorry.

107
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:06,695
You know... of all the
things I hate, it's stupidity.

108
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:10,449
I also don't want you
flirting with any of the staff!

109
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:13,619
And I get annoyed with lazy people!

110
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:16,079
What are you smiling at?

111
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,002
Ma'am... you told me I should
always be smiling to be welcoming.

112
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:23,754
[heavy sigh]

113
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:38,726
What's that?

114
00:12:00,624 --> 00:12:01,624
What's this?

115
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:04,293
What is that?

116
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,027
Uh, Ma'am! I have no idea.

117
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:11,885
I just saw it floating
while I was walking.

118
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:14,686
What idiot would leave that there?

119
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,349
Uh, Ma'am, but what is this?

120
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,142
Can't you see?

121
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:23,626
That's what women or gays use
privately when they don't have a partner.

122
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,603
Don't you even have a
phone or a computer?

123
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,944
Ma'am, no, I don't.

124
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:32,281
- Give that to me!
- Alright then.

125
00:12:33,657 --> 00:12:34,657
Here you go.

126
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,829
- Just give it to Lira.
- Okay.

127
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:46,378
Ugh! It's tough working these days.

128
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,131
Beats me. Making money’s tough, huh?

129
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:50,385
True!

130
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:55,262
Lira! Lira! Hold on!

131
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:57,806
Ma'am wants you to keep this.

132
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:01,941
That's huge! Shit!

133
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,131
A dildo!

134
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:09,631
Uh, I saw it earlier.
Floating near the pool.

135
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:12,003
So I took it out.

136
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:16,535
Our boss said to have you keep it
for now, in case someone looks for it.

137
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:19,940
Why doesn't she
just hide it herself?

138
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:22,003
Since she has one of those too.

139
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:24,040
She has one of those?

140
00:13:24,857 --> 00:13:28,181
Well you know… I'm the
one who cleans her office.

141
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:30,287
I saw one in her bathroom.

142
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:34,166
Uh, so... she doesn't
have a boyfriend?

143
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,898
She's a monster!
Guys are scared of her.

144
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:40,908
She did have a boyfriend abroad once...

145
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,868
but she came home because
she had her heart broken.

146
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:46,828
- Here, Lira. You keep it.
- Hm?

147
00:13:47,063 --> 00:13:48,255
So you have a toy.

148
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:50,357
Hey! I don't need something like that.

149
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:53,073
I've got living people
who play with me like that.

150
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:56,838
They're not that huge,
but they're good enough.

151
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:58,535
You're such a flirt!

152
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,770
Do you want to play with me, Jason?

153
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:04,122
- Well, how old are you?
- Uh, 28.

154
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:07,434
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

155
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:10,712
Uh, yeah. Once.

156
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:14,591
But when she married
someone else, that was it.

157
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:17,761
Since then, I don't
want to love again.

158
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,042
I've been hurt, you know?

159
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:23,682
I won't hurt you.
I'll make you happy.

160
00:14:23,707 --> 00:14:24,707
That’s a promise!

161
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:26,254
Stop that.

162
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:28,146
Not me, Dahlia!

163
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:29,480
I'm already married.

164
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:32,628
But your husband left you and
took your kid to the province.

165
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:36,612
We've talked. I'm just saving money,
and I'm going back home to them.

166
00:14:36,637 --> 00:14:38,639
Hmph! Just give it to me!

167
00:14:39,783 --> 00:14:40,951
Later, okay?

168
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:42,781
Why?

169
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:45,872
We'll play and see how
slippery things can get.

170
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:48,281
Here, Lira.

171
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:53,004
This woman is such a flirt.

172
00:15:35,297 --> 00:15:36,297
Hey!

173
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:37,966
Why are you here?

174
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:41,000
They might wake up.

175
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:46,364
Shh! Don't worry. They're
too drunk. They won’t wake up.

176
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,018
Don't you want me here?

177
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:53,636
What about Dahlia?
She might look for you.

178
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:56,359
Come on. She's already snoring.

179
00:15:57,736 --> 00:15:59,237
So why are you here, really?

180
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,241
What do you mean?
We're going to play.

181
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:05,952
Huh? What game?

182
00:16:08,163 --> 00:16:10,415
Don't worry about it.
I've got this.

183
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,464
Wait. Hold on. Stop.

184
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:21,509
What now? I'll take care of you.

185
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:26,979
Wait a second.

186
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:29,034
Why?

187
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:31,326
Why are you doing this to me?

188
00:16:32,472 --> 00:16:35,309
From the first moment I
saw you, I already liked you.

189
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:01,007
No one can ever know about this.

190
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:02,509
Ugh!

191
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:29,544
I'm cumming!

192
00:21:31,193 --> 00:21:32,193
Almost there!

193
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:58,225
Hey, Jason! Where are you going?

194
00:21:58,322 --> 00:22:00,276
Uh, I was going to do laundry.

195
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:02,982
But it’s okay, I'll
just do it later tonight.

196
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:05,352
What are you talking about?
Come on. Go ahead and start.

197
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:07,171
These tablecloths are almost done.

198
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,024
You can load yours next.

199
00:22:10,715 --> 00:22:11,924
No, it’s okay.

200
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,540
I'll just do this by hand.

201
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:15,828
I actually don't know
how to use that machine.

202
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,730
It's easy! Come here, I'll teach you.

203
00:22:21,202 --> 00:22:22,953
- Alright.
- Like this.

204
00:22:22,954 --> 00:22:23,996
How do you use it?

205
00:22:23,997 --> 00:22:27,416
- First, you turn the power on.
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:29,872
Then next, you add the water.

207
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,837
Set how much water you need.

208
00:22:31,862 --> 00:22:34,823
Next, how many minutes
for the wash. And the rinse.

209
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:38,094
That’s all. I'm just
gonna scrub these first.

210
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:41,762
So that's how you use it.

211
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:49,022
Uh, hold on. Why are
you washing that by hand?

212
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:52,652
It's only a few items, so I
decided to just do it by hand.

213
00:22:53,776 --> 00:22:54,776
Mm-hmm.

214
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:00,324
Jason?

215
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:03,518
Jason, our boss has
been looking for you.

216
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:06,694
You should go see her. She's in her office.
She might get angry again.

217
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:08,356
Uh, okay.

218
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:12,165
Dahlia, I'm gonna go first.
Our boss is asking for me.

219
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,096
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Oh, thank you, by the way.

220
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:15,121
Sure.

221
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:21,454
What about you, Dahlia,
still busy with the laundry, huh?

222
00:23:22,597 --> 00:23:23,682
Hey!

223
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:27,685
Ooh!

224
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:30,063
Is this his?

225
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:33,900
[sniffing] Hmm!

226
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:38,654
Seriously, Lira! Why are
you even touching that?

227
00:23:39,322 --> 00:23:42,075
Mmm! I can totally smell it!

228
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:46,996
Put that back!
Jason might see you!

229
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:49,515
Why don’t you take a sniff too!
It smells so good!

230
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,958
Ew! You are so gross!

231
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:53,515
- Come on, just try it!
- No way!

232
00:23:53,939 --> 00:23:55,232
It smells so good!

233
00:23:56,691 --> 00:23:59,761
Look at this! It's huge!
You know the deal!

234
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:00,949
Yuck!

235
00:24:03,257 --> 00:24:04,717
Ew! You can have it.

236
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:07,031
- Don't you want a huge one?
- No, thanks!

237
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,092
Geez! It’s our boss.

238
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:12,872
Dahlia, I'll be working overtime, alright?
I think Ma'am wants me to do something.

239
00:24:12,897 --> 00:24:14,529
She has something she needs finished.

240
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:16,150
- [sighs]
- Alright.

241
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,494
Ma'am? Yes, Ma'am Isabel?

242
00:24:25,368 --> 00:24:27,930
She's gone now. Let's take a look.

243
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,442
Wow, it really is big!

244
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:34,985
[sniffing] Hmm!

245
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:36,833
And it smells good.

246
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:42,468
[sniffs]

247
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,681
[sniffs]

248
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:49,505
This underwear is big!

249
00:24:49,806 --> 00:24:53,310
It's huge! And it seems to smell good!

250
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:55,189
[sniffs] Hmm!

251
00:24:55,998 --> 00:25:00,246
He's huge! This pair is big!

252
00:25:02,071 --> 00:25:03,489
[sniffs] Hmm!

253
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,541
Oh, Ma'am!

254
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,793
Good evening!

255
00:25:15,908 --> 00:25:16,951
Please come in.

256
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:20,609
- I have…
- Have a seat.

257
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:23,705
I have something to give you.

258
00:25:24,312 --> 00:25:25,372
Try it on.

259
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:26,810
Ma'am, what is this?

260
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,637
Just try it on to see if it fits you.

261
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:33,502
Is this for me?

262
00:25:44,852 --> 00:25:46,019
They're beautiful.

263
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,963
You finally look decent.

264
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:55,208
They're lovely, Ma'am!

265
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,989
I'm deducting that
from your salary, okay?

266
00:25:58,285 --> 00:25:59,662
Yes, Ma'am, thank you.

267
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:03,590
This is the first time
I've had new shoes...

268
00:26:03,851 --> 00:26:05,561
since high school.

269
00:26:08,308 --> 00:26:10,549
Well, I’m still taking
that from your pay.

270
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:12,265
Yes, Ma'am.

271
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,148
Take this as well.

272
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:23,757
Uh, Ma'am, what is this?

273
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,986
Wear that later at the swimming pool.

274
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:29,617
Use it.

275
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:33,538
Is this for me?

276
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:34,891
Yes, it's for you.

277
00:26:40,628 --> 00:26:43,464
Ma'am, I don't really
wear things like this.

278
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:45,625
- But... Why not?
- Besides...

279
00:26:46,175 --> 00:26:47,260
It's embarrassing.

280
00:26:48,886 --> 00:26:52,265
Well, you have a great body,
why would you be embarrassed?

281
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:57,766
Alright, Ma'am. Thank you again.

282
00:26:58,854 --> 00:27:00,314
I’ll wear this later.

283
00:27:05,528 --> 00:27:06,862
Wow, this is great.

284
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:09,407
It suits me perfectly. It's good.

285
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:11,172
This too!

286
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:14,370
This suits me as well. I've never
worn anything like this before.

287
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:25,298
- Oh! Geez! Sorry!
- Hey!

288
00:27:25,464 --> 00:27:27,216
Why didn't you knock?

289
00:27:27,592 --> 00:27:30,344
I heard someone was here,
so I just came in.

290
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:36,058
Besides, your door was slightly open.
Go cover yourself up.

291
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:41,952
- It's fine now.
- All good?

292
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:42,977
I'm covered with the blanket.

293
00:27:45,943 --> 00:27:46,961
Gross!

294
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:50,531
Wow! New shoes, huh?

295
00:27:50,906 --> 00:27:52,106
- Yeah.
- Where'd you get them?

296
00:27:52,825 --> 00:27:54,035
Our boss gave them to me.

297
00:27:54,535 --> 00:27:56,037
Oh, wait, I owe her.

298
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:58,039
She's deducting it from my pay.

299
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:02,821
Yeah, all staff are required
to wear white sneakers here.

300
00:28:04,128 --> 00:28:06,297
But why are you only
wearing your briefs?

301
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,884
I was about to change clothes...

302
00:28:10,134 --> 00:28:12,178
I was just trying on my new shoes.

303
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,555
And then you just walked in.

304
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:20,345
I was just going to tell you I put
your clothes in the wash. See?

305
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,940
Oh, right. I forgot.

306
00:28:25,191 --> 00:28:27,026
Okay. They might be done.

307
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:31,530
- Probably. You just have to hang them up.
- Alright, then.

308
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:35,326
- Oh, geez!
- I'm sorry!

309
00:28:37,078 --> 00:28:39,038
This guy, seriously.

310
00:28:44,696 --> 00:28:47,004
Hmm. This smells good, though.

311
00:28:48,047 --> 00:28:49,715
It smells nice, I approve.

312
00:29:22,198 --> 00:29:23,198
Uh?

313
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:25,605
Where's Lira?

314
00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:28,061
She's not here.
She's working overtime.

315
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:32,299
Do you need help? Huh?

316
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:25,399
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

317
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:27,556
So good.

318
00:30:31,277 --> 00:30:32,433
Go deeper!

319
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:20,461
I’m cumming!

320
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:54,638
Who’s that?

321
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:07,425
Help! Help!

322
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,160
I'm drowning!

323
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:14,600
[coughing]

324
00:35:28,614 --> 00:35:29,614
Ma'am?

325
00:35:29,907 --> 00:35:30,907
Ma'am?

326
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:32,283
Wake up.

327
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:33,970
Ma'am?

328
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:36,357
- Ma'am, wake up.
- [coughing]

329
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:38,292
Ma'am?

330
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:43,294
Ahh, it hurts.

331
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:44,529
Okay, Ma'am. Take it easy.

332
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:50,761
- How are you feeling, Ma'am?
- My foot hurts.

333
00:35:51,011 --> 00:35:54,013
Where? Let me do this.
I'll massage it.

334
00:35:54,014 --> 00:35:56,642
Ah! Easy now. That hurts.

335
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:04,035
What happened?

336
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:05,202
Ma'am!

337
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:07,171
I just saw her...

338
00:36:07,978 --> 00:36:09,312
drowning.

339
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:10,810
I think she had a cramp.

340
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:16,182
Wait, don't leave yet.
It might start hurting again.

341
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:18,793
Yes, Ma'am. I'll watch
over you for a while.

342
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:20,949
Are you okay now?

343
00:36:21,282 --> 00:36:22,617
A little better, sis.

344
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:24,389
Thanks, Jason.

345
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:28,554
If you don't have anything else
to do, Jason, you can go now.

346
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:30,799
I'll leave her with you, Ma'am?

347
00:36:32,261 --> 00:36:33,387
Okay. I’ll go ahead.

348
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:45,990
[applauding]

349
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:50,704
Best Acting Award goes to you.

350
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,364
Help me up.

351
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:57,576
Sis, your new pool
boy has a great body.

352
00:37:00,122 --> 00:37:03,208
Looks like you're planning
something with my pool boy, huh?

353
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:06,337
Well, is it my fault you
keep hiring handsome staff?

354
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:12,759
I get him first. Besides, I
have plans for him already.

355
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,735
Am I in your plans?

356
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Of course not!

357
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:19,839
Jason doesn't even
pay attention to me.

358
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:22,135
Well, that's because you're so mean!

359
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,260
Why are you here again anyway?

360
00:37:25,386 --> 00:37:27,638
Oh, nothing. I was just checking
out what's new around here.

361
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:29,622
And your new hire is even more perfect.

362
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,523
[laughing]

363
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:33,304
- Come on, let's go!
- Let's go!

364
00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:51,005
Uh, Ma’am?

365
00:37:51,632 --> 00:37:53,342
Ma’am, I was told that you asked for me?

366
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:55,802
Uh, yes.

367
00:37:56,678 --> 00:38:00,557
I just wanted to thank you
for saving my friend.

368
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,769
I was just helping, Ma'am.

369
00:38:03,862 --> 00:38:06,030
Anyone would have done the same.

370
00:38:08,757 --> 00:38:11,260
- Shall we sit?
- Yeah, sure.

371
00:38:21,662 --> 00:38:23,997
By the way, why didn't you go to college?

372
00:38:25,749 --> 00:38:27,740
Ma'am, we didn't have the money.

373
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:35,513
And ever since my parents died, it's just
been me and my brother trying to get by.

374
00:38:36,385 --> 00:38:40,597
So instead of studying,
we just started working.

375
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:44,404
Where is your brother?

376
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:48,243
He doesn't have a job.

377
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:54,062
He just does odd jobs on the
farm near us. In San Martin.

378
00:38:57,572 --> 00:39:00,200
That seems far.

379
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:03,555
Not really.

380
00:39:04,221 --> 00:39:08,225
It's only about an hour
between our place and here.

381
00:39:16,258 --> 00:39:18,218
Ma'am? Ma'am?

382
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:20,178
How are you feeling?

383
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:23,335
Uh, I just feel a little dizzy.

384
00:39:28,145 --> 00:39:30,439
Ma'am, you can rest on me.

385
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:32,449
Please do.

386
00:39:32,963 --> 00:39:34,910
Oh, right there?

387
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:36,153
Yeah.

388
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:39,072
So you can rest properly.

389
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:43,561
- Uh, alright.
- Go ahead and lie down, Ma'am.

390
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:45,918
Just take it slow.

391
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,838
Right here. A massage?

392
00:39:55,035 --> 00:39:57,569
Oh sure, Ma'am. I'll massage you.

393
00:40:02,721 --> 00:40:03,721
There you go.

394
00:40:11,646 --> 00:40:13,920
- Uh, that should be enough.
- Are you feeling fine now?

395
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:17,156
- Just help me sit up.
- Alright. Just take it slow.

396
00:40:26,578 --> 00:40:28,622
Uh, Ma'am…

397
00:40:43,762 --> 00:40:45,180
Oh, you're here?

398
00:40:48,006 --> 00:40:50,008
I thought you'd left already?

399
00:40:50,234 --> 00:40:52,152
Why? Did I disturb you?

400
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,666
Uh, no! No, of course not.

401
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,483
[whispers] Yeah.

402
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:59,747
By the way, Ma'am. I have
some things to take care of.

403
00:41:01,613 --> 00:41:02,613
I’ll go ahead.

404
00:41:04,825 --> 00:41:06,975
Well, I'm leaving now.

405
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,870
Keep me posted, okay?

406
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,610
I won’t!

407
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,096
You might join in if I do.

408
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:15,513
Good luck. Bye!

409
00:41:46,245 --> 00:41:50,082
You're so hardworking, my love!
That's why I love you so much.

410
00:41:50,415 --> 00:41:52,209
Hey! Don't be like that.

411
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:56,621
Someone might see us,
you know. They might think...

412
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:00,005
Why? After what happened
between us, are we not together?

413
00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:04,675
Stop that! Look, someone might hear us!

414
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,621
I don't care! I'm proud that
something happened between us.

415
00:42:09,181 --> 00:42:12,350
This is the first time I've been with
someone as handsome and good as you.

416
00:42:13,435 --> 00:42:14,840
Shall we do it again later?

417
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:19,816
Hey!

418
00:42:20,066 --> 00:42:22,944
Come on, it's just a kiss.
Let them be jealous!

419
00:42:25,235 --> 00:42:26,694
- Oh, you!
- Ouch!

420
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,553
So that's where you're ticklish, huh?

421
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,785
Stop it! Seriously?

422
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:31,340
So that's where you're
ticklish, huh? Geez!

423
00:42:46,421 --> 00:42:47,547
You're here!

424
00:42:49,043 --> 00:42:51,629
You didn't even tell me you were here.

425
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,794
- Let's go.
- Are you already done?

426
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,287
Our boss might see us.

427
00:42:59,856 --> 00:43:03,359
She's already asleep!
Besides, she said we can go swimming

428
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:06,011
at night, when there are no guests.

429
00:43:07,103 --> 00:43:08,646
Dahlia might still be awake.

430
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,738
She's already asleep too.

431
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:16,329
Come on. Keep me company.

432
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:20,673
No, I don't want to. I'm already
wearing my sleepwear. I'm ready for bed.

433
00:43:20,977 --> 00:43:22,019
Come on.

434
00:43:22,087 --> 00:43:25,173
No thanks. I just
took a shower too.

435
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,037
Are you sure you don't want to?

436
00:43:30,084 --> 00:43:31,127
Last chance?

437
00:46:37,657 --> 00:46:41,286
You know, my ex and I have
been separated for two years.

438
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:44,679
But I still send money to them every month.

439
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,419
Oh? Why don't you
get back together?

440
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:54,010
We talked about it the last time
I went home for Christmas.

441
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:59,764
But it seems like he's already interested
in someone else. Just a rumor I heard.

442
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,598
Did you ask him why?

443
00:47:04,193 --> 00:47:05,193
Yes, of course.

444
00:47:07,177 --> 00:47:08,679
But he wouldn't admit it.

445
00:47:15,972 --> 00:47:18,391
Oh, well. So what's your plan now?

446
00:47:19,598 --> 00:47:20,933
Nothing.

447
00:47:21,654 --> 00:47:26,658
For me, whatever happens
or comes along, that's it.

448
00:47:26,706 --> 00:47:28,577
I don't like making plans.

449
00:47:31,002 --> 00:47:34,798
Oh, I see. That's why what
happened with us wasn't planned.

450
00:47:35,794 --> 00:47:41,049
Exactly, if we had planned and talked about
that, it probably wouldn't have happened.

451
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:43,275
[laughing]

452
00:47:44,659 --> 00:47:47,578
We're the same, then.

453
00:47:48,175 --> 00:47:49,801
I don't like planning either.

454
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:51,644
Does Lira know?

455
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:58,915
Of course not. For me, if it's
private and personal, it stays with me.

456
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,157
I hate gossip.

457
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:05,093
We’re really alike.
I don't like that either.

458
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:09,760
But... But that thing,
what happened with us.

459
00:48:09,808 --> 00:48:11,536
That's just between us, okay?

460
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:15,361
- Of course. That’s normal.
- We're on the same page.

461
00:48:16,225 --> 00:48:19,533
- Good afternoon!
- Uh. Good afternoon, Ma'am!

462
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:22,349
- Dahlia…
- Yes, Ma'am?

463
00:48:22,376 --> 00:48:23,919
Clean my office.

464
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:25,284
Yes, Ma'am.

465
00:48:30,034 --> 00:48:32,286
There she is. The boss is angry again.

466
00:48:36,109 --> 00:48:42,323
[indistinct argument]

467
00:48:42,348 --> 00:48:44,015
What the hell is he doing here?

468
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,664
Ma'am, he was insisting on coming in!

469
00:48:46,879 --> 00:48:49,006
Why did you come back here, Arnold?

470
00:48:49,412 --> 00:48:52,356
I just left some of my
things in the staff room.

471
00:48:52,381 --> 00:48:55,341
I already told Lira to
throw away all of your trash!

472
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Tsk.

473
00:48:57,821 --> 00:49:01,283
Get out! Get him out of here!
He might steal something again!

474
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:03,027
Yes, Ma'am, I'll take care of him.

475
00:49:03,246 --> 00:49:04,246
Let’s go!

476
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,860
I'll go with him, just in case
he tries anything bad.

477
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:08,799
Come on! Let's go! Move!

478
00:49:09,965 --> 00:49:11,383
- We're not done yet!
- Come on!

479
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:21,779
- Hey, what's up?
- Uh, Ma'am.

480
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:25,091
Please have a seat.

481
00:49:25,178 --> 00:49:28,473
Looks like you've been
drinking for a while.

482
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,193
No, not really.

483
00:49:35,665 --> 00:49:36,833
Is there any occasion?

484
00:49:44,706 --> 00:49:46,916
♪ Happy Birthday to me ♪

485
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:53,685
It's your birthday?

486
00:49:55,316 --> 00:49:56,453
Really?

487
00:49:58,065 --> 00:49:59,065
Yeah.

488
00:50:06,723 --> 00:50:08,641
Happy Birthday, Jason.

489
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:13,367
It’s embarrassing.

490
00:50:14,207 --> 00:50:15,875
But, thank you, anyway.

491
00:50:20,463 --> 00:50:23,257
Didn't Lira and Dahlia know?

492
00:50:24,425 --> 00:50:25,510
Well...

493
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:28,137
I didn't tell them anything.

494
00:50:29,452 --> 00:50:31,662
Besides, it's nothing.

495
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:35,103
I think it's their day off anyway.

496
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:39,977
You're right. They did
ask permission from me.

497
00:50:40,775 --> 00:50:43,361
What about you? Aren't you going home?

498
00:50:43,695 --> 00:50:50,910
I figured that if Dahlia and Lira
went home, you'd be left here alone.

499
00:50:54,831 --> 00:50:56,207
Honestly...

500
00:50:58,459 --> 00:51:00,795
I used to be scared here.

501
00:51:02,046 --> 00:51:03,589
But now...

502
00:51:05,133 --> 00:51:06,384
not anymore.

503
00:51:06,843 --> 00:51:09,429
Because they're all my friends now.

504
00:51:11,222 --> 00:51:12,473
You're the only one who isn't.

505
00:51:13,725 --> 00:51:15,560
You're just too elusive.

506
00:51:18,396 --> 00:51:20,523
That's because you're always angry at me.

507
00:51:28,906 --> 00:51:30,450
Don't you like me?

508
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:38,709
It's not that.

509
00:51:43,796 --> 00:51:47,925
Anyway, thank you for saving
me from Arnold yesterday.

510
00:51:48,468 --> 00:51:50,261
You're truly dependable.

511
00:51:52,513 --> 00:51:53,931
It was nothing.

512
00:54:44,185 --> 00:54:48,189
- Good morning, Lira!
- Oh. Hi, Ma'am! Good morning.

513
00:54:48,314 --> 00:54:51,275
- Good morning, Dahlia!
- Good morning, Ma’am!

514
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,153
- Can you make me a black coffee?
- Yes sure.

515
00:54:59,825 --> 00:55:01,452
What a miracle!

516
00:55:01,702 --> 00:55:05,248
Well, someone’s looking refreshed!

517
00:55:05,706 --> 00:55:07,208
Who’s the guy?

518
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:14,840
- Ma'am, here's your coffee.
- Uh, thank you, dear.

519
00:55:19,428 --> 00:55:21,097
Good morning, Jason!

520
00:55:28,896 --> 00:55:30,496
Good morning, honey!

521
00:55:55,744 --> 00:55:56,888
Hey, you!

522
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:00,305
Why are your deliveries always late?

523
00:56:02,415 --> 00:56:04,416
First it's your supplies being delayed!

524
00:56:04,483 --> 00:56:07,778
Then it's your flat tire!
What is it, really?

525
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,351
We are never late in paying your bills.

526
00:56:13,325 --> 00:56:15,118
Get your job done right!

527
00:56:20,048 --> 00:56:23,175
I don't get it. She was
in a good mood earlier.

528
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,036
Who knows what's up with her.

529
00:56:25,367 --> 00:56:27,786
- Then now she's grumpy.
- Exactly.

530
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,701
Jason!

531
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:36,935
Jason!

532
00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:40,905
Jason!

533
00:56:41,427 --> 00:56:43,451
Why the hell are you ignoring me?

534
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:44,814
Uh, what?

535
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,420
Ma’am.

536
00:56:46,853 --> 00:56:48,647
Have I done something wrong?

537
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:51,083
You're such an idiot!

538
00:56:54,103 --> 00:56:57,523
What are you staring at?
Don't you have work to do?

539
00:57:02,757 --> 00:57:05,802
You are really making me angry!

540
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:09,433
Ma'am!

541
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:11,619
Ma'am.

542
00:57:11,786 --> 00:57:12,996
I'm really sorry.

543
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:17,880
You are so unpredictable!

544
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,840
We were perfectly fine
last night, weren't we?

545
00:57:20,865 --> 00:57:23,576
And now you're ignoring me?

546
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:31,064
I was just listening to music. That's
why I didn't notice you. Look, here.

547
00:57:33,027 --> 00:57:34,625
Where did you get that?

548
00:57:35,715 --> 00:57:36,841
Where did that come from?

549
00:57:37,056 --> 00:57:38,057
Uh...

550
00:57:38,374 --> 00:57:43,128
The house helper next door,
she lent it to me.

551
00:57:43,664 --> 00:57:47,460
She said she wasn't going to use
it anymore, so she gave it to me.

552
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,121
You see that?

553
00:57:51,285 --> 00:57:53,412
If you had just told me
you wanted a phone,

554
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:54,997
I would
have bought you one.

555
00:57:57,795 --> 00:57:59,922
What is your relationship
with that neighbor?

556
00:58:00,786 --> 00:58:03,246
- Uh, we're just friends.
- Just friends?

557
00:58:05,511 --> 00:58:06,595
I'm sorry.

558
00:58:06,991 --> 00:58:10,495
I just didn't notice you earlier,
and I couldn't hear you.

559
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:12,187
I'm really sorry.

560
00:58:14,603 --> 00:58:15,855
Please forgive me, hon.

561
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:17,596
I’m sorry.

562
00:58:18,808 --> 00:58:19,851
I'm really sorry.

563
00:58:24,472 --> 00:58:25,598
I'll make it up to you.

564
00:58:26,952 --> 00:58:28,819
I'll do whatever you want.

565
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,030
Okay fine. Whatever.

566
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,028
I'm cumming! Almost there!

567
01:04:06,747 --> 01:04:09,374
- What's going on inside?
- I don't know either.

568
01:04:12,512 --> 01:04:15,640
Ma'am? Ma'am Isabella?

569
01:04:16,433 --> 01:04:19,838
Ma'am? The delivery is waiting.

570
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,440
[laughing]

571
01:04:23,505 --> 01:04:25,256
They might catch us.

572
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,369
What about me?

573
01:04:31,926 --> 01:04:33,595
Let's be careful for now.

574
01:04:33,923 --> 01:04:36,134
It's better if they don't know anything.

575
01:04:37,012 --> 01:04:38,472
Than if they find out.

576
01:04:38,735 --> 01:04:41,363
Besides, what am I to you here?

577
01:04:44,415 --> 01:04:47,668
You're always like this.
Thinking all sorts of things.

578
01:04:50,082 --> 01:04:51,333
How about this?

579
01:04:52,449 --> 01:04:55,952
On Saturday, Lira and Dahlia won’t be here.

580
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,143
Let's meet by the pool.

581
01:04:58,197 --> 01:04:59,240
Then what?

582
01:05:00,195 --> 01:05:01,363
We'll see.

583
01:05:02,141 --> 01:05:04,060
It'll just be the two of us here.

584
01:05:04,691 --> 01:05:06,609
I'll do everything you want me to.

585
01:05:20,237 --> 01:05:21,237
Oh!

586
01:05:21,512 --> 01:05:22,512
Dahlia?

587
01:05:23,156 --> 01:05:24,156
Dahlia?

588
01:05:25,367 --> 01:05:29,454
Dahlia? Do you think you could
run my laundry along with yours?

589
01:05:30,205 --> 01:05:31,707
Wash it yourself!

590
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:33,666
Huh?

591
01:05:35,669 --> 01:05:36,669
Why?

592
01:05:36,879 --> 01:05:41,216
You said you would always
wash my laundry with yours?

593
01:05:41,383 --> 01:05:42,801
That was then!

594
01:05:45,012 --> 01:05:47,347
Huh? But why though?

595
01:05:50,726 --> 01:05:53,228
So what did you two
talk about with the boss?

596
01:05:53,937 --> 01:05:56,523
Come on. You're getting jealous.

597
01:05:57,482 --> 01:05:59,901
I was just asking for
my salary in advance.

598
01:05:59,902 --> 01:06:04,781
So I can give something to
my brother when I get home.

599
01:06:06,909 --> 01:06:12,873
Why didn't you just tell me? I
could have lent you some money.

600
01:06:13,707 --> 01:06:15,709
I was just embarrassed to ask you.

601
01:06:18,629 --> 01:06:20,172
Are you going home this Saturday?

602
01:06:21,381 --> 01:06:22,925
Uh, maybe Sunday instead.

603
01:06:24,134 --> 01:06:27,888
Should I just go home Sunday?
So we can go to town together.

604
01:06:29,556 --> 01:06:32,935
So it will just be the two
of us here Saturday night?

605
01:06:33,936 --> 01:06:36,897
I guess so. That would be
great. So it can happen again.

606
01:06:39,191 --> 01:06:40,192
Why?

607
01:06:40,984 --> 01:06:41,984
Would you like that?

608
01:06:44,488 --> 01:06:45,989
That's our secret, okay?

609
01:06:46,907 --> 01:06:48,200
You're such a goofball.

610
01:06:49,076 --> 01:06:51,786
[laughing]

611
01:06:51,787 --> 01:06:54,080
- Hey!
- You flirt!

612
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:57,167
[laughing]

613
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,543
Not the soap.

614
01:07:01,254 --> 01:07:02,254
[sighs]

615
01:07:09,846 --> 01:07:10,889
Lira!

616
01:07:13,225 --> 01:07:14,225
Yes?

617
01:07:15,602 --> 01:07:17,896
Uh, Lira. Are you going home Saturday?

618
01:07:19,773 --> 01:07:20,773
Yeah!

619
01:07:22,067 --> 01:07:23,067
That's a shame.

620
01:07:24,778 --> 01:07:25,778
Why is that?

621
01:07:28,115 --> 01:07:31,076
Dahlia said you were
both going home Saturday.

622
01:07:31,118 --> 01:07:34,329
And I also overheard
Ma'am Isabella talking on the phone...

623
01:07:34,705 --> 01:07:36,873
- And so?
- she said she's going home Saturday.

624
01:07:37,082 --> 01:07:38,290
So what?

625
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:41,294
I'll be left here alone.
What am I supposed to do?

626
01:07:48,093 --> 01:07:49,761
What am I going to tell Dahlia?

627
01:07:51,304 --> 01:07:54,099
Tell her our boss needs
you to finish your report.

628
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:59,271
What if... you don't go home Saturday?

629
01:08:00,647 --> 01:08:03,025
And what exactly
would we do here then?

630
01:08:05,277 --> 01:08:06,445
Up to you!

631
01:08:07,612 --> 01:08:09,114
What would you want me to do?

632
01:08:10,949 --> 01:08:14,161
You really are annoying!
You're messing with my head!

633
01:08:16,121 --> 01:08:17,121
Why?

634
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,752
Don't you miss this?

635
01:08:24,713 --> 01:08:27,674
Yes, fine. I miss it, miss it so much.

636
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,968
Oh, stop.

637
01:09:13,178 --> 01:09:17,099
- What are you doing here?
- I'm attending the party! I was invited.

638
01:09:20,977 --> 01:09:22,020
You too?

639
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:23,438
Yes, Ma'am.

640
01:09:30,028 --> 01:09:32,239
Don't tell us you too!

641
01:09:32,322 --> 01:09:34,282
Yes, I'm invited!

642
01:09:35,033 --> 01:09:36,952
Huh? Am I not allowed?

643
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:41,748
[laughing and applauding]

644
01:09:42,624 --> 01:09:45,794
You're all here already?
Well, look at that.

645
01:09:46,419 --> 01:09:47,587
What is this, Jason?

646
01:09:48,004 --> 01:09:52,676
Why? Is it wrong for me to
want to be with all of you tonight?

647
01:09:53,135 --> 01:09:57,139
I'm confused! Did you plan all of this?

648
01:09:57,472 --> 01:09:59,891
- Why? What for?
- [laughing]

649
01:10:01,143 --> 01:10:02,644
This bastard!

650
01:10:03,478 --> 01:10:04,604
To have fun!

651
01:10:05,689 --> 01:10:07,524
So I can have all of you to myself!

652
01:10:09,609 --> 01:10:10,610
Girls!

653
01:10:11,778 --> 01:10:13,155
Let's start the party!

654
01:10:13,738 --> 01:10:16,324
Wait, hold on.
Are you two together?

655
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:17,700
And you too?

656
01:10:17,868 --> 01:10:19,869
Is something happening
between all of you?

657
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:21,579
[laughing]

658
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:23,081
Wait a minute. Hold on.

659
01:10:23,623 --> 01:10:27,043
Don't start fighting.
Don't be impatient.

660
01:10:27,836 --> 01:10:30,380
I'll satisfy all of you.

661
01:10:35,468 --> 01:10:37,179
So this is what you really wanted, huh?

662
01:10:49,232 --> 01:10:50,232
[whistles]

663
01:10:55,447 --> 01:10:59,367
[cheering]

664
01:15:25,508 --> 01:15:26,508
Jason?

665
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:30,679
Jason?

666
01:15:33,391 --> 01:15:34,391
Jason?

667
01:16:22,106 --> 01:16:23,650
Wake up, all of you!

668
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:28,571
Lira! Mira! Dahlia! All my
money and jewelry are gone!

669
01:16:28,655 --> 01:16:30,531
Look for Jason!

670
01:16:30,532 --> 01:16:33,493
Dahlia! Lira! Mira!

671
01:16:34,077 --> 01:16:37,038
Wake up! Get up now! Look for Jason!

672
01:16:38,039 --> 01:16:40,250
My money is gone!

673
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:43,253
- All my jewelry is gone too!
- Are you sure?

674
01:16:43,294 --> 01:16:47,506
Jason took it! I just checked,
it's all gone! He took everything!

675
01:16:47,507 --> 01:16:49,216
- Oh no, maybe ours too.
- Right.

676
01:16:49,217 --> 01:16:52,512
He stole it! He took it all! Find him!

677
01:16:53,972 --> 01:16:56,641
Find him! Find Jason!

678
01:16:57,183 --> 01:16:59,143
My bag is missing too!

679
01:17:00,562 --> 01:17:03,398
Ma'am! Our things are gone too!

680
01:17:04,607 --> 01:17:06,985
Jason! [wailing]

681
01:17:24,502 --> 01:17:26,086
Did you get everything?

682
01:17:26,087 --> 01:17:28,339
Yes, brother. I got it all.

683
01:17:29,048 --> 01:17:35,263
Ever since my parents died, it's just
been me and my brother trying to get by.

684
01:17:35,888 --> 01:17:37,348
- We're not done yet!
- Let's go!

685
01:17:39,017 --> 01:17:41,144
- Here.
- Alright. I got this.

686
01:17:46,566 --> 01:17:48,443
News Break!

687
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:51,320
The public is being warned
about two scammer siblings.

688
01:17:51,321 --> 01:17:54,031
Their latest victims are
from a resort in Rizal,

689
01:17:54,032 --> 01:17:57,743
where they took off with the money and
jewelry of the manager, staff, and guests.

690
01:17:57,744 --> 01:18:02,415
Authorities are still searching for
them, but they remain... elusive!

691
01:18:02,832 --> 01:18:05,543
And now, for other news
update, let’s listen to…
