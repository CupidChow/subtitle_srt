00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:09,314
<i>I am Yoo Jui Na, Yoo Ji Na's imitator!</i>

3
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:11,426
<i>Yoo Ji Na is hot!</i>

4
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:13,294
Is Yoo Ji Na your toy or something?

5
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:15,548
<i>I'm sorry for always causing
you so much trouble!</i>

6
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,350
<i>My sister impersonates your songs.</i>

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,725
<i>I'm Yoo Ji Na. You are Yoo Jui Na?</i>

8
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:23,689
<i>Mom! How can I let you go like this?</i>

9
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:27,352
She lived a good, full life
so don't be so heartbroken.

10
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:29,064
The owner of this house is Mom.

11
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:33,045
<i>Please give this envelope, along with
the letter, directly to Park Hyun Joon.</i>

12
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:34,883
<i>Why would you take a picture
of that with your phone?</i>

13
00:00:34,883 --> 00:00:38,090
<i>She was so kind to my sister!
Who are you people to...</i>

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,673
<i>How dare you ruin my life in one moment?</i>

15
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:43,814
<i>She really liked you.</i>

16
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:47,015
<i>She has no one to rely on in this world.</i>

17
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:48,764
<i>From now on, only mess with her.</i>

18
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:52,170
<i>A singer is someone who sings.
You think she's your toy?</i>

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,185
<i>This is my anger directed towards myself.</i>

20
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:56,700
<i>Are you curious who that child is?</i>

21
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,307
<i>If you become part of my family. Women
in this family's background has been...</i>

22
00:01:01,307 --> 00:01:04,531
<i>Hyun Joon is in Korea. You didn't know?</i>

23
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,686
<i>I heard you're seeing someone.
What kind of a man is he?</i>

24
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:08,850
<i>Are you just going to watch
people live before you go?</i>

25
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,311
<i>Leave everything and escape this world.</i>

26
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:12,760
<i>How long have you been dating?</i>

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,435
10 years?

28
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:17,710
<i>- Please hug me.
- You're okay now that I'm here.</i>

29
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,188
Sung Taek!

30
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:22,625
I have to live with him.
So give him to me.

31
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,126
<i>Think of it as paying your debt.</i>

32
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:27,004
<i>You sang my songs as if they
were yours without my permission.</i>

33
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,400
<i>Your voice when you sing
sounds like someone I know.</i>

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,700
<i>That woman is Yoo Ji Na?</i>

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,091
- She's rude.
- I have different feelings.

36
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:37,379
<i>There's something I want to do.</i>

37
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:39,188
<i>I plan on starting my own
entertainment business.</i>

38
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:41,599
<i>You know that I love you, right?</i>

39
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,944
<i>I felt like you were me and I was you.</i>

40
00:01:44,944 --> 00:01:48,155
<i>The person who can save her
is not you but me.</i>

41
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:49,748
<i>My sister fainted!</i>

42
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:51,335
<i>- I have to go.
- Don't go.</i>

43
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:53,460
<i>No! Sung Taek! </i>

44
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,004
<i>When we meet next time,
let's get married.</i>

45
00:01:57,004 --> 00:02:00,105
<i>Sung Taek, I'm sorry!</i>

46
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:04,179
<i>He was with a girl who I really liked.</i>

47
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:08,981
<i>The people I love tend to leave.</i>

48
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:11,462
<i>There is a girl who
impersonates me at night clubs.</i>

49
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:14,552
<i>Get her to sign a contract with me.</i>

50
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,866
<i>[Episode 5]</i>

51
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,480
Hoon, let's have one more bite.

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,189
- No!
- Just one more bite!

53
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:28,519
Hoon! If you don't eat it,
Auntie is going to eat it all!

54
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,888
Hey... Just sit down and eat.

55
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:36,350
Are you not going to feed your own child?

56
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,489
Just leave him be. He'll eat
when he gets hungry.

57
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:41,937
- What?
- You two ruin his habits anyway.

58
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:44,514
Who ruins what?

59
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:48,162
People say kids raised by their
grandmothers grow up with no manners.

60
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:52,270
Instead of thanking me for taking
care of the kid, listen to her talk!

61
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,919
I understand that Aunt Bong Seon
cares about Hoon

62
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,551
but I am a little worried to be honest.

63
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,183
- Worried?
- That's right!

64
00:02:59,183 --> 00:03:02,680
Sometimes, she does have
trouble with Hoon.

65
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:08,631
- So what?
- So she's saying thank you.

66
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:11,704
Look at her face! Does it look like
a face that's saying thank you?

67
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:14,300
Hoon, come here!

68
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,099
If you don't come here in three seconds,
you'll be in trouble!

69
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:23,780
Eat. Eat first and then play.

70
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,651
Moms sure are scary.

71
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:34,247
I thought you were
bringing your bankbook.

72
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,426
Why haven't I heard
anything about it yet?

73
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:38,900
What bankbook?

74
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,990
Your mother wants us to give her
access to the checking account

75
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,239
where your salary is deposited.

76
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,811
- What?
- If you can't give me the bankbook

77
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:47,319
give me one month's allowance.

78
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,829
M... Mom. I mean... Mother...

79
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,860
My friend's daughter-in-law
does all the housekeeping.

80
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,954
Her daughter-in-law is a doctor,
so she makes tons of money.

81
00:03:57,954 --> 00:04:00,532
She bought her brother-in-law
a new apartment as a wedding gift

82
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,253
and she even bought her
mother-in-law a mink coat.

83
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:07,182
You should at least do something
for me to think fondly of you.

84
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:13,639
Mom, you sure have all kinds of friends.

85
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,454
You have so many friends
to talk about when you need to.

86
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:20,309
- Wh... What?
- Just eat.

87
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:21,925
I'm all set.

88
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:23,653
I... Hey...

89
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:27,089
Does she look after her kid
or take care of the house?

90
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:30,278
It's not like she supports
the family with an income either!

91
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:33,502
She can't even afford to pay
for her own bus fare or books!

92
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:41,660
Why did you get up and leave like that?

93
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,790
Did you hear how she was talking to me?
She was asking for a fight.

94
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,764
You work on your habit of
getting up while my mom is talking.

95
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:52,523
Did my mom say anything wrong?

96
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:53,744
If it's not wrong then what?

97
00:04:53,744 --> 00:04:56,959
There are people at work
where both parents work!

98
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,473
Instead of getting his wife's home-cooked
meals, they switch cars and stuff!

99
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:01,583
What?

100
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:05,483
All I'm saying is that we
all have our circumstances.

101
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:14,242
This is why you don't
live with the other family.

102
00:05:14,242 --> 00:05:17,630
Are you jealous of wives who make a lot
of money after hearing it from your mom?

103
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,209
How can I not be?

104
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:23,918
It would be nice if you at least
prepared a nice meal when I come home.

105
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:25,877
My gosh... This is ridiculous.

106
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:28,454
Just give her an allowance once a month.

107
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:31,153
- No!
- Why not? It's the same thing.

108
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:33,040
That's me accepting their system.

109
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,500
System?

110
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,798
Mother and Aunt Bong Seon
are staying with us temporarily.

111
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:40,550
My gosh... You just...

112
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,968
The products we will be
launching this spring

113
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:54,153
will be emphasizing a daily look that
people can eat and be comfortable in.

114
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,170
Also, in order for the golf wear to be
recognized with young consumers

115
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,197
we were able to secure both
the design and its practicality.

116
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,567
Okay. Everything is good except
increase the product image.

117
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,117
I like the idea of focusing on sales

118
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:12,937
But don't you think you need stronger
and specific marketing tactics

119
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:17,009
to get through the vicious competition?

120
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,862
That is why our marketing team
is planning a variety of events

121
00:06:20,862 --> 00:06:24,620
to reach the consumers directly.

122
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:35,504
It's here, sir.

123
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:38,901
Isn't this a place
where young kids hang out?

124
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:58,846
Drinking at places like this... I'm doing
a lot of things I've never done before.

125
00:06:58,846 --> 00:07:01,043
A lot of celebrities come here.

126
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:04,031
They guarantee privacy
and their food tastes fresh.

127
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,153
And the reason you're
buying drinks today?

128
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:13,697
To ask you to forget about me
crying like a baby last time.

129
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:19,098
I can't do that. After just buying
me a drink at a place like this?

130
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:20,843
I really liked that moment.

131
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:25,043
I was thinking of just
ignoring your calls...

132
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:27,172
but I decided to tell you in person.

133
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:28,951
That's why I asked you to come today.

134
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,983
- Does that mean I'm getting dumped?
- Yeah.

135
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:39,526
Then you should just dump me.
Why would you buy me drinks to dump me?

136
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,413
I hope you like their snacks here.

137
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:44,187
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

138
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,666
<i>Listen to
the sentimental siren of ships...</i>

139
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,658
<i>at a port late at night</i>

140
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:07,553
<i>even though you are expecting no one</i>

141
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:11,654
<i>at the very wharf of ferries.</i>

142
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:21,863
<i>I should not miss my youth
suddenly again at this age</i>

143
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:26,966
<i>but there is an empty place inside </i>

144
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:33,390
- <i>my heart...</i>
- Our Baek Mi Sook

145
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,567
sure knows how to sing!

146
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:39,340
<i>I ponder the things
that my heart has lost.</i>

147
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,909
<i>I ponder on romance.</i>

148
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:49,234
How did a human being write
these lyrics? They're a work of art.

149
00:08:49,234 --> 00:08:51,543
Your singing is improving every time.

150
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:53,346
It's because I have so much resentment.

151
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:55,482
You try living with
a daughter-in-law like mine.

152
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:57,904
You will naturally
sing a work of art.

153
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,227
Just finish your work of art.

154
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:04,519
"At a port late at night"

155
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,587
"at the very wharf of ferries"

156
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:09,863
"paint a picture in your head."

157
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:13,855
"Doesn't your heart feel
so lonely at the core?"

158
00:09:13,855 --> 00:09:17,494
"At the very wharf of ferries..."

159
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:20,129
What did it say after
at the wharf of ferries?

160
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:24,596
"Listen to
the sentimental siren of ships."

161
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:30,712
- Where are you going?
- To clean up and rest.

162
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:32,371
Don't you have any pride?

163
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,563
Goodness, what am I to do with her?

164
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:42,719
What are you doing?

165
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:45,105
Can't you see?

166
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:46,721
Go inside. I'll do it.

167
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:51,904
I'm not even a doctor.
The least I can do is wash the dishes.

168
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,346
You think that's going to last long?

169
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,418
She's the type to do it
once she makes up her mind.

170
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:01,928
What are you going to do if she quits
school and claims her place here?

171
00:10:01,928 --> 00:10:03,427
I'm not scared one bit!

172
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:06,589
You think anyone can take
care of the house? No way.

173
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,663
You said you needed someone to hurt.

174
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:22,049
In that sense, there is no one
who fits better than me.

175
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:24,424
I'm sorry but...

176
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:30,397
I can't hurt anyone who
has no affection for me.

177
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,855
No affection?

178
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:35,306
Even though my life is reckless

179
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:40,905
I know the difference between
wanting someone and loving someone.

180
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:46,683
You know so much, but why don't
you understand my heart?

181
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:49,126
Yoo Ji Na.

182
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,389
This is good.

183
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:55,697
At least we can end with good feelings.

184
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,120
I can't be sober with you, Yoo Ji Na.

185
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:12,403
Is there really a difference

186
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:16,311
between wanting someone
and loving someone?

187
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:21,830
To be honest, I'm very nervous

188
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,142
that I might actually get dumped.

189
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,921
A woman like you
will dump me if you want to.

190
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,873
I was truly happy when you
asked me to meet with you.

191
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:39,299
I was excited for no reason.
Everything tasted good.

192
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:45,312
It was my first time feeling that way.

193
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:48,359
Are you really nervous?

194
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:52,707
I realized there is a woman I can't have,
even when I try with everything I have.

195
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:57,318
This is the first time
I've felt pathetic.

196
00:11:58,938 --> 00:12:03,721
I'm sure you felt miserable in
front of your wife who passed away.

197
00:12:05,044 --> 00:12:14,308
Not at all. Even though she didn't have
anything, she loved me.

198
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:18,700
I'm not doubting your feelings.

199
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,974
Then what is it that you can't trust?

200
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:27,480
- When you get sick of me.
- Get sick of you?

201
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,528
You said you know very well
about a woman's life, right?

202
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:34,119
Was there ever a woman
you never got sick of?

203
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:40,557
Is is okay to throw away women
when you get sick of them?

204
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,494
- Do you think this is unfair?
- I do.

205
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:49,563
Because it's a different feeling.

206
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:53,701
Of course you think it's different.

207
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:57,597
You're interested because it's different.

208
00:12:57,597 --> 00:13:01,745
But that kind of attraction
will all become the same.

209
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:07,754
This is the price I pay
for the life I lived.

210
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:12,763
Let me ask you one more question.

211
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:20,049
If I get dumped by you, where
can I find another woman like you?

212
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,234
There are a lot more women
like me than you think.

213
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:25,908
Women who don't think
money is everything.

214
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:28,600
I have no opportunities to meet them.

215
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,077
They just come running to me
without a second thought.

216
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,289
That's the price you have to pay.

217
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:39,125
The price you have to pay as
someone who has everything.

218
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:45,399
Even if I meet other women, I am
never going to be interested in them.

219
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,278
You just have to change your
hobby to something more sound.

220
00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:02,841
I wish I could live with you,
Yoo Ji Na, for just one day.

221
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,187
I want to make you my woman

222
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:10,714
for one day.

223
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,618
I want to get to know you more and more.

224
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:21,908
What kind of life did you have?

225
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:23,682
Are you curious?

226
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,018
Is there any way...

227
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:35,239
that you could just pretend
to fall for my tricks and meet with me?

228
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:49,011
Bring the car over here.

229
00:15:02,221 --> 00:15:06,399
<i>I want to get to know you more and more.</i>

230
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,115
<i>What kind of life did you have?</i>

231
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:14,413
<i>Isn't it because
of the child in this picture</i>

232
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,711
<i>that you are so angry and flustered?</i>

233
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:42,889
Does Yoo Ji Na have that much influence
over the broadcasting companies?

234
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:45,177
Just to see her face
once is so difficult.

235
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,578
Once the contract is complete, they
said they will set up an appointment.

236
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,347
Fine. I can understand Yoo Ji Na

237
00:15:56,347 --> 00:16:00,751
but why is Yoo Jui Na
acting so arrogant too?

238
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,626
They say one will follow others blindly.

239
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:23,139
- Does it taste good?
- Do I eat because of taste?

240
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:24,763
Then why do you eat?

241
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:27,094
If I don't eat, I will die.

242
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:28,942
Do you know how many
performances I have in one night?

243
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:32,642
All right. Just finished eating.
You're going to spit it back out.

244
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:35,860
Then why would you talk
to someone who's eating?

245
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,926
You ate the whole thing!
You didn't even leave one bite!

246
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:54,745
What are you doing now?

247
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,985
What is that?

248
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:59,878
Adding raw egg into the seafood soup...

249
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:02,792
It's my method to give me stamina.

250
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:06,402
Stamina... Your pronunciation is...

251
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,152
It'd be better if I didn't see it...

252
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:16,570
So who told you to stand there and watch?

253
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,150
Jui Na, hurry up and get ready!

254
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,403
Okay, I'll be there soon.

255
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:42,526
What am I doing here?

256
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:56,683
<i>You don't have to say it.
I already know.</i>

257
00:17:58,173 --> 00:18:04,469
<i>Your gloomy expression says it all.</i>

258
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:09,636
<i>That's right, everything is changing.</i>

259
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:04,733
All kinds of things happen
when I'm up here.

260
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,059
Why is this acting up today?

261
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:10,914
- Yoo Jui Na, just take it off!
- Just take it off!

262
00:19:10,914 --> 00:19:14,109
What? You want me to
perform without holding onto it?

263
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,423
- Yeah!
- Just take it off!

264
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,049
That's not right.

265
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:23,540
I can't do that with
the money I make here.

266
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:29,941
I don't know if this is going to work.

267
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:32,541
Please give me one more pin.

268
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,075
You don't have any more?

269
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:40,079
Whatever! Nothing can stop me now!

270
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,196
If this comes off,
you just won the lottery!

271
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:46,288
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

272
00:19:46,915 --> 00:19:53,113
Since it's come to this,
let's have some fun!

273
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:59,383
The next song you all love by
Yoo Ji Na is called "Emerald."

274
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:02,198
Okay? Let's go!

275
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:17,290
<i>In order to best myself,
I sit here, left all alone.</i>

276
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:24,580
<i>Why do I entertain people
and lose a part of myself?</i>

277
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:29,492
<i>I don't shout.</i>

278
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:33,364
<i>Out of the darkness...</i>

279
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:40,656
<i>I believed that love could
overcome everything.</i>

280
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:53,669
You did all kinds of things after
drinking that seafood soup.

281
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,625
You can't just sit quietly and sing?

282
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:01,259
If you can introduce me to a place that
will give me money, then let me know!

283
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,884
I said I will.

284
00:21:02,884 --> 00:21:05,930
I'll introduce you and give you a way
into the broadcasting companies.

285
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,851
That's why I'm working
this hard to make it happen.

286
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,875
You can't just leave. Think of
the person who was waiting all this time.

287
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,413
Did I tell you to wait?

288
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:29,299
Wow.

289
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:32,417
And where did she learn
manners like that?

290
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,990
Is she provoking me?

291
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:36,527
- I'm leaving!
- Okay. Good work!

292
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,757
Thank you!

293
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:49,615
Hae Dang!

294
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:57,951
- Did you eat dinner?
- I brought ramen!

295
00:21:57,951 --> 00:22:00,799
You know me so well!

296
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,500
Let's go eat ramen!

297
00:22:08,497 --> 00:22:10,387
- It's probably ready.
- No, not yet.

298
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:12,909
- Count 30 more seconds.
- Okay.

299
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:15,325
One, two, three...

300
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:18,852
- I'm sure it's ready!
- No! Wait a little longer!

301
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:21,779
Might as well eat it
when it tastes the best!

302
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:25,483
1, 2, 3, 4, 23...

303
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:29,133
Let's just eat it! It's all the same
once it goes in the stomach.

304
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:30,833
Okay.

305
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:43,671
What does it taste like?

306
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:47,355
- I wonder... Try the soup.
- Okay!

307
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,450
Mine tastes better!

308
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,049
Try mine.

309
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:06,067
- What do you think?
- It's good.

310
00:23:12,688 --> 00:23:14,769
- Have some more.
- Dad, you eat it!

311
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,652
Dad!

312
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:18,135
Dad, you eat it!

313
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:21,681
Goodness gracious.

314
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:45,512
You seem really close to your father.

315
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:49,602
- Were you following me?
- Do you like your father?

316
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:52,561
Is there someone who doesn't?

317
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:54,692
It's more than disliking...

318
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:57,002
There are people who
live for the sake of torturing them.

319
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:01,250
Not me. A friend of mine.

320
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:07,701
In other words, you're
the worst son in the world!

321
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:09,849
I said it wasn't me!

322
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:14,551
Why are you yelling in my neighborhood
in the middle of the night?

323
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:20,594
You can't just leave!

324
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,536
What the...

325
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:29,185
Who does she think
she is to be so arrogant?

326
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:30,756
Gosh...

327
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:35,376
Why am I getting so worked up

328
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:37,251
because of this girl?

329
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:52,982
You're awake already?

330
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:03,247
You even made soup?

331
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:11,891
Mom, she even made soup.

332
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:13,590
She must be desperate.

333
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,814
- Breakfast is ready.
- Go ahead and eat.

334
00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:27,652
I'm going to eat later.

335
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,964
What? What is this?

336
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:34,175
Oh my gosh! You did all this?

337
00:25:37,222 --> 00:25:38,606
Hey!

338
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:41,079
The radish soup tastes refreshing!

339
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,080
- Is it refreshing?
- Yes! It's so refreshing!

340
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,040
She just wasn't doing it,
but she does it well!

341
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,864
They say a person who is smart
is also good at cooking.

342
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,472
Drop him off at day care before you go.

343
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,280
Before work?

344
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,266
We're going to send him
to day care from now on.

345
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:02,577
I can pick him up after the lecture.

346
00:26:02,577 --> 00:26:05,051
Oh. Okay. Sure.

347
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:09,907
Wow! The soup is seriously
so refreshing! Honey!

348
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,662
Her mother passed away early

349
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,382
so I'm sure she and her
sisters rotated cooking

350
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,492
but you bragged about cooking,
thinking that she would starve herself?

351
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:29,806
She's determined.

352
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:32,559
She's so cruel!

353
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:37,957
Hurry up! You're the one
who said to drop you off!

354
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:44,096
You have no opinion for yourself?

355
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,553
What was so great that you sat
there slurping down the soup?

356
00:26:46,553 --> 00:26:48,914
"So refreshing! Wow so refreshing!"

357
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:51,099
Should I tell her it tastes bad after
she spent time preparing for it?

358
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:53,873
- Then what about me?
- You have to survive on your own!

359
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:56,327
What? You! You wait and see!

360
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:59,236
Wait and see what? You've been
waiting this whole time.

361
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:01,298
I'm going crazy because
I'm stuck in the middle!

362
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:04,258
You! Be clear which side you're on!

363
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:07,741
If I do that and I get a divorce,
are you going to be responsible for it?

364
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,276
Hoon, tell Grandma
you're going to day care.

365
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:19,038
Bye, Grandma.

366
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,305
Tell her to not lift a single
finger and rest comfortably.

367
00:27:22,305 --> 00:27:24,856
- Rest well, Grandma.
- Goodbye.

368
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:27,023
- See you.
- Let's go, Hoon.

369
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:33,680
- I'm going.
- Whether you go

370
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,482
or decide to go somewhere far,
do whatever you want!

371
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:43,180
This is ridiculous.

372
00:27:44,628 --> 00:27:47,097
What are you doing?

373
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:50,327
I'm on the night shift
this week, so I am cleaning.

374
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:53,229
Why don't you make
hand-torn noodle soup for lunch?

375
00:27:53,229 --> 00:27:56,296
Hand-torn noodle soup? You can do it.

376
00:27:57,726 --> 00:28:00,135
I am going on strike.

377
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:03,090
- Strike?
- I might be kicked out soon.

378
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,167
I'm so sorry for all
the trouble I caused you.

379
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,917
Oh my goodness...

380
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:12,592
What's the difference
between getting it all at once

381
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:14,198
or when you need it little by little?

382
00:28:14,198 --> 00:28:17,874
The problem is dignity. Human dignity.

383
00:28:17,874 --> 00:28:20,000
Dignity?

384
00:28:23,172 --> 00:28:24,759
Looks good!

385
00:28:28,781 --> 00:28:31,426
What are you eating?

386
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:35,740
I am respecting your
dignity and eating ramen.

387
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,873
I... I only made one.

388
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:40,260
You can add rice to it!

389
00:28:43,977 --> 00:28:46,000
You took it all!

390
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:53,980
She prepared food
just so that I would see it.

391
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:59,290
Out of the four girls,
she's the best cook.

392
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:02,439
I didn't know that.
I'm so embarrassed!

393
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:06,932
Your old friend is telling you
she feels embarrassed

394
00:29:06,932 --> 00:29:09,186
and you're just going
to sit there and watch?

395
00:29:09,186 --> 00:29:11,595
Nobody can beat her stubbornness.

396
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:14,170
Even when 50 million people
run after her, she won't budge.

397
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,765
So? You want to twist my arm
and make me back down?

398
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:18,801
Of course an arm only
twists in one direction.

399
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:21,491
Have you ever seen someone
twist their arm the other way?

400
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:23,582
Don't be like that, help me!

401
00:29:23,582 --> 00:29:28,000
I might make it worse if I try to help!

402
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,575
She says she can't because she
thinks you're going to spend it all!

403
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:33,115
Who's going to spend it all?

404
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:35,240
Does she think I don't know
how to handle money?

405
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,454
Can you really blame her
for being a little bit worried?

406
00:29:40,454 --> 00:29:43,798
Wow. Are you done?

407
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,194
I... I'm sorry.

408
00:29:47,194 --> 00:29:50,664
Am I still not awake from
the drinks I had last night?

409
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:56,106
She won't give it to me because
she thinks I'm going to spend it all?

410
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:04,394
If you're mimicking her,
do you have to look like her too?

411
00:30:04,394 --> 00:30:07,025
Everything has to be
the same from head to toe.

412
00:30:07,025 --> 00:30:08,724
I see.

413
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,739
Here.

414
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:20,558
I left it where I usually put it.

415
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:22,522
It's hot. Be careful.

416
00:30:26,888 --> 00:30:31,200
Some people will fix their teeth
to look exactly like the real person.

417
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,061
If the person has a crooked tooth,
then people will even want to mimic that.

418
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:36,757
Really?

419
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:40,369
That's how you become
the exact replica of the real thing.

420
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:43,877
Can you imagine it? What that's like?

421
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:49,968
We're spending every moment of our lives

422
00:30:49,968 --> 00:30:53,636
trying our hardest
to look like the real thing.

423
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:56,364
When I walk around in rural areas
after an event with my makeup on

424
00:30:56,364 --> 00:30:59,016
people say, "Oh, it's Yoo Ji Na!"

425
00:30:59,016 --> 00:31:02,425
They run after me, but once
they see me up close they say

426
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:07,173
"Oh, are you not Yoo Ji Na?" And then
they walk away disappointed.

427
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:13,471
When that happens, it feels so strange.

428
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,603
I feel sorry too.

429
00:31:16,603 --> 00:31:19,531
When I sing in front of the elderly

430
00:31:19,531 --> 00:31:25,661
a lot of them think
I really am Yoo Ji Na.

431
00:31:25,661 --> 00:31:28,626
- No way.
- Really!

432
00:31:28,626 --> 00:31:32,323
From far away, my figure
looks about the same.

433
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:35,720
How would they be able to tell?

434
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:41,209
That's the reason why
impersonators make good sales.

435
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:45,699
But it's so strange.

436
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:50,079
I usually can't tell this
to anyone comfortably.

437
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:54,801
Even when I didn't have money,
I never bought an imitation item before.

438
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,464
Even my sisters would
never buy imitation items.

439
00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:03,309
Do you want to listen to music?

440
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,728
You don't have any of Yoo Ji Na's CDs.

441
00:32:15,728 --> 00:32:19,297
You have CDs from other artists though.

442
00:32:19,297 --> 00:32:22,210
Do you not like her?

443
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:27,945
You don't like her, do you? That's why
you don't have any of her CDs.

444
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:33,171
It would've been nice if I was an
impersonator of a singer you liked.

445
00:32:33,171 --> 00:32:37,570
Have you ever met Yoo Ji Na in person?

446
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:41,289
Yeah.

447
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:45,030
What kind of person is she?

448
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,570
Why?

449
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,017
Did they prepare the party meals nicely?

450
00:32:56,743 --> 00:33:03,701
I didn't realize until after going to
this party how well-known Yoon Hee was.

451
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:05,528
You are being too kind.

452
00:33:05,528 --> 00:33:08,484
On top of that, you spoke
English and Japanese

453
00:33:08,484 --> 00:33:10,575
like they were your native languages.

454
00:33:10,575 --> 00:33:13,856
I felt myself stand up
a little taller thanks to you.

455
00:33:15,057 --> 00:33:16,696
You should eat more.

456
00:33:16,696 --> 00:33:19,839
You were talking so much that
you didn't get a chance to eat much.

457
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,545
Go ahead and make a simple noodle soup.

458
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:27,798
She knows how to make
the perfect anchovy broth.

459
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:30,222
You are too kind.

460
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:34,990
Next time, please
invite Na Kyung as well.

461
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:37,890
Everyone has a place and time.

462
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,028
What are you doing? Go and make the soup.

463
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:49,355
After the wedding,
you should have a child.

464
00:33:49,355 --> 00:33:52,886
Our house is not ordinarily.
Grandchildren are so important.

465
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:59,230
I won't have any regrets if I get
a chance to see your child before I die.

466
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,213
- Are you going to pass this spring too?
- Pass what?

467
00:34:14,213 --> 00:34:18,092
Hyun Joon doesn't seem
like he is in any rush.

468
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:20,552
You don't know that our
family is deciding on the date?

469
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:24,025
Would you like me to ask my husband
to bring him into the company?

470
00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:28,887
You probably felt like my
husband was the next successor

471
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:32,416
after talking to people at the company.

472
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:35,396
Were you not listening to Grandmother?

473
00:34:35,396 --> 00:34:39,418
She said she wants another
granddaughter-in-law.

474
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:43,297
She doesn't have any more grandsons,
so what do you think it means?

475
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:45,911
You think she's the type
to say empty words?

476
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:51,231
You can tell by how she looks after me
even though I haven't had children yet.

477
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,815
If this keeps up, I'm going to be
a kitchen maid before I get kicked out.

478
00:35:01,815 --> 00:35:04,556
I don't know what it is,
but don't cause any scenes.

479
00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:08,565
It's not like you
would follow me out.

480
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,887
I can't just sit here and be beaten.

481
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:13,800
She's underestimating me.

482
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,585
- It's going to be an all out war now.
- All out war?

483
00:35:16,585 --> 00:35:20,253
- I need power.
- Power? What kind of power?

484
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:22,737
I don't need Grandmother or anybody else.

485
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:25,525
I'm going to make my way through Father.

486
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,119
- Was it okay today?
- Yeah.

487
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,217
You have a guest waiting.

488
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:34,909
A guest?

489
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:39,619
My name is Go Na Kyung.

490
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,675
You guys must have a lot
of free time on your hands.

491
00:35:47,675 --> 00:35:51,021
I'm sorry to meet you like this
without making plans ahead of time.

492
00:35:51,021 --> 00:35:54,813
You introduce yourselves for the sake
of formality and to strike a blow.

493
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:59,697
- Both are the same.
- It's not what you think.

494
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:04,748
- Then what?
- Father hasn't been going to the office.

495
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:06,760
For several days.

496
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,280
Is he sick?

497
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,804
He is not in Seoul.

498
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:12,389
Then what?

499
00:36:12,389 --> 00:36:15,998
I'd like to stress that he
has never done this before.

500
00:36:15,998 --> 00:36:19,039
- Not once.
- Never done this before?

501
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,891
I think his feelings
for you are genuine.

502
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:27,012
He won't leave his villa at all.

503
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,661
He's not a young adult...

504
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:35,039
Why don't you accept him?

505
00:36:38,034 --> 00:36:41,373
Your family is so strange.
For his daughter-in-law to step up...

506
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:44,117
You didn't come here because
Chairman Park sent you here, did you?

507
00:36:44,117 --> 00:36:45,795
Of course not.

508
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:55,815
He is not as intimidating
as people make him out to be.

509
00:36:55,815 --> 00:36:58,617
He's very lonely if you get to know him.

510
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:47,166
<i>I think his feelings
for you are genuine.</i>

511
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:23,009
<i>My personality won't let
me be hurt by others</i>

512
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:28,288
<i>no matter what they do to me.
That's my handicap.</i>

513
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:49,898
None of this was moving to me.

514
00:38:54,728 --> 00:38:57,637
What are you doing here
giving up your profession?

515
00:38:57,637 --> 00:38:59,847
I'm embarrassed that
people are going to find out.

516
00:38:59,847 --> 00:39:01,722
We're not teenagers.

517
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,454
Can I hug you?

518
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,333
They say earnest thoughts work.

519
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:29,244
You never left my thoughts,
even for a second.

520
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,996
I'm not worth that.

521
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:39,134
You can just use me.

522
00:39:39,134 --> 00:39:45,603
Even though I am not worth receiving
love, you will find me quite useful.

523
00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:49,842
I told you everything ends in tragedy
when you get involved with me.

524
00:39:49,842 --> 00:39:52,954
Whether it ends in tragedy,
or happily ever after

525
00:39:52,954 --> 00:39:56,228
I want us to at least have a beginning.

526
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:59,661
- Let's be friends then.
- Friends?

527
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:02,253
Someone with a lot of money,
who knows a lot of cool places

528
00:40:02,253 --> 00:40:05,070
and someone I can
confidently show off to others.

529
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,009
If we're friends,
there won't be any flaws.

530
00:40:09,893 --> 00:40:15,869
What's the difference between a friend
and a lover? Between a man and a woman?

531
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:21,911
Does a person have a say when a scandal
breaks out with another person or not?

532
00:40:23,161 --> 00:40:25,418
Sounds safe.

533
00:40:25,418 --> 00:40:28,231
There is no space for us to get hurt.

534
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:37,257
Then... is there some space
and choice to do other things?

535
00:40:37,257 --> 00:40:40,862
- Should I go back to Seoul?
- No, no.

536
00:40:40,862 --> 00:40:42,748
Let's go eat.

537
00:40:42,748 --> 00:40:48,793
I'm starving after spending days
paying the price for the life I lived.

538
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:51,432
You recovered so fast that
I feel like this was all for nothing.

539
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:54,311
Your appetite came back so quickly...

540
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:56,074
I feel like I was tricked.

541
00:40:56,074 --> 00:41:00,369
Then, let's go get some coffee.
Does that work?

542
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:15,382
I have to move.

543
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:17,922
Why all of a sudden?

544
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:20,083
I left my company.

545
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,891
Why?

546
00:41:21,891 --> 00:41:24,327
I have to empty the villa
I'm staying at right now.

547
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,333
Your company gave you that villa.

548
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:31,099
I have a house I bought
that I'm going to move into

549
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:33,833
but I have a month left
before I can move in.

550
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:35,512
One month?

551
00:41:35,512 --> 00:41:37,791
I'm about to be homeless for a month.

552
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:40,668
Then, did you look for a house yourself?

553
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:42,891
I have to ask my manager.

554
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:46,157
Would young fellows know
how to look for a house?

555
00:41:53,403 --> 00:41:55,338
Welcome home.

556
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:58,972
Grandmother! Father is back.

557
00:41:58,972 --> 00:42:01,552
Let me see you for a minute.

558
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,144
Me?

559
00:42:09,606 --> 00:42:12,030
If you were going
to come back this soon...

560
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,356
He should be embarrassed to see his kids.

561
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:18,320
My goodness.

562
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:21,804
A house? That fast?

563
00:42:21,804 --> 00:42:25,137
That's why I'm asking you for a favor.

564
00:42:25,137 --> 00:42:26,936
I understand.

565
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:35,625
What about this?

566
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:38,788
We have another house.

567
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:41,326
The other house?

568
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:45,088
It will be difficult to acquire
an actual house in a month's time.

569
00:42:45,088 --> 00:42:47,456
Plus, there is not enough time.

570
00:42:47,456 --> 00:42:49,025
Will that be possible?

571
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:52,402
If she stays at the other house,
I can take care of her meals as well.

572
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:56,639
I heard that celebrities don't eat
properly and have poor health.

573
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,617
If that's possible then...

574
00:42:59,617 --> 00:43:03,103
Either way, thanks for your help.

575
00:43:03,103 --> 00:43:05,923
What made you think to go visit her?

576
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:12,942
There was someone in this
house who thought about me.

577
00:43:12,942 --> 00:43:15,155
I will remember this.

578
00:43:15,155 --> 00:43:17,355
Thank you, Father.

579
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,599
Hot!

580
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:36,775
Hey! Wash your hands and
put rice in the lunchbox.

581
00:43:36,775 --> 00:43:38,813
You guys think you're all that great!

582
00:43:38,813 --> 00:43:44,418
You think I go around saying, "I'm sorry"
because I think I'm beneath you?

583
00:43:44,418 --> 00:43:49,360
You look down on me because I deliver
packages? How dare you talk informally?

584
00:43:50,668 --> 00:43:54,900
You wanted me to carry it to your storage
room while you were holding that dog?

585
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,257
You don't have hands and feet?

586
00:43:57,257 --> 00:44:00,643
For someone who looks
like a giant pumpkin head...

587
00:44:00,643 --> 00:44:04,793
I hope your face blows up
like a giant pumpkin cart!

588
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:13,664
So refreshing!

589
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:17,244
Okay! Today was another fruitful day.

590
00:44:17,244 --> 00:44:21,632
If you're all done, then pour the soup
into the thermos.

591
00:44:26,568 --> 00:44:28,865
When are you going to tell the family?

592
00:44:30,653 --> 00:44:32,454
You can't tell anybody.

593
00:44:32,454 --> 00:44:34,514
You think it's easy to become a writer?

594
00:44:34,514 --> 00:44:36,400
You're quitting a perfectly
good teaching job.

595
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,889
If others hear about this
they'll think you're crazy...

596
00:44:39,889 --> 00:44:43,202
Hae Soo! What are you doing?
You said you'd be ready in 15 minutes.

597
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:45,568
You should've just left
if I was running late.

598
00:44:45,568 --> 00:44:47,963
How could I leave without all
the costumes and makeup?

599
00:44:47,963 --> 00:44:49,748
I'm done. I'm done!

600
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,581
What were you guys talking about?

601
00:44:52,581 --> 00:44:54,168
Talking about what?

602
00:44:54,168 --> 00:44:56,039
Why would you cover
her mouth with your hand?

603
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:58,659
Tell me now before you
get in more trouble!

604
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:01,076
That only worked when we were young.

605
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:03,346
You said you're late! You should go!

606
00:45:03,346 --> 00:45:06,474
Are you not taking me seriously
because you're older now?

607
00:45:06,474 --> 00:45:08,474
Hurry up and go!

608
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,541
Dad!

609
00:45:16,253 --> 00:45:18,983
My third daughter came this time!

610
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:22,853
Hae Soo's tutor ended late,
so the food ran late.

611
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:28,275
My daughters are struggling
because of the strike.

612
00:45:28,275 --> 00:45:30,076
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

613
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,235
You were hungry.

614
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:41,130
- So refreshing!
- Aren't you tired?

615
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,786
It seems like you're standing
most of the time when you're busy.

616
00:45:43,786 --> 00:45:46,826
Hm? It's not tiring.

617
00:45:46,826 --> 00:45:52,943
Hey. All the workers here are
saying my daughters are all beautiful.

618
00:45:52,943 --> 00:45:55,583
It's all thanks to you.

619
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,050
Are you sorry about something?

620
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,889
- What?
- You're being so soft.

621
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:02,730
I'm suspicious of your ulterior motives.

622
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,807
What ulterior motives?

623
00:46:04,807 --> 00:46:08,885
I just have a similar head size as you.

624
00:46:08,885 --> 00:46:13,369
What do you mean? Who says
my head is big like that?

625
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:16,251
Okay! Okay! Go ahead and eat!

626
00:46:16,251 --> 00:46:19,007
Should we stop by a cart
and grab some chicken feet?

627
00:46:19,007 --> 00:46:20,519
Chicken feet sound good!

628
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:23,041
Then what should you make?

629
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,967
- Noodle soup!
- That's right!

630
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:29,717
Hot noodle soup with spicy chicken feet!

631
00:46:29,717 --> 00:46:32,456
With soju!

632
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:38,623
Nothing pleases you except for
a glass of soju at the end of your night.

633
00:46:38,623 --> 00:46:40,309
What else should I ask for?

634
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:42,831
Life is like that.

635
00:46:42,831 --> 00:46:44,750
I don't wish for much.

636
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,969
Don't stress your oldest sister.

637
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:49,309
That's all that I want.

638
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:50,619
Okay.

639
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:54,788
Every family has those
who obstruct oncoming obstacles.

640
00:46:54,788 --> 00:46:59,391
All parents face hardships before
they mature into better parents.

641
00:46:59,391 --> 00:47:03,612
You'll know what I mean after you get
married and have children of your own.

642
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,268
Yes.

643
00:47:05,268 --> 00:47:08,105
Life as a professor is good, right?

644
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:09,876
Of course.

645
00:47:09,876 --> 00:47:12,759
I'm not worried about you.

646
00:47:12,759 --> 00:47:15,231
I'm worried about Hae Jin though.

647
00:47:15,231 --> 00:47:17,090
Hae Jin is too uptight!

648
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,657
Here. Here.

649
00:47:26,672 --> 00:47:30,730
It must have been hard to
prepare all this after school, right?

650
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,114
I feel bad eating this.

651
00:47:33,114 --> 00:47:34,757
Please eat a lot.

652
00:47:34,757 --> 00:47:36,135
My goodness.

653
00:47:36,135 --> 00:47:38,699
Look at our daughter-in-law
who made fried squash.

654
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:41,798
She made them so nicely.

655
00:47:41,798 --> 00:47:44,148
Eat a lot, Mother.

656
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:49,936
The vegetables taste good too! There's
nothing you don't know how to do!

657
00:47:51,385 --> 00:47:56,043
Oh by the way! Next week, our youngest
aunt is having her 60th birthday party.

658
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:57,465
What?

659
00:47:57,465 --> 00:47:59,864
Who has a 60th birthday
celebration these days?

660
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:03,585
All our aunts and uncles
are going to come up!

661
00:48:04,443 --> 00:48:07,106
I'm going to tell them to
stay here for a couple days.

662
00:48:07,106 --> 00:48:11,137
- What?
- We won't get many chances to see them.

663
00:48:11,137 --> 00:48:14,005
This is the time we get together
to chat with one another.

664
00:48:14,005 --> 00:48:15,764
Where are they going to stay?

665
00:48:15,764 --> 00:48:17,289
- Here.
- Mother.

666
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:20,320
I have a daughter-in-law who knows
how to cook. Let me brag a little!

667
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,431
Where are they all going to sleep?

668
00:48:22,431 --> 00:48:23,989
What do you mean?

669
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:29,353
The aunts can stay in my room and Hoon's.
The uncles can sleep in the living room.

670
00:48:29,353 --> 00:48:33,766
- Mother.
- Let me call them while I remember.

671
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,650
Hi this is Bong Soo's house!

672
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,684
Have you been well?

673
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,208
I see.

674
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:46,195
While you're up here next week,
stay at our house for several days.

675
00:48:46,195 --> 00:48:48,387
My daughter-in-law said so.

676
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:52,005
Yes. She is so bright.

677
00:48:55,445 --> 00:48:57,112
Yeah.

678
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,418
- Why is your mother doing this?
- She's close to her aunts.

679
00:49:09,418 --> 00:49:13,081
She saw her aunts often
after Father passed away.

680
00:49:13,081 --> 00:49:15,233
You think that's why
she's doing this right now?

681
00:49:15,233 --> 00:49:16,516
What else would it be?

682
00:49:16,516 --> 00:49:19,889
I hate it when anyone
comes over to visit.

683
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:22,248
I absolutely hate it
when people stay over!

684
00:49:22,248 --> 00:49:23,934
Are your aunts strangers to you?

685
00:49:23,934 --> 00:49:27,893
You want me to live with
people I've only seen a few times?

686
00:49:27,893 --> 00:49:29,753
Do you want to see me go crazy?

687
00:49:29,753 --> 00:49:32,661
What do you want me to do?
She already called!

688
00:49:34,188 --> 00:49:36,869
This is nonsense.

689
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:40,842
I hate this. I hate this!

690
00:49:40,842 --> 00:49:47,324
Nowadays, it's worse to bring
relatives home than to go visit them.

691
00:49:47,324 --> 00:49:50,190
Call them right now. Tell them
something came up and cancel it!

692
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,148
- No.
- Mom!

693
00:49:52,148 --> 00:49:53,992
Don't "Mom" me!

694
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:56,711
How dare she try to win against an adult?

695
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:05,543
I... have no idea how to stop my mother.

696
00:50:05,543 --> 00:50:07,597
It must be hard for you
to be in the middle.

697
00:50:07,597 --> 00:50:09,996
Even a flea that is too small to
be seen by the naked eye has a face

698
00:50:09,996 --> 00:50:13,289
but living in my wife's home,
my mother and my sister both...

699
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:16,329
How does she not understand my situation?

700
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:18,387
Have a drink.

701
00:50:25,465 --> 00:50:31,264
I know this is not something
I should say in front of you, but...

702
00:50:31,264 --> 00:50:34,422
to be honest, I find
my mother burdensome.

703
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:38,855
- What did you say?
- If I see how pitiful she is

704
00:50:38,855 --> 00:50:41,528
the feeling is endless,
but pity is one thing.

705
00:50:41,528 --> 00:50:48,472
She is becoming more burdensome
as life gets more difficult.

706
00:50:48,472 --> 00:50:51,733
Parents also think their
kids are burdensome at times.

707
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:55,634
You think kids are always
lovable to parents?

708
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,108
There might be no other relationship

709
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:02,567
that is more burdensome
than between parents and kids.

710
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:05,653
If it's other people, you
just have to stop seeing them

711
00:51:05,653 --> 00:51:07,400
but because they're your parents...

712
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,565
Because they are your kids, you can't
not see them or throw them out.

713
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:16,527
That's when you have to be patient.
When you do that...

714
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:21,681
Plus, is there a relationship
like parents and children?

715
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:29,804
The only people parents would die for
with no regrets, are their children.

716
00:51:29,804 --> 00:51:32,355
If you can die for your child

717
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:35,143
then why can't you just be
patient with your daughter-in-law?

718
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:40,867
If it was only affecting me,
then I would tolerate it

719
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:44,380
but I have a wife and a kid.

720
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:49,181
If I keep holding it in like this,
then I might go crazy.

721
00:51:52,054 --> 00:51:53,757
Here.

722
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:15,811
You're working so hard
without getting any rest.

723
00:52:15,811 --> 00:52:19,800
We ran out of the kimchi we prepared,
so we don't have any kimchi to eat.

724
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,152
It's more than one or two
things that's becoming a hassle

725
00:52:23,152 --> 00:52:26,086
ever since Hoon's grandmother
went on a strike.

726
00:52:26,086 --> 00:52:28,650
She worked hard before.

727
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:32,101
Thanks to her, we were able to work at
ease without worrying about house chores.

728
00:52:32,101 --> 00:52:36,539
Speaking of that, do you
want to talk to Hae Jin?

729
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:39,740
I don't think she has a lecture today.
I think she's upstairs.

730
00:52:46,835 --> 00:52:51,554
My biggest regret in
life is getting married.

731
00:52:51,554 --> 00:52:53,773
Hae Jin.

732
00:52:53,773 --> 00:52:55,677
But she must want
excellent daughters-in-law.

733
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:57,416
That person should
be thinking of her son.

734
00:52:57,416 --> 00:53:00,733
What do you mean that person?
She's your mother-in-law.

735
00:53:00,733 --> 00:53:02,289
This situation is the same.

736
00:53:02,289 --> 00:53:04,811
What else is this other than
trying to make my life miserable?

737
00:53:04,811 --> 00:53:06,981
How could this even happen?

738
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:10,621
Is that how you should look at marriage?

739
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:14,409
How can you be so foolish to get into
an ego fight with your mother-in-law?

740
00:53:14,409 --> 00:53:17,768
Don't talk as if you know
if you aren't married.

741
00:53:17,768 --> 00:53:19,295
What?

742
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:23,398
I'm saying you're less convincing
because you haven't been in my shoes.

743
00:53:23,398 --> 00:53:25,110
Is that how you should talk to me?

744
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,824
We live with his mother
and his older sister.

745
00:53:27,824 --> 00:53:29,530
How else am I supposed tolerate this?

746
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:32,398
You break all the good things you do!

747
00:53:32,398 --> 00:53:34,469
Why do you have to always talk like that?

748
00:53:34,469 --> 00:53:38,771
We tolerate you because we're family,
but you think strangers would?

749
00:53:42,311 --> 00:53:47,458
I know that this is hard for you, and I
know you're not someone without patience.

750
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,385
I don't know. I don't know.

751
00:53:49,385 --> 00:53:51,746
Just go downstairs. My head hurts.

752
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:04,516
So?

753
00:54:04,516 --> 00:54:06,572
Did you talk to her?

754
00:54:06,572 --> 00:54:08,798
I don't think I got
through to her one bit.

755
00:54:08,798 --> 00:54:11,320
We raised her thinking
everything was fine

756
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,804
because she did well in academics but...

757
00:54:13,804 --> 00:54:17,789
We should be proud of her for growing
up even in such a hard environment.

758
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:19,701
I'm sure it will get
better as she gets older.

759
00:54:19,701 --> 00:54:23,474
You're only a couple years older
and you're completely fine.

760
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:30,655
This is only making you suffer.

761
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:33,277
You don't have to worry about me.
Go inside and rest.

762
00:54:33,277 --> 00:54:37,402
I have to go to the cafe.
I have to relieve Hae Soo.

763
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:39,668
Really?

764
00:54:39,668 --> 00:54:41,668
Work hard.

765
00:54:41,668 --> 00:54:43,505
It's not that hard.

766
00:54:46,222 --> 00:54:48,023
Are you crazy?

767
00:54:48,023 --> 00:54:50,302
I think it's a good idea.

768
00:54:50,302 --> 00:54:52,922
Do you want your mother to pull my hair?

769
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,068
It's another house that we use

770
00:54:55,068 --> 00:54:58,742
whenever friends from out of the country
come over to stay for a month or two.

771
00:54:58,742 --> 00:55:00,420
Don't be ridiculous.

772
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,833
I'm always worried
about what you're eating.

773
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,244
How is your health going
to sustain you like that?

774
00:55:06,244 --> 00:55:07,887
You want me to also eat there?

775
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:11,184
I mean, why wouldn't I feed my
friend who is staying at my house?

776
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:13,496
Your mother is going to faint.

777
00:55:13,496 --> 00:55:16,603
We're friends who haven't
laid a hand on each other.

778
00:55:18,396 --> 00:55:22,034
I am formally inviting
you over, Yoo Ji Na.

779
00:55:23,681 --> 00:55:26,315
If your mother invites me over,
then I'll think about it

780
00:55:26,315 --> 00:55:28,463
Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

781
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:41,451
I wonder if it's because
it's spring... I have no appetite.

782
00:55:41,451 --> 00:55:43,818
I have something to say.

783
00:55:45,532 --> 00:55:48,900
I'd like to invite someone
to stay at our other house.

784
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,221
Why are you asking me that?

785
00:55:51,221 --> 00:55:53,329
Do whatever you want.

786
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:56,784
I'll take that as a yes.

787
00:55:56,784 --> 00:55:58,288
Who is it?

788
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:01,324
Is it a friend coming from
out of the country?

789
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:05,835
You know... Yoo Ji Na, right, Mother?

790
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,248
Let me see you for a minute.

791
00:56:18,963 --> 00:56:21,309
Who?

792
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:23,842
You're now planning to
bring her into the house?

793
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:27,284
Father, if you could see me...

794
00:56:35,161 --> 00:56:39,398
There is one way you can convince her.

795
00:56:39,398 --> 00:56:41,181
Really?

796
00:56:42,456 --> 00:56:45,266
That's what you came up with

797
00:56:45,266 --> 00:56:48,177
after you staying at the villa
for the past few days?

798
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:56,135
You're trying to belittle me
in front of my grandchildren!

799
00:56:56,135 --> 00:56:57,994
Of course not.

800
00:56:57,994 --> 00:56:59,588
Then what?

801
00:56:59,588 --> 00:57:02,775
What kind of ludicrous statement
was that in front of everyone?

802
00:57:02,775 --> 00:57:05,559
I have one more request.

803
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:09,224
Please extend your
invitation to her directly.

804
00:57:09,224 --> 00:57:12,554
- What?
- If you can tell her directly

805
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:15,942
that it is okay for her to stay,
that would be greatly appreciated.

806
00:57:15,942 --> 00:57:18,264
Are you out of your mind?

807
00:57:18,264 --> 00:57:21,735
If not, then I'll step away
from my position.

808
00:57:21,735 --> 00:57:24,121
Wh... What?

809
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:27,297
I'll turn over everything to Hyun Sung

810
00:57:27,297 --> 00:57:29,289
and I'll relax comfortably.

811
00:57:29,289 --> 00:57:33,737
Oh my goodness... What does he know?

812
00:57:33,737 --> 00:57:37,452
I'm sure he can learn
with professional training.

813
00:57:37,452 --> 00:57:44,043
It might be better if I turn it over to
him while I can still give him support.

814
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,396
Then, what about me?

815
00:57:47,865 --> 00:57:50,393
You want to turn me into
an old, shriveled up grandma

816
00:57:50,393 --> 00:57:53,565
who's always cautious
of her grandchildren?

817
00:57:53,565 --> 00:57:57,824
It's about time that you also
go on vacation and rest.

818
00:57:57,824 --> 00:58:00,248
Says who?

819
00:58:00,248 --> 00:58:03,387
All because of some wench!

820
00:58:06,918 --> 00:58:08,454
Fine.

821
00:58:08,454 --> 00:58:14,525
If you like her that much, then live
with her until you get sick of her.

822
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:18,173
I can turn the other way for that much.

823
00:58:18,173 --> 00:58:21,364
She is not someone you can
treat in that manner.

824
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,003
What did you say?

825
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:36,367
In the next board of directors meeting,
I will announce my retirement.

826
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:14,389
Even if you're not going to work,
shouldn't you get some rest?

827
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:18,277
It's okay. I'm so used
to sleeping late now.

828
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:21,931
Let's see...

829
00:59:21,931 --> 00:59:26,452
Instead of sitting around and singing,
should we try something different?

830
00:59:26,452 --> 00:59:28,103
Something different?

831
00:59:28,103 --> 00:59:29,802
Like what?

832
00:59:31,623 --> 00:59:33,175
Want to dance?

833
00:59:33,175 --> 00:59:36,313
Dance? No way.

834
00:59:36,313 --> 00:59:39,195
I've never danced.

835
00:59:39,195 --> 00:59:42,235
You said you'd try things
you've never done before with me.

836
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:57,916
I can't teach you, but I can
certainly dance with you.

837
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:04,670
Dancing is not that big of a deal.

838
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:08,112
All you have to do is listen to
the music and sway back and forth.

839
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:16,980
I probably look ridiculous.

840
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:22,494
Not at all. When good looking people
sway back and forth, it's called dancing.

841
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:24,309
No way.

842
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:35,021
You're better than I thought.

843
01:00:35,021 --> 01:00:36,929
Don't you think you're a natural?

844
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:40,432
I'm just rocking back and forth.

845
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:44,302
You are a musician.

846
01:00:44,302 --> 01:00:47,061
I'm sure you were born with rhythm.

847
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:07,561
It's much different than sitting
and listening to music, right?

848
01:01:13,099 --> 01:01:15,056
You changed your shampoo.

849
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,300
I splurged a little.

850
01:01:20,672 --> 01:01:25,208
I can hear you breathing.

851
01:01:25,208 --> 01:01:27,688
That doesn't make you
feel uncomfortable, right?

852
01:01:31,543 --> 01:01:36,123
You smell nice too.

853
01:01:36,123 --> 01:01:38,045
It's cheap cologne.

854
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,000
What do I look like?

855
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:52,349
I've never been curious about it before.

856
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,150
Touch your face.

857
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,063
I'm not talking about
the indents in my face.

858
01:01:58,063 --> 01:01:59,978
I'm talking about when others see me.

859
01:02:04,407 --> 01:02:06,746
Why are you curious about it now?

860
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:11,737
Why?

861
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,500
You're teasing me, right?

862
01:02:21,615 --> 01:02:24,286
To be honest...

863
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:29,327
you're indescribably handsome.

864
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:36,092
To the point, it's a waste
to just leave you like this.

865
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:40,061
That's good to hear.

866
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,211
You believed that?

867
01:02:43,211 --> 01:02:44,833
What?

868
01:02:48,677 --> 01:02:52,268
It's nice to see you smile more often.

869
01:02:53,934 --> 01:02:57,733
Does Yoo Ji Na also have long hair?

870
01:02:57,733 --> 01:03:00,067
Of course it's long.

871
01:03:01,516 --> 01:03:05,112
I told you I always make
myself look like her.

872
01:03:06,929 --> 01:03:10,931
If she grows her hair out,
then I grow my hair.

873
01:03:10,931 --> 01:03:15,516
If she cuts her hair, I cut mine.

874
01:03:15,516 --> 01:03:17,936
Her hair is long, I see.

875
01:03:17,936 --> 01:03:20,286
Why are you curious?

876
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,701
Hello.

877
01:03:35,701 --> 01:03:39,268
Ah. The company that
I told you about last time.

878
01:03:44,134 --> 01:03:46,143
Didn't we say we wouldn't mention that?

879
01:03:46,143 --> 01:03:47,639
Of course we did

880
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:51,737
but she brought it up first and
asked if this was your request.

881
01:03:51,737 --> 01:03:55,474
Does that mean Jung Hae Dang
knows that I asked?

882
01:03:55,474 --> 01:03:57,326
I'm sorry.

883
01:03:57,326 --> 01:04:02,025
At this point, no matter which agency
asks, the situation will be the same.

884
01:04:03,813 --> 01:04:06,525
What kind of lousy job is this?

885
01:04:15,628 --> 01:04:17,956
<i>Don't worry.</i>

886
01:04:17,956 --> 01:04:20,570
The situation you're
worried about won't happen.

887
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:22,347
What am I worried about?

888
01:04:22,347 --> 01:04:25,630
The child in the picture...

889
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:28,885
I don't have any reason to bring it up.

890
01:04:28,885 --> 01:04:31,554
Isn't that what you're worried about?
Isn't that why you're here?

891
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:52,034
<i>[Yoo Ji Na]</i>

892
01:05:00,056 --> 01:05:02,199
Just meet me once.

893
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:05,018
I told you there is no need to do that.

894
01:05:05,018 --> 01:05:07,585
I think there's a misunderstanding.

895
01:05:07,585 --> 01:05:11,416
Whether you believe me or not,
that was not my intention.

896
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:14,844
<i>Let's meet and talk. Please.</i>

897
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:17,139
I'm in your neighborhood.

898
01:05:17,139 --> 01:05:20,793
I passed by a cafe nearby.
It looked quiet.

899
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:24,378
I'm going to wait until you come out.

900
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:53,668
Welcome. The worker left temporarily.

901
01:05:53,668 --> 01:05:56,221
Do you mind waiting?

902
01:05:56,221 --> 01:05:58,034
It doesn't matter.

905
01:06:46,822 --> 01:06:50,070
<i>I heard Yoo Ji Na came here.
Do you know why?</i>

906
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:52,824
<i>- Get out!
- Where are you touching? You're single!</i>

907
01:06:52,824 --> 01:06:54,695
<i>- I'm leaving.
- Are you Hae Dang's friend?</i>

908
01:06:54,695 --> 01:06:56,007
<i>Ah yes, I'm her friend!</i>

909
01:06:56,007 --> 01:06:58,264
<i>I heard she had a talk with an agency.</i>

910
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,681
<i>She said they were crooks!</i>

911
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:02,063
<i>They were crooks...</i>

912
01:07:02,063 --> 01:07:04,396
<i>You and the cafe owner
aren't anything, are you?</i>

913
01:07:04,396 --> 01:07:08,248
<i>- Of course not.
- There is nothing I can do for you.</i>

914
01:07:08,248 --> 01:07:10,793
<i>Just don't disappear on me.</i>

915
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:14,855
<i>Okay. Why don't you move into our house?</i>

916
01:07:14,855 --> 01:07:17,492
<i>Why do you think your
oldest son wanted to see me?</i>

917
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:21,197
<i>- Why are you curious?
- I'd like to move in.</i>
