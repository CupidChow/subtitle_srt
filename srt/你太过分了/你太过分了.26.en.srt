<i>[Episode 26]</i>

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,840
How are you feeling?

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,650
You are getting old.
You should control your temper now.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,450
Your body is not able
to handle it anymore.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,400
It's the first time you really fainted.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,130
You really fainted this time.
You don't know how shocked I was.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,220
She gave birth and abandoned
the child... Oh my gosh.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:42,560
I accepted it so you should, too.
I have children, too.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,720
She abandoned her child.
How could a human do that?

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,610
Oh gosh. How can you even love
such a person?

12
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,830
Mother, how do you feel?

13
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,320
Can't you see how I feel?

14
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,760
Why? Are you disappointed?

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,610
You wanted me to die
when I fainted, didn't you?

16
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,310
Are you disappointed that
I haven't died yet?

17
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,680
Why would you say that?

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,340
Get out! I feel like I'm going to faint
after seeing your face again.

19
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,660
You should get well soon
so that you can come to our wedding.

20
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:47,320
I really want you
to be there at the wedding.

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,540
Oh goodness.

22
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,040
Don't think life is easy.

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,110
Aren't you ashamed
that you abandoned your own child?

24
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,600
Are you going
to keep talking to me like that?

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,400
Can't you tell?
My children are my own enemies.

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,260
No one else is my enemy.
In fact, you even abandoned yours.

27
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,570
That child of yours will finish
your life in the end.

28
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,380
I will eat my hat if I'm wrong.

29
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,180
Please take good care of yourself
and get well.

30
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,900
Of course I will.

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,590
I'm going to take
good care of myself and eat well

32
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,260
so that I can be alive to witness

33
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,910
you shedding bitter tears
over your child one day.

34
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,500
Get out! I don't want to see you.
Get out!

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,750
Where did you spend the 10 million won?

36
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,030
Can you not ask that? Please?

37
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,090
Where did you spend it?
Did you lose it in the stock market?

38
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,160
Where did you spend it?

39
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,610
I didn't spend it.

40
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,560
Then what did you do with it?

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,800
- I lent the money to someone.
- To whom?

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,780
I will tell you later.

43
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,910
Where are you going?

44
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,010
I'm going to get some water!

45
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,500
Who did you lend the money to?
Aren't you going to tell me?

46
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,130
Oh gosh.

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,650
Who did you lend the money to?

48
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,330
There was a person
I wanted to lend the money to.

49
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,310
- Don't follow me around.
- Who did you lend the money to?

50
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,650
Stop following me!

51
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,870
Oh man.

52
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,260
Oh gosh. I told you to stop following me.

53
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,700
Who did you lend the money to?

54
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,870
Wow. You are so persistent.

55
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,810
Who did you lend the money to?

56
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,970
I feel like
I'm being interrogated by a cop.

57
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,240
- Who did you lend the money to?
- Can you please stop?

58
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,340
Stop following me!
Please! You are scaring me.

59
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,740
- Oh dang it.
- Who did you lend the money to?

60
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:57,510
Mom! I don't think I can live with
this woman. She scares me. Oh gosh.

61
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,410
Don't follow me!

62
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,860
Please don't follow me.

63
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,110
If you follow me
one more step from there

64
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,370
then I'm going to jump
off the roof to my death.

65
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,060
Don't follow me.
Don't follow me.

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,280
Don't follow me.

67
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,400
Where did you spend the money?

68
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,740
Please stop it.

69
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,060
Stop what? I just started.

70
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,500
You I still have my dignity.
I am never going to tell you.

71
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,910
What? Your dignity?

72
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,430
I am not a descendant
of a Korean independence activist.

73
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,490
But I won't say even if I get tortured.

74
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,970
Did you lend the money to the woman?

75
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,310
Oh gosh. Be quiet.

76
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,890
Just tell me.

77
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,710
Don't tell my wife.

78
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,580
Unless you want to see me suffer
until I die, don't even say a word.

79
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,900
Did you really lend
the money to that woman?

80
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,350
When are you going to get the money back?

81
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,500
She disappeared... with the wind.

82
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,820
This crazy guy!

83
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,230
Oh, Mom!

84
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,240
Love that travels straight to your heart?

85
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,350
A poignant memory?

86
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,680
It must be poignant
since you lost your precious money.

87
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,870
It must be traveling
straight to your heart. You idiot!

88
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,140
You!

89
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:42,670
I yelled at him to get his confession
about where he used the 10 million won.

90
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,660
But he wouldn't say.

91
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,740
Where did he have his money taken?

92
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,110
What? No.

93
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,610
"It must be traveling
straight to your heart"

94
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,110
"since you lost
your precious money. You idiot!"

95
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,660
Isn't that what you said?

96
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,140
When did I say that?

97
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,550
You know he is an idiot in so many ways.

98
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,100
We are going to get
a confession from him someday!

99
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,310
Mom!

100
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,460
Did you sleep well?

101
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,740
Mother. You should add "Mother."

102
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,940
Did you sleep well...

103
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,390
Mother?

104
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,180
What kind of soup
are you going to make for breakfast?

105
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,160
Aren't you going to cook with me?

106
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,150
I'm going to be doing yoga in my house.
So come get me when you are done.

107
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,490
What are you going to do
in the other house?

108
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,110
Did you sleep well, Mother?

109
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,350
Go to the kitchen and prepare the meal.

110
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:17,450
You can make
the soybean paste stew. Go make it.

111
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,380
I am not good at cooking so I got

112
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,300
housewife's eczema after
cooking a few meals.

113
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,160
I cannot cook anymore.

114
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,230
She is saying
that she has nothing to lose now.

115
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,070
You should greet me if you see me.

116
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,380
What?

117
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,500
You are a highly educated man.

118
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,210
Why don't you say,
"Good morning" to your mother?

119
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,420
Mother, my butt.

120
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,620
Did you just talk down to me?

121
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,010
Excuse me! Mrs. Yoo Ji Na!

122
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,020
There are two kinds
of women in this world.

123
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,430
There are women who never abandon their
children no matter how much they suffer.

124
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,730
And there are bitches who abandon their
children to survive by themselves.

125
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,470
- Bitches?
- And you want to be called my mother?

126
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,230
I won't call you Mother
even if you kill me.

127
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,120
It doesn't matter if you get upset.

128
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,990
I'm legally the wife
of Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

129
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,210
So what  does that make me legally
to Park Hyun Joon?

130
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,330
So do you like the laws?

131
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,870
I asked you if you like the laws.

132
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,280
Of course I do.

133
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,440
Because they guarantee
my legal rights in this house.

134
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,900
My rights.

135
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,550
Because of the laws that you like, you
will become the wife of a murderer.

136
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,530
What?

137
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,710
What do you mean?

138
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,250
Why would I tell you what I meant?

139
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,640
I'm going to just watch
you turning, in one day

140
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,020
from the wife of a chairman,
into the wife of a murderer.

141
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,550
Mother? She is really acting up.

142
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,150
- Who is acting up?
- What?

143
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,980
Were you just saying that
to your stepmother?

144
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,420
No. I was saying that to the new woman
of Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

145
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,820
The new woman?

146
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,130
You two are a perfect match.
You will be happy for a while.

147
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,250
How can you love a woman
who abandoned her own child?

148
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,110
She must have had a reason.

149
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,400
Ah. So according to
Chairman Park Sung Hwan

150
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,480
children can be raised
when the circumstances are right

151
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,470
but they can be abandoned
in unfavorable circumstances.

152
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,660
I know that you are offended
because we got married

153
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,300
although you were so against it.

154
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,520
But a man shouldn't be so small-minded.

155
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,610
What?

156
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,780
You haven't done anything with your life

157
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,960
because you were too busy
feeling sorry for yourself.

158
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,700
You are a loser.

159
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,490
I would never consider
a person like you my son.

160
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,770
So stay out of my life.

161
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,860
You are annoying and bothersome.

162
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,550
I thought you were going to do yoga?

163
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,240
When are you going to introduce
Kyung Soo to the family members?

164
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,970
At this point, there is no need to lie
that he is the son of some other woman.

165
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,610
I agree.

166
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,580
Should I ask him to come over for dinner?

167
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:44,420
I can introduce him to the family only
if he is willing to meet them.

168
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,110
Why would I go there?

169
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,040
We registered our marriage.

170
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,720
He said he's not only
going to accept you as his son

171
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,960
but he's going to make you love him.

172
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,610
What more do you want?

173
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,320
I don't want anything.

174
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,910
I don't want anything from Yoo Ji Na.

175
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,540
So why would I want
anything from Park Sung Hwan?

176
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,620
Don't think about pulling me
into any of this.

177
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,840
Since it seems like you got married,
please live happily.

178
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,520
Then... who are you
going to live happily with?

179
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,720
Are you going to live happily
with Jung Hae Dang?

180
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,280
Do you think I will let that happen?

181
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,890
Why was that woman here?

182
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,350
That must be heavy.
I will carry it for you.

183
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,060
You don't need to.

184
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,620
You must be hot.
Please come in and have a glass of juice.

185
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,890
Oh! That sounds good.

186
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:58,460
Um. Do you know Yoo Ji Na by any chance?

187
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,800
Ah. I do.

188
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,180
Oh geez. She is really mean.

189
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,090
Hae Dang was slapped by that woman.

190
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,230
She was slapped?

191
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,400
How could she treat her like that just
because she lives off singing her songs?

192
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,640
<i>Tell her to break up with Lee Kyung Soo.</i>

193
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,520
It's none of your business.

194
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,970
Lee Kyung Soo... is my son.

195
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,180
<i>Hae Dang was slapped by that woman.</i>

196
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,500
Hi, Father!

197
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,150
Please come here and sit.

198
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,120
I just made juice. Would you like some?

199
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,750
I heard that you are Yoo Ji Na's son.

200
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,680
Where did you hear that?

201
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,600
I heard it from Yoo Ji Na.

202
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:44,680
You probably know that Yoo Ji Na...
your mother...

203
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,030
does not like Hae Dang very much, right?

204
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:53,370
Father. You don't
have to worry about that.

205
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,420
Move far away with Hae Dang.

206
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,860
W... What?

207
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,580
Hae Dang likes you a lot.

208
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:13,380
You only live once. You shouldn't care
about other things too much.

209
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,480
Father.

210
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,060
She had to go through a lot in the past.

211
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,380
As your mother said,
she was supposedly a night club singer

212
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,800
but she was actually treated
like a cabaret dancer.

213
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,340
She did all that to feed
and support her younger sisters.

214
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,660
Yoo Ji Na said that?

215
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,010
I can't ask you to break up with her
because I feel sorry for her.

216
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:45,990
So you two should run away to a place
where your mother can't find you.

217
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,290
- Father.
- I'm begging you.

218
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,900
Please do as I say.

219
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,140
My dad said that to you?

220
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,200
I think he is saying that because

221
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,850
someone calling herself my mother
is pestering you so much.

222
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,030
But how can we all of a sudden...

223
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,290
Should we... just move far away?

224
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,470
We talked about moving
to the countryside someday anyway.

225
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,700
I can't stand her looking down on you

226
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,800
and treating you so badly just because
she is my biological mother.

227
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,400
I heard she even slapped you.

228
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,850
We can't stop her.
She will never change.

229
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,230
But Kyung Soo...

230
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,800
I don't need a mother anyway.

231
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,700
We are going to have our wedding
as soon as we get ready.

232
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,500
It's popular among celebrities
these days to have a small wedding.

233
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,520
Let's just announce our marriage
in front of the journalists

234
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,540
and take some photos
and then go on a trip.

235
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,930
Wouldn't you be sad?

236
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,330
I'm sure you would
be embarrassed to make a fuss.

237
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,840
I appreciate you considering me.
But it's your first marriage.

238
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,140
First marriage? It's not like she
is completely single.

239
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,160
"First marriage", that puts me to shame.

240
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,700
Mother.

241
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,310
What did the child's father do?

242
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,240
I'm sure the child was born
because he had a father.

243
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,370
Mother.

244
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,830
What did the child's father do?

245
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,180
Is he alive or dead?
Was he a married man?

246
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,740
Oh gosh. You don't need to say.

247
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,250
Why else would you have given birth
when you were so young?

248
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:16,220
Oh geez. In short, you are just dirty.

249
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,030
I think I have to excuse myself.

250
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,020
Please excuse me, too.

251
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,200
I can never eat a meal in peace.

252
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,520
What have you cooked?
There is nothing to eat!

253
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,730
I have prepared as usual.

254
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,470
Is an old person who can't digest food
the only person living in this house?

255
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,400
Everyone else needs to eat well to work.

256
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,130
Starting tomorrow, tell me what you are
going to cook each time.

257
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,610
Why does she need to listen to you?

258
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,810
Then who does she need to listen to?

259
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,040
Who are you to tell her what to do?
How dare you?

260
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,930
Why can't I say that
to my daughter-in-law?

261
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,620
You are a mother-in-law who is only
a few years older than her!

262
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,740
Oh gosh. Are you showing off
that you seduced

263
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,860
and married a man
who is 18 years older than you?

264
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,850
Should you wear a medal for that?

265
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,380
Shame on you.

266
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,040
In fact, you gave birth
at such a young age.

267
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,090
So you probably are a master
at those things by now.

268
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,770
How vulgar!

269
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,240
- Mother!
- I am not your mother!

270
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,790
Please watch your temper
for your children's sake.

271
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,360
What? "Watch my temper"?

272
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,650
They say, "An old person in the house
with a bad temper"

273
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,940
"stands in the way of their children."

274
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,040
An old person?

275
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,210
I am telling you this as the lady of
the house because I am worried that

276
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,730
unfortunate things
could happen to your children.

277
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,710
Unfortunate things?

278
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:09,690
You eventually made your daughter-in-law
kill herself because of your bad temper.

279
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,880
That...

280
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:24,120
Wh... What did that woman just say to me?
I am at a loss for words.

281
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,950
She is just saying whatever she wants to
now that they are legally married.

282
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,150
Oh my.

283
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,980
Have a nice day.

284
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,780
Bye now.

285
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,110
Don't be too hurt
even if my mother says hurtful things.

286
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,560
Don't worry. I will endure it
until she likes me.

287
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,710
Thank you.

288
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,760
Ah.

289
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,220
Who was the child's father by the way?

290
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,450
Why are you curious to know that now?

291
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,290
Was he really a married man
as my mother said?

292
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,700
You can at least tell me
what kind of person he was.

293
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,980
Why are you suddenly curious
to know that now?

294
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,200
I'm going to take him as my son.

295
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,420
Of course I'm curious to know
his biological father.

296
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:32,480
What kind of person would do nothing
when the mother abandoned his child?

297
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,540
Why? Do you feel uncomfortable
without knowing the birth father

298
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,600
now that you are trying
to accept him as your child?

299
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,210
That's not what I exactly meant.

300
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,990
If that's not "exactly" what you meant

301
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,760
then I guess you are feeling
a little uncomfortable.

302
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,920
Bye.

303
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,490
I have something to tell you.

304
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,880
Please do not mention the child's
father in front of Sung Hwan ever again.

305
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,780
- Why?
- It doesn't matter anymore

306
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,670
and it's not meaningful anymore.

307
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:38,330
So that's your favor to ask me?

308
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,210
You are quite shameless.

309
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,560
It hasn't even been
an hour since you told me

310
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,920
to stay quiet and not stand
in the way of my children.

311
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,660
And now you come to me for a favor?

312
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:58,260
I'm sorry but I'm
going to mention it constantly.

313
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,920
Why are you doing this to me?

314
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,680
I'm going to do it without stopping
until Sung Hwan says

315
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,430
he doesn't want to even touch you
because you are so dirty.

316
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,720
What are you going to do now?

317
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,150
Did you think it was over
when you registered your marriage?

318
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,850
Not likely!

319
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:24,060
I'm going to make you so crazy that you
check yourself into a mental institution.

320
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,060
Do you really mean that?

321
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,490
That's what you said.

322
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,930
You said that my specialty
is making my daughter-in-law

323
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,370
kill herself by driving her crazy.

324
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,640
Let me see if you can endure it.

325
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,520
You said you are strong because you are
a vulgar person. Didn't you?

326
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,370
You should desperately endure it because

327
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,220
I'm going to drive you out of your mind.

328
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,330
I wanted you to come over.
But I heard you refused to come.

329
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,960
I am not going there.

330
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,330
As I told you, I will not disclose
myself as Yoo Ji Na's son in public.

331
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,180
And I will not live as your son, either.

332
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:30,350
Maybe we need more time.
I think I was in a rush.

333
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,490
I'll get going then.

334
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:44,560
Have you heard anything about your
biological father from Yoo Ji Na?

335
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,880
Ah. Please don't misunderstand.

336
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,620
I have.

337
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,130
What did he do?

338
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,600
You should ask Ms. Yoo Ji Na.

339
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,860
I'll see you next time then.

340
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,760
Yoo Ji Na told me that she
doesn't even know who the father is.

341
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,000
What?

342
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,330
Even though my last name is Lee

343
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,350
she told me that
she is actually not sure

344
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,380
if my last name should be Kim or Park.

345
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,960
Hi! Did you just get home?

346
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,750
Yes.

347
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,330
Did something happen today?

348
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:08,710
Do you really not know
who your child's father is?

349
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,670
Where did you hear that?

350
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,640
Did you hear that from Kyung Soo?

351
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,260
A mother who gave birth doesn't
even know who the child's father is...

352
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,320
What are you implying?

353
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,770
You really have lived your life
with no definite idea...

354
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,190
ever since you were that age.

355
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,440
Did you have a fight with Father?

356
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,410
No. I didn't.

357
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:11,020
You were so excited
to see him but he was cold.

358
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,520
So I thought you had a lover's quarrel.

359
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,100
Ah. I guess you really fought.

360
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,000
What was the fight about?

361
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,480
- Why did you tell him that?
- Because he asked.

362
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,190
What do you get from disgracing me?

363
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,300
Who are you to slap Hae Dang?

364
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,250
Did she tell you that?

365
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,830
Did you say you got married to a rich
man for me? To make me a rich man?

366
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,120
Please tell that despicable lie
to Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

367
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,130
Then for whom do you think I married
a man who is 18 years older than me?

368
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,160
Maybe because you wanted to hold on
to him after getting dumped by his son.

369
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,390
What?

370
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,950
You really are trash.

371
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:12,130
And you told Hae Dang's father
that she is like a cabaret dancer?

372
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,420
Do you think you are
any better than a cabaret dancer?

373
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,170
Do you know what you are saying?

374
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,610
If you really think of me,
then I don't need anything else.

375
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,170
Tell people that I'm your son.

376
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,520
What do you get if I do that?

377
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,630
I may not get anything from it.
But my wound might be healed.

378
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,830
Do you know how how hurtful it is

379
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,910
to be abandoned by the person
who gave birth to you?

380
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,020
How could you use those hands
that abandoned a blind child

381
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,780
to slap the person I love in the face?

382
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,320
So you told him you don't know
your father to retaliate?

383
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,280
I did. So what?

384
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,560
You really are crazy about Jung Hae Dang.

385
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,940
You are crazy.

386
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,990
Wh... What did you say?

387
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,820
Did you say Kyung Soo is Yoo Ji Na's son?

388
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:29,150
As you know already, Yoo Ji Na stole
the man Hae Dang used to date.

389
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:34,040
Hae Dang! Is everything Dad said true?

390
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,800
How can Hae Dang and Kyung Soo
get married now then?

391
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,750
So they are going to move to a place

392
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,690
where they don't know anyone
and where Yoo Ji Na can't find them.

393
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,420
So you have to start living
without Hae Dang from now on.

394
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,700
Father. That is not possible.

395
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:03,310
Your sister did everything she could
for you. We should let her go now.

396
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,250
I can't do that.

397
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,340
I will just break up with Kyung Soo.

398
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,140
Don't say anything
you will regret all your life.

399
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,250
Yoo Ji Na won't leave you alone
when she finds out.

400
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:21,070
I will deal with that.

401
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,000
Take Kyung Soo and leave quickly.

402
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,590
Do you think she won't find us?

403
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:56,750
Record this house
as your permanent address.

404
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,830
How will she find you if you do that?

405
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,260
Dad...

406
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,000
They are going to move away?

407
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,860
Yes. I told them to move away.

408
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,170
I decided to bear the shame
and think about my child's life.

409
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,260
They said they want to live like that
even if they get to live for only a day.

410
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,100
You only live once you know.

411
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,210
That is a good idea.

412
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:40,880
I also think that is the only way for
them to be free from Yoo Ji Na.

413
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:46,080
Do you think I am being shameless?

414
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,250
No. I think I would have said
the same thing to her

415
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,410
if Hae Dang were my daughter.

416
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,240
That's impossible.

417
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,920
So the child in the picture
was her abandoned child?

418
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,230
Oh gosh. That's why
she freaked out back then.

419
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,910
No wonder she was so mean to Hae Dang.

420
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:21,560
Then is Hae Dang not going to marry him?

421
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,640
Father still wants them
to run away and live together.

422
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,760
Run away? To where?

423
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,670
To a place where Yoo Ji Na
can't find them.

424
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,270
This is not something
to be resolved by running away.

425
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,480
I agree with him.
They can just run away and live together.

426
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,070
She is going to hide her son
until the end.

427
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,510
She doesn't need to be treated
as her mother-in-law.

428
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,100
They can just get away from her
so that she can't pester them.

429
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,820
It's an escape for love.

430
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,870
It won't be so easy
to run away and live as you say.

431
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,190
Would he say that
if there were another way?

432
00:34:54,190 --> 00:35:00,520
In fact, he wouldn't make a hasty
judgment about his children.

433
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,040
He must feel sorry that he made her go
through a lot when she was little.

434
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,960
I agree with him.

435
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,570
I'm also going to help them run away.

436
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:12,740
We are also going to be worse off.

437
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,430
That's not the problem.
We will live with what we have.

438
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:20,870
We had to go through
hardships in the past.

439
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,800
I'm going to start doing
the parcel service again.

440
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,580
I'm also going to study and do
translation work in my spare time.

441
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,800
The translation work
takes up too much of your time.

442
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,180
- I can cut down on sleep.
- How can you cut down even more?

443
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,770
I'm going to learn some technical skills.

444
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,710
I'll make sure to make
a living for myself.

445
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,850
Thank you for everything
you have done for us.

446
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,530
And I'm sorry.

447
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,840
The thought of living in a house without
you makes me feel empty already.

448
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,920
Me, too.

449
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,350
Why are you acting like children?

450
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,780
You can just think
that she got married and moved out.

451
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,170
How can I leave Dad like that?

452
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:16,300
He has Bong Soo.
He is determined to live as his son.

453
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:24,950
You should be free of us
and live comfortably from now on.

454
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:40,990
Um. Father! Aren't you sad?

455
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,840
I will just think
that she is getting married.

456
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:49,490
When Hae Jin got married, it didn't
really feel like she was getting married

457
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:54,090
because she was living
on the second floor.

458
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:57,640
I guess you wouldn't even have
a house for Hae Dang

459
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,200
although she went through
all sorts of hardships.

460
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,300
I could have given her some money
if I could sell this house.

461
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,250
Don't be too sad.
You are still letting her go

462
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,200
so that she can live
with someone she loves.

463
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,930
Oh my gosh.

464
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:27,040
It seems like he is trying to give her
money as soon as this house gets sold.

465
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,360
Then I guess it will be
a big move for us, too.

466
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,010
I think Bong Soo
has money to get a townhouse.

467
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:36,660
You and I should just get a small studio.

468
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,080
I guess so.

469
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,030
- Are you all done?
- What's the occasion?

470
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,330
Nothing.
I just came to have a drink with you.

471
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:14,820
Because of you, I learned about drinking
soju with udon like this at a cart bar.

472
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,300
I guess I won't
be able to see you anymore.

473
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,330
Ah... Did you hear from Dad?

474
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,850
How can he be Yoo Ji Na's son?

475
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,300
How can you love Yoo Ji Na's son?

476
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,800
He has once said
my singing voice is very similar

477
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,310
to his mother's voice when she was young.

478
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,030
I should have sensed it then.

479
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,960
Sure. It might be better
to just move away!

480
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,440
How can I go away?

481
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,850
My contract is still not over yet.

482
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,010
Are you worrying about that right now?

483
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,660
How can I just leave my family?

484
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,880
Just leave them to me and move away.

485
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,700
What are you talking about?

486
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,360
I'll be your father's son
and your sisters' brother.

487
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:30,550
I will do what I can.
So don't worry and just leave.

488
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,730
Hyun Joon...

489
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,510
Be happy with that man.

490
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:39,130
Why would you be my dad's son
and my sisters' brother?

491
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,400
Because I like them.

492
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,340
I like your dad and your family.

493
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:50,160
I seem to like anything
that's related to Hae Dang.

494
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,990
Even the udon noodles
at the local cart bar taste good.

495
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,710
Hyun Joon...

496
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:02,400
Just leave your family to me and go.

497
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,790
Why would I be beholden to you?

498
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,060
Why wouldn't you?

499
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,180
You are not even
in a situation to think about all that.

500
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,080
Just be beholden to me
and let me handle any trouble.

501
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,800
Just live like that for once!

502
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,240
How and when would I ever pay you back?

503
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,140
Pay it back when in the next life.

504
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:30,360
If we meet again in the next life...

505
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,970
then you can pay me back.

506
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:03,490
I can't stand her holding her head high.

507
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,760
You have to be prepared for it
if you want to come over.

508
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,410
I'm sure she has a lot against you, too.

509
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,500
Hi! Grandmother is asleep right now.

510
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,920
Don't worry. I'll see her a little later.

511
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,360
Hi, there!

512
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,460
I will be upstairs. Call me
when Grandmother gets up.

513
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,140
Don't you hear me?

514
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,330
You should greet
your future mother-in-law.

515
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,490
Is that how you were trained at home?

516
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,640
You are a daughter
of an educated and rich family.

517
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,960
Could you please not talk to me
from now on?

518
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,100
What did you say?

519
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,960
If you managed to become
Father's woman after a great struggle

520
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,940
you should just live quietly.

521
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,190
My only mother-in-law
is the one who passed away.

522
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,390
Says who?

523
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,870
My future husband
doesn't consider you his mother.

524
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:18,290
So how can I consider you
my mother-in-law, Ms. Yoo Ji Na?

525
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,420
You don't want to get married
to Hyun Joon, do you?

526
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,500
Hi, Father! It's me, Yoon Hee.

527
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,040
I called you after thinking really hard.

528
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:45,720
I think Stepmother wants
to stop us from getting married.

529
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,510
Do you know why she is doing that?

530
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:58,520
I only met her a few times
but she hates me so much.

531
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,650
I think she just hates the fact that

532
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,780
someone else
is getting married to Hyun Joon.

533
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:10,240
Father, please help me.
Yes. Okay.

534
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,090
He said I shouldn't worry
because he will talk to you.

535
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:23,920
Did he really say that?

536
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,400
He didn't say I misunderstood.
He believed everything I said.

537
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,250
That means Father doesn't trust you.

538
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,140
That kind of suspicion becomes stronger
as you love someone more.

539
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:44,480
Now I see that you
are really the scary one.

540
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,250
I'm dumb so I can't handle my man.

541
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,210
But I naturally can't stand
a person who is so self-centered.

542
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,760
That was good.

543
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,060
Oh gosh. I feel so much better now.

544
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:28,720
I think you have an innate talent
for looking down on people.

545
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,150
I think you have to be born
that way to have those skills.

546
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:35,990
Mother-in-law? How ridiculous!

547
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,190
Let's talk.

548
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,320
Didn't you hear what I said?

549
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,330
I told you not to talk to me.

550
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,890
What?

551
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:15,650
- Hi, Yoon Hee!
- Did you sleep well?

552
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,760
Why didn't you just wake me up?
You didn't have to wait.

553
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,060
I heard you wanted to talk to me.

554
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,580
- Is it about your wedding?
- Yes.

555
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,130
Why are you sitting down?

556
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:36,060
As the lady of the house, shouldn't I
hear about my son's wedding?

557
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,480
Your son?

558
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,890
Go ahead and tell me. What is it?

559
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:50,210
My parents requested that the person
in front me not attend my wedding.

560
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,890
Who?
Ah.

561
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:57,590
Of course she won't.
Don't worry about that.

562
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:00,850
How could we have her there?
That's so embarrassing.

563
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,900
They are worried
that the wedding would be affected

564
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,020
by presenting a spectacle to the guests.

565
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,030
Why would I be a spectacle to the guests?

566
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,090
Didn't you live as a spectacle
to others all your life?

567
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,210
What?

568
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:22,000
What if you wear a backless dress or
something and spoil the wedding?

569
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,860
Just having her stand next to your father

570
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,710
as the groom's mother is a shame
to the family and a spectacle to others.

571
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,550
Don't worry.

572
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,030
You should just stay quietly
inside the house.

573
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,040
Don't be selfish
and get involved in this.

574
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,490
How could you even think
about showing up on such an occasion?

575
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,910
You drink so much water these days.
Are you anxious?

576
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,390
Shut your mouth.

577
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:24,230
Were you thinking that you
should tattle on her to Sung Hwan?

578
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,640
Please, don't even.

579
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:34,820
Father has unconditional trust and
support for Yoon Hee.

580
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:40,370
You could cause more loss.
You'd better listen to me.

581
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:45,470
What kinds of side dishes
should I make for dinner?

582
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:48,110
You told me to report the menu to you.

583
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,880
I can't stand how Hong Yoon Hee acts.

584
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:10,160
She is an arrogant woman who is
a master at looking down on people.

585
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,890
She is so disrespectful.

586
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:17,280
Why can't you just leave her alone?

587
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,960
What?

588
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,850
Yoon Hee is not disrespectful.

589
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:25,050
She is different from Hyun Sung's wife.

590
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:28,180
How can you hate a person like her?

591
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,720
What are you saying right now?

592
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:35,950
Do you hate her just because
she's going to be Hyun Joon's wife?

593
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,900
What?

594
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,190
Don't badmouth Yoon Hee anymore.

595
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:45,980
I get mad because it seems like
it has to do with Hyun Joon.

596
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,600
It's not what you think!

597
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,290
Don't you think I have an eye
for character?

598
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:56,210
Yoon Hee is too clumsy and too clean.
That is why Hyun Joon got tired of her.

599
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,340
Oh gosh. This is just ridiculous.

600
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,230
But we need a person like her
as the eldest daughter-in-law.

601
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:08,480
After seeing Hyun Sung's wife,
a shrewd one is not good.

602
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,520
She told me not to come to her wedding
because she's embarrassed.

603
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,990
She is intentionally turning my stomach.

604
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,880
Grandmother told her to say that.
Can't you tell?

605
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,100
What?

606
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:27,080
Yoon Hee wouldn't turn someone's stomach
because of her personal feelings.

607
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,500
I have known her for many years.

608
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:34,140
Oh my goodness.

609
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,960
I told you it would cause more loss.

610
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:54,500
Father only trusts his own judgment

611
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,450
when he believes in something,
no matter what other people say.

612
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:05,670
In fact, that's maybe why Stepmother
is in this house right now.

613
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,530
Stepmother?

614
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,540
I thought you wanted me
to call you Mother.

615
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:15,940
But I can't just call you Mother
because it's confusing.

616
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,190
Confusing?

617
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,310
In fact, Hyun Joon calls you
Father's new woman...

618
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,760
when you are not around.

619
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,850
Does he call you that, too?

620
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,410
Please try this, Stepmother.

621
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,390
<i>I thought everything would work
if we registered our marriage.</i>

622
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:02,240
<i>Okay. I'm going to make
my son beat your husbands</i>

623
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,390
<i>and become the successor
to Chairman Park Sung Hwan.</i>

624
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:28,110
Where is her car?

625
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,960
Maybe she didn't come to work today.

626
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:39,040
- She quit.
- Why?

627
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,780
She lost her popularity and no one
really looks for her any more.

628
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,550
Then how does she make a living?

629
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,370
How am I supposed to know that?

630
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:01,630
Jung Hae Dang stopped all her activities.

631
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:04,780
Are you trying to make
her debut as a singer?

632
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,950
No. She doesn't even have a song ready.

633
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:11,030
Then why did she stop
her activities all of a sudden?

634
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:16,510
I don't know the details.
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

635
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,300
You quit your work at the nightclubs
and stopped your activities.

636
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:41,870
What are you trying to do? Are you
trying to get married or something?

637
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,360
Call the journalists
this week and tell them

638
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,850
you found your son, whom you
abandoned years ago.

639
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,020
- What?
- Tell people that Kyung Soo is your son.

640
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,020
You are just ridiculous.

641
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,840
I clearly said this week.

642
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,660
Do you think I will do as you say?

643
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:03,170
If you don't, I can't guarantee
what will happen.

644
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:04,270
What?

645
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,450
If you call the journalists
and confess the truth

646
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,630
and atone for what
you did to Kyung Soo...

647
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,020
then I'll leave him.

648
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,630
It was sold quickly
because you sold it at a low price.

649
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:44,290
Come and sign the contract tomorrow.

650
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,710
Thank you.

651
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,950
Are you selling your cafe?

652
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:59,350
It's none of your business.

653
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:03,100
Don't you have anything better to say
than, "It's none of your business"?

654
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:08,530
Then where are you going to live?

655
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,940
Are you worried
that I will live on the street?

656
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:17,580
Maybe it'd be best
to just leave this town.

657
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,980
I don't like that you live
in the same town as Jung Hae Dang.

658
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,100
<i>[Standard Contract for Pop Artists.]</i>

659
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:39,920
That's it. You don't have to worry
about the contract issue anymore.

660
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,430
Thank you.

661
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:44,940
Please be happy.
Thank you for everything.

662
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,430
Thank you, Mr. Jang.

663
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,990
Did you find a place to stay?

664
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:08,130
I rented a studio.

665
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,270
How did you afford that?

666
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,070
How did you afford that?

667
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:16,180
Kyung Soo had spare money.

668
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,310
I see.

669
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,480
You should go in now.

670
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:30,240
I guess you might not come back here.
So this could be the last time I see you.

671
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,760
Take care.

672
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,970
You can do that, right?

673
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,060
You should hurry up and leave.

674
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,110
I think I got closer to you
than I expected.

675
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:54,720
Maybe because I saw you every day
and we spent a lot of time together.

676
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,190
Do you think so?

677
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,010
Now that I think this
is the last time I will see you

678
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:10,500
I am more thankful, sorry, and sad
than I thought I would be.

679
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:17,020
That's good enough for me.

680
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,530
Please take good care of Hae Dang.

681
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,600
Don't worry.

682
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,840
Please take good care
of my sister-in-law, Brother.

683
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,530
We'll come visit you often
once we settle down.

684
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:19,580
Thank you for everything.

685
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,310
Thank you.

686
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:23,780
Don't worry about your dad.

687
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,240
Forget about everything
going on here and live freely.

688
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,770
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you sorry?

689
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:32,010
And... Dad!

690
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,020
Here.

691
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:45,850
I haven't paid off the loan but here
is six months of living expenses.

692
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:48,920
Why are you giving this to me?
Take it with you.

693
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,700
Are you going to leave with empty hands?

694
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,820
And...

695
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:56,020
Please take this.

696
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,070
It's the security deposit
I got from selling my cafe.

697
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:04,400
You will be empty-handed
if you give us everything you have.

698
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,840
- I have some spare money.
- But how?

699
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,570
My guardian has left me some money
before she passed away.

700
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:12,840
Is that so?

701
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,350
We will have enough
for the two of us to live.

702
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,830
That's good to hear.

703
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:22,170
Even if that's the case,
you shouldn't give this to me.

704
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:25,170
Please take it so that Hae Dang
can leave feeling relieved.

705
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:29,500
Hey!

706
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:36,530
I can't even buy furniture
for you. I can't take this.

707
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:40,290
I will send you money
after selling this house.

708
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:44,090
So take this and go buy furniture.

709
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:49,350
No, Dad. How are you going to make
a living after I leave?

710
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:52,180
You shouldn't worry about us anymore.

711
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,520
Dad!

712
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,420
Um. Don't worry. I'm going to be here.

713
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:02,600
I will take care of my father-in-law and
your sisters. I'll do all that.

714
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,130
So don't turn back, just leave.

715
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:09,300
It would have been nice if we could have
lived nearby even after you got married.

716
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,850
Oh gosh. It's like you guys
are running away.

717
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:14,400
I'm feeling so sad right now.

718
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,790
There is no need to be sad.
Things will turn out well.

719
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:19,170
Then we'll live together again
sometime in the future.

720
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:22,900
Don't feel sad. Those who
have to leave will feel more sad.

721
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:27,520
But I don't know why I am tearing up.

722
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:05,080
I am so happy to have been
born your daughter.

723
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,930
Thank you for making a hard decision.

724
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:21,220
Dad!

725
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,110
My little baby.

726
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:37,450
You had to suffer so much
because of your poor dad.

727
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,850
My poor thing. My daughter Hae Dang.

728
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:48,730
I'm sorry and I love you.

729
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:52,970
Take care, my daughter.

730
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,230
Take care.

731
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:54,170
Oh my.
Hyun Joon!

732
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,860
Oh my goodness.

733
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:09,420
Please come downstairs.

734
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,400
What happened?

735
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:14,560
What happened?

736
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:17,730
Get up! Are you okay?

737
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,240
I've never seen him this drunk.

738
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,380
What is going on here?

739
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:29,180
What is going on?

740
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:34,570
I still have a lot to say.
I still have a lot to say.

741

<i>Jung Hae Dang stopped all her activities.</i>

742
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,920
<i>Are you selling your cafe?</i>

743
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,060
<i>It's none of your business.</i>

744
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,650
Call the journalists
this week and tell them

745
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:12,240
you found your son,
whom you abandoned years ago.

746
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,920
<i>I clearly said this week.</i>

747
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:19,490
<i>If you don't,
I can't guarantee what will happen.</i>

748
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,230
What are you doing?

749
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,530
Where are you going so late?

750
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:04,030
<i>Kyung Soo! Are you in there, Kyung Soo?</i>

751
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:11,240
<i>Kyung Soo! Come out if you are in there.
Kyung Soo! Come out if you are in there.</i>

752
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:22,200
<i>No! Kyung Soo! No!
Kyung Soo! Kyung Soo!</i>
