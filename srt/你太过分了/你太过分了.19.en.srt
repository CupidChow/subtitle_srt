<i>[Episode 19]</i>

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,560
Have you heard the name Lee Kyung Soo?

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,980
What?

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,620
Lee Kyung Soo.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,210
Did you hear it from Yoon Sung Ha?

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,630
Did I hear it from Yoon Sung Ha?

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,420
If not...

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,910
How do you know the name Lee Kyung Soo?

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,270
I know the name because...

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,610
Yoon Sung Ha is Lee Kyung Soo.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,270
What?

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,740
I just learned that his name is not
Yoon Sung Ha, it is Lee Kyung Soo.

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,220
What's wrong?

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,100
Do you know Lee Kyung Soo?

16
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,810
<i>Somehow I thought, "She must have
a family member who is blind."</i>

17
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,360
<i>I used to have a close friend, too.</i>

18
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,750
<i>- Not a girlfriend?</i>
- No.

19
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,290
He was blind.

20
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,540
His name was... Lee Kyung Soo.

21
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,950
<i>One day, he told me that...</i>

22
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,660
singer Yoo Ji Na's voice is just like
his mother's voice.

23
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,780
I have a favor to ask you.

24
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,160
Please don't tell anyone
about the conversation

25
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,550
we had about Lee Kyung Soo.

26
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,060
Why are you so afraid of Lee Kyung Soo?

27
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,790
I'm not afraid of him!

28
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,550
I'll tell you the truth.

29
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,140
He's my friend's son.

30
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,930
Hello! There is no one working right now,
so we can't make you coffee.

31
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,100
<i>You've grown so much without your mom.</i>

32
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,460
<i>You probably didn't even have
anyone who took care of you.</i>

33
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,810
<i>You grew up all on your own.</i>

34
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:07,470
Are you still standing there?
There is no one working here.

35
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,260
- It's me, Yoo Ji Na.
- What brings you here?

36
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,730
I don't want coffee.

37
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,210
Can you just give me a glass of water?

38
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,000
Please have a seat.

39
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,000
What brings you here?

40
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:21,510
I just... wanted to stop by.

41
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,330
Bye now.

42
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,940
If you came to tell me something,
then please do.

43
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:39,230
Is it true that Lee Kyung Soo
had surgery and recovered his sight?

44
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,720
Of course.
Why would I lie about that?

45
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,510
<i>You probably can see me with those
eyes and know that I'm your mom.</i>

46
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,820
<i>But why don't you say
that I'm your mother?</i>

47
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,690
Is everything okay?

48
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,470
Yes. Thank you for the water.

49
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:03,350
<i>You and I can't live
as mother and son in this life.</i>

50
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,420
<i>I can't expose you
to the public as my son.</i>

51
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,120
<i>So what's the point
of calling you my son?</i>

52
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,330
<i>I can't let it collapse like this.
I came a long way to get here.</i>

53
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,760
<i>I can't let it collapse like this.</i>

54
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,700
Oh goodness. I don't need clothes.

55
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,230
I don't even have places
to go with new clothes.

56
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,390
This is a good opportunity
to get new clothes.

57
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,200
But I feel like I'm indebted to you.

58
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,200
- I thought you consider me you son.
- Of course I do.

59
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,250
It's my duty as a son to get you
something for Parents' Day tomorrow.

60
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,550
I guess even a beggar
"can entertain a guest."

61
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,740
Did you say, "Even a beggar
has something to lose."

62
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:25,130
No, I mean that a beggar could have
a "guest," not just "something."

63
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,330
What I mean is that
I will wear them if I buy them.

64
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,270
That's what I'm saying. Let's go in.

65
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,250
- Should we go in?
- Let's go.

66
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,890
Please try those on.

67
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,330
Sir. I'll take your measurements.

68
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,670
Let me see.

69
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,800
What does this say?

70
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,390
You don't have to worry.

71
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,740
Why would I buy such expensive clothes? I
don't even have an occasion to wear them.

72
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,210
Just get one.

73
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,780
So these must be designer labels, huh?

74
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,460
You don't have to worry about that.
You should try those on.

75
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,280
A person like me
doesn't need luxurious clothes.

76
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,270
You know that's being rude
to luxurious clothes.

77
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,980
Oh goodness. Let's leave.

78
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,820
I'm sorry. Take care.

79
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,950
- Father.
- Thank you.

80
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,880
Oh geez. I was so shocked
by the price of the suit.

81
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,800
You should just get one.

82
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,350
A person like me
doesn't wear luxurious clothes.

83
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,600
Even the luxurious clothes
wouldn't like that. Let's go.

84
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,980
Okay. Then can I buy you
clothes that you can wear daily?

85
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,690
Oh gosh. They have
a lot of good stuff here.

86
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,390
I like these clothes.

87
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,490
Are these things he can wear comfortably?

88
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,010
- Yes. You should try this on.
- Okay.

89
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,650
Isn't that... for young people?

90
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:11,090
No. I like colors like this.

91
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,090
You do?

92
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,780
Yes. As I get older,
I like brighter colors.

93
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:22,790
Can you find me clothes
that are popular with the young people?

94
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,230
This is too much. Thank you.
I'll wear them well.

95
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,450
I'm glad you like them.

96
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,050
- I do.
- Let's go.

97
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,570
<i>The reason why he came into this house
using a different name must be</i>

98
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:58,390
<i>to look for a clue about Mother's death.</i>

99
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,700
<i>I must watch his every move from now on.</i>

100
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,830
<i>If I can get the clue,
then I win the game.</i>

101
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,420
Since you're here anyway,
please have lunch.

102
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,950
Is that hamburgers?

103
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,450
I can tell he's young.
When I asked him what he wanted to eat

104
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,960
he said he wanted to eat this.

105
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,130
- Who said that?
- Sung Ha.

106
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,740
I mean Lee Kyung Soo.

107
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,770
Are you feeding him now?

108
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,090
It's not a hard thing to do.

109
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,670
I wonder why he's not coming down.

110
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,710
You're here.

111
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,280
What is that smell?

112
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,850
It's hamburgers.
They're for my piano teacher.

113
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,590
Ah. Please say hi to my
grandmother-in-law.

114
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,980
I'm Yoon Sung Ha.

115
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,610
Ah. You're the guy
who played the piano at the party.

116
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,780
He's very handsome.

117
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,610
Thank you.

118
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,090
I'll make mushroom stew for you,
Grandmother.

119
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,590
No. I'll eat a burger with him. I feel
like eating one now that I've smelled it.

120
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,830
How is it? Is it good?

121
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,450
I like hamburgers.

122
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,170
I remember how my mom used to make them
for me when I was little.

123
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,710
I think she couldn't afford
to buy a lot of meat.

124
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,240
So she had to put in
a lot of bread crumbs.

125
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,960
Which one tastes better? This or the one
your mom made for you?

126
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,180
Of course what his mom made for him
when he was little tastes better.

127
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,820
That's just the way it is.

128
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,190
I'll pack some side dishes for you.
Please take them with you.

129
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,990
- I'm fine.
- Please take them.

130
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,220
We have so much food here.

131
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,160
I think I'll just eat the mushroom stew.

132
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,660
Sure.

133
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,230
Please enjoy your meal.

134
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,230
Do you want to talk to me alone?

135
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,710
Are you perhaps watching me right now?

136
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,810
Don't mind me. Please eat.

137
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,870
When I looked at him closely,
he's very handsome.

138
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,960
Maybe that's why I feel
so sorry for him that he's blind.

139
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,530
- I know.
- Take good care of him.

140
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,120
And give him plenty of money
for the lesson.

141
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,540
I already do.

142
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,800
I think my grandmother likes you, too.

143
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,540
Thank you for the food.

144
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,070
Get home safely.

145
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,870
Why do you treat him so well?

146
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,920
Grandmother told me to.

147
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,950
It seemed like you were
quite eager to treat him well

148
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,970
even before Mrs. Sung asked you to.

149
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,230
Why? Do you feel uncomfortable?

150
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,060
You don't put effort into something
you don't need to.

151
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,950
I am a human, too.

152
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,340
I also have a heart for those in need.

153
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,930
So are you going to introduce him
to everyone in your family?

154
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,670
You used to like him so much.

155
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,580
Why are you trying to keep your distance
from him all of a sudden?

156
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,230
What do you mean? I'm not trying
to keep my distance from him.

157
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,270
You always put words into my mouth.

158
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,530
<i>There is certainly something going on
between him and that woman.</i>

159
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,640
Bong Soo! Are you home?

160
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,770
- Father-in-law.
- What are all those?

161
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,490
Come here.

162
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,510
Here.

163
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,600
All right. Here.

164
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,230
And this one.

165
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,450
This one, too.

166
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,890
They are for you.

167
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,400
Where did you get all these?

168
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,230
- CEO Park bought them for me.
- All these?

169
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,960
I think he has a connection with that
store. They gave him a huge discount.

170
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,840
Wow. I like the color, too.

171
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,660
I picked the young colors on purpose
to give them to you.

172
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,640
Why didn't you pick
something for yourself?

173
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,560
I heard that you got mistreated because
you always wore old men's clothes.

174
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,280
- Oh gosh. Father.
- This is great. This will last long.

175
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,840
I think I can even wear this one.

176
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,800
Oh gosh. It's men's.

177
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,810
The color is so pretty though.

178
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,920
But CEO Park bought this for you.

179
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,940
We can wear them together then.

180
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,170
I look good in these young colors
because of my handsome face.

181
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,310
Not because of your face...

182
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,630
but because you have a pale face,
the bright colors look good on you.

183
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,580
But what's the occasion
for buying you these clothes?

184
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,140
Tomorrow is Parents' Day.

185
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,340
What? How can I wear these then?

186
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,600
Why? Is there a law
that says a parent can't buy

187
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,850
their children anything on Parents' Day?

188
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,740
No. But it's a day on which
I'm supposed to buy you a gift.

189
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,300
A good son-in-law like you
is a good gift for me.

190
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,870
You're the only one
who could put up with her temper.

191
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,160
- Who else would live with her?
- She's been good these days.

192
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,040
Who knows how long that will last?

193
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,500
Dad!

194
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,890
I should give something to my mom, too.

195
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,430
She'll give me a hard time
if I don't give her anything.

196
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:50,220
What gift? No need.
I don't need anything at all.

197
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,900
Oh gosh. She always talks like that.

198
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,000
But then why do you emphasize
"anything at all?"

199
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,600
Just for your information,
I don't need anything at all.

200
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,790
But if you really want to give me
something, then I'd like cash

201
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,550
or a gift certificate.

202
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,420
Oh goodness.

203
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,480
Also, I don't want flowers.

204
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,550
It's so hard to throw them away
and they're so useless.

205
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,480
- Grandma!
- Yes.

206
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,270
He made it in kindergarten.

207
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:28,370
Oh gosh. I'm so proud of you.
Did my little boy really make this?

208
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:36,250
Thank you. My little baby grew up and
can make these things now.

209
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,520
Thank you. Hoon! I love you.

210
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,060
I love you too, Grandma!

211
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,400
So adorable.

212
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,700
Hello! Is there anything
for your grandpa?

213
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,550
Here you go.

214
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,760
Aw. My grandson is the best.
You're the best!

215
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Yeah.

216
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,330
I have a favor to ask you.

217
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,420
Is it about the wedding again?

218
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,090
It's about Go Na Kyung.

219
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,310
She's taking piano lessons.

220
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,760
And?

221
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,100
She takes lessons from the guy
who used to teach me

222
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,830
although I had to fire him.

223
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:29,140
But she insists on taking lessons
from him to make me angry.

224
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,290
Okay. Don't worry.

225
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,510
Father! Do you need something?
Are you hungry?

226
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,860
Let me talk to you for a moment.

227
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,750
Can we talk after dinner if it's not
urgent? Grandmother will be hungry.

228
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,670
I heard that you're taking piano lessons.

229
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,090
Yes. It's just for fun.

230
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,960
- Get a new teacher.
- Why?

231
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,080
"Why?"

232
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,590
Do you really want to get in trouble?

233
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,880
Father...

234
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,530
You are the one who told Hyun Joon
about the will. Aren't you?

235
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,960
No. I'm not.
Why would I do such a thing?

236
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,460
Are you smart or dumb?

237
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,490
Pardon?

238
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,260
If you told that to anyone,
don't you think

239
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,030
I would know that it was you who said it?

240
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,930
That day, you brought me some snacks.
So I hung up the phone.

241
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,520
Do I look like someone who would forget
what happened that day?

242
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,520
You knew... that I heard?

243
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,920
Would you not know if you were me?

244
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,240
I'm sorry, Father.
I really didn't hear anything.

245
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,480
I only heard... the words, "the will."
That's all I heard.

246
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,980
You didn't even hear the whole story
and you told that to other people?

247
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,800
And to make it even worse,
you told Hyun Joon?

248
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,750
I'm so sorry, Father. I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

249
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,400
You use your brain and try so hard
to make trouble in our family.

250
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,950
You didn't take it seriously when I said
that I would be watching you.

251
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,620
I'll never do such a thing again.

252
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,930
If you're counting on Grandmother,
don't be stupid.

253
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,850
- Tell Hyun Sung to come down.
- I'll never it again.

254
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,890
Tell Hyun Sung to come down!

255
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:55,270
Honey! Please help me.
Please help me.

256
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,640
What happened?

257
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,360
Honey! What should I do?

258
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,250
What are you talking about?

259
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,170
Hyun Sung! Divorce her.

260
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,280
Father! I'm sorry.

261
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,850
Why don't you answer me?
Are you looking down on me too?

262
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,320
This is just too abrupt.

263
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,560
Do you want to get kicked out
of this house, too?

264
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,240
Get out of this house right now.

265
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,670
Get out of this house right now!

266
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,980
What's the matter now?
You didn't even knock.

267
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,230
Grandmother! Farther-in-law
is trying to kick me out of the house.

268
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,770
- Why?
- Please stop him, Grandmother.

269
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,470
He told me to get out
of the house right now.

270
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,590
What?

271
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,650
Please forgive her this time.
Please give her one more chance.

272
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,680
I gave her enough chances.
I can't see her anymore.

273
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,420
What's going on?

274
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,050
Please stay out of this.

275
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,970
Because you couldn't take it out me,
are you taking it out on her instead?

276
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,400
It's not like that.

277
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,940
Then what kind of nonsense is this?

278
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,350
What kind of a father-in-law
kicks a daughter-in-law

279
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,960
out of the house for no reason?

280
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,750
What will people say when they hear this?

281
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,810
I should be one who decides
whether to kick her out or not.

282
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,530
Hyun Sung, starting tomorrow,
don't come to work.

283
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,070
What is really going on?

284
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,580
I'm really going to get kicked out
if I tell you the reason.

285
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,290
Why do you have so many complications?

286
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,760
I have complications
because I'm trying to survive.

287
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,370
If I didn't have to do anything

288
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,150
then why would I try to use my brain?
I'm not even that smart.

289
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,380
Grandmother, what should I do now?

290
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,840
What do you mean?
You have to get out if he kicks you out.

291
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,250
I don't think he's going
to let it go this time.

292
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,810
<i>I can't really do anything without her.</i>

293
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:17,870
Do you really want me
to get divorced right now?

294
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,150
She't not helpful to you or the family.

295
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,790
- I can't do that.
- What?

296
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,100
I will not go to work.

297
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,340
What?

298
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:35,580
If I work my fingers to the bone, are you
going to hand the company over to me?

299
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,080
What?

300
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:43,310
I know that both you and Grandmother
will choose Hyun Joon eventually.

301
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,750
I know that. But how can Hyun Joon
suddenly lead the company overnight?

302
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:57,120
At least I should know how the company
operates so that I can support him.

303
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,040
That's why I'm putting up with it.

304
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,060
And you're telling me to quit

305
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,070
because I didn't control my wife?

306
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,590
I'm disappointed, but I'll quit.

307
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,500
I'm no longer a dog who does

308
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,900
everything you tell me to do
because I'm scared of you.

309
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,030
I worried a lot about my family in my own
way after Mother passed away.

310
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:29,410
These days, Grandmother,
you, and Hyun Joon

311
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,940
all of you are just busy
worrying about something else.

312
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,680
So no one seems to worry
about the family.

313
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,650
<i>When did he grow up?</i>

314
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,250
Starting tomorrow,
don't come eat at the table.

315
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,930
Stay in your room and don't do anything.

316
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,160
Yes.

317
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,770
Please cook for the family instead.

318
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,040
If you're planning to become
the lady of the house

319
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,850
then you should
at least cook meals for the family.

320
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,960
- I don't know how to do anything.
- You should learn then.

321
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,150
I'll teach you, step by step.

322
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,360
Did you think the lady of a large family

323
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,660
just sits down, powders her face,
and puts on red lipstick?

324
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:35,240
If there are things you want to enjoy,
then there are things you have to do.

325
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,910
What are you staring at?

326
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,720
Starting tomorrow,
don't come anywhere near the kitchen.

327
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,090
Yes, Grandmother.

328
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,970
Call the maid and tell her
to take some time off.

329
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,920
You should do everything by yourself
if you really want to learn.

330
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,130
Mother! But that's--

331
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,850
Did you think housework was easy?

332
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,660
It's harder than getting graduate degrees

333
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,470
if you really want to learn well.

334
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,140
I can't even cook food for myself.

335
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,590
Cook breakfast tomorrow
and we'll see how bad it is.

336
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,380
I need to see where you are first.

337
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,400
What are you giggling at?

338
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,630
This is my grandmother. You're like
"Iron Lady." No one can beat you.

339
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:25,680
If she had studied more, then she
could've been Lady Thatcher of Korea.

340
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:39,790
What is wrong with that old lady?
This is ridiculous.

341
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,540
Is she telling me to cook
a meal for this family?

342
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,220
Hyun Joon's late mother was
a daughter of an owner of a company.

343
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,060
But she could never get
out of the kitchen

344
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,170
because of my mother
until Hyun Sung's wife came.

345
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,350
So are you saying
that I should do as I'm told

346
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,770
since I'm not even a daughter
of an owner of a company?

347
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,690
Can you at least pretend to do it for me?

348
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,860
I won't do it even if I know how to.

349
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,920
Then as Mother said,
do you just want to be treated

350
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,990
as the lady of the house while sitting
down with your makeup on?

351
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,470
What if I say no?

352
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,820
"What if I say no?"

353
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,210
Let's eat.

354
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,650
- Wow!
- It's Parents' Day morning.

355
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,980
What are you looking for?

356
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,470
No. Nothing.
I wasn't looking for anything.

357
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:51,190
You said you didn't need anything at all.
So we really didn't buy anything at all.

358
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:56,290
That's good. I'm fine
with this gift from my grandson.

359
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,810
I didn't prepare a cash gift separately

360
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,330
since Bong Seon
will give you 500,000 won.

361
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:06,050
Good. But I haven't received
the 500,000 won yet.

362
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,310
Sure. That's good enough for me.

363
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:16,040
I'm not fortunate enough
to receive a gift for every holiday.

364
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,380
- Are you mad?
- Why would I be mad?

365
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,500
Oh geez. You are mad!

366
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,290
Why are you making me look bad
in front of my daughter-in-law?

367
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,280
I also think that you're mad.

368
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,480
- I'm not mad.
- She's mad.

369
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,940
This girl is trying to humiliate me

370
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,410
instead of giving me a gift on
Parents' Day morning.

371
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,280
Wow! She's officially mad now.

372
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,950
I said I'm not!

373
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,400
What's wrong? What's wrong?

374
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,460
- You should go to this place.
- What's that?

375
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,280
It's a ticket to Tae Jin Ah's
dinner show. Your favorite.

376
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,050
Oh my gosh. Really?

377
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,010
If it's a dinner show,
do they serve a meal, too?

378
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,110
Of course. Do you know
how much the ticket cost?

379
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,530
But it wouldn't be fun to go by myself.

380
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,560
There are two tickets.
You can go with Father-in-law.

381
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,880
Sure. We don't have to keep our distance
from each other. We can go together.

382
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,970
Mother. This one, too.

383
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,690
What is this?

384
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:26,750
It's cash, which my mother-in-law likes.
You can use it to enjoy the show.

385
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,620
Oh, thank you.

386
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,180
And this is the finish.

387
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,850
What is this?

388
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:39,260
It's a gift certificate, which my mom
likes. Buy something you like.

389
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:44,130
Oh, thank you. Everything I like is here.

390
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:49,060
My children understand
the meaning of what I say so well.

391
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,030
You're so picky that you don't like
anything we buy anyway.

392
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,980
You're right.

393
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,810
But isn't it too desolate
without any flowers?

394
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,610
What do you mean there are no flowers?
Here's one.

395
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:07,880
My grandson, who is prettier
than a flower, made it for me.

396
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,040
Oh geez. Mom, do you
like money that much?

397
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,490
- What do you like?
- Me?

398
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:20,020
I... like my mom.
Mom! Thank you!

399
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,050
- I love you!
- Gross! Get away from me!

400
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,610
You got all those things from us and
you're saying I'm gross.

401
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,200
How can you say I'm gross?

402
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,940
Oh my goodness.

403
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,820
Let's eat.

404
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,940
Did she make anything?

405
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,630
If you want more, then you can put rice
into the soup and eat it.

406
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,070
Did you think I was joking when I said I
don't know how to cook anything?

407
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,700
Please go ahead and eat,
so that we can eat.

408
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,790
The ramen noodles will get soggy.

409
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,840
Do you think she could do
something like this

410
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,140
if she respected you even a little?

411
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,970
Why do you like this girl so much?

412
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:26,130
Do you think this girl
can have a married life?

413
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:32,300
They say that you can tell a man's worth
when you see his wife.

414
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,640
Aren't you embarrassed?

415
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,160
Please excuse me.

416
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,030
I'd like to meet your late parents.

417
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,650
I wonder what they were thinking when
they raised you.

418
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,880
Please don't talk about my parents.

419
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,430
I'm going to talk about them
once in a while to remind you.

420
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,500
I'm sure your parents gave birth to you

421
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,680
and worried so much
about you while raising you.

422
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,960
I said stop!

423
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,070
Go get your father!
Tell him to look at this face

424
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,190
at this woman who's yelling at someone
who will be her mother-in-law.

425
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,210
Father. Grandmother is looking for you.

426
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,740
Oh geez.

427
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,370
Father! Thank you!

428
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,820
Thank you, my daughters.

429
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,320
Next is...

430
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,900
What are you doing?

431
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,430
We're also going to give you
a flower starting this year.

432
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,010
Hey! I'm not even married yet.

433
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,300
You're like our mom.

434
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,780
Hae Dang!

435
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,480
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

436
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:18,350
Okay. That's a good idea.

437
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,220
We should make what Dad likes. Right?

438
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,450
What if he gets mad
that we spent too much money?

439
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,200
I just have to get two more
70th birthday parties.

440
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,130
What if you turn into a singer
for 70th birthday parties?

441
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:41,850
Maybe I should make that my specialty.

442
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,280
You are only picking
what you want to eat.

443
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,630
Dad doesn't eat oranges
because they're too sour.

444
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,850
Let us eat oranges, too.

445
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:55,450
Why are you picking fruit first?

446
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:59,170
Should we buy sea bream?
He likes sea bream.

447
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:04,900
He likes luxurious food. But grilled sea
bream is hard to pack in a lunch box.

448
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,570
When Dad had to pack lunch for us
because Mom was at work

449
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:13,340
he put half a mackerel in our lunch
boxes. Do you remember that?

450
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,100
I was so embarrassed because of that.

451
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,880
When he got busy,
he put the entire pickled radish

452
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,670
this big, with rice in the lunch box.

453
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,280
- I know.
- Oh gosh.

454
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,840
It's funny now that I think about it.

455
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,670
The past is always fun.

456
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,120
Is that so?
You must have had a long life.

457
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,590
Let's hurry and get the groceries.

458
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,440
We always spend time chatting
when the four of us are together.

459
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,330
Do you want to buy that fruit?

460
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,640
This looks delicious.

461
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,510
Should I pack for six people if everyone
at his work needs to eat?

462
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,400
- Yes.
- When they hear that the daughters

463
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,700
who are pretty, are also good at cooking,
they'll try to introduce us to men.

464
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,000
You quit school because you wanted
to become a writer.

465
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,840
Now you want to get married?

466
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,150
They won't arrange a match when they hear
that you're trying to become a writer.

467
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,890
Would you like a daughter-in-law
who doesn't have an income

468
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,390
and doesn't do any housework either?

469
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,630
Why do you think a writer
doesn't have an income?

470
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,460
You'll be 50 by the time
you have an income.

471
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,290
You should get married when you turn 50.

472
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:19,440
I know. I should've started gotten
married first and then started writing.

473
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,120
You won't care
about ruining the guy's life?

474
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,420
- Are you cursing me?
- Okay. Okay.

475
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,260
Hurry up! We're late.
You guys talk too much.

476
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,840
Women need to say
a certain number of words in a day.

477
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,320
That way, they feel emotionally stable.
So we chat for world peace.

478
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,590
She's right. We need to chat.

479
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,940
Hurry! We won't get it done on time.

480
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,350
Mm. I'll pack it now.

481
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,570
Thank you!

482
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,140
Take care!

483
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,560
Dad!

484
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,400
What's going on?
All my daughters are here.

485
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,820
We packed lunch for you
and your coworkers.

486
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,700
Really? You made time for this, too?

487
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,230
It's good for all your daughters to come
and say hi. I'll be going to work after.

488
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,930
All right! Thank you for coming.

489
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,840
Come in! Come in!

490
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,850
Hi!

491
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:23,350
My daughters packed lunch
for Parents' Day.

492
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:28,010
Oh, wow! All your daughters
are very pretty.

493
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:33,630
Right. She's the first, the second,
the third, and then the fourth.

494
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,040
Everyone say hi together!

495
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,840
- Hi!
- Hi!

496
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:44,630
Sons just give cash for Parents' Day.

497
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,020
But daughters are nice.
Daughters are the best!

498
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:54,020
Of course! My daughters love me a lot.
Isn't that right, my daughters?

499
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,630
Yes!

500
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:00,060
I told you.
Everyone, sit down and eat.

501
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,060
Sit down.

502
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,790
Let's see the cooking skills
of the pretty daughters.

503
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,930
- Enjoy!
- My goodness.

504
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,720
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

505
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,790
Enjoy.

506
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,250
Let's eat.

507
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,240
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

508
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:45,810
I have urgent business so I don't
think I can take lessons anymore.

509
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,890
Okay.

510
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:53,370
Is it... because Ms. Yoo Ji Na
in the other house

511
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:58,850
did not feel comfortable with me
coming to this house?

512
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:03,630
I'm not in a position to continue
the lessons anyway.

513
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,810
Okay.

514
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,650
Thank you for everything.

515
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,820
Is she in the other house right now?

516
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,250
She is.

517
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:33,700
Then... can I at least go say goodbye
to her before I leave?

518
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,620
I'll never be able to see her again.

519
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,480
Go ahead.

520
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,300
<i>How will I find the clue without him?</i>

521
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:03,370
<i>I was so close.
I was really close.</i>

522
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,360
What brings you here?

523
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,730
I came to say goodbye.

524
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,280
The lady of the house
is not taking lessons anymore.

525
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,460
Is that so?

526
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:32,660
I feel like I will never see you again.
So I came to say goodbye before I leave.

527
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,460
I see.

528
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:44,000
I would like to apologize...

529
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,170
if I made you feel uncomfortable.

530
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:53,740
I hope that you stay healthy.

531
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:23,790
I bought one of these in remembrance of
my mother. And I bought one more.

532
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,500
Do you want to take one?

533
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:39,850
Sure. It looks pretty.

534
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,930
Thank you. Bye.

535
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,310
Wait.

536
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:04,340
I hope... that you
stay healthy, too. Sung Ha.

537
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,380
Thank you.

538
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,710
What is that?

539
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:21,470
Can't you see?
It's a carnation for Parents' Day.

540
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,010
Do you have a secret child somewhere?

541
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,240
- Yes.
- Really?

542
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,350
My younger sisters gave it to me.

543
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:33,240
But you are still a single woman.
People will think that you are married.

544
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,590
- Who cares?
- Why don't you care?

545
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:40,490
I'm offended that my soon-to-be woman is
being seen as a married woman by others.

546
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:44,160
Are you going to keep
making those unfunny jokes?

547
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,370
Who knows? You might get
brain washed if I keep saying it.

548
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:52,200
Oh, yeah! The person I'm seeing
wants to meet you.

549
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:56,780
- Me? Really?
- You said you wanted to meet him.

550
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,800
Did you tell him about me?

551
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:05,880
But... what would we talk about?

552
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,710
- Are you scared?
- Why would I be?

553
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,500
Because you could be embarrassed.

554
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,060
Why would I be embarrassed?

555
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,990
He could put you to shame by saying

556
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,930
that you joke around
with another man's girlfriend.

557
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,600
Did you really tell him everything?

558
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:26,170
Do you think I'm like you just because
you tattle on people? I was joking.

559
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,050
- Oh goodness.
- Were you really scared?

560
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:32,270
Your face turned pale.

561
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,100
Oh gosh.

562
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:38,750
Oh geez. So why do you
always joke around?

563
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,710
Sure. I'll meet him.

564
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:46,910
I'm going to meet him and ask, "Who do
you think can make Hae Dang happier?"

565
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:48,690
And then I'm going
to confront him by saying

566
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,830
"You should give up
if you're not confident."

567
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:53,820
What is there to be afraid of?
I have your father.

568
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,870
Why don't you take off
the carnation on your shirt?

569
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:05,120
Did you come all the way here like that?

570
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:13,880
You should eat a lot now since
you won't be able to eat dinner.

571
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,650
You can be hard on your daughter-in-law
when you are in your 60s.

572
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,500
It's so hard to do when you're over 80.

573
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,340
I feel like I'm going to die first.

574
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:29,970
I'm sure she has never been scolded
before because she's a celebrity.

575
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:33,320
That's why she's so inconsistent
and has to win everyone over.

576
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,920
I can't believe people call her
a diva or something.

577
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,820
Oh gosh. She's so scary.

578
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:52,760
Oh my gosh.

579
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,720
The way knots are tied is so pretty.

580
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,240
A famous master artisan of knots
made those.

581
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,880
You are the only one who brought me
a gift for Parents' Day.

582
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,800
Is Hyun Joon doing well?

583
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,510
Do you not talk to him at all?

584
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:20,840
Who gets married
without experiencing a break-up?

585
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:26,070
You are the only granddaughter-in-law
for my eldest grandson.

586
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,970
Oh, no! I can't ask you
to have dinner with us.

587
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,200
I heard what happened from Grandmother.

588
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,640
I see.

589
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,240
Do you still come visit this house?

590
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:59,130
I came to say hi to your grandmother
for Parents' Day.

591
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,530
You should leave if you saw her.
Why did you come up here?

592
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:04,460
How are things going with the woman?

593
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,020
- It has nothing to do with you.
- Why not?

594
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,470
Your father and grandmother
still consider me

595
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,920
their eldest daughter-in-law.

596
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,890
Do you want to become
the eldest daughter-in-law

597
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:17,650
of this family that much? So much that
you could shelve your pride?

598
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,090
If not, then why
are you still lingering around?

599
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,890
I told you how I feel.

600
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:25,320
If the woman you like
gets official approval

601
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,660
from your father and grandmother,
then I'll give up completely.

602
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,660
What?

603
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,560
Why can't you introduce her
to your family?

604
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,780
It's none of your business.

605
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:51,010
You should eat, Mother. You like sushi.

606
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:54,930
You all enjoy. You should make yourself
available tomorrow afternoon.

607
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,890
Let's begin with side dishes.

608
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:00,190
I have something to tell you.

609
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:04,820
You are going to give us the main room
when we get married, right?

610
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:05,850
What?

611
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:11,290
I think that room is a little
uncomfortable for a couple to use.

612
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:15,190
What are you talking about?
What about Mother?

613
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,550
Why don't you go live in the other house?

614
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:22,320
Eat the sushi and stop talking crazy.

615
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:27,340
Then... can I take that as a yes
and start preparing furniture?

616
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,690
Why are you staring at me?

617
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:34,380
Are you thinking about knocking over
the miso soup this time?

618
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,840
Sung Hwan, you saw that, right?

619
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,930
This is her level.
She's trying to pick a fight.

620
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:46,910
What do you think about this? Do you
think I should respond to everything?

621
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:51,240
Answer me! What should I do?

622
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:58,920
You didn't even talk to me beforehand.
It was so thoughtless.

623
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,870
I did that because I got sick of her
being so unreasonable.

624
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,050
What else can I do to an old lady
who is being unreasonable?

625
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:10,730
No one can win against my mother
in being unreasonable.

626
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:14,910
So are you saying that I should stop
arguing with her and just give up?

627
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:19,450
Can you just pretend to give up for me?

628
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:23,330
Would you like to me to kill myself like
Hyun Joon's mother did?

629
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,130
She can make three or four
daughters-in-law kill themselves.

630
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:34,450
I'm sorry but please
don't bring up my late wife.

631
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:38,830
What do you mean by that?

632
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:43,640
She had maximum patience
and tolerated everything until she died.

633
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:51,480
I realize what kind of person
she was by comparing her to you.

634
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,620
What?

635
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,060
I wonder if they are having fun.

636
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,260
- What if they got into a fight again?
- No.

637
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,250
There is nothing to fight about.

638
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,860
Father-in-law could just eat without
watching the show.

639
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,430
Then Mother could scold him,
saying that she's embarrassed.

640
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:13,740
It's possible someone could bring up
when they were in elementary school.

641
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,550
They start fighting whenever and wherever

642
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,030
regardless of what they were doing,
when they talk about that.

643
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,080
Right.

644
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,900
It's about time for them to come home.

645
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,300
- There.
- Ah! You're here!

646
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,470
Did you enjoy the show?

647
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:32,400
Don't talk to me. I'm still moved.

648
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,500
I shook hands with Tae Jin Ah.

649
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,960
- Wow!
- Really?

650
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,710
He looks so much more delicate in person.

651
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:46,510
Delicate? What kind of man
can smile with his eyes?

652
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:50,330
What is wrong with you? Do you think
just anyone can smile with their eyes?

653
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,670
That's his charm.

654
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,810
So how did you shake his hand?

655
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:55,780
How do you think she did?

656
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,700
She did because she was bold enough
to hold out her hand like this.

657
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,820
- At the dinner show?
- No.

658
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,000
- We saw him in the parking lot.
- No.

659
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,150
He was in his car and she ran after him
and asked him to shake hands.

660
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,750
Oh gosh. Tae Jin Ah
was probably frightened.

661
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,750
What do you mean he was frightened?

662
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,890
When he showed up
in the parking lot, she was like

663
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:18,380
"Oh my gosh! It's Tae Jin Ah!
Jin Ah! Jin Ah!"

664
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,100
Everyone was looking at her.
I was so embarrassed.

665
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,470
What was there to be embarrassed about?
That's called "a fan's heart."

666
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,510
If I had missed that opportunity,
when would I ever

667
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,550
shake hands with a celebrity like him?

668
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,480
"A fan's heart" sounds ridiculous.

669
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:36,360
Oh my gosh. He has such
an appealing singing voice.

670
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:46,590
<i>What else would I dedicate
other than my tears?</i>

671
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:55,300
When he was singing that part, all
the women who were there were crying.

672
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,080
I'm sure they were thinking about their
mothers who had passed away.

673
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:03,040
Right. I was a bit tearful
at that part, too.

674
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,460
What kind of person would have never
worried about their mother?

675
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:12,540
Even my mom passed away after only
seeing her daughter suffering.

676
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,000
Oh gosh.

677
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,780
<i>What else...</i>

678
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,130
She seems to have enjoyed it though.

679
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:28,920
Yeah. She had fun.
She likes that kind of thing.

680
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,320
That's good to hear.

681
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,930
Thank you for taking her.

682
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,630
No. I had fun, too.

683
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:38,000
I finally see why people
enjoy those shows.

684
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:47,880
<i>What else would I dedicate
other than my tears?</i>

685
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:54,350
What is that, "Ah. Ah. Ah?"

686
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,100
Vibration.

687
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,360
Vibration.

688
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:04,120
Oh my goodness.
It sounds like they had fun.

689
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:10,660
<i>Let's eat the rest of the pizza then.</i>

690
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,060
<i>Let's do that.</i>

691
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,690
This one is mine.

692
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:21,580
Hae Dang!

693
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:27,150
How would you feel if prince charming

694
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,560
who is a multi-millionaire,
appeared before you?

695
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,900
How would I feel?

696
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,070
Would you be happy since you suffered
from money troubles all your life?

697
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:41,380
Of course I would be.
Why would I not be happy?

698
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,730
I'm not kidding.

699
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,840
I'd follow him right away.

700
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:47,300
You would leave everything else behind?

701
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,530
Do I even have anything to leave behind?

702
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:53,190
I should say, "Thank you!"
and go with him right away.

703
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:58,640
"Do I even have anything to leave
behind?" Then what about me?

704
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,700
I've never even seen a multi-millionaire
driving a car on the street.

705
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,430
You can be honest.
This is only "what if."

706
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,480
What do you mean "be honest?"

707
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,660
- So you'd follow him?
- Follow him where?

708
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:16,830
I wouldn't leave you,
even for a billionaire.

709
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:21,090
I thought we both would do the same.

710
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,940
Oh. Really?

711
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,990
Oh my goodness. Why do you mention
a multi-millionaire so suddenly?

712
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,800
Then let me ask you the other way around.

713
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:36,520
What would you do if a multi-millionaire
lady told me she liked me?

714
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,900
Of course I would let you go.

715
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,610
That doesn't make sense. You wouldn't go
anywhere but you would let me go?

716
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:45,210
Of course you should go.

717
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:48,740
You've had such a hard and sad life.

718
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,100
If you had an opportunity like that,
then you should go after it.

719
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,120
Then what would happen to you?

720
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:59,690
I would happily let you go
and hope that you'd be happy.

721
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:07,500
<i>Then I should happily let you go
and hope that you'll be happy, too.</i>

722
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:10,840
What are you thinking about?

723
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:16,120
<i>But I can't live
without you anymore, Hae Dang.</i>

724
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:21,430
Did you get to meet
a super rich woman somehow?

725
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,490
I'm stuck here every day. Where would I
go to find that kind of lady?

726
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:29,550
Then why did you ask me
all those questions?

727
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:35,860
I heard that some people are born
to miss someone all their life.

728
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:39,150
That's nonsense.

729
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:44,190
Unless I have to leave you first

730
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:48,280
because I have a disease or something,
I'd never do that. So don't worry.

731
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,070
Oh! Really?

732
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:52,380
Of course.

733
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,730
The director of the Planning Office
did not come in today.

734
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,440
So all the projects stopped.

735
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:09,570
Okay. You can leave.

736
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:12,920
What happened to him?
He didn't even transition anything.

737
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:15,850
I said you can leave.

738
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:19,670
The associates in the Planning Office
are not motivated to work, either.

739
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,690
What is that you wanted to tell me?

740
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:44,200
Let's go live abroad.

741
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,410
Abroad?

742
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:50,080
Let's go abroad, get married,
and live there.

743
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,750
What about the company?

744
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:59,040
Mother is going to work
with Hyun Joon and Hyun Sung.

745
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,350
Are you crazy?

746
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:09,000
I don't want to go live abroad with you
and give up singing.

747
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,900
Besides, I told you that you should
remain in your present office.

748
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,670
Let me ask you this again.

749
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:21,330
Do you not have a reason to marry
anymore if I step down from my office?

750
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:24,180
Why do you make me repeat myself?

751
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:29,190
What exactly did you mean when you said,
"You will only look at me?"<i></i>

752
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:32,560
I'm looking only at you right now...

753
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,160
very faithfully.

754
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:41,250
I want you and everything you have.
Am I being rude?

755
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:45,050
I think you're being rude.

756
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:51,090
Just because I said I'll only look at
you, you will step down?

757
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,860
Are you kidding me?

758
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,230
I won't accept you stepping down
from your present office.

759
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:05,230
Then...

760
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,990
Let's break up.

761
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,960
What?

762
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:19,730
I don't understand what you said.

763
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:25,470
Did you just say you want to break up?

764
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:28,470
I did. That's what I said.

765
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:32,780
You said that you would
do anything for me.

766
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,390
I was going to do anything.
I was going to give up on

767
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:38,000
my company, my mother, and my children.

768
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,650
I was really going to only look at you.
But then...

769
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,850
But then what?

770
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:47,240
The most that I can do for you
is to give up everything that I have

771
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,100
in order to have you.

772
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:53,560
I cannot do any more than that.

773
01:01:55,230 --> 01:02:02,760
But if I give up everything I have,
then you don't need me.

774
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,590
So do you want to end everything now?

775
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:10,100
What else can I do?

776
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,230
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

777
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,890
Who says you can end it now?

778
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:17,740
If you end everything now,
then what will happen to me?

779
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:19,930
The engagement party ended like that.

780
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:25,570
What would people say about me? That I
tried to get married to a rich man?

781
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:30,270
I'm not sure if people are still
interested in you so much.

782
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:32,690
But if that's so important to you

783
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:35,730
then you can live the way you want.

784
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:44,130
She's not a mother who is always
on her son's side no matter what.

785
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:51,000
And the children in their 40s are no
longer scared of what their father says.

786
01:02:53,070 --> 01:03:02,120
Even if you break up with me,
I'll never say anything about your son.

787
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:08,890
So... you are free now.

788
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:11,230
Did you say I'm "free?"

789
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:20,750
You tried hard with a man
you don't even love.

790
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:30,230
I'm sorry for insisting on loving
someone I wouldn't be able to bear.

791
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:40,240
But I didn't realize this is who you are.

792
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:48,330
I didn't know the real celebrity,
Yoo Ji Na, would be like this.

793
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:50,640
I really didn't know.

794
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:53,140
Park Sung Hwan.

795
01:03:54,660 --> 01:04:02,200
I'll forget you.
It will be as if we never met.

796
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:10,430
You can go anywhere
and live however you want to live.

797
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:21,000
Go live however you live
for the name, Yoo Ji Na.
