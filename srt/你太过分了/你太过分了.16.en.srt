<i>[Episode 16]</i>

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,880
Who is this Lee Kyung Soo? He's blind?

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:25,600
If you don't want to reveal
your past to the entire world

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,650
then you'd better come out tomorrow
and announce our engagement.

6
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,030
An official announcement.

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,540
You're going to ruin
my life if I don't do it?

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,300
If I can't do anything about it,
I should just marry you?

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,950
Am I crazy? Why would
I be engaged to you?

10
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,360
You're a cruel man.

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,620
This is the kind of person you are.

12
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,640
You're right.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,070
This is who I am.

14
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,320
Yoo Ji Na

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,120
I mean, Kim Hae Jung

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,180
what kind of person are you?

17
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,760
I told you from the beginning

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,890
that I do whatever it
takes to get what I want.

19
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,200
And I told you clearly

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,430
that I don't like you because
you and I are too similar.

21
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,380
I'm not doing it.

22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,250
I would rather die!

23
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,470
Then die.

24
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,600
If you die, then you
probably will be forgiven

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,750
for abandoning the child
who couldn't even see.

26
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,040
And you thought you could fool everyone

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,280
by acting proud and smiling
with that despicable face?

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,100
If you die, maybe
people will forgive you.

29
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,330
So, just die!

30
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,230
If you die, then I will give up on you.

31
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:16,510
I am not someone you
can just mess with easily.

32
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,580
Try it. Just try it!

33
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,650
Call all the reporters to the press
conference room tomorrow.

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,080
Tell them that I have breaking news
about pop singer Yoo Ji Na.

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,470
Tell them she committed
an unthinkable act in the past

36
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,700
and that she has fooled
the entire world this whole time.

37
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,360
Tell them I have the most exclusive news
about Yoo Ji Na. It will bring her down!

38
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,470
I will say one thing.

39
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:20,190
You probably know me well enough
to know what kind of person I am.

40
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,450
If I can't have you

41
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,840
I can't watch someone else have you.

42
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,450
I would rather

43
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,790
destroy you.

44
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,910
Is this...

45
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,880
How you're going to be?

46
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,730
That's why you should've listened
to me when I asked.

47
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,540
- Thank you!
- Welcome!

48
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,590
What are you doing here?

49
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,570
I wanted to see you.

50
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,530
Is it because you don't want to go home?

51
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,130
What?

52
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,220
She wants to get divorced.

53
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,880
- Really?
- Yeah.

54
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,030
So...

55
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,060
I said okay.

56
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,200
Good job.

57
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,220
- Good job?
- With her temper

58
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,530
she finally settled for a divorce.

59
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,150
What if we really get divorced?

60
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,090
Why are you worried?

61
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,000
You can just live with me.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,460
What?

63
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,640
You want me to live
with you instead of her?

64
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,680
- That's right.
- How does that make sense?

65
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,720
How does it not make sense?

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,170
Don't you know
that I think of you as my son?

67
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,430
When you two get a divorce,
one of you is going to live with me.

68
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm going to live with you.

69
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,130
- Still...
- We have to fix her habit

70
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,060
of acting out when
things don't go her way.

71
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,280
That's more urgent than
her becoming a professor!

72
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,870
Sir...

73
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,060
So... You decided to get a divorce?

74
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,780
- You told me to get divorced.
- You're doing it because I said so?

75
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,460
Why else?

76
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,160
You really don't know how
to do anything but study.

77
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,480
I tolerated you this whole
time because of Hoon's dad.

78
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,870
As soon as I submit the documents,
I'm going to quit school.

79
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,750
I asked my friend
to look for a tutoring job.

80
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,130
- What?
- What am I supposed to do?

81
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,630
If I want to feed and raise my kid,
becoming a professor is impossible!

82
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,810
Sorry that all your late night shifts
on stage to support me were a waste.

83
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,770
Fine! Get a divorce! You think I'm
the one who wants to be a professor?

84
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,180
- You!
- Hae Dang, calm down!

85
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,730
- Go inside!
- Go inside! Go inside!

86
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,820
Do you really have to say that
after I quit my job at the school?

87
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,590
You're the one who stepped aside
to do what you wanted to do.

88
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,460
What right do you have
to act like you're on her side?

89
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,850
Your temper is through the roof again

90
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,500
seeing as you're using that bitchy
tone and saying rude things!

91
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,930
You go inside too!

92
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,290
Don't talk so carelessly
if you're not married!

93
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm sick of my sister-in-law
and my mother-in-law!

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,720
They are not that kind of people!

95
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,370
Their very existence makes me sick!

96
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,220
There is no such thing as logic
when it comes to them.

97
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,900
I just hate them.

98
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,760
I hate them even if I have to starve
to death or live on the streets!

99
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,620
<i>[Petition for Divorce]</i>

100
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,270
I already stamped my seal,
so it's your turn.

101
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,790
You said to get the documents ready.

102
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,900
Hurry up and do it.

103
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,560
Can... Can I get a drink
of water before I do it?

104
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,660
Stamp it first and then go.

105
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,510
I... I really need to use the bathroom.

106
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,390
Are you joking right now?

107
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,990
Hurry and stamp it.

108
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,600
All right. I'll stamp it!

109
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,910
He said he wasn't going to wait.

110
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,530
What is this?

111
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,780
Welcome.

112
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,690
What's up with the wine?

113
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:35,300
I never imagined that
this would happen to me.

114
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,130
I wasn't sure how
I'm supposed to do this...

115
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,500
So I just bought a bottle of wine.

116
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,590
Did something happen?

117
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,450
No. Just because...

118
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,940
I wanted to give this to you.

119
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,290
I wanted to wear these with you.

120
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,250
Kyung Soo.

121
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:28,080
I never thought I would
want to give a ring to a girl.

122
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,970
Everyone is celebrating their
100 day and 1,000 day anniversaries

123
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,300
and making good memories...

124
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,820
But we've been so busy with our lives

125
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,560
and I don't know how long
we've been seeing each other, so...

126
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,790
I guessed your size,
but it fits perfectly.

127
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,610
It's so pretty.

128
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,650
Put it on for me.

129
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,810
It feels like it's not a big deal

130
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,120
but after doing it

131
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,710
you feel much closer to me.

132
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,330
Cheers.

133
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,860
You should be dating and giving a ring

134
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,880
to someone much younger than me.

135
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,860
You still don't know how I feel?

136
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,210
It's because I know how you feel

137
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:31,030
that I feel more and more
sorry to be the object of your affection.

138
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,000
And my situation right now is...

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,460
You're saying I have to wait, right?

140
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,580
I have to wait

141
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:48,550
until you feel ready
to leave your family.

142
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,200
I'll wait for you.
You don't have to be sorry.

143
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:02,030
I don't see an end to it.

144
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,690
I feel like I'm trying to fill
a broken pot with water.

145
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:11,540
You heard that Hae Sung
quit her job at the school, right?

146
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,130
She wants to be
a screenwriter of all things.

147
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,550
It's more troublesome than waiting

148
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,900
for my youngest sister to find a job.

149
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,020
My closest sister...

150
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,240
is getting a divorce.

151
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,170
Why?

152
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,450
I don't know what she's thinking.
Getting a divorce when she has a kid...

153
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,440
After I take care of all of them...

154
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,940
how old will I be?

155
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,730
Give me your hand.

156
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,130
There will be an end to it someday.

157
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,140
Whenever that day may be,
I'll be waiting.

158
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:29,070
So... Don't be sorry

159
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,280
don't be hasty

160
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,360
and just accept my heart.

161
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,910
Don't you think to love someone
means you have to wait?

162
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,870
And it's possible that as you wait,
you could love that person even more.

163
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,480
Kyung Soo.

164
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,800
Smile.

165
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,780
You're so pretty when you smile.

166
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,390
You look the prettiest
when you smile shyly.

167
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,020
I don't do that in front of just anybody.

168
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,660
I'm so brave and cheerful
in front of others.

169
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,790
Do you like the ring?

170
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,120
Give me some time.

171
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,400
How am I supposed to give an engagement
announcement all of a sudden?

172
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,310
What do you mean all of a sudden?

173
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,440
There was already a scandal about us
dating and living together.

174
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,820
Give me some time. Please.

175
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,410
Two o' clock this afternoon.

176
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,250
If you don't show up by then

177
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,380
I'm going to reveal everything
I found out about you to the reporters.

178
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,700
I'm not saying I won't do it. I'm asking
you to give me some time to think.

179
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,550
From now on, I'm not going to trust
anything that comes out of your mouth.

180
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:49,260
What do you take me for? You got
caught with him in photos like that...

181
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,590
Park Hyun Joon actually
sent those photos?

182
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:58,320
What did I tell you? He doesn't
care about you at all.

183
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,070
Nothing happened that night. Nothing!

184
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,310
You think it matters if
something happened or not?

185
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,600
You still don't understand
what he's trying to show me?

186
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,310
As soon as you got in that elevator,
you weren't thinking about me at all.

187
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:21,100
What would he think of me?

188
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,280
But you have the nerve
to ask me for a favor?

189
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,780
Still, this is not the solution.

190
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,780
Actually, this is the one solution
that does work for you.

191
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,470
Show up at two o' clock today.

192
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,960
If you don't show up,
I'm going destroy you.

193
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,900
And after that

194
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,020
I'm going to forget about you completely.

195
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,380
Call the salon for
an appointment at noon.

196
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,410
Just do it! Why are you
asking so many questions?

197
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,060
All the reporters have arrived
in the press conference room.

198
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,980
Okay.

199
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,130
Go over there.

200
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,790
You came right on time.

201
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,170
I'm going to hate you forever.

202
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,670
- I don't care.
- I'm going to despise you

203
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,120
- until I die.
- I don't care.

204
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,410
I will never love you.
Not even for a second.

205
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,500
Let's go. The reporters are waiting.

206
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,530
Thank you for taking the time
out of your busy schedule.

207
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,020
Hello, I am singer Yoo Ji Na.

208
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,940
The reason why we invited you here is...

209
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,020
is because...

210
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,240
is because...

211
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,480
we wanted to announce our engagement.

212
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:47,030
Congratulations!
So the scandal was not a lie.

213
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,920
Yes, it looks like it. I'm sorry.

214
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,340
You strongly denied it and
said you were going to file a lawsuit.

215
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:03,840
I'm sorry. I was thinking about
Chairman Park, who is not a celebrity.

216
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,490
I was trying to protect his privacy.

217
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,950
I hope that you do not
think of it negatively.

218
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,800
Then, when do you think
you will get married?

219
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:25,630
There is a lot to prepare, so it's hard
to say exactly when we will get married

220
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:31,750
but we will make an announcement
when everything is ready.

221
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,260
Congratulations again.

222
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,840
Thank you.

223
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,460
What is it about Chairman Park Sung Hwan
that made you decide to marry him?

224
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,530
He is more kind-hearted than you'd think.

225
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:06,060
I thought that I could
trust my life to him.

226
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,780
Will you continue to pursue
your singing career?

227
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,850
Of course. When I think about my fans

228
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:19,130
who loved singer Yoo Ji Na and
the songs through all these years

229
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:25,450
I don't want to leave
the stage until I die.

230
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,860
It's my wish to die on the stage.

231
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,880
May I ask a question to
Chairman Park Sung Hwan this time?

232
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,760
- Yes.
- Normally

233
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,610
it's a tradition to quit work
when you get married.

234
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,960
Is there a special reason
you're letting her continue?

235
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,330
She is someone who can't
live without being on the stage

236
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,480
and I love everything about her.

237
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,400
Her past, her singing career, everything.

238
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:00,840
I have no intention of taking her away
from her adoring public.

239
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,170
As a man, I love her

240
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:13,600
and as a fan, I love singer Yoo Ji Na.

241
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,420
Congratulations.

242
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,700
If you can come up to the front for
photos, that will be greatly appreciated.

243
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,940
You're making a mistake.

244
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,950
I can't guarantee what's going
to happen now.

245
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,810
Do you remember that you were
eventually going to be mine?

246
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:59,930
If you're that angry, then why didn't
you reveal your past instead?

247
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,570
- You're going to regret it.
- No.

248
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,000
That won't happen.

249
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,260
As soon as you leave me, you will turn
into ash and disappear like a moth.

250
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,450
- Are you threatening me?
- Think whatever you want.

251
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,540
In the end, all you wanted
was just to have me, right?

252
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,780
Maybe.

253
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,930
So be careful from now on.

254
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,560
Isn't that what you
were afraid of as well?

255
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:39,010
That as soon as you get what
you want, you might get sick of it.

256
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,320
- What did you say?
- If you don't want that

257
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,900
don't get on my nerves and
work hard to accept my love.

258
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,740
Now that you have revealed
your true self, I am speechless.

259
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,080
No matter how terrible you think I am

260
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,240
it is nothing compared to you. I love you
but you still have feelings for my son.

261
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,900
After you trap me like this, you're
telling me you might get sick of me?

262
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,450
You still have a choice.

263
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,090
You can reveal your past

264
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,410
find your abandoned son, and repent.

265
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,900
If you can't do that

266
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,220
then you have no way to escape from me.

267
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,740
What? An engagement announcement?

268
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,090
He held a press conference.

269
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,480
No way. No way!

270
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,990
It looks like we're about to give
a seat in this household to her.

271
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,040
What were you doing?

272
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,910
- I think we were one step too late.
- What are you going to do?

273
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,410
We can't give up.

274
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,250
Tell him to come here now. Right now.

275
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,050
Will he come now?

276
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,430
Tell him I fainted! Tell him I'm
about to get sent to the hospital.

277
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,960
- I doubt he's going to fall for it.
- What?

278
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,480
I think it would be better to start
research about her quickly.

279
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,800
Find her weakness that made her announce
the engagement without any resistance.

280
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,090
Spend 100 million or 200 million won!

281
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,640
Do whatever it takes to find out!

282
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,630
<i>[After only one year...
Chairman of GR group in love.]</i>

283
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,950
I have never met anyone like you.

284
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,620
And whose fault is this?

285
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,310
I knew you were going to give in
as soon as he pushed you.

286
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,040
What made you so
confident to get in my car?

287
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,690
You don't even understand
me, so don't irritate me.

288
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:57,320
You had no intention to give up
on him, isn't that it?

289
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,740
I said don't irritate me
if you don't know.

290
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,270
You really don't know how I feel?

291
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,920
Wow... I am so moved.

292
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,510
But you realized that it's not working
on me, so you decided to settle for him?

293
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,490
I won't forgive you.

294
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,760
The biggest reason this happened to me

295
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,930
is because of you, Park Hyun Joon.
You used me and looked down on me!

296
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,730
Your love has changed to loathing now?

297
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:33,490
When I become Chairman Park's
woman, I'm going to go after you first.

298
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:38,520
As a punishment for
insulting me and my love.

299
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,070
You won't have a chance to do that.

300
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,900
Why won't I?

301
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:48,180
I will become his woman
and he can do anything.

302
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,780
You drew the losing
ticket for the lottery.

303
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,370
What?

304
00:27:54,230 --> 00:28:01,690
Did you think if nothing works out,
you can be the chairman's wife?

305
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:06,620
Chairman Park Sung Hwan is
going to eventually go to the police.

306
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,060
- What?
- You drew the losing ticket.

307
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,390
<i>You can reveal your past</i>

308
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,910
<i>find your abandoned son, and repent.</i>

309
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:37,010
<i>If you can't do that, then you have
no way to escape from me.</i>

310
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,110
<i>Chairman Park Sung Hwan is
going to eventually go to the police.</i>

311
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,740
<i>You drew the losing ticket.</i>

312
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,190
Are you waiting for Father?

313
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,840
I already prepared dinner.

314
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,530
The housemaid will
assist you during dinner.

315
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,610
Of all days...

316
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:15,070
I'm sorry. The reservation
was made in advance

317
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,810
and it's hard for him to make time.

318
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,010
You saw the engagement
announcement, right?

319
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:30,120
- Yeah.
- Your father is unbelievable.

320
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,310
Even after she went on
a trip with your brother.

321
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,420
It just means that he trusts
my brother that much.

322
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,880
That's what pisses me
off the most right now.

323
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,650
- Really?
- He trusts that nothing happened.

324
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,100
If he didn't trust him and
believed something happened

325
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,510
how could he even think
about getting engaged to her?

326
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,940
You're right.

327
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,900
"I hate it when you get on my nerves,
but out of everyone, I trust you."

328
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,600
- Isn't that what he's saying?
- Even if he wants to trust him

329
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,740
that ship has sailed.

330
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:07,820
What I'm worried about is that he gets
married to Yoo Ji Na and has a child.

331
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,670
What?

332
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,280
She's about to turn 50.

333
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,350
There are people who get
pregnant when they're 50.

334
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,500
Plus, in our modern world, medical
technology has advanced so much.

335
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:24,080
What bothers me is that
she is too young for your father.

336
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,860
He loves her so much already.
Now, think about if they have a baby.

337
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,810
You think your father won't
wait until that baby turns 20?

338
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:38,990
He might even wait until he turns 30.

339
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,540
When you removed your father-in-law
and took over the company...

340
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,320
did you do it by yourself?

341
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,630
If it weren't for you, it would
have been impossible.

342
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,380
- And?
- I am grateful for it.

343
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:02,420
You're grateful for it, but you
decided to get married to that wench?

344
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,030
Please accept that for your son's sake.

345
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:09,770
I was even able to harass the daughter
of the owner of this house.

346
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,000
You're not scared?

347
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,420
She is not the same person
as their deceased mother.

348
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,980
- What?
- This is only making it hard for you.

349
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,670
As the eldest person in the family,
please accept her graciously.

350
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,960
No.

351
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,470
You've aged enough now!

352
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,260
How dare you raise your voice?

353
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:36,800
Did you beat your father-in-law and
take over the company fair and square?

354
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,820
Do you want to go against me?

355
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,790
Is that something you should
say to your son right now?

356
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,650
Remember when you said you
wouldn't look at me as your mother?

357
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,680
If things keep going this way,
I won't think of you as my son either!

358
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,520
Did you tell my brother about the will?

359
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,990
Don't you think you
used that card too early?

360
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,430
It's not a useful card
to hold on to anymore.

361
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,450
- What do you mean?
- If we can't find any evidence

362
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,470
it's useless.

363
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:21,460
Why do you think I haven't used
that to face your father myself?

364
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,880
To say that I heard them fight
about a will over the phone

365
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,950
is a useful card to pit your brother
and father against each other

366
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:33,830
but it's not sufficient evidence
to send your father to the police.

367
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,020
- That's true.
- Your father is not easy.

368
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,940
You think that evidence
is going to just show up?

369
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,000
If we aren't careful,
we might end up getting burned.

370
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,780
So...

371
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,580
Bong Soo and Hae Jin

372
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,050
have finally decided to get a divorce.

373
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:01,280
Before submitting the documents,
we are having one final family meeting.

374
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,800
Hey... Honey. Do you
really have to do this?

375
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,640
Bong Seon and I will find our own place.
Think about it a little more.

376
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,300
What do you mean you'll
find your own place?

377
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,770
As the head of this household...

378
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,850
Bong Soo, stay and live upstairs
with your mother and sister.

379
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,110
And you, Jung Hae Jin,
get out of this house.

380
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,200
Hae Dang, is that okay?

381
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,640
Do what you wish, Dad.

382
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:44,220
I'm sorry. I can live without you,
but I can't live without Bong Soo.

383
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,530
After all of you get married

384
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,820
I'm going to grow old with him.

385
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,690
My son-in-law,
my son, and my friend.

386
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,550
- Sir...
- Honey

387
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,620
think about Hoon. What did
he do wrong to deserve this?

388
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,220
This is Hoon's destiny.

389
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,170
It was Hoon's destiny
to be born to an impatient mom.

390
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:15,340
Fine. I'll take Hoon and leave.

391
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,460
I'll see you in court.

392
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:23,050
Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey...

393
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,490
Honey, I can't live without you!

394
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,230
This didn't happen!

395
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,000
Honey. Honey, I love you.

396
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,700
I love you!

397
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,920
I'm sorry I love you,
but I still love you!

398
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,500
Geez.

399
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,970
How are we supposed to teach
her if you act like this?

400
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,090
Why are you all attacking her?

401
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,080
You shouldn't chase her out like this.

402
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,600
What wrong did she
commit except marrying me?

403
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,300
For someone with her kind of pride

404
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,330
you're all being too harsh on her
because she let her anger out once!

405
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:11,520
I'm the criminal for giving birth to you!
I'm the criminal for giving birth to you!

406
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,710
Let's stop this and go eat.

407
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,010
Dinner's late. I'm hungry!

408
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:21,560
Honey! Honey! I love you!

409
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,930
Go upstairs. Go upstairs. Go upstairs.

410
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,320
- Go up to the roof!
- Why are you being like this?

411
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,220
Go up there and declare your love, and
that you're going to jump off the roof!

412
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,330
- Go upstairs!
- Sir...

413
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,030
Go upstairs. Go upstairs!

414
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,840
Why are you hitting me?

415
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,800
Geez. Geez!

416
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:44,720
It's because my son is acting that way
that his wife is acting like a princess.

417
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,850
You were scared earlier too.

418
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:50,500
"Hey... Honey. Honey..."

419
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,800
You were scared they were
about to get a divorce, right?

420
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,680
How could I not have been?

421
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,730
He found her when he was a young
bachelor. Think about if he remarries.

422
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:02,650
I'm terrified just imagining what
kind of daughter-in-law she might be!

423
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:07,570
Who knows? She might be someone
kind who makes a lot of money.

424
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,150
Geez. I'll never find

425
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,720
a nice, wealthy daughter-in-law
when my son is so foolish.

426
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,530
Geez. Geez.

427
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:25,220
This whole time, I had no
idea why Hae Jin married him.

428
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,690
It must be because of that!

429
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,880
Right?

430
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,830
After seeing that, how can women without
husbands live and not get depressed?

431
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,280
I think I have to change my ideal man.

432
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,030
Bong Soo has been
promoted to my ideal man!

433
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,740
You're going to get married
and live at this house too?

434
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,690
He clung to her without any shame!

435
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,160
I'm just grateful.

436
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,590
Grateful... This is why Hae Jin
is still able to act like a princess

437
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:57,340
even when she's living here and spending
her husband's money while she's studying.

438
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,150
She acted like a princess
before she got married.

439
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,570
You're partly responsible for that.

440
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:09,250
You bought her expensive new clothes
and shoes because she did well in school.

441
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,430
I did.

442
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:15,200
While we had to wear
street market clothes, right?

443
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,410
Agreed! I take much
of the responsibility!

444
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,700
Gosh... I should just...

445
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,320
What did I do?

446
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,430
You ruined everything at the last second.

447
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,850
You couldn't wait?
You had to cling to her?

448
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,430
As a man, I should be more tolerant.

449
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,960
Geez. And aren't you manly?

450
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,350
Is that why you grabbed your wife's
skirt in front of the entire family?

451
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:45,310
Are you going to keep saying that?

452
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:50,930
And I'm so thankful that you
think of me as your son and friend

453
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:55,460
but I think it was a bit too much when
you said we would grow old together.

454
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,030
- How?
- I am not

455
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:02,510
in a position to be growing old with you.

456
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,330
When people look at us,
we're about the same.

457
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,210
What?

458
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:12,430
If you keep saying that,
I'm going to sleep here again.

459
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,380
No, no, no!

460
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,800
I didn't get any sleep that night
because you snored all night long!

461
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,820
For someone as old as me,
I'm going to faint. No!

462
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,380
Please!

463
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,170
Sir, I love you!

464
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,570
Do you...

465
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:38,930
make that face at Hae Jin
too when you say I love you?

466
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:43,490
- Yeah.
- You need to change it

467
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,840
for the sake of the person
receiving the love.

468
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,210
How should I change it?

469
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,500
This right here.

470
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,500
Can't you make it... better somehow?

471
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,490
This is actually pretty good.

472
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:21,060
What are you doing here?

473
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,380
You said you were going to sleep
in Hoon's room. Go get Hoon.

474
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,690
Since we're here,
might as well sleep here.

475
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:35,930
Why would I bring him in? He's already
asleep! What if I wake him up?

476
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:40,570
Oh! Wait, hold on.

477
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:47,010
Honey, I love you.

478
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,190
What are you doing?

479
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,730
Ta-da! I changed it!

480
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,350
It's more disgusting. More disgusting.

481
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:08,620
You said it's more disgusting,
but you're going to sleep here?

482
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,270
You snob!

483
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,030
Oh!

484
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,350
Honey, I'm coming!

485
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,950
Get out! Get out!

486
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,640
- Get out!
- Hold on!

487
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
<i>Get out! Get out!</i>

488
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,070
What's going on?
Are they sleeping together?

489
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,160
Quiet. Quiet. Let's go inside.

490
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,690
Come with me.

491
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,050
What did Park Hyun Joon mean
when he said you're going to the police?

492
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,140
It's of no concern to you.

493
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:51,770
And you still threatened me
to announce our engagement?

494
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,660
What's going to happen to me?

495
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,670
Are you scared you won't be able
play the role of the chairman's wife?

496
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:03,740
You said that you and Hyun Joon
can't be in the same boat, right?

497
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,810
But you dragged me into
a boat that's sinking?

498
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:12,740
If you want to survive,
you have to be on my side.

499
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,280
All you have to do is
wish for my survival.

500
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,770
Wh... What did you say?

501
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,690
If you hate this, all you have to do is
confess everything to the public

502
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,230
find your son, and repent.

503
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:28,200
Then what about me?

504
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,140
What about me? I abandoned my own
child and worked all my life to survive!

505
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,160
What about me? What about me?

506
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,480
What kind of situation is this?

507
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,100
You abandoned your own blind child

508
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,070
and enjoyed yourself while you
received love from everyone else.

509
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,220
What's so unfair about that?

510
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,050
Situation?

511
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,990
How can you even say that?

512
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,950
I'm the one who abandoned my child.
Why are you getting so worked up?

513
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,060
Did I ever do anything wrong to you?

514
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,660
You haven't done anything wrong
that affected me?

515
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:16,050
Is it because you like me,
but I approached your son instead?

516
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,060
Did anyone tell you to like me?

517
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,370
Isn't it my choice who I like?

518
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:27,530
I never once told you to like me!

519
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,460
Why is your love for
me my responsibility?

520
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,520
Why?

521
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,550
Why do I have to die with you?

522
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,760
Why? Why? Why?

523
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,130
I, Park Sung Hwan, am not dead yet!

524
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,660
I worked too hard to get to where I am!
Do you know what I had to do?

525
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,720
You think I'm going to die that easily?

526
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,550
I, Park Sung Hwan, am not dead yet.

527
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,760
- Get out.
- Did you think

528
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:19,480
that I would just watch Yoo Ji Na
replace Mom's spot in this house?

529
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,150
You still haven't explained the will.

530
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,650
There is nothing to explain.

531
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,410
You fought with Mom over
the phone about the will.

532
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:30,020
The next day she went to the vacation
house and fell off the cliff.

533
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,140
You still want to argue
that this was a suicide?

534
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,650
I'm too tired to explain myself
since you won't believe me.

535
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,560
What do you think you need then?

536
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,450
You need evidence. Evidence!

537
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,150
If there is something to reveal, then
some kind of evidence should show up.

538
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,890
Don't you think?

539
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,700
<i>[From: Choi Kyung Ae.
To: My Son]</i>

540
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,930
<i>The item that needs to
be given to you, Hyun Joon</i>

541
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:04,140
<i>is buried underneath the tree
that only you and I know about.</i>

542
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,240
<i>And I have one favor to ask.</i>

543
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,640
Please don't tell others about...

544
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,970
our conversation regarding Lee Kyung Soo.

545
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:26,260
Is that why you're giving me more money?

546
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:31,310
It's a lot more than you probably expect.

547
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,270
It's me.

548
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:46,420
Why are you calling me at this hour?

549
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,820
I have something to tell you.

550
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,610
There's nothing I want to hear
from you. I'm going to hang up.

551
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,250
I have something to tell you,
so please meet with me.

552
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,380
It's important.

553
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,290
Is it regarding your friend,
Lee Kyung Soo?

554
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:01,630
Yes, that's right.

555
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:05,570
You don't keep it clean, do you?

556
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,860
I told you there is nothing
I want to hear or say!

557
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,030
- It's something you have to hear.
- I said I don't want to hear it!

558
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:16,500
You said you don't need money.
Did you change your mind?

559
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,570
If you need more money,
we don't need to meet.

560
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,920
If you give me your account info,
I'll transfer it over.

561
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,590
<i>Do you really want to delete
your son's existence</i>

562
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:51,840
<i>because you're worried your engagement
with a chairman might be jeopardized?</i>

563
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,820
<i>I'm your son. I'm your son,
Lee Kyung Soo!</i>

564
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:16,810
Yoon Sung Hwa?

565
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:27,070
What are you doing here?

566
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,590
I heard that the lessons were over.

567
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:32,740
What brings you here?

568
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,730
- I was just passing by.
- At this hour?

569
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,760
And you came here
without your cane today.

570
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,810
I was about to call a taxi.

571
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:48,510
So...

572
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,240
Who is he?

573
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:09,250
Hello, President Park!

574
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,460
How are you?

575
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:17,210
My daughters used to come visit me,
but now my sons-in-law are visiting me!

576
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,170
Sons-in-law?

577
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,490
Not yet. Why? Does it bother you?

578
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:24,170
No. It makes me happy to hear that.

579
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,280
Really? Give me a minute.

580
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,140
I'll buy you something
delicious over there.

581
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,540
Okay!

582
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,590
You came here with your son-in-law last
time. Who did you come with this time?

583
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,950
- He is my eldest son-in-law.
- Hello.

584
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:44,230
You must be so happy.

585
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:48,410
Your eldest son-in-law sure is handsome.

586
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:50,950
You haven't seen my daughters yet, right?

587
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,320
My daughters are beautiful!

588
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,870
They must resemble their mom.

589
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:59,440
What? Just bring me more ox blood...

590
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,850
Enjoy!

591
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,690
- Ma'am!
- Yes!

592
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,250
That lady is so silly.

593
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,650
- Let's eat.
- Okay, okay.

594
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:12,320
By the way, do you like ox blood?

595
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,840
What? Yes...

596
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:19,430
Here. One is not enough.

597
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,910
This is too much.

598
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:32,090
It looks like you're
concerned about something.

599
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,550
How did you know?

600
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:39,710
I knew right away because
I think of you as my son!

601
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,370
- It's a problem.
- What is it?

602
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:46,650
Hae Dang's appearance in a program?

603
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:49,660
If it doesn't work out, oh well.

604
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,270
I'm sure another opportunity will come.

605
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:53,920
Don't worry too much.

606
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,890
It's not that.

607
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,800
I'm so upset.

608
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,910
Hae Dang is dating someone.

609
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:05,370
- She is what?
- What should I do?

610
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,800
What do you mean?

611
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,110
Is it true that you're dating someone?

612
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,030
Yes.

613
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,800
What kind of person is he?

614
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,020
You know him too.

615
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:25,100
- Who is it?
- The cafe owner.

616
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:30,840
He got eye surgery, so you don't
have anything to worry about now.

617
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,550
How old is he?

618
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:38,350
25.

619
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,720
That means he's only a year older

620
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,670
-  than our youngest, Hae Soo.
- Yes.

621
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:48,680
What are you going to do with
someone eight years younger?

622
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,470
What about his parents?

623
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:00,270
I heard from Hae Soo once

624
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:05,910
that he was raised in
an orphanage. Is that true?

625
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,410
Yes.

626
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,400
Hae Dang.

627
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,730
Of course I want you
to marry someone you like

628
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,140
after all the work you've been through.

629
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:23,370
I haven't thought about marriage yet.

630
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:26,850
For me...

631
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,560
I like President Park.

632
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,400
He's normal and healthy.

633
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,970
What else do you need?

634
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:40,840
He's attractive and
his character is good too.

635
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,200
His family background may not be great

636
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,510
but it's good enough.
What more can we ask for?

637
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:53,350
- That's true.
- Even if you think your marriage

638
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,670
is smooth, something is bound to happen
as you live together. That's marriage.

639
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:02,980
But why would you choose the hard
way when there is an easier path?

640
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:07,550
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know about anything else

641
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:09,560
but he's so young.

642
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,160
I'm sorry to worry you.

643
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,940
Geez.

644
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,220
Good morning.

645
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,820
You're just getting here?

646
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:33,800
Jung Hae Dang said she wants
to see you in the practice room.

647
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,720
- She's already here?
- She has something scheduled

648
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,060
in the afternoon, so I think she
only has the morning to practice.

649
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,840
Really? Please prepare some coffee.

650
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,440
Okay.

651
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,490
Good morning!

652
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,750
Is it really a good morning?

653
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,910
Is it not?

654
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,620
It must be for you.

655
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,370
What? Did something happen?

656
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:06,320
What did you tell my dad?

657
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,560
He's worrying about nothing.

658
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:12,800
As the CEO of your agency,
I told him because I was worried.

659
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,310
What if you decide to get married
after we make you into a star?

660
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:20,140
Are you going to keep mentioning
your position as an excuse?

661
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:23,230
Then what other excuse should I use?
I have to use that at the very least.

662
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:28,390
I'm canceling our contract right now!

663
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:31,460
I said do it if you have the money.
Who's stopping you?

664
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,160
Let's have bibimbap for lunch today.

665
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:43,820
You don't want that?

666
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,180
That's not the problem right now.

667
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,230
What's going on this time?

668
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:52,420
After we finally calmed
things down with Hae Jin

669
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,240
this time it's about Hae Dang.

670
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,440
Your eldest daughter?

671
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,860
She has never caused you
any trouble. What's going on?

672
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,750
I think she fell in love with
a man who is only 25.

673
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,130
What?

674
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:12,760
Wait a minute... How old is Hae Dang?

675
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,730
What do you mean? She's 33.

676
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:19,120
- No. No.
- That's what I'm saying.

677
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,890
Even if you're the same age,
women age faster.

678
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:24,530
Women these days want younger men
without understanding the truth

679
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:27,710
but the worst thing you can
do is marry a younger man.

680
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:30,990
She's going to have to be mindful of him
even when she hasn't done anything wrong.

681
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:33,660
You know everything.

682
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:38,080
They may think that 25 and
33 are the same thing right now.

683
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,280
But he'll still only be 32
when Hae Dang turns 40.

684
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,990
He's going to cheat.

685
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:48,190
Then, what do I do?

686
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,840
What does he do?

687
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,370
You know that cafe near the front
of our neighborhood?

688
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:55,870
You never saw him when you passed by?

689
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:58,310
Why would I have peeked inside?

690
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:02,260
Check it out when you pass by
next time. I saw him briefly once.

691
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,810
Yeah, okay.

692
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:09,180
Since we're talking about it,
let's just go visit right now.

693
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,920
- Right now?
- Get up.

694
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:17,030
What if he asks why we're there?

695
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:20,120
We'll just say we went
for some coffee. You said it's a cafe.

696
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:25,650
Don't say anything unnecessary.

697
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,360
I'm going to get in
trouble with Hae Dang!

698
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,950
Don't worry.

699
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:33,160
I don't know if this is
the right thing to do.

700
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,390
I don't think this is right!

701
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:39,550
What's not right? Let's just see
his face since we're already here.

702
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:42,430
What if he asks what our relationship is?

703
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,410
Why would he ask customers that?

704
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:47,040
But still, what if he asks?

705
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,740
We'll just say that we're in-laws.

706
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:54,800
What if he asks why in-laws
like ourselves are visiting?

707
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,330
Just go home.

708
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,770
I'll take a look by myself.

709
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:03,070
Then, what about me?

710
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,230
Wel... Welcome.

711
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:16,190
I'm not sure if it's okay for elders
like ourselves to be coming in here.

712
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:19,800
It's totally fine. Welcome.
Please sit anywhere you'd like.

713
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,930
What would you like to order?

714
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,780
One coffee please.

715
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,320
You... You can't order just one.

716
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,790
- I need a drink too.
- Right.

717
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,680
Two coffees please.

718
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,330
We have a lot of different kinds.

719
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:59,590
Is it okay if I prepare something
for you that I think you'll like?

720
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:04,600
Just... Give me the regular one.

721
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,390
I will make one for you.

722
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:16,730
This guy is more attractive.

723
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:18,850
What if he hears you?

724
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:23,490
Your oldest daughter is marrying late,
but she's blessed with good-looking men.

725
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:28,210
Whose family does he belong
to that he is so good looking?

726
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,040
I said to be quiet!

727
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:36,050
His smile is worth a million US dollars.

728
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:40,110
Who cares if he's kind? He's 25.

729
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:43,890
He would be perfect for
your youngest daughter.

730
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:46,560
I know.

731
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:58,710
I'm not sure if this is
going to taste good.

732
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,790
Enjoy.

733
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,270
Will do.

734
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:06,640
I mean, of course I will,
because I bought it.

735
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,480
Anyway, we will enjoy the coffee.

736
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,080
Hot!

737
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,810
Are you okay?

738
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:20,870
I'm okay.

739
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,440
Don't worry about me. Go on
and do what you need to do.

740
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,430
Okay...

741
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,640
This is so romantic.

742
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:49,570
I wish I could have
a son-in-law like him.

743
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,120
Yeah, right.

744
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:57,230
It's not even time for dinner.
What brings you here?

745
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:00,300
- Congratulations on your engagement.
- Thanks.

746
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,840
I saw Yoon Sung Hwa
outside the gate the other day.

747
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,890
I wonder why he came when
he stopped giving you lessons.

748
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,410
How should I know?

749
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:13,230
Why did you stop taking lessons with
him when you enjoyed it so much?

750
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:16,650
There was a limit to his abilities.

751
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:21,120
You said the lesson was not your goal.

752
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,890
What are you trying to ask me?

753
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,640
Why are you getting so angry?

754
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,020
I saw him at the front gate, so
of course I had to tell you about it.

755
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:32,010
It was extremely late.

756
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,400
It's strange that you're
getting mad about it.

757
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:43,680
<i>I told him clearly not to come,
but he came all the way here?</i>

758
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:14,810
Who is it?

759
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:20,820
We'll just talk here since
you don't have any customers.

760
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:26,100
I'd like to know why you
came all the way out to my house.

761
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:29,470
I told Mrs. Go that
I was just passing by.

762
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:31,930
Just passing by?

763
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:35,970
What could you have possibly been doing
to pass by that area at that hour?

764
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,900
Is it money that you want?

765
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,410
I already told you no.

766
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:43,530
Then, what is it?

767
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:45,880
If it's not that, then what is it?

768
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:51,260
Why are you so afraid of Lee Kyung Soo?

769
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,560
Who's afraid?

770
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,240
I'll be honest.

771
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,900
He is my friend's son.

772
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:12,030
- What did you say?
- He is my best friend's son.

773
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:18,480
I was just curious because
I was thinking about my friend.

774
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,800
Is that so?

775
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,980
So don't think you can approach me

776
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:26,780
as if you discovered
my weakness or something.

777
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:28,390
Did you come here to tell me that?

778
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,600
That's right.

779
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,950
I came here to tell you that.

780
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:38,310
I recently heard

781
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:43,640
that Lee Kyung Soo,
my friend, had surgery.

782
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:58,260
Wh... What... What kind of surgery?

783
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:02,840
I heard that he got a corneal transplant
and that the results were good.

784
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:16,340
That means my friend is somewhere

785
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,160
watching you.

786
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:25,390
He said your voice is
the same as his mom's.

787
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:33,150
Now he can confirm if your face is
the same as his mom with his own eyes.
