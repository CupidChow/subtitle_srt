00:00:06,317 --> 00:00:07,710
(Episode 32)

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,085
Give me the letter now.

3
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:18,265
- What letter?
- Now is the time for you to give me that letter.

4
00:00:20,242 --> 00:00:21,242
I lost it.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,406
- You lost it?
- Yes. I lost it.

6
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,343
Then will you be okay if your mom
gets kicked out of this house?

7
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:37,676
Yoo Ji-na's singing career
is completely over.

8
00:00:38,992 --> 00:00:44,203
She's been branded as a woman who
had abandoned her blind child.

9
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:47,570
If I kick her out, it's the end for her.

10
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,539
Will you be okay if I brush her
off like she's some kind of bug?

11
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:59,768
Is that why you had revealed
I was her son at the

12
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:04,172
press conference when she
had denied it herself?

13
00:01:06,227 --> 00:01:10,226
So that you could ruin her until
she had nowhere to run away

14
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:14,742
so that you could use that as
a weakness to get the letter?

15
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:18,328
My life is at stake on that letter.

16
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:27,781
If Yoo Ji-na, your mom, gets
dumped by me in this situation,

17
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:30,469
she might overdose on pills
and take her own life.

18
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,360
- What do you think about that?
- So this is the kind of person you were.

19
00:01:35,384 --> 00:01:41,007
If you realize that, give
the letter to me now.

20
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:49,437
- I already told you that I lost it.
- Then why did you sneak into my house?

21
00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:54,769
It'd be best for you to not regard matters
so simply when you're dealing with me.

22
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,347
There's no way to retrieve a lost letter.

23
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:01,550
But that letter is useless
to everyone else.

24
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,064
- What?
- Only Park Hyun-joon will know what it means.

25
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:10,437
No one else will be able
to find the clue but him.

26
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,257
Is that so? Then it's over for Ji-na.

27
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:22,546
I don't want to be pestered by an immoral,
irresponsible woman anymore anyways.

28
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:32,132
However, the ending won't be up to you.

29
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:37,141
What do you mean?

30
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:40,161
It will be up to me.

31
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,007
"I don't have the letter,
so don't ask for it.

32
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:52,416
However I'll be able to tell Hyun-joon the
content of the letter, so act wisely."

33
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,485
Is that what you're saying?

34
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:59,034
I'm saying that I hope you
will at least give me some

35
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:03,664
time to persuade Ji-na into
leaving this house with me.

36
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:05,437
Then let me ask you one thing.

37
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:09,500
What are you planning
to do after you leave?

38
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:13,742
Are you saying that I won't
have to worry about matters

39
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:19,203
regarding the letter if I give
you time to leave this house?

40
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:24,743
Isn't this the moment where
you need to make a promise?

41
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:29,151
I have no intention of bargaining
with someone like you.

42
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,348
- What?
- Nothing will be achieved if I make a bargain

43
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:37,653
with someone who follows the
rules only when he wants to.

44
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:41,522
I simply...

45
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:46,353
want you to keep in mind
that you may have been the

46
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:48,607
one who dragged my mother
and me into this house,

47
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:56,562
but we'll be the ones to decide about
matters regarding leaving this house.

48
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:25,016
Did you mean it when you said you don't
find me beautiful as a woman anymore?

49
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:31,250
I think Kyung-soo will be the
greatest gift you will ever give me.

50
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,601
What do you mean?

51
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:41,588
I've always wanted a son like him.
Someone who is quiet and strong.

52
00:04:57,953 --> 00:05:00,453
He's a very intelligent and firm man.

53
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:04,398
He knows how to endure and crush others.

54
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:09,664
He didn't learn those things.
It's a natural talent.

55
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,511
That is why they say
business can only be done

56
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:15,267
by people who have a natural talent for it.

57
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,351
He's endured through tough
times, so he's different

58
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,820
from your sons who have grown up in luxury.

59
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,632
I've worked my entire
life building my company.

60
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:28,734
It's my pride.

61
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:35,421
Even after I die, it must
stand strong and flourish.

62
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:41,034
I can't hand over my company to
those rascals just because they're

63
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:43,727
my flesh and blood when they don't
have the skills to protect it.

64
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:47,820
It will only be a matter of
time before it collapses.

65
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:58,515
Hyun-sung is hard-working but dense and
Hyun-joon doesn't have a spiteful side.

66
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:04,836
On top of that, they're on
the worst terms with you.

67
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,851
- What did you say?
- He has high expectations for you.

68
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:24,726
Mr. Park Sung-hwan no longer loves you.

69
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:28,173
He might be able to love
me again because of you.

70
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,890
If you're no longer useful
to him, he'll dump you.

71
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:34,968
- He told me he wanted a son like you.
- Don't be ridiculous.

72
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:38,539
- Get out of this house before you get kicked out.
- What?

73
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:44,234
Listen to me carefully.

74
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:48,132
My life as a singer is completely over now.

75
00:06:49,148 --> 00:06:51,710
People just think of me as a
wench who had abandoned her son.

76
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,265
It's not like you don't
have money to survive.

77
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,493
Go to the country and live quietly.

78
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:59,452
I didn't abandon you and come this
far just so I can merely survive.

79
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:01,578
One day, you're going to
be dumped by Mr. Park!

80
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:02,969
Then...

81
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:07,296
I won't live.

82
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:13,703
I'd rather not live then. Why would I?
What hope do I have to keep living?

83
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:21,679
- What?
- I, Yoo Ji-na, would rather die than live low like that.

84
00:07:23,398 --> 00:07:26,656
What? Go the country and live quietly?

85
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:36,921
At one time, I was loved
and cheered on by people!

86
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:42,336
If you wanted to keep being a singer,
you shouldn't have married Mr. Park.

87
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,560
I did it for you!

88
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:49,533
Mr. Park, who loved me back then,
found out about you and used you

89
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:52,854
for blackmail to get me into
publicly announcing our engagement.

90
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:57,901
That's when everything went downhill.

91
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:02,492
After everything went
downhill, you eventually

92
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:06,810
threw stones at me by telling
everyone at the press conference

93
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:09,234
for my marriage that you were
the son I had abandoned.

94
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:17,531
In the end, because of you, whom I
had abandoned, things came this far.

95
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:21,001
If you had let me live with Hae-dang,
none of this would've happened.

96
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:22,718
I lost many things because of you, too.

97
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:29,570
However, I'm still putting up
with you because you're my child.

98
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,984
If Mr. Park divorces you, will
you really end your life?

99
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:47,343
People who lived like me...

100
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:50,804
don't have any other choice.

101
00:08:57,508 --> 00:09:02,281
I've worked with Hyun-sung all this time,
but he hasn't shown brilliant achievements.

102
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,796
He's just a hard-working, exemplary worker.

103
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,515
Then bring in Hyun-joon.

104
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,788
Both Hyun-joon and Kyung-soo will
be learning for the first time.

105
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:16,289
On top of that, Hyun-joon is too
old to learn from the beginning.

106
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:20,039
How could you compare Hyun-joon
and Hyun-sung to Kyung-soo?

107
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:26,375
Hyun-joon has a hot temper and becomes
weak-hearted at the most crucial moments.

108
00:09:26,828 --> 00:09:28,945
He has the worst personality for business.

109
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,609
Still, my first choice is Hyun-joon.
Then it's Hyun-sung.

110
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:34,382
There's no one else after that.

111
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:40,012
Mother, the era of treating the company
as your personal possession is over.

112
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:43,539
No. As long as I'm alive, it won't be over.

113
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:47,730
I'm going to live in the world
I know and do as I please.

114
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:58,664
I lost many things because of you, too.

115
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:03,734
However, I'm still putting up
with you because you're my child.

116
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:12,789
What's on your mind?

117
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,531
I just came out for some fresh air.

118
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:21,914
Are you really thinking of
just doing music your life?

119
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:26,656
Are you going to just do music
and not work in the company?

120
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:31,429
I have neither the skills nor the
desire to work in the company.

121
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:40,937
I have nothing to lose anyways.

122
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:45,101
Fine. I'll put my faith in you.

123
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,304
Good morning...

124
00:10:57,226 --> 00:10:58,226
mother.

125
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:03,531
Mother? Not step-mother?

126
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:07,687
Go and do your yoga. I'll
make vegetable juice for you.

127
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:37,851
Mother, you have gorgeous skin.

128
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:40,907
You have the elasticity of
someone in her thirties.

129
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,695
Did you eat something wrong?
What's wrong with you?

130
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:49,507
Of course I should call you mother. What
else would I call my mother-in-law?

131
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:56,039
What do you want? You wouldn't even lift
a finger unless you want something.

132
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:59,406
- I want family peace.
- Family peace?

133
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:02,740
You married my father-in-law,
so you should play the lady of

134
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,578
the household in order for the
family to become peaceful.

135
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:07,406
That's the order, too.

136
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:16,773
Thanks for the juice.

137
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:20,171
If there's one other thing I want...

138
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:29,132
I don't want to treat a woman who
dances at a cabaret as my superior.

139
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:34,023
You were happy you would be
able to have someone under you.

140
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:37,781
Would you like to me to make
juice for you every morning?

141
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:40,382
I'd be grateful if you did.

142
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:50,085
You should be honored I'm serving you.
Why play hard-to-get?

143
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,835
I can't stand this.

144
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:07,656
What if all you do is ruin Hyun-joon and
do something beneficial for Kyung-soo?

145
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,828
- He said all he's going to do is play music.
- You actually believe that?

146
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,531
Even if he's telling the
truth, do you think

147
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,020
Yoo Ji-na is going to just let that happen?

148
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,422
- I'll just have to put up a safety net.
- A safety net?

149
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:20,656
I'm going to make a trap.

150
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:25,631
A trap she'll fall deeply into and
won't be able to come out of.

151
00:13:26,577 --> 00:13:30,803
I'm going to use her weakness. That way,
she won't be able to trick me later.

152
00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:34,561
- What are you talking about?
- What is her greatest weakness?

153
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:50,545
- Ask me for a favor.
- A favor?

154
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:53,295
That way, I'll be able to
ask you for a favor later.

155
00:13:54,843 --> 00:13:58,811
- What favor do you want?
- For you to accept Kyung-soo as your younger brother.

156
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:01,608
I'm not interested.

157
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:06,037
How will you be able to do
business with such a dense brain?

158
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:11,411
If the chance comes, I'll do my best.

159
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,772
What would you like to
eat for lunch, mother?

160
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:33,241
Vietnamese spring rolls? For
some reason, I want to eat that.

161
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:37,912
Is that food? It's just child's play.
Just make rice.

162
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:43,006
But mother wants to eat that.

163
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,459
- Then she'll make it on her own.
- I'll prepare rice for you.

164
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,334
Then I'll leave it to you.

165
00:14:56,538 --> 00:15:00,287
What are you doing? What's wrong with you?

166
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:07,655
- Did you decide to team up with her?
- I need to play the mediator for family peace.

167
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:12,725
- Since when did you care about family peace?
- I'm going to start caring now.

168
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:15,998
Goodness. You're shallow
like a piece of paper.

169
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:23,623
All I want is for the family to
stop fighting and live in harmony.

170
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:29,483
You might end up being kicked
out first before that happens.

171
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:33,733
I'll prepare hot pot for you.

172
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,358
My goodness.

173
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:47,967
Aren't you happy that I called you
"mother" in front of grandmother?

174
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:52,280
The color of her face immediately changed.

175
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:58,100
Once I put my mind to
something, I do it for sure.

176
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:03,834
That seems true. You're very thick-skinned.

177
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:10,274
If you keep me nearby and use
me, it'll be worthwhile.

178
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:13,001
I'm very much indebted.

179
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:16,879
We must stop Jung Hae-dang
from becoming part of

180
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:19,645
this family, at least for
my brother-in-law's sake.

181
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:22,173
- Your brother-in-law?
- I'm talking about Kyung-soo.

182
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:27,141
I want to live at least one day like you.

183
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:31,782
- Is that a compliment?
- No, it's admiration.

184
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:40,048
What will you do if Kyung-soo
keeps insisting he'll do music?

185
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,009
- At times like this, you're very naive.
- I am?

186
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:52,899
As expected, you're lacking 2%.
That's the problem with you.

187
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:59,790
However, unexpectedly enough,
I'll make a good team with you.

188
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:03,926
- Why?
- Because both of us are in a situation where

189
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,016
we won't accomplish
anything if we do nothing.

190
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:12,048
- Are you scaring me?
- I'm giving you a chance to decide.

191
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:16,220
Then there should be no further questions.

192
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,329
In my position, of course I
choose Hyun-sung over Hyun-joon.

193
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:23,626
Thank you.

194
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:27,977
Then I'll prepare the
Vietnamese spring rolls now.

195
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:37,891
Fine. Do your best to take Hae-dang down.

196
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,704
Once she's gone, I'll
take care of you next.

197
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:48,376
There's only one way to solve this.

198
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:53,774
- We need to get your father hitched.
- What? Bong-soo!

199
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:57,428
My mother is a woman, so she
can live alone even when she's

200
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,960
old, but it's too pitiful for
your father to live by himself.

201
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:02,431
Are you serious?

202
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,681
Come on. You need to
consider this sincerely.

203
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:09,907
These days, if you're sixty-one years old,
you're considered to be in your youth.

204
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:14,673
Wait a minute. Is there a
gentle widowed lady somewhere?

205
00:18:14,954 --> 00:18:19,282
This is definitely your way of thinking.

206
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:27,227
- Here.
- Oh, yes.

207
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:35,751
- Um... father.
- Yes?

208
00:18:36,744 --> 00:18:38,634
What kind of women do you like?

209
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,499
What are you suddenly talking about?

210
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:43,205
Who is your ideal woman
among the celebrities?

211
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:47,798
- You're talking strange.
- What if you had to pick someone?

212
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:52,415
I don't know who's on TV these days.

213
00:18:52,884 --> 00:18:55,817
Then what about among the old celebrities?

214
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:59,806
New or old, I don't have any
interest in celebrities.

215
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:06,079
Then is the lady who owns the hangover soup
restaurant at the intersection a widow?

216
00:19:06,642 --> 00:19:09,548
What is it that you want to say?

217
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:13,641
- You're lonely, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

218
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:17,235
- You need to be lonely.
- How could I be lonely?

219
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:22,196
- Why are you yelling at me?
- Why are you being ridiculous while we're drinking?

220
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:25,915
Oh, all right! Just drink! My goodness.

221
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,159
Did you tell me to try and get out of it?

222
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:38,266
Fine. You should do your best to
make sure I can't get out of it.

223
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:41,494
So you're going to keep up this
up until the end, aren't you?

224
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:43,801
In the end, it's all about the evidence.

225
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:47,142
Making sure I can't get
out of it is evidence.

226
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:51,579
Arranging a way to get out
of it is evidence, too.

227
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:02,717
Her son has the crucial letter that
could be a clue to mom's death.

228
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:05,972
- Are you serious?
- Father knows that fact.

229
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:26,236
- Hello.
- Mrs. Sung told me to come.

230
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:29,509
- Aren't you going to say hi to me?
- Hello.

231
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,940
You should say hello when you meet someone.

232
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,298
- Did your parents teach you such awful manners?
- Sorry?

233
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,376
Grandmother, Hae-dang is here!

234
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:45,900
Of course, I'm not happy that you were in a
deep relationship with another man before.

235
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:50,080
However, I decided to trust
Hyun-joon's decision.

236
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:57,775
- Thank you.
- You should gratefully accept his love.

237
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:01,228
I'll keep that in mind.

238
00:21:01,596 --> 00:21:05,397
Did you say your sister died
in a car accident while Yoo

239
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:08,820
Ji-na was trying to stop
you from marrying her son?

240
00:21:10,822 --> 00:21:14,509
- Yes.
- Then you two must have loved each other.

241
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,483
Isn't that why such an accident happened?
Because you two loved

242
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:22,016
each other so much that even
she couldn't separate you two?

243
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:26,646
I have no intention of letting
Kyung-soo live in our house.

244
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:31,119
You don't have to worry about putting
up with him as your brother-in-law.

245
00:21:32,986 --> 00:21:36,408
However, the important thing is your heart.

246
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:41,134
Are you completely over Lee Kyung-soo?

247
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:48,345
There's a problem if you're not over Kyung-soo
but you're going to marry Hyun-joon.

248
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:55,164
If you're completely over Kyung-soo and
decided to accept Hyun-joon's love,

249
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,353
bring me the letter that Kyung-soo has.

250
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:04,744
- Letter?
- If you love Hyun-joon, you can do it.

251
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:17,939
Why are you glaring at her?
How dare you glare at her?

252
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:22,658
She's about to become Hyun-joon's wife.

253
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:26,595
She's the crown princess who
is about to become a queen.

254
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:34,306
- Don't you dare belittle her.
- I'm the one who is Park Sung-hwan's wife.

255
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:38,595
According to your analogy,
the current queen is me!

256
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:43,595
Queen, my foot. You're
merely the second wife.

257
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:50,705
To be more specific, you're the royal
concubine who has never been a queen before.

258
00:22:54,682 --> 00:22:57,330
- Apologize to her.
- For what?

259
00:22:57,604 --> 00:23:01,306
Apologize to her for your existence.

260
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,963
For my existence?

261
00:23:08,814 --> 00:23:13,197
I'm not the one who troubled
others by existing. It's her!

262
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:17,876
Who are you to cause the deaths of
two people and not even apologize?

263
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:22,806
No such law exists on earth!

264
00:23:24,189 --> 00:23:30,606
That's between Hae-dang and me. It's not
something for you to be angered by.

265
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:34,986
Really? Then don't get angry
about what I'm about to do next.

266
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:44,291
Take this to Kyung-soo in the annex.

267
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:52,587
- I'll go.
- No. Hae-dang, you go.

268
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,345
Where do you think you're going?

269
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:02,525
Why? Why are you getting angry about?

270
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:05,728
I'm sending her on an errand
to tell him something.

271
00:24:06,682 --> 00:24:09,923
Go and take your time talking to him.

272
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:49,166
Hae-dang, what are you doing here?

273
00:24:49,885 --> 00:24:51,814
Is playing the piano all
you do the entire day?

274
00:24:57,493 --> 00:25:02,791
Are you composing a song? It doesn't
seem like classic music. Is it a song?

275
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:07,884
I just compose whatever I
can think of as a hobby.

276
00:25:10,502 --> 00:25:15,759
Mrs. Sung gave Hyun-joon and me
permission again to get married.

277
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:22,291
Really? That's great.

278
00:25:32,385 --> 00:25:35,220
What is that old hag up to?

279
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,697
She wants to torment you.

280
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:44,759
You become furious at the mere sight
of Kyung-soo and Hae-dang together.

281
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:53,876
The benefactor you were talking about
before was Hyun-joon's mother, wasn't it?

282
00:25:57,533 --> 00:25:59,572
Mrs. Sung told me.

283
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,220
So did she tell you to
bring her the letter?

284
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:15,416
This is the kind of family where you'll
be used if you don't use someone.

285
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:21,556
I'm being blackmailed by Mr.
Park with Ji-na as a hostage.

286
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:29,400
You're being blackmailed by Mrs.
Sung with Hyun-joon as a hostage.

287
00:26:32,213 --> 00:26:36,134
How did you and I end up in such a family?

288
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:44,744
How did we end up meeting again
in this kind of relationship?

289
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,361
I'm sorry.

290
00:26:50,564 --> 00:26:53,024
Park Hyun-joon told me...

291
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:57,265
that the time for me to pick

292
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:04,783
between Yoo Ji-na and you is approaching.

293
00:27:06,088 --> 00:27:07,088
Kyung-soo...

294
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:14,314
So did you come to ask me for the letter?

295
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:21,189
That means Mr. Park might
be the culprit, right?

296
00:27:32,424 --> 00:27:35,396
- What did you two talk about?
- I was running an errand for Mrs. Sung.

297
00:27:35,544 --> 00:27:37,681
So what errand was it?

298
00:27:38,627 --> 00:27:39,940
Why should I tell you?

299
00:27:39,964 --> 00:27:42,400
Are you saying you have Mrs.
Sung in the palm of your hand?

300
00:27:43,322 --> 00:27:46,423
Do you think someone like you can
get married into this family?

301
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:51,863
- Yoo Ji-na did it. So why can't Yoo G-na do it?
- What?

302
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:55,468
What's so different between you being loved

303
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:58,525
by Mr. Park and me being
loved by Hyun-joon?

304
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:01,166
You're playing Hyun-joon's wife already.

305
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:05,803
On top of that, I'm going to have
the fate of your life in my hands.

306
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,704
What? What do you mean?

307
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,767
And it's all thanks to your son.

308
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:17,212
He'll end up putting your fate in my hands.

309
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:23,743
Life is profound and mysterious.

310
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,454
Of course, I couldn't
end up loving your son,

311
00:28:28,892 --> 00:28:32,955
but thanks to him, I'm going to end
up having your fate in my hands.

312
00:28:53,346 --> 00:28:55,072
What on earth is she talking about?

313
00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:01,181
You're the one who dragged Hae-dang
and me into this complicated house.

314
00:29:01,564 --> 00:29:03,267
I dragged her here?

315
00:29:03,502 --> 00:29:06,478
Like I said before, I wished
for both of your happiness.

316
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:11,689
I wished you to be happy with Mr. Park
and Hae-dang to be happy with Hyun-joon.

317
00:29:12,532 --> 00:29:15,032
I thought everything would
be okay if I endured it.

318
00:29:15,283 --> 00:29:17,447
Why would you wish for her happiness?

319
00:29:18,143 --> 00:29:21,908
However, I don't think this
family will allow me to do that.

320
00:29:22,478 --> 00:29:25,955
In the end, I'll have to end
up taking someone's side.

321
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:32,956
- What?
- It's like you put your fate into Hae-dang's hands yourself.

322
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,900
So what on earth are you talking about?

323
00:29:35,197 --> 00:29:38,853
Do you think I'll be able to
go against her in any moment?

324
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
What?

325
00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:01,199
Oh, this feels great. My goodness.

326
00:30:03,744 --> 00:30:05,861
You have very skillful hands.

327
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:09,869
This feels very nice. You can stop now.
Your hands will hurt.

328
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,134
No, I'll do it for you a bit longer.

329
00:30:14,205 --> 00:30:16,275
Jung Hae-dang, I need to speak to you.

330
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:20,830
Why do you keep wanting to talk to her?
She didn't come to see you.

331
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,885
Didn't you hear me say I
need to speak to you?

332
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:28,859
From now on, even if she talks to
you, don't fraternize with her.

333
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:59,643
You must be burning up inside again.

334
00:31:01,955 --> 00:31:03,877
If you keep getting angry
every time she rubs

335
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:05,906
salt on your wounds, your
lifespan will shorten.

336
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,280
You just need to ignore it.

337
00:31:07,757 --> 00:31:10,928
I don't care about
anything else, but I just

338
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,980
can't stand seeing her protecting Hae-dang.

339
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:23,358
Did you want to speak to me?

340
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:29,030
How can you talk to your future
mother-in-law that way? That's very crude.

341
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:36,741
- Mother, would you like me to prepare coffee?
- Yes.

342
00:31:37,217 --> 00:31:40,859
Mother, please take a seat.
Sit down and talk.

343
00:31:47,592 --> 00:31:49,992
Forget about coffee. Leave us alone.

344
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,381
As you wish, mother.

345
00:31:59,632 --> 00:32:01,881
What do you mean my fate is in your hands?

346
00:32:02,394 --> 00:32:05,405
- If you're curious, ask Kyung-soo.
- I asked you what you meant!

347
00:32:06,616 --> 00:32:08,181
Mrs. Sung is in the living room.

348
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:10,749
Is it okay for you to be
raising your voice like this?

349
00:32:10,773 --> 00:32:14,858
So you're going to keep acting up
with your faith in that old hag, huh?

350
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:18,983
Would it feel better if I tell you I'm going
to act up with my faith in Kyung-soo?

351
00:32:19,592 --> 00:32:24,202
- What?
- I'm going to end you with my own hands.

352
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:28,764
I'll end you very slowly.

353
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:35,061
I'm going to watch you
slowly crumble and fall.

354
00:32:35,507 --> 00:32:40,545
- Jung Hae-dang.
- In the end, you're going to be doomed in front of my eyes.

355
00:32:42,686 --> 00:32:44,694
Are you done talking?

356
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:47,217
How dare you raise your voice at her!

357
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,006
You've barely been stripped from
your title as Mr. Park's mistress.

358
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,586
How dare you glare at the one who is going
to become the eldest lady of the household?

359
00:32:57,249 --> 00:32:58,451
Lower your eyes at once!

360
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:04,155
Did you come in here because
you needed something?

361
00:33:04,288 --> 00:33:07,826
No. I came in here because I was
worried about you. Let's go out.

362
00:33:35,655 --> 00:33:40,076
Why have you been sitting there so stiffly?

363
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,618
Mother, when you talk
to my dad nowadays, why

364
00:33:44,642 --> 00:33:47,866
don't you formally address him as Mr.
Jung anymore?

365
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:53,474
- What?
- Other people will see you two and think you two are candid in-laws.

366
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:57,397
- Who will see us?
- Someone is bound to see you two.

367
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:07,873
All right. I'll make sure to
formally address him from now on.

368
00:34:12,795 --> 00:34:18,420
Bong-soo, get a studio for your
sister and me to move into.

369
00:34:19,382 --> 00:34:21,725
What are you suddenly...?

370
00:34:21,749 --> 00:34:24,527
She's behaving like this because
a strange rumor is going around.

371
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,600
So get a studio for Bong-sun
and me to move into.

372
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,608
- Bong-sun makes money.
- She doesn't make much.

373
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:36,147
She makes enough to pay for the
studio rent and living expenses.

374
00:34:37,272 --> 00:34:40,725
You want us to pay for the rent and living
expenses with the small amount she makes?

375
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,383
If you do that, Bong-soo and I will do help
out when we have some more money later on.

376
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:48,139
Are you kidding me?

377
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:51,312
Do you want me to live off
of my daughter working as a

378
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:53,440
housekeeper when I have my
son who has a decent job?

379
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,398
No one depends on the son anymore.

380
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:58,992
The child with the money to spare
will take care of the parent.

381
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:02,076
Money to spare? Does she look
like she has money to spare?

382
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:06,826
You don't necessarily need a lot of
money for the two of you to live on.

383
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:09,420
It's not like she has a child
who needs an education.

384
00:35:10,913 --> 00:35:14,217
Bong-soo, did you hear what she just said?
What do you think about it?

385
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,467
What do you think?

386
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,647
You're the one who first brought
up the topic of moving out.

387
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:27,092
W-What...?

388
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:33,444
- Where are you going in the middle of dinner?
- Mom!

389
00:35:34,475 --> 00:35:37,444
- Wait!
- Mr. Jung Kang-sik! Let me speak to you for a moment!

390
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:41,038
Yes? What can I do for you?

391
00:35:41,662 --> 00:35:46,819
There's a rumor going around
that you and I are dating!

392
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:50,959
- What?
- What do you think about that, Mr. Jung?

393
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:53,012
Who would say such a stupid thing?

394
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:56,624
I'm about to be kicked out
by my daughter-in-law!

395
00:35:56,648 --> 00:35:57,848
What's this about?

396
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:02,656
My finicky daughter-in-law
scolded me for acting

397
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,770
impolitely to you right
in front of my face!

398
00:36:09,116 --> 00:36:14,389
So are we dating? Have we dated before?
Are we going to date?

399
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:19,729
Oh my goodness! People have nothing
better to do than gossip about others!

400
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,706
Why would you get so angry
over such nonsense?

401
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:25,561
How could I not?

402
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:31,459
Although I have nowhere else to
stay but my son's in-laws' home...

403
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:37,295
how could they put me
with someone like you?

404
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:45,131
Are you crying because
you're upset about that?

405
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:47,631
I'm much better than you in
looks and everything else.

406
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:54,100
No matter how old and wrinkly I might be...

407
00:36:56,249 --> 00:37:00,303
Mom, are you really crying
because you're angry about that?

408
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:06,780
- Of course!
- Fine! Cry and be angry all you want! Let her cry!

409
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:10,280
My goodness! You must have nothing
else to cry about! Sheesh!

410
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:17,108
I'm about to become offended, too! Ha!

411
00:37:24,335 --> 00:37:25,335
Mom!

412
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,092
Wow. As expected from our mom...

413
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:31,061
How could she say that in this situation?

414
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,186
She's so cute!

415
00:37:35,374 --> 00:37:40,295
- How could you laugh right now?
- She's so cute at her age!

416
00:37:43,014 --> 00:37:44,389
My goodness.

417
00:37:54,132 --> 00:37:55,694
Why are you suddenly getting up?

418
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,210
My goodness!

419
00:38:02,858 --> 00:38:05,819
It's because fire is raging inside of me!

420
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,350
Why?

421
00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:12,216
Baek Mi-sook has always
had a knack of looking

422
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,506
down on people ever since we were little.

423
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:20,272
Dad, do her words make you that angry for
fire to be raging inside your chest?

424
00:38:20,413 --> 00:38:23,061
Of course!

425
00:38:24,374 --> 00:38:26,107
What's so great about her?

426
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:28,327
She has unrealistically high standards!

427
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:32,475
I was being nice to her because we were
in-laws when there's nothing good about her!

428
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:35,941
Dad, are you really that furious?

429
00:38:36,538 --> 00:38:39,795
Of course I'm furious! Why wouldn't I be?

430
00:38:47,044 --> 00:38:48,983
Our dad must be really furious, too.

431
00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:52,178
It's not like they're
little kids or something.

432
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:55,428
To be honest, isn't it true
that our mom is more valuable?

433
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:59,295
- What?
- My mom was extremely beautiful when she was younger.

434
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:03,967
- My dad was handsome, too.
- I can't imagine that.

435
00:39:05,288 --> 00:39:06,998
Go to the room and bring me the album.

436
00:39:07,249 --> 00:39:10,716
Excuse you. He was a pretty
boy when he was younger.

437
00:39:11,272 --> 00:39:15,656
Pretty boy might be exaggerating, but he
didn't lose in the looks department anywhere.

438
00:39:16,983 --> 00:39:22,959
- I guess so. His looks aren't the flaws.
- Then what are his flaws?

439
00:39:22,983 --> 00:39:26,851
- To be honest, isn't he lacking?
- What is he lacking in?

440
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:29,710
Everyone is somewhat lacking.

441
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:33,045
Even though he may be lacking,
he's not as lacking as you are.

442
00:39:34,077 --> 00:39:38,108
You have nothing else to retort with,
so now you're deviating from the topic.

443
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:41,258
Hae-jin, hold it in. Because
of those groundless

444
00:39:41,282 --> 00:39:43,960
rumors, he's rebelling for no good reason.

445
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:47,031
Yeon Bong-soo, are you a teenager?
What's wrong with you?

446
00:39:47,055 --> 00:39:49,350
It's not like you're at the
stage of rebellion right now.

447
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:52,444
Should we just use this chance
to hook them up together?

448
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:56,999
- You're crazy!
- What are you talking about?

449
00:39:57,023 --> 00:39:58,913
- I was joking!
- What are you talking about?

450
00:39:58,937 --> 00:40:01,725
- What's wrong with you?
- I was joking! I'm sorry!

451
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:05,194
I don't think that's a bad idea either.

452
00:40:05,991 --> 00:40:09,608
- Bong-sun!
- What? Are you going to slap my back, too?

453
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:15,893
- Bong-sun!
- Aren't I allowed to just imagine it?

454
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:18,835
Don't imagine it! Don't even imagine it!

455
00:40:19,038 --> 00:40:23,084
I don't want anyone to even imagine it!
I don't! I really don't!

456
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,981
Doesn't my brother drive you nuts?

457
00:40:30,624 --> 00:40:33,058
How could he be acting
like that at his age?

458
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:52,076
- Do you need something?
- Give me a cup of coffee, if there's any.

459
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:18,287
I discovered the reason why grandmother
had sent Hae-dang to the annex.

460
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:22,804
Why?

461
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:28,686
Kyung-soo, I mean my
brother-in-law, has the letter.

462
00:41:28,943 --> 00:41:32,467
Letter? What letter?

463
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:37,061
A letter that has to do
with my late mother-in-law.

464
00:41:37,882 --> 00:41:40,155
Are you serious?

465
00:41:46,155 --> 00:41:47,381
Who did you hear that from?

466
00:41:48,186 --> 00:41:50,975
Does Kyung-soo really have that letter?

467
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,135
He said he lost it, but I think he has it.

468
00:41:56,436 --> 00:41:59,921
Look straight into my eyes.

469
00:42:02,413 --> 00:42:03,772
I'm only going to ask you once.

470
00:42:05,335 --> 00:42:10,225
Did you... by any chance... kill your wife?

471
00:42:11,882 --> 00:42:14,725
Do you think that makes any sense?
No, I didn't.

472
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,420
Then why are you so
obsessed about that letter?

473
00:42:19,374 --> 00:42:25,108
Anyways, I must stop Hyun-joon
from receiving that letter.

474
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:47,514
- Do you really have such a letter?
- Who said that?

475
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:50,119
- Hand it over.
- I lost it.

476
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:52,858
No one believes that! Give it to me.

477
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,962
- I lost it.
- Are you crazy?

478
00:42:55,584 --> 00:42:59,373
- If you had such a letter, you should've
given it to me!- Do you think I'm crazy?

479
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:06,201
- Why would I give you that letter?
- Then you're going to give it to Hae-dang?

480
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,879
If you want it, tell Hae-dang
that you accept our love

481
00:43:10,295 --> 00:43:13,304
so that she can make up her
mind to run away with me.

482
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,756
- What?
- I can't let Hae-dang stay in this family.

483
00:43:18,335 --> 00:43:21,327
They're family, but they use
each other, and if you don't

484
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:24,186
want to use anyone, you'll
be the one who becomes used.

485
00:43:25,788 --> 00:43:29,254
Mr. Park is accused of killing
his wife, and his sons treat

486
00:43:29,278 --> 00:43:32,358
their father as if he's a
murderer who killed their mom.

487
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:35,225
On top of that, Mrs. Sung is
out to make her son into a

488
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,218
murderer when he might be
innocent in order to destroy him.

489
00:43:41,155 --> 00:43:44,897
This is a crazy family.
It's a cursed family.

490
00:43:45,538 --> 00:43:47,608
I can't allow Hae-dang to
live with such a family.

491
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:50,209
So what are you planning to do?

492
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:53,811
Since you love conglomerates
so much, you can stay here.

493
00:43:54,444 --> 00:43:58,514
I'm going to give up that letter
and run away with Hae-dang.

494
00:43:58,882 --> 00:44:03,131
You can't. You can't do that.
I said you can't!

495
00:44:03,155 --> 00:44:05,905
I thought I would be able to
forget her if I put my mind to it!

496
00:44:06,694 --> 00:44:07,694
However...

497
00:44:10,554 --> 00:44:12,623
what am I supposed to do
when I can't forget her.

498
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,030
What?

499
00:44:23,788 --> 00:44:28,178
Mrs. Sung is trying to get
that letter through Hae-dang.

500
00:44:29,741 --> 00:44:33,124
- What do you think about that? -
- Did you really lose the letter?

501
00:44:33,325 --> 00:44:36,272
Whether I lost it or not, why would
you drag Hae-dang into this mess?

502
00:44:39,663 --> 00:44:43,730
I can't allow her to be used for
your family's messy affairs.

503
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:49,537
Once she gets used, she'll
continue to be used.

504
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:54,201
Do you even have the
confidence to protect her?

505
00:44:56,632 --> 00:44:59,826
- If you don't, tell me.
- What do you mean tell you?

506
00:45:01,725 --> 00:45:04,873
If I say I don't have the
confidence, what will you do?

507
00:45:08,788 --> 00:45:12,559
Did you give permission for Hae-dang
and me to get married for that reason?

508
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:20,162
She's going to have to choose a side when
she becomes part of this family anyways.

509
00:45:22,007 --> 00:45:25,725
Did you bring her here
without preparing for that?

510
00:45:25,944 --> 00:45:28,053
I want to let her live in peace.

511
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,750
- That can't happen.
- Why not?

512
00:45:31,397 --> 00:45:35,709
If you want that, you need to forgive
your father first. You don't want to?

513
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:43,225
Then your wife-to-be won't
be able to live in peace.

514
00:45:43,389 --> 00:45:46,873
- How can I forgive him?
- If you can't forgive him, you should overcome him.

515
00:45:47,397 --> 00:45:51,537
My pride as a man won't
allow Hae-dang to be used.

516
00:45:51,804 --> 00:45:54,866
Your father isn't someone you
can win against so easily.

517
00:45:55,374 --> 00:45:59,522
You can't win against him while
keeping onto your pride.

518
00:45:59,942 --> 00:46:03,280
If you can neither forgive nor overcome
him, what do you think will happen?

519
00:46:04,288 --> 00:46:06,084
It will be over for you.

520
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:12,334
Hae-dang chose you for her revenge anyways.

521
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:17,959
To need someone is the most trustworthy and

522
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:21,411
logical way to be intertwined with someone.

523
00:46:21,663 --> 00:46:26,348
I didn't tell her I loved her because I
wanted to use her for a battle of wits.

524
00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:33,631
If you don't do anything, your father
will take the side of a total stranger.

525
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:41,131
How dare you whine about love when
you're born as Park Sung-hwan's son?

526
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:53,108
- Mom, I'm home.
- Oh, what are you doing here at this time?

527
00:46:53,913 --> 00:46:55,920
The lady of the house said
she has guests coming

528
00:46:55,944 --> 00:46:57,828
in the afternoon and told
me to go home early.

529
00:46:57,852 --> 00:46:59,399
She paid me for the full day though.

530
00:46:59,423 --> 00:47:01,929
- That's great. You didn't eat lunch yet, right?
- Yeah.

531
00:47:02,076 --> 00:47:03,194
I should make more noodles.

532
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:05,506
- I'm going to change.
- Sure.

533
00:47:19,249 --> 00:47:22,100
Mr. Jung, come upstairs
and have some noodles.

534
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:28,021
No, thanks. I'm just going to
soak my rice in water and eat it.

535
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:32,998
- We made noodles.
- I said I'm okay. A simple lunch is good enough for me.

536
00:47:34,123 --> 00:47:37,456
- Then should I bring it downstairs?
- Forget it.

537
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:52,279
- He's just going to eat rice with water.
- Fine.

538
00:47:53,069 --> 00:47:55,256
I said I would bring it
to him, but he said no.

539
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:59,459
Why would you take it to him? I'm going
to eat it all. You can eat more, too.

540
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:23,772
What are you up to, Mr. Jung?

541
00:48:25,249 --> 00:48:29,647
Can't you tell? I'm wiping the floor.

542
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:33,131
- Why didn't you come up to eat noodles?
- It's up to me.

543
00:48:33,374 --> 00:48:35,992
Are you really going to be so
embarrassing in front of the kids?

544
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:42,686
From now on, don't come down
here without a special reason.

545
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:50,295
- What?
- If you need to come down, call me before you do.

546
00:48:50,569 --> 00:48:51,803
Call you?

547
00:48:52,772 --> 00:48:57,023
"I ran out of soy sauce, so I'm coming to
get some. I'm coming to wipe the floor."

548
00:48:57,047 --> 00:48:59,959
- You want me to call you for every little thing?
- Yes, ma'am.

549
00:48:59,983 --> 00:49:03,366
It may be troublesome, but I'll be
thankful if you do that for me.

550
00:49:03,811 --> 00:49:07,795
Have a safe trip upstairs then.

551
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,960
Oh, my.

552
00:49:15,788 --> 00:49:19,319
Oh my goodness! That idiot!

553
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:34,280
Geez! No matter how much I think about
it, my mom will be the one at loss.

554
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:38,268
What do you mean?

555
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,528
- To be honest, does your father have anything?
- Why would you bring that up?

556
00:49:44,137 --> 00:49:48,464
- All she'll do as times goes on is look after your sick father.
- Don't you worry.

557
00:49:49,261 --> 00:49:52,511
You told us not to even imagine this,
so why are you working so specifically?

558
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:57,240
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- Your feelings were never right.

559
00:49:57,824 --> 00:50:01,057
- I think they will be right this time.
- That will never happen!

560
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:09,440
- Why have I never thought about it before?
- Thought about what?

561
00:50:10,855 --> 00:50:15,409
Why did I assume my mom would just
be single for the rest of her life?

562
00:50:18,535 --> 00:50:24,675
I should've found a good spouse for her
sooner when she was a day younger.

563
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:27,690
I'm starting to become really offended.

564
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:33,432
- Is my dad not a good spouse?
- To be honest, he's not that great.

565
00:50:34,339 --> 00:50:39,339
If you had met such a great step-father,
you would've been terribly mistreated.

566
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:43,330
- What?
- Your mother wouldn't have even dreamed of

567
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:46,027
remarrying just in case
you would be mistreated.

568
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,128
Then think of it this way.

569
00:50:50,503 --> 00:50:52,393
Let's say you're not
your father's daughter.

570
00:50:52,706 --> 00:50:55,202
In an objective point-of-view,
if your mother was

571
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:57,621
going to remarry, would
you like his conditions?

572
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,168
Would you want to push her
to get married to him?

573
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:06,034
- I wouldn't want to push her per Se...
- See.

574
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,212
I'd want her to get remarried
to someone who has some money

575
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:15,902
and a couple buildings he
could get rent money from.

576
00:51:16,605 --> 00:51:19,214
- That way, my life would be easier.
- See?

577
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:24,503
After thinking like that, my dad wouldn't
be able to find a partner like your mother.

578
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:26,167
I told you so.

579
00:51:26,277 --> 00:51:30,268
He doesn't have a son who can take
responsibility for him, half of his house is

580
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:34,331
from loans, he doesn't have any money, and
he doesn't have a great income either.

581
00:51:34,495 --> 00:51:36,636
See? That's reality.

582
00:51:37,831 --> 00:51:41,667
You're right. That's reality.

583
00:51:42,963 --> 00:51:46,932
Now that I think of it this way, I
don't need to get worked up over this.

584
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,393
Even in the worst situation,
we won't suffer much damage.

585
00:51:52,378 --> 00:51:54,597
- Then I should just sleep.
- What?

586
00:51:58,589 --> 00:52:03,065
Gosh, she's so annoying. She's
especially annoying today.

587
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:06,487
Geez!

588
00:52:08,362 --> 00:52:09,362
What the...?

589
00:52:11,597 --> 00:52:14,104
- What's wrong with you?
- Come on!

590
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:15,439
Get out!

591
00:52:20,644 --> 00:52:24,111
I didn't know my grandmother
would make you do that.

592
00:52:28,238 --> 00:52:33,956
I feel so bad that I dragged into
my family's complicated affairs.

593
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:38,351
Can you feel it?

594
00:52:39,128 --> 00:52:42,167
I'm fine, so don't feel too bad.

595
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,214
Kyung-soo was going nuts over it, but
I was too ashamed to say anything.

596
00:52:48,074 --> 00:52:49,675
It's not your fault.

597
00:52:50,995 --> 00:52:52,728
I'm so damn embarrassed...

598
00:52:53,432 --> 00:52:56,862
I realized that you
could've been very lonely.

599
00:52:58,527 --> 00:53:05,050
I felt like I could understand why you
like me when I'm nothing special.

600
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:12,182
I'm someone who lives with the thought that
my own father could've murdered my mom.

601
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,480
I know.

602
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:18,426
Could you even imagine
what that feels like?

603
00:53:19,925 --> 00:53:24,769
If I hadn't met you, I wouldn't have even
considered reconciling with the world.

604
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:27,950
Hyun-joon...

605
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:36,333
Even if I knew you were trying to use me,
I was happy to be getting married to you.

606
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:44,082
Don't worry. I can't leave someone first.
You know how foolish I am.

607
00:53:55,356 --> 00:53:58,981
You can never leave me first, okay?

608
00:54:01,841 --> 00:54:03,153
That won't happen.

609
00:54:23,442 --> 00:54:24,840
Life is profound and mysterious.

610
00:54:25,856 --> 00:54:29,012
Of course, I couldn't end up
loving your son, but thanks

611
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:34,521
to him, I'm going to end up
having your fate in my hands.

612
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:48,715
- Why are you drinking so much?
- I'm going to really lose my mind at this rate.

613
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:52,949
Is there a way I'll be able
to live without seeing her?

614
00:54:54,614 --> 00:54:58,677
Unless we were enemies in our previous life,
how could we become tangled up like this?

615
00:54:59,356 --> 00:55:00,809
You're frustrated, aren't you?

616
00:55:04,145 --> 00:55:05,598
I'm up to my limits.

617
00:55:07,169 --> 00:55:09,825
I get furious just hearing
the name Jung Hae-dang.

618
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:16,309
I'm afraid I won't be
able to control myself.

619
00:55:18,692 --> 00:55:20,606
You should cool down.

620
00:55:21,513 --> 00:55:23,309
Do you want to go shopping
with me tomorrow?

621
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:26,395
Shopping is the best way
to distract yourself.

622
00:55:41,815 --> 00:55:44,895
This will really suit you.

623
00:55:46,497 --> 00:55:47,910
You should pick one, too.

624
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,848
All I do is stay home and
do the housework anyways.

625
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,731
It's not like I do something special.
We're in the same boat.

626
00:55:54,035 --> 00:55:58,106
Still, we came out today to cheer you up.

627
00:56:03,364 --> 00:56:08,012
Oh my goodness! You look like a goddess!
You're beautiful!

628
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:11,270
- Really?
- You should just wear this.

629
00:56:12,177 --> 00:56:15,019
- Please wrap up the clothes that I wore.
- Yes, ma'am.

630
00:56:15,802 --> 00:56:18,551
It's such a waste to go home
when you're dressed so nicely.

631
00:56:19,434 --> 00:56:21,793
Should we stop by the gallery
and look at some paintings?

632
00:56:23,363 --> 00:56:24,363
Should we?

633
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,364
Do you like this one?

634
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:35,965
I was thinking of changing
the painting by the door.

635
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:39,739
That one is calm but too dark.

636
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:42,160
It's my late mother-in-law's taste.

637
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,895
- Let's change the painting.
- You should look around some more.

638
00:56:55,536 --> 00:56:56,536
Oh! Cheol!

639
00:56:59,106 --> 00:57:02,870
Oh, come on. If you saw me, you
should say hi. It's been a long time.

640
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:05,075
I heard you opened up a law office.

641
00:57:05,341 --> 00:57:08,062
Wow. You're the same as ever.
You haven't changed at all.

642
00:57:09,047 --> 00:57:11,509
Oh, say hello to my mother-in-law.

643
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:14,743
She's not a new face, is she?

644
00:57:15,916 --> 00:57:17,318
I'm Im Cheol-woo.

645
00:57:19,033 --> 00:57:22,962
- Who is he?- He's my friend from church.

646
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:27,188
Both our colleges were in Sinchon, so
we were in the same union circles.

647
00:57:27,783 --> 00:57:30,509
Is that so? Do you know who I am?

648
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:35,236
Of course. Is there anyone who was born in
South Korea who doesn't know Yoo Ji-na?

649
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:39,282
I was a fan of you since college. I
went to your concerts often as well.

650
00:57:39,572 --> 00:57:41,400
- Really?
- Yes.

651
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,601
Once, I had even seriously considered
becoming a producer so that I could see you.

652
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:49,533
It's an honor.

653
00:57:51,095 --> 00:57:52,907
- Did you get married?
- No, not yet.

654
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:57,806
I'll officially say hello.
It's an honor to meet you.

655
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,165
I'll see you next time, Mrs.
Yoo. See you next time.

656
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:14,454
- Next time when?
- I'll call you.

657
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,157
How can I trust you? Buy us tea.

658
00:58:17,853 --> 00:58:19,455
I'm supposed to meet someone here today.

659
00:58:20,235 --> 00:58:23,435
- You're as popular as ever.
- Have a good time.

660
00:58:34,228 --> 00:58:35,868
He's a very smart style, isn't he?

661
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:50,923
Why isn't father coming out?

662
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:07,954
I was just coming to get you. The meat
is almost done. Hurry up, mother.

663
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:12,142
Did you decide to call her "mother" now?

664
00:59:12,634 --> 00:59:15,701
Of course I should. I'll
go bring grandmother.

665
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,698
If you use her to your advantage, she'll be

666
00:59:25,238 --> 00:59:27,634
functional, but she can be
dangerous, so be careful.

667
00:59:28,572 --> 00:59:29,572
I know that.

668
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,618
My eyes are stinging. Maybe
it's because of the smoke.

669
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:35,908
Let me see.

670
00:59:40,845 --> 00:59:42,782
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

671
00:59:53,486 --> 00:59:56,876
She keeps lingering in front of
him, so how could he forget her?

672
00:59:58,642 --> 01:00:02,126
I have no idea why your mother
is going to allow her to become

673
01:00:02,624 --> 01:00:05,423
her granddaughter-in-law when she
was about to marry Kyung-soo.

674
01:00:06,986 --> 01:00:09,860
Your mother is someone who is even
displeased with Na-kyung's family.

675
01:00:10,869 --> 01:00:16,136
There has to be an ulterior motive for
the way she's easily accepting Hae-dang.

676
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:44,322
All right then. Let's enjoy our dinner.

677
01:00:45,357 --> 01:00:52,177
I'm feeling less stuffy now that
we're sitting out here in the yard.

678
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:56,982
- Hae-dang, eat a lot.
- You, too.

679
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,536
Here. Let's make a toast.

680
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:20,489
When are you going to let
Hyun-joon work in the company?

681
01:01:22,224 --> 01:01:25,740
- Do you want to work in the company?
- Yes.

682
01:01:26,138 --> 01:01:27,138
Then wait.

683
01:01:28,232 --> 01:01:30,911
Wait for what? Are there no positions?

684
01:01:32,005 --> 01:01:36,115
What I mean is that I will find a proper
position after I see how he acts.

685
01:01:36,795 --> 01:01:38,044
After you see how he acts?

686
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:44,013
He's going to learn work under Hae-sung.
He doesn't need to wait for a position.

687
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:46,732
When will you let him come to work?

688
01:01:47,521 --> 01:01:50,607
- Kyung-soo, eat a lot.
- Sung-hwan!

689
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:55,599
- Yes, mother.
- What do you think you're doing?

690
01:01:57,271 --> 01:01:58,997
How dare you cut off my words!

691
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,357
Kyung-soo, get up and go
to the annex right now.

692
01:02:04,129 --> 01:02:07,380
What are you doing? Kyung-soo
is part of this family, too.

693
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:10,092
Why are you suddenly telling him to leave?

694
01:02:10,116 --> 01:02:13,372
Get up and go to the annex right now.
Didn't you hear me?

695
01:02:16,474 --> 01:02:17,674
I'll be going now.

696
01:02:18,146 --> 01:02:20,396
- Stay seated.
- Stand up!

697
01:02:21,545 --> 01:02:24,602
Mother, why are you insisting
on making the girl who was

698
01:02:24,626 --> 01:02:27,360
about to marry Kyung-soo
your granddaughter-in-law?

699
01:02:27,513 --> 01:02:30,872
I said it doesn't matter!
They're not brothers!

700
01:02:31,334 --> 01:02:33,779
Do you think he'll become your
son just because you insist?

701
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:40,286
Hyun-joon, don't you even dare think
of coming anywhere near my company.

702
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:45,982
Why would you tell your eldest son that?
What kind of nonsense is this?

703
01:02:46,185 --> 01:02:48,115
I'm not the only one
saying nonsense right now!

704
01:02:48,427 --> 01:02:51,166
You're going to push your sons
who are almost turning forty

705
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:53,986
and put a stranger who isn't related
to you by blood in their spot?

706
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,583
You keep talking about being related by
blood, but why is that so important?

707
01:02:58,411 --> 01:03:01,944
Who cares if they're related to me by blood?
Just look at the way they act towards me!

708
01:03:01,968 --> 01:03:03,967
I don't need sons related
to me by blood anymore!

709
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:06,669
Kyung-soo, get up this instant
and get out of this house!

710
01:03:07,763 --> 01:03:08,763
Stay seated.

711
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:11,973
- Get out at once!
- Stay in your seat!

712
01:03:18,201 --> 01:03:20,208
Hae-dang, get up.

713
01:03:23,428 --> 01:03:24,857
What are you doing sitting here?

714
01:03:27,498 --> 01:03:29,435
I can't stand this family anymore.

715
01:03:30,865 --> 01:03:33,763
Get up and leave this house with me.

716
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:37,013
I don't need anything now.

717
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:41,724
Get up. Get up and leave this
house with me right now!

718
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:47,957
Lee Kyung-soo, what the hell do you
think you're doing in front of me?

719
01:03:49,162 --> 01:03:51,075
- What are you doing?
- Hae-dang!

720
01:03:52,442 --> 01:03:54,216
We shouldn't be here!

721
01:03:57,115 --> 01:03:58,115
Get up.

722
01:04:00,256 --> 01:04:04,068
Leave this house with me right now.

723
01:04:42,563 --> 01:04:45,165
("You Are Too Much")

724
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:47,631
I think the problem is Jung Hae-dang.

725
01:04:47,655 --> 01:04:51,092
She'd be able to gobble up ten
people like naive Kyung-soo.

726
01:04:51,116 --> 01:04:53,492
Even if she eats them up for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner,

727
01:04:53,516 --> 01:04:55,608
she's much better than you
who married for business.

728
01:04:55,632 --> 01:04:57,360
She told me not to come with her.

729
01:04:57,384 --> 01:04:59,108
Na-kyung, are you really going to do this?

730
01:04:59,132 --> 01:05:03,064
I'm going to use this to buy
Hae-dang a car and jewelries.

731
01:05:03,088 --> 01:05:06,426
Kyung-soo is going to start
studying business administration.

732
01:05:06,692 --> 01:05:10,082
Are you curious why I'm
mistreating your mom?

733
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:14,075
Cheol offered to buy us a meal.
Should I refuse?

734
01:05:14,099 --> 01:05:17,091
Still... he contacted us when he was busy.

735
01:05:17,115 --> 01:05:19,007
- She fell for it.
- Why are you so surprised?
