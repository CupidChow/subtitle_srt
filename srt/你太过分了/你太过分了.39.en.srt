(Episode 39)

3
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:22,391
Mother.

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,093
Call my son.

5
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,539
Are you...awake?

6
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:38,007
Call my son. I have something to tell him.

7
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:41,500
Call my son.

8
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,393
Why are you so surprised?

9
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:08,398
It's nothing. What did the doctor say?

10
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,148
Because of her old age, it's dangerous for her to keep

11
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:17,390
being unconscious like this since there will be complications.

12
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,676
Hopefully, she'll wake up soon.

13
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:49,406
They say people of old age pass away when they go to the hospital.

14
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,217
I'm worried about you.

15
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,344
What do you mean?

16
00:01:56,477 --> 00:02:00,765
For your sake, I hope she wakes up as soon as possible.

17
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:08,923
What do you mean you're worried about me?

18
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:11,312
I'm saying it for your sake.

19
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:16,367
Park Hyun-joon is going crazy trying to find the clue of the incident.

20
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,593
What if things go wrong and you get imprisoned?

21
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:24,022
What? Why would I get imprisoned?

22
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:30,076
Since you're the child of your mother, she'll at least make an effort to get you out.

23
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:36,943
- She will. - But what do you think Hyun-joon and Hyun-sung are going to do?

24
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:41,209
They'll come up a non-existent crime and make you rot

25
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:44,279
in prison for the rest of your life. Isn't that true?

26
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,154
Then what do you want me to do?

27
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:49,990
We should declare Kyung-soo as your successor.

28
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:55,756
Are you telling me to transfer my shares to him?

29
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,850
When your mother passes away, who else do you have?

30
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:05,469
Kyung-soo would never betray anyone. You know that more than I do.

31
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:08,857
We can't guarantee that you'll be safe.

32
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:11,518
You need someone on your side who has power if

33
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:13,444
you're going to get out of an unsafe situation.

34
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:19,041
I'm asking you what you think about using this opportunity to finalize the successor.

35
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,795
For your sake, your mother has to live a long life.

36
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:34,631
- It's unreasonable to transfer my shares right now. - It's unreasonable?

37
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:39,170
Transferring company shares isn't such a simple task.

38
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,256
Do you want to rot in prison?

39
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:46,951
- Why would I rot in prison? - If you're unlucky, you'll rot there.

40
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,100
You're really...!

41
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:55,131
You'll only come to your senses when your sons make you shed tears of blood.

42
00:03:56,014 --> 00:03:59,990
Even though I rot in prison, I can't transfer all my shares right now.

43
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:02,842
Then why did you keep saying that you would transfer your shares?

44
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:06,225
I did it to crush Hyun-joon.

45
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:16,053
He kept boasting about how he would give everything to Kyung-soo.

46
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:19,443
I bet it's not easy to actually give up everything,

47
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,670
especially with that temper of his.

48
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,324
What do you think Hyun-joon and Hyun-sung are going to do?

49
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:33,191
They'll come up with a non-existent crime and

50
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:35,395
make you rot in prison for the rest of your life.

51
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:48,035
Did something happen at the studio with you that day?

52
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:56,051
What?

53
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,285
Why do you keep pestering me about the shares?

54
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:02,110
I can't believe you.

55
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:06,183
Aren't you doing it because everything is over for you once my mother wakes up?

56
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,996
- Honey. - Don't try to fool me.

57
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:11,293
Don't be ridiculous!

58
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:14,011
If my mother wakes up and I find out that

59
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,644
something happened between you and Cheol-woo,

60
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:21,066
you'll die in my hands.

61
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:25,043
- Why are you suddenly...? - You know my temper, don't you?

62
00:05:25,903 --> 00:05:29,097
- Honey. - I'll hire the greatest divorce lawyer in

63
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:33,316
this country and chase you out of here with nothing.

64
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:39,082
I said nothing happened! What's wrong with you? Why would you say that?

65
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:52,943
It looks like I won't be able to gain anything by bringing up the shares with him.

66
00:05:57,512 --> 00:06:03,269
"Till peonies bloom, I'll still wait for my spring to come.

67
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,394
When peonies drop laboriously their blossoms one by one,

68
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:10,707
I'll then be drowned in sorrows for my loss.

69
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:14,824
One day in May, as it was so hot and humid,

70
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:18,957
when even fallen blossoms were prostrate wilted,

71
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:23,949
Without a trace peonies vanished from this world

72
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,410
And had my soaring thrills..."

73
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,152
She won't even be able to hear you. So why the pathetic act?

74
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:40,824
She might be able to hear me.

75
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:44,316
Sitting here doing nothing is boring as well.

76
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:47,965
I'll stay here tonight, so go home and sleep.

77
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:51,774
What would people say if I don't even spend one

78
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:54,367
night at the hospital when I'm her daughter-in-law?

79
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:57,589
I'm fine, so go home and sleep.

80
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:59,355
I'm not fine with it.

81
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:03,566
Unless you want me to be cursed at, just do as I say.

82
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,558
"Without a trace peonies vanished from this world

83
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:17,573
And had my soaring thrills to sorrow twirled.

84
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,215
While peonies wither as they may, with them my year's all gone-"

85
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:26,897
Why are you speaking about peonies in the middle of summer? If I say go in, go in!

86
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,148
- Look here, Yoo Ji-na. - First you call me mother and now it's Yoo Ji-na.

87
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:35,538
It must take a lot of work to put up with the angel act.

88
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:38,492
If I tell you to go home, go home!

89
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:41,210
Lower your voice. This is the hospital.

90
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:42,679
Why aren't you going home?

91
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:45,249
Why are you glaring at me?

92
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:47,515
What kind of rash trick are you trying to pull?

93
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,734
This family's destiny depends on this.

94
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:54,617
What are you imagining about me?

95
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,078
If you don't want to be cursed at, then sit here and stay the night with me.

96
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:04,218
Let's spend the night talking about the old times.

97
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:18,296
- What's going on?- I think Mr. Park is suspecting me.

98
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:22,413
- Suspecting what? - Suspecting that you paid me to shut my mouth.

99
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:26,773
- What? - I think I got rashly involved in this.

100
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,137
Keep holding on.

101
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:33,343
Holding on isn't the problem.

102
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:37,562
If Mrs. Sung wakes up, I'm done for!

103
00:08:37,836 --> 00:08:42,765
You're about to be done for anyways, so you can't just sit here and do nothing.

104
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:50,804
- What are you talking about? - I'll give you five times the amount I gave you before.

105
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:57,398
As a matter of fact, it's all the cash I have.

106
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:03,093
That amount wouldn't be a loss, even if you gambled your life with it, would it?

107
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:10,632
We've got nothing to lose. If Mrs. Sung wakes up, it's over for you as well.

108
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,713
When will you give me the money and in what condition?

109
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:19,057
I'll give you 50% to start with.

110
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:21,916
We won't be able to do this without trusting each other anyways.

111
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:28,689
Would I risk my life, as lousy as it is, if the money isn't given 100% up front?

112
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,768
If you fail, will you return the money?

113
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:40,971
I could tell Mr. Park about your offer and be forgiven of my past sins.

114
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:43,346
What?

115
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:49,002
So you're being suspected right now?

116
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:52,650
I hastily told him to transfer his shares and got suspected.

117
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:55,033
You were trying to be smart with Mr. Park?

118
00:09:55,307 --> 00:10:00,104
I was trying to get him to transfer his shares to you before his mother woke up.

119
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:03,494
The game would be over then.

120
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:06,034
It's not like she'll wake up easily.

121
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,385
Why would you dig your own grave by being greedy?

122
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:13,846
While Mr. Park went to see the doctor, his mother had woken up for a moment.

123
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:19,962
- Really? - What will happen to us if she wakes up?

124
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:25,143
Call out Jung Hae-dang.

125
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:27,315
W-What?

126
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:32,025
She either stays in the hospital room herself or makes one of

127
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,518
her family members stay, just in case I might do something.

128
00:10:35,995 --> 00:10:40,939
- And? - Hae-dang will be at the hospital tonight.

129
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,862
Tell her you're at the hospital and call her out.

130
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:47,494
She'll come if you call her.

131
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:49,276
So what are you trying to do?

132
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:52,205
All you need to do is call her out.

133
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:54,510
Mr. Yoon...

134
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,260
will do everything else.

135
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:04,237
- You've lost your mind. - I may really have to lose my mind from now on.

136
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:12,286
- I lost my entire cash bribing Mr. Yoon. - What?

137
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:14,479
If his mother wakes up in this situation,

138
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,811
he'll hire the best divorce lawyer and take

139
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:20,020
everything I have, including the house I have left...

140
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:25,166
because the reason of divorce is my extramarital affair.

141
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:30,722
If that happens, I'll lose all the money I had made during my entire

142
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:34,143
lifetime after abandoning you, and we'll be chased out with nothing.

143
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:36,807
So why did you make things go this far?

144
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:43,182
Mrs. Sung just has to disappear.

145
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:48,299
Mr. Yoon won't be able to tell anyone about this anyways.

146
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:54,407
No way. Is that why you want me to call Hae-dang out of the hospital room?

147
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,409
Then what choice do I have?

148
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,705
I'm the wife of a CEO, and you're about to become the owner of the company.

149
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,885
Do you want me to lose all that and be chased out with nothing?

150
00:12:03,714 --> 00:12:05,114
This is ludicrous.

151
00:12:05,252 --> 00:12:09,113
It's even more ludicrous of me to live with you

152
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:12,917
using the tearful money Choi Kyung-ae gave you.

153
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:19,014
When that happens, I'll be fortunate if I go crazy.

154
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:23,369
If I'm not, I'll just stop living this wretched life.

155
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:27,143
- I can't do it. - You can't?

156
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:29,479
How could you drag your son into this?

157
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:30,815
Because...

158
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:34,057
you're the only one I have.

159
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,143
I can't. I can never do it.

160
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,502
Don't be ridiculous. I can't do it! I can't!

161
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:44,940
- Kyung-soo. - Don't touch me!

162
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:51,369
I'm terrified of you. You're not even human. You're not even human!

163
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:18,401
My mother loved her children, dramas, and cash.

164
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:24,823
I have a habit of thinking about something else whenever I think of her.

165
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:32,182
Thinking about her makes me miss her a lot, so I can't even bear to think about her.

166
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:40,557
I still miss her very much.

167
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:53,369
Hae-dang, I'm at the first floor of the hospital. Can you come down for a minute?

168
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:05,721
I can't leave my grandmother-in-law alone.

169
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:08,737
Why don't you just come up here instead?

170
00:14:24,354 --> 00:14:28,752
It's because it's too heartbreaking for me to see Mrs. Sung lying in bed like that.

171
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:32,252
Just come down and have a cup of coffee.

172
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:40,205
Grandmother, I'm going to go down for a bit.

173
00:14:40,784 --> 00:14:43,190
It won't take long, so you can be by yourself, can't you?

174
00:14:47,073 --> 00:14:48,073
Hae-dang.

175
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:52,542
Grandmother.

176
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:59,541
Grandmother, did you just call me? You called me just now, didn't you?

177
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:01,901
Grandmother, please wake up!

178
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:07,307
- Hae-dang. - Grandmother!

179
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:13,557
Are you serious? My grandmother woke up?

180
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:19,010
Hyun-sung, wake up! Grandmother woke up!

181
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:23,205
Really? Honey!

182
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:25,245
Hyun-joon...

183
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,948
Your mother in heaven helped us.

184
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:38,260
Father! Father!

185
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,823
Grandmother just regained consciousness!

186
00:15:45,604 --> 00:15:48,633
What are you standing there for? We must go to the hospital immediately!

187
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,535
- Should I call the chauffeur? - I can't wait until then. I can drive there myself.

188
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:00,688
Do you have anything to say?

189
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:04,580
You're really done for now.

190
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,166
Mother!

191
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:18,955
- Grandmother. - Mother.

192
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:21,768
Mother.

193
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:24,252
Why are you making such a fuss?

194
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:30,463
Mother, I was so worried you would just pass away like this!

195
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,948
Did you think I would die so easily?

196
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:42,174
You. Don't you have anything to say to me?

197
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:47,081
Don't you?

198
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:52,237
Grandmother, please calm down. The doctor said you had to have absolute rest.

199
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:53,573
Don't you worry.

200
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:57,119
Do you think I'll pass away with that vulgar thing in my house?

201
00:16:57,597 --> 00:17:01,205
Don't be ridiculous! Don't be ridiculous!

202
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:03,432
Why did you come here?

203
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,534
Did you come here to check with your own two eyes to make sure I was still alive?

204
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:13,635
Grandmother, I heard the whole story, so please don't worry and calm down.

205
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,385
That way, you'll discharge from the hospital soon.

206
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,151
What if your condition worsens because of your rage?

207
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,737
You're right. I've waited this long.

208
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:25,760
Why would I be in a hurry?

209
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:30,733
You. I'll see you at home.

210
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:49,034
- What is my mother talking about? - Hear it from her later.

211
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:51,290
Does it have to do with Im Cheol-woo?

212
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:54,881
What's the hurry? Just drive.

213
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:03,545
Do you remember how you said you would never

214
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,994
deny me in any situation before we got married?

215
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:17,760
Do you also remember how I told you I'm not a woman you can handle?

216
00:18:30,229 --> 00:18:32,940
So what the hell did you do with your faith in those words?

217
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,119
Just hear it from your mother.

218
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:43,682
I'm so glad! Okay! Bye!

219
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:48,619
- Hurrah! Hurrah! - Hey! What's going on?

220
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:51,049
Why are you yelling hurrah in the middle of the night?

221
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:54,940
Did you win the lottery?

222
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:57,493
Mrs. Sung woke up!

223
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:59,713
- What? Are you serious? - Yes!

224
00:19:00,276 --> 00:19:03,205
- The second floor! The second floor! - That's right! The second floor!

225
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:07,041
- Mrs. Baek! Hae-jin! Bong-soo! - Wake up, everyone! Come out here!

226
00:19:07,158 --> 00:19:10,120
- What's going on? - What happened?

227
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:11,893
What on earth is going on?

228
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:17,506
Mrs. Sung woke up! How could we sleep with this happy news to ourselves?

229
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,502
- Are you serious? - She woke up?

230
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,198
Hyun-joon called me just now.

231
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:28,815
Oh, thank heaven!

232
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,307
Hae-dang is saved now!

233
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:32,713
This is great!

234
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:38,724
- Hurrah! Hurrah! - Why do you keep saying that? It's so noisy!

235
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:41,940
- Does that mean you'll get the gas station now? - Honey!

236
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:46,385
Ouch! Ow! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

237
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:49,456
I really can't handle his beggar spirit!

238
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,893
How can you even think of gas station at this time?

239
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:56,659
What? Beggar's spirit? I know it's a joke, but how can you say that?

240
00:19:56,956 --> 00:20:03,487
Mom, that's not all. She said I have a dirt-poor beggar's spirit.

241
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:05,301
Dirt-poor? What's that?

242
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:09,688
A normal beggar eats food given to him, but a dirt-poor beggar minds

243
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:14,104
others while eating food off the ground. It's the lowest of all beggars.

244
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:17,651
- Jung Hae-jin! - Y-yes, mother?

245
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,588
You called my son a dirt-poor beggar?

246
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:23,923
- Come here! - I was just joking.

247
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:27,721
If you say that to others, it's a joke, but if you say that to him...

248
00:20:29,518 --> 00:20:33,198
it becomes a scar. Isn't that what he feels like?

249
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:37,322
Mom! Wait a minute. Why are you running over there?

250
00:20:37,347 --> 00:20:40,088
There are other people here, so why would you hide behind him?

251
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,229
It's because I'm trustworthy!

252
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:44,268
Father!

253
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,525
Grandmother said she doesn't like hospital food, so I made porridge.

254
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:55,627
They said we can give her porridge from home.

255
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,308
It's over, right?

256
00:21:03,604 --> 00:21:05,994
Ko Na-kyung, it's all your fault.

257
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:12,330
Whoever's fault it may be, you're done for now.

258
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:19,869
A mere celebrity like you ruined our family. Were you happy when I called you mother?

259
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:24,673
Even if I die, I'll drag you with me.

260
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:28,791
Did you say your specialty was crushing people like me?

261
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:34,721
Go and say those bullying comments at your playground.

262
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:43,049
Oh, wait. You can't even go on TV. It looks like you'll have to work at a cabaret.

263
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:46,385
Go ahead and glare at me all you want.

264
00:21:47,534 --> 00:21:50,854
There aren't many days left for you to be able to do that.

265
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:56,284
You're going to drag me to your death? Go ahead and try!

266
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:25,893
Cheers!

267
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:31,479
Tell your family we sincerely congratulate them.

268
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:33,862
Thanks to all of your concerns, all she has to

269
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:35,718
do is safely discharge from the hospital now.

270
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:39,455
- Thank you so much. - You don't have to thank us.

271
00:22:39,785 --> 00:22:42,385
You've especially worked hard, Mrs. Baek.

272
00:22:42,643 --> 00:22:47,198
- I did it so that Hae-dang won't be tired. - Thank you anyways.

273
00:22:48,386 --> 00:22:52,862
- Then are you getting your card back? - There you go with the money again.

274
00:22:54,954 --> 00:22:59,463
My grandmother wouldn't want her eldest grandson to be penniless.

275
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:01,174
Then what about the gas-

276
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,494
Why are you pinching me?

277
00:23:07,026 --> 00:23:08,737
Take it easy, please.

278
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:10,011
What did I do?

279
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:16,026
I suddenly thought of Chow Yun-fat. That was what I was going to say.

280
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:19,119
Why do you freak out every time you hear the words gas station?

281
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:22,988
Chow Yun-fat? Why do you suddenly think of him?

282
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:25,705
I suddenly think of him, too.

283
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:28,784
Right. Right.

284
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:34,627
- Why out of the blue? - That's because your face shape is somewhat similar to his.

285
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:39,237
You have a strong chin. If you had bigger eyes, you'd look exactly like Chow Yun-fat!

286
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:42,619
You're greasy like him, too.

287
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,510
I'm greasy?

288
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:48,440
Chow Yun-fat is going to cry!

289
00:23:49,276 --> 00:23:52,470
What's going on? I feel like there's an inside joke I don't know about.

290
00:23:52,495 --> 00:23:56,987
Nonsense! There's nothing going on! Drink up! Cheers!

291
00:23:57,012 --> 00:24:02,174
Anyways, it's a huge relief that Mrs. Sung woke up.

292
00:24:02,347 --> 00:24:05,508
To blessings for all of us!

293
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:08,031
We lost to you.

294
00:24:08,056 --> 00:24:14,165
- Cheers! Drink up! - Cheers!

295
00:24:14,696 --> 00:24:19,191
- Welcome back, grandmother! Are you okay now? - Yes.

296
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:22,321
She has to go to her bedroom and rest first.

297
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,485
Please give me one chance, mother!

298
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:34,532
I'm sorry! I have committed a grave sin!

299
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:36,954
You have committed a grave sin?

300
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:41,758
You wished for me to die, didn't you? Isn't that what you wished for?

301
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:47,060
Please give me one chance! If you do, I won't be

302
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:50,876
greedy, and I'll do everything you tell me to!

303
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:52,502
Please...

304
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:55,923
Please give me one chance!

305
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,798
I remember the first day I met you.

306
00:25:00,728 --> 00:25:08,126
Our long ill fate has come to an end at last.

307
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,767
I had a difficult time as well.

308
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:19,251
Yes. Were you tormented because of me?

309
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:25,822
I was literally about to die because of you.

310
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,173
You're worry? You have committed a grave sin?

311
00:25:33,978 --> 00:25:40,048
Please give me one chance!

312
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:42,994
You should at least keep your last pride.

313
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:46,025
It's humiliating to see!

314
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:18,337
Do you remember I said one of us has to leave this house?

315
00:26:20,486 --> 00:26:24,587
Don't be arrogant. The game isn't over yet.

316
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,550
Is that what you think?

317
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:31,454
It will be over soon. It won't take long.

318
00:26:32,455 --> 00:26:34,533
Ko Na-kyung isn't an easy woman.

319
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:40,126
She requested a video from Im Cheol-woo.

320
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:45,837
What will your husband's face look like when he sees that?

321
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:49,173
What did you say?

322
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,674
Do you remember how you said you would never

323
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,126
deny me in any situation before we got married?

324
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:10,212
Do you also remember how I told you I'm not a woman you can handle?

325
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:17,689
Hurry up! We're almost there!

326
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:22,220
How could I just barge into his house without letting him know about it first?

327
00:27:22,353 --> 00:27:25,181
It's fine! We don't care about such things.

328
00:27:25,206 --> 00:27:27,033
Still, this is wrong.

329
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,795
You said you wanted to meet my father-in-law again.

330
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:35,494
I do, but whenever I call him, he keeps telling me he's busy.

331
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:38,853
Is he not interested in me?

332
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:44,447
He is interested! He is overwhelmed with interest in you! He's just too shy.

333
00:27:44,978 --> 00:27:45,978
Really?

334
00:27:46,003 --> 00:27:52,072
And this is a secret, but in front of strange women, he gets hand tremor.

335
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:56,509
He's adjusting well to you though.

336
00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:59,025
- You mean it? - I do.

337
00:28:01,924 --> 00:28:05,111
- Wait a minute! - What is it now?

338
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:08,994
- The grandmother of his in-law's family is awake, right? - Yes, she's awake.

339
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:13,120
It's not far until a gas station falls out of the sky.

340
00:28:13,307 --> 00:28:16,829
Then I should put up with it, I guess, even though it's embarrassing.

341
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:27,270
She really is a moneylender. The real money-grubber here is her.

342
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:28,986
Come this way.

343
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:33,790
Father! Hae-sung! Hurry up and come out!

344
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:35,392
Come here.

345
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,025
She's the person from the photo...

346
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,751
- What is it? - Father!

347
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:44,475
What's going on?

348
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:47,283
What brings you here?

349
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:51,634
Oh, my. I should go change.

350
00:28:55,494 --> 00:28:57,298
It's nice to meet you. Please sit.

351
00:28:58,267 --> 00:29:00,150
How did you end up coming here out of the blue?

352
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,298
- Please wait here. - Hold it!

353
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:08,689
- You have a guest, so where are you going? - I need to tell Hae-jin to come down.

354
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:13,165
- Only Hae-jin, okay? - I'll see.

355
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:16,650
What do you mean you'll see? You'll cause trouble for no reason.

356
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:19,197
Is there someone you need to call from the second floor?

357
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:24,806
- My sister.  - Oh, Mr. Jung's second daughter who got married first?

358
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:27,711
- Yes. - Please wait here.

359
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:29,096
Wait!

360
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:31,219
Don't call my mom.

361
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,134
Hae-jin! Hae-jin, come out! We're in big trouble!

362
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:41,861
- What's wrong? - What is it? Did Mrs. Sung collapse again?

363
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:45,251
No! That shaman woman came home!

364
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,884
- What? - It looks like Bong-soo made her come.

365
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:54,439
- Does he have nothing else to do? - He has one tenacious will.

366
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:57,454
Goodness. If only he had studied with such a will...

367
00:29:57,697 --> 00:29:59,775
Mother, what are you going to do?

368
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:05,861
What else? She's a guest. Go downstairs. I have to cook.

369
00:30:06,486 --> 00:30:09,619
- Aren't you curious? - Why would I be curious?

370
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:14,087
- She might become your in-law. Go and say hello. - Hello, my foot!

371
00:30:14,447 --> 00:30:16,197
She should come say hello to me!

372
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:28,259
Mom, are you really not going to go downstairs?

373
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:31,197
How could she barge into someone's house without notice first?

374
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:34,665
She doesn't know how to think of the other person's position at all!

375
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:40,060
The meat is going to end up everywhere. Why would you smash meat so fiercely?

376
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:48,228
My name is Oh Soon-jung.

377
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,548
She has a beautiful name, doesn't she?

378
00:30:54,307 --> 00:30:57,440
I may look like this, but I have a pretty name.

379
00:30:57,465 --> 00:31:00,611
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Oh Soon-jung.

380
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,361
But you really do look exactly like your picture.

381
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:10,726
My photos don't bring out the true beauty in me.

382
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:14,212
Oh, I see...

383
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:18,644
You came out of the blue. What do we do about dinner?

384
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:23,033
- We don't have any side dishes. - Should we order from a Chinese restaurant then?

385
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:25,400
How can we do that when we have a guest?

386
00:31:26,322 --> 00:31:31,829
Don't mind me. I just need sweet and sour pork and a bowl of seafood noodle soup.

387
00:31:31,854 --> 00:31:36,173
Yes! Let's order! It's my treat today!

388
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:44,837
- Doesn't she speak really strangely? - Yes.

389
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:47,704
She puts on an innocent act but says whatever is on her mind.

390
00:31:48,017 --> 00:31:50,829
She said her photos don't bring out the true beauty in her.

391
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:54,497
She said all she needs is sweet and sour pork and seafood noodle soup!

392
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,783
Hey, don't laugh! She can hear you!

393
00:31:58,478 --> 00:32:01,775
- She's an awfully strange one. - Right!

394
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:32,462
Kill me instead. J-just kill me with your own hands.

395
00:32:33,322 --> 00:32:36,158
Yes. I'll kill you.

396
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:45,343
Get up. What did I just witness?

397
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,210
What did I just witness with my own two eyes?

398
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:50,632
Honey...

399
00:32:52,695 --> 00:32:57,085
I was so good to you...yet, you betray me like this?

400
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,936
What did you take me for that made you think

401
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,809
it was okay to go behind my back like this?

402
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:09,460
- It was a trap. - And you fell for it?

403
00:33:10,804 --> 00:33:13,523
You fell for it? You fell for it?

404
00:33:16,882 --> 00:33:20,927
Let's die together. Let's just die together.

405
00:33:22,046 --> 00:33:27,015
How will I be able to face my kids now? How will I be able to face my mother?

406
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:30,382
I'm sorry! Please give me one chance!

407
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:35,991
If you give me one chance, I swear I'll be good to you!

408
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:40,406
All I have is you now! I'm sorry!

409
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:46,250
You left your son who has nothing to do with me in my care...

410
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:51,983
but you were fooling around with a younger man behind my back?

411
00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:01,437
What would he have thought of me when we went golfing together?

412
00:34:02,804 --> 00:34:05,733
If you were going to have an affair, you should have done it quietly.

413
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,101
How dare you bring him in front of my face?

414
00:34:08,578 --> 00:34:11,999
I didn't! Ko Na-kyung played a trick!

415
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:18,562
He must have known she was playing a trick!

416
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:24,437
I tried to stop him from meeting you, but he didn't listen to me!

417
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:28,523
If he didn't listen, then you should have stopped!

418
00:34:29,226 --> 00:34:33,372
He didn't listen to you, but you still ran off to meet him?

419
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:36,872
Why would you do that?

420
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:44,208
Even after he came to this house and went golfing with you, she still went out

421
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:49,817
to meet him like a rabbit who couldn't come to its senses after being shot.

422
00:34:54,505 --> 00:34:58,247
Don't you think he thought of my face as you were rolling around in his bed?

423
00:34:58,857 --> 00:35:03,239
He must have mocked me while we hung out together.

424
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:06,755
What would he have thought of me?

425
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:11,973
- Honey. - Who are you to make me into a fool like this?

426
00:35:12,888 --> 00:35:16,778
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?

427
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,364
I've committed a grave sin.

428
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,247
Fine. I'll kill you. I will.

429
00:35:28,661 --> 00:35:31,989
I'll kill you! Die! Die! Die! Die!

430
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,372
She's not even worth killing.

431
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,520
Get out. Get out of this house.

432
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:03,059
Let's stop this now. Let's stop it.

433
00:36:04,427 --> 00:36:05,723
I'm exhausted as well.

434
00:36:07,911 --> 00:36:12,864
Don't ever appear in front of me again.

435
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,208
Get out.

436
00:36:17,435 --> 00:36:20,200
Get out before I put an end to you!

437
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,208
Kyung-soo, take your mom to the annex.

438
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:45,942
I pity your child who has to see you like this.

439
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:49,250
What sin did this young man commit?

440
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:55,641
It's sad enough that he was born from you and abandoned by you at a young age.

441
00:36:56,751 --> 00:37:03,563
How can you let him see you like this? I pity him so much! I pity him!

442
00:37:24,313 --> 00:37:25,555
Let's go to the annex.

443
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,024
Kyung-soo...

444
00:37:42,985 --> 00:37:44,524
Don't say anything. Just go.

445
00:38:32,866 --> 00:38:37,406
She put on such a big show, but eventually, this is how she ends.

446
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:43,219
- Did you see my father's expression? - He nearly lost his mind and went on a rampage.

447
00:38:44,368 --> 00:38:46,571
He was wounded with a scar that won't heal as a man.

448
00:38:47,196 --> 00:38:51,703
- Are you satisfied? - So I do get to witness him in this kind of state, after all.

449
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,469
I didn't know you harbored such resentment against him.

450
00:38:54,657 --> 00:38:59,305
Hyun-joon ignored him and ran away from him a long time ago, so he probably forgot.

451
00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:05,362
However, I had to suck up to the one who calls himself our

452
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:09,766
father while killing him over a hundred times in my mind.

453
00:39:10,188 --> 00:39:13,102
Anyways, Yoo Ji-na is done for now.

454
00:39:15,094 --> 00:39:18,360
Now that she's gone, I'm starting to get bothered by Jung Hae-dang.

455
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:24,266
If I get rid of someone, someone else comes along.

456
00:39:24,664 --> 00:39:27,297
So are you thinking of getting rid of Hae-dang?

457
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:31,961
Don't. I told you not to.

458
00:39:32,212 --> 00:39:34,399
To be honest, I'm tired of this side of myself.

459
00:39:34,821 --> 00:39:39,742
However, I don't know what it means to give up.

460
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:43,321
I clearly told you not to do it!

461
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:51,360
I'm sorry that dinner was so plain when you came to our house as a guest.

462
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:54,078
It's fine. Dinner was great.

463
00:39:57,102 --> 00:39:59,258
Why did you come down here?

464
00:39:59,283 --> 00:40:01,906
I heard there's a guest, so I couldn't just sit and do nothing.

465
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:04,727
I had some cinnamon punch, so I brought it over.

466
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:07,505
Please drink it.

467
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:12,891
- Who are you? - Didn't Bong-soo tell you about me?

468
00:40:14,587 --> 00:40:19,250
- She's my mom. - Oh, the one who does all the housework?

469
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:22,061
I'm not just here to do housework.

470
00:40:22,623 --> 00:40:24,742
It's not like I'm a maid or anything.

471
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:30,922
- The in-laws live together? - I'm afraid so.

472
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:38,024
But did you purposely draw your eye-liner like that?

473
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:42,328
Well, it's just my personal preference.

474
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,899
Why? Is it atrocious to look at?

475
00:40:46,055 --> 00:40:49,946
It's just because you emphasized your eyes when they're already shaped upwards.

476
00:40:51,235 --> 00:40:55,836
All I mean is that she has a strong impression. Why are you poking me?

477
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:01,440
Mom, go on upstairs. Thank you for the cinnamon punch. You can

478
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:04,914
- go up now. - Let me stay and look at her for a bit longer.

479
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,531
I'm not a monkey at a zoo. What are you trying to look at?

480
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:14,812
- It's just because your make-up is unusual. - It's unusual?

481
00:41:14,914 --> 00:41:18,922
Did you used to be in a gang in your school days?

482
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:22,602
Mom...

483
00:41:23,602 --> 00:41:26,219
She looks like she bulled quite a few people.

484
00:41:28,711 --> 00:41:31,649
- Mom, get up. - I bullied people?

485
00:41:31,674 --> 00:41:34,508
Get up. Get up!

486
00:41:34,696 --> 00:41:38,250
All right. I'll get up even if you tell me not to.

487
00:41:39,828 --> 00:41:41,922
I'll be leaving now.

488
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:50,383
- Oh, come on, mom. - My goodness.

489
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:55,727
How did you come to know my husband?

490
00:41:56,712 --> 00:42:00,203
I already told you. She works at my company.

491
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:05,289
Mr. Yeon borrowed a lot of money from me.

492
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:08,238
At the end of every month, he would come racing

493
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:10,266
to me to borrow money to pay back his card debt.

494
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:14,752
I paid her back already.

495
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,080
Of course he did.

496
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:21,491
The only people I can't get money back from is the dead.

497
00:42:21,944 --> 00:42:24,791
As long as you're alive, you can't just take my money.

498
00:42:29,323 --> 00:42:30,323
She just left.

499
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,158
I thought she would be here for a little bit, but she stayed for quite a bit.

500
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,604
Oh my gosh. She's scarier in real life.

501
00:42:38,471 --> 00:42:41,505
Did you hear her say that the only people she can't get money back from

502
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,394
is the dead? As long as you're alive, you can't just take her money!

503
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:48,236
Don't you feel like she's a professional in that area?

504
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:54,172
Professional, my foot! What kind of professional? A professional who gets money back?

505
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:58,979
I'm certain she used to bully people in her school days! Can't you tell?

506
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:02,777
There were girls like that in high school. They used to wear

507
00:43:02,802 --> 00:43:05,584
patches on their necks, chew gum, and pretend to be cool.

508
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:09,809
So Mrs. Oh Soon-jung used to be a bully in her school days, and

509
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:13,909
in the future, she'll become a shaman. What happens after that?

510
00:43:13,934 --> 00:43:17,129
My goodness. You made a completely normal person into a

511
00:43:17,154 --> 00:43:20,632
shaman and a gangster. What will you make her into next time?

512
00:43:20,893 --> 00:43:22,705
It depends on my condition that day.

513
00:43:25,448 --> 00:43:26,697
My goodness.

514
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:29,291
That woman!

515
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:35,242
In elementary school, she would nag me and play hard-to-get, but when I showed

516
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:39,886
interest in other girls, she would toss my pencil case in the trash can!

517
00:43:41,939 --> 00:43:42,939
Goodness.

518
00:43:43,515 --> 00:43:47,959
Father, why are you laughing? What's the meaning of that laughter?

519
00:43:48,061 --> 00:43:51,092
It's cute that she acts like that at her age!

520
00:43:52,249 --> 00:43:54,303
She's cute? When she's your in-law?

521
00:43:54,529 --> 00:44:00,037
"Kang-sik!" "Mi-sook!" It seems like yesterday we were still young.

522
00:44:00,062 --> 00:44:03,186
My goodness. When did time fly by so quickly?

523
00:44:05,655 --> 00:44:06,655
Gosh.

524
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:11,842
Don't laugh like that! It really offends me!

525
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:21,509
I told you she wasn't worth it, didn't I?

526
00:44:23,343 --> 00:44:24,343
Be quiet.

527
00:44:24,671 --> 00:44:27,076
It's not like you to not have known that,

528
00:44:27,913 --> 00:44:30,282
but you burned yourself quite badly trying to argue

529
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:32,538
you loved her just because you wanted to beat me.

530
00:44:33,116 --> 00:44:37,707
You're the incompetent and dishonorable jerk who

531
00:44:37,732 --> 00:44:42,135
has no other purpose in life except to beat me.

532
00:44:42,475 --> 00:44:46,342
I'm still better off than someone who keeps obsessing over beating his own son.

533
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:51,256
It may be dishonorable for a son to try to beat his own father,

534
00:44:51,928 --> 00:44:55,897
but it's a mental illness for a father to try to beat his own son.

535
00:44:56,686 --> 00:45:00,108
Mind your own business and get out.

536
00:45:00,436 --> 00:45:07,795
Can you still be a big talker after seeing your wife fooling around with another man?

537
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,940
How dare you talk about transferring your shares

538
00:45:12,966 --> 00:45:16,335
to that woman's son in front of Hyun-sung and me?

539
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:19,809
Go ahead and transfer them to the son of the

540
00:45:19,835 --> 00:45:22,533
woman who stomped all over your pride as a man!

541
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,514
Go ahead and do that if you want!

542
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:27,561
Please get out. Get out. Get out.

543
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:28,811
Get out!

544
00:45:29,507 --> 00:45:31,490
You once said I lost to you, didn't you?

545
00:45:32,717 --> 00:45:37,600
I'm sorry, but you were no competition to me from the beginning.

546
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:42,865
- What? - Because I'm the true flesh and blood successor of this family.

547
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:47,552
No matter how much of an effort you make, you'll

548
00:45:47,577 --> 00:45:51,249
never be nothing more than a temporary figure.

549
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,569
It may be dishonorable for a son to try to beat his own father,

550
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,272
but it's a mental illness for a father to try to beat his own son.

551
00:46:15,585 --> 00:46:19,857
Your father-in-law was disappointed in you, so since he didn't have any other

552
00:46:20,584 --> 00:46:23,715
sons, he had chosen Park Hyun-joon as his successor from an early age.

553
00:46:25,093 --> 00:46:29,136
You and Mrs. Sung couldn't stand seeing your father-in-law ignore you

554
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:33,030
and plan to make his grandson into his successor instead, could you?

555
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:38,301
So even though Hyun-joon was your own son, you

556
00:46:38,326 --> 00:46:40,686
would've felt an inferior complex towards him.

557
00:46:43,436 --> 00:46:44,639
An inferior complex?

558
00:46:44,764 --> 00:46:49,500
If not, you wouldn't have blackmailed the woman

559
00:46:49,525 --> 00:46:53,767
who liked your son into becoming your wife.

560
00:46:54,452 --> 00:46:59,217
- Not if you had a sane mind. - A sane mind?

561
00:47:01,553 --> 00:47:02,975
You're a lunatic.

562
00:47:31,944 --> 00:47:36,334
- I need to talk to you. - I don't want to.

563
00:47:36,858 --> 00:47:40,420
It wasn't yours from the beginning.

564
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:47,889
Transfer your shares to your sons and reconcile with them.

565
00:47:49,468 --> 00:47:51,420
Are you still thinking of going against your own

566
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:54,569
children when something like this happened?

567
00:47:55,882 --> 00:48:01,319
Neither Hyun-joon nor Hyun-sung will touch your scars if you reconcile with them.

568
00:48:03,022 --> 00:48:09,006
- I don't want to. - You still don't want to? You still have enough energy to fight?

569
00:48:11,843 --> 00:48:16,819
I haven't gone crazy yet. Don't worry.

570
00:48:18,218 --> 00:48:23,920
I haven't gone crazy yet! I haven't gone crazy yet...

571
00:48:25,575 --> 00:48:27,974
I haven't gone crazy yet!

572
00:48:28,624 --> 00:48:32,928
My goodness. What a fool.

573
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,545
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

574
00:49:14,725 --> 00:49:16,787
Because there are many things I'm ashamed about.

575
00:49:21,053 --> 00:49:26,639
My life is so tainted with sins that I sometimes get nervous when it's too bright.

576
00:49:30,257 --> 00:49:33,256
Do you want me to go to the main house and get you alcohol?

577
00:49:35,796 --> 00:49:36,796
No, thank you.

578
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,522
Sleep on the bed. I'll sleep on the sofa.

579
00:49:42,311 --> 00:49:44,608
I'll make coffee for you.

580
00:49:46,538 --> 00:49:51,545
I'm sorry you were born as my son.

581
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:20,037
- Why aren't you sleeping? - I can't seem to fall asleep.

582
00:50:33,436 --> 00:50:36,225
Should I guess what's on your mind?

583
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,600
You can tell me.

584
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:45,912
I told you that you can tell me until I tell you to stop.

585
00:50:47,733 --> 00:50:55,139
I keep thinking about Kyung-soo's back figure as he took his mom to the annex.

586
00:50:57,569 --> 00:51:02,225
- Life can be so cruel. - I know.

587
00:51:03,022 --> 00:51:07,221
At such a young age, amidst all the fear of being blind,

588
00:51:08,115 --> 00:51:11,296
he must have waited for his mom and missed her so much.

589
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:13,966
My grandmother said that, too.

590
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:22,818
It would be painful for a son to witness his mom shaking in fear while begging her

591
00:51:22,843 --> 00:51:30,006
husband for forgiveness for being caught in an extramarital affair with another man.

592
00:51:31,568 --> 00:51:33,037
You must be heartbroken.

593
00:51:45,475 --> 00:51:50,004
How could there be such a sad and pathetic life?

594
00:52:14,537 --> 00:52:19,248
I don't know how long it has been since I've watched you sleep.

595
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:23,719
When did you grow up?

596
00:52:25,951 --> 00:52:26,951
Kyung-soo...

597
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:31,920
when did you grow up to be an adult?

598
00:53:43,584 --> 00:53:44,584
What is that?

599
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:54,584
It's a picture of you.

600
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:13,599
Did you have this all this time?

601
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,404
I always had it with me.

602
00:54:18,397 --> 00:54:22,295
Every time I missed you, I would look at it.

603
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:28,123
Were there times that you missed me?

604
00:54:33,022 --> 00:54:36,607
Of course. You're my child.

605
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:43,943
The most heartbroken women in the world are those who have abandoned

606
00:54:45,685 --> 00:54:50,771
their young children to live better lives for themselves...

607
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,646
Whether they abandoned their child because of a man...

608
00:54:58,365 --> 00:55:02,466
or to live a better life on their own...

609
00:55:06,959 --> 00:55:11,037
there isn't a more painful life for a woman than that.

610
00:55:14,709 --> 00:55:16,373
Why didn't you come for me again?

611
00:55:18,928 --> 00:55:20,920
Because I was afraid...

612
00:55:24,336 --> 00:55:26,552
that the life I made an effort to build would crumble.

613
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:35,529
Just because I didn't go to find you doesn't mean I didn't miss you.

614
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,668
As long as you didn't completely forget me, it's fine.

615
00:55:49,756 --> 00:55:55,052
As long as you didn't completely forget me...

616
00:55:57,412 --> 00:55:58,412
it's fine.

617
00:56:02,131 --> 00:56:03,331
That's all I need.

618
00:56:12,975 --> 00:56:13,975
Kyung-soo.

619
00:56:17,631 --> 00:56:19,022
Don't remember...

620
00:56:21,514 --> 00:56:24,240
how I told you that you were someone I had to hide...

621
00:56:26,662 --> 00:56:33,802
 and get rid of ever since you were born.

622
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:56,443
I'm sorry this is all I could give you.

623
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:08,052
What's going through your mind?

624
00:57:10,022 --> 00:57:11,289
I'm going to sleep.

625
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:14,349
If you decide to do something foolish, I won't forgive you.

626
00:57:15,631 --> 00:57:19,295
Promise me. Promise me that you won't do anything foolish!

627
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:26,568
Keep living on. Do that much for me at least.

628
00:57:31,459 --> 00:57:34,045
Promise me that you won't do anything foolish!

629
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,998
Go to sleep. Don't worry.

630
00:58:14,811 --> 00:58:17,435
Father said he's going to go to work without eating breakfast.

631
00:58:19,022 --> 00:58:20,022
Let's eat.

632
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:32,365
There's a time for everything.

633
00:58:34,123 --> 00:58:35,123
What do you mean?

634
00:58:35,785 --> 00:58:41,862
I mean that now is the time for you two to make up with your father.

635
00:58:42,621 --> 00:58:45,354
If you reach out to someone at their most vulnerable time,

636
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:48,058
it's not easy for them to brush you away.

637
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,526
The only thing that has changed is the fact that Yoo Ji-na is gone.

638
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,284
Forgive your father now.

639
00:58:55,777 --> 00:59:00,370
Then what about mom? I need to find out how she died.

640
00:59:00,558 --> 00:59:03,628
Even though you find out, she can't come back alive.

641
00:59:03,847 --> 00:59:09,253
What if he had done something to her? How could I do nothing about that?

642
00:59:09,636 --> 00:59:13,261
This is the family you will continue.

643
00:59:13,785 --> 00:59:17,011
It's the family you'll bear kids into and carry on.

644
00:59:17,574 --> 00:59:18,907
You love Hae-dang, don't you?

645
00:59:20,441 --> 00:59:25,456
If the Hae-dang you love has a child, won't you love him?

646
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:30,860
Do you want your child to grow up into a family where the

647
00:59:30,885 --> 00:59:35,551
entire world knows that his grandfather killed his grandmother?

648
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:40,466
Everyone doesn't keep quiet just because they don't have anything to say.

649
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:43,253
But I'm her son.

650
00:59:43,472 --> 00:59:46,581
There's no mother in this world who wishes for her child

651
00:59:46,606 --> 00:59:49,550
to destroy his own life trying to get revenge for her.

652
00:59:51,222 --> 00:59:54,526
And Hae-dang, you've worked very hard.

653
00:59:55,066 --> 01:00:00,401
Hyun-sung told me you always watched over me in the hospital room.

654
01:00:03,464 --> 01:00:07,631
Yes. I told my grandmother that you and your

655
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:11,729
family made sure to always stay by her side.

656
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:17,003
Tell your family I thank them from the bottom of my heart.

657
01:00:18,253 --> 01:00:19,253
I will.

658
01:00:19,967 --> 01:00:23,068
I took care of the family at home.

659
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,279
I see. Good job. You did well.

660
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:29,701
- I went to the hospital during the daytime, too. - I know. That's why you did well.

661
01:00:29,975 --> 01:00:31,677
That's not the only thing you did well.

662
01:00:32,248 --> 01:00:36,586
It's all thanks to you that we were able to put an end to Yoo Ji-na.

663
01:00:37,436 --> 01:00:38,599
Thank you, grandmother.

664
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:45,873
Anyways, you made an action to do something about it, which is why it led to today.

665
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:51,615
I missed you so much that I cried while cleaning your bedroom.

666
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:55,740
I don't think you're the one who cleaned my bedroom.

667
01:00:57,068 --> 01:01:00,084
Hae-dang cleaned, and I helped her.

668
01:01:01,162 --> 01:01:05,185
- Na-kyung cried because she missed you. - Really?

669
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:08,537
I had my cheek slapped by Yoo Ji-na.

670
01:01:09,755 --> 01:01:14,137
She was acting all high and mighty like she was the lady of the house and sat in your

671
01:01:14,162 --> 01:01:18,342
seat, so I told her to get up at once, which is why she ended up slapping my cheek.

672
01:01:18,803 --> 01:01:21,466
Thank you. You did well.

673
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:28,177
You've done very well if you protected my seat and got slapped for it.

674
01:01:29,959 --> 01:01:33,263
Of course, you probably did that because you were annoyed by her.

675
01:01:34,154 --> 01:01:35,221
That's not true.

676
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:40,144
I'll remember how much of an effort you made, so don't worry

677
01:01:40,169 --> 01:01:44,327
about anything else now, and just focus on having a baby.

678
01:02:07,162 --> 01:02:11,162
I called you here because there was nowhere else to speak privately to you.

679
01:02:12,248 --> 01:02:15,068
I know you didn't call me here to eat lunch.

680
01:02:16,263 --> 01:02:18,306
I don't have any intention to start a lawsuit

681
01:02:18,331 --> 01:02:20,373
and take everything from you. It's bothersome.

682
01:02:27,693 --> 01:02:28,990
I already put my seal on it.

683
01:02:31,053 --> 01:02:33,365
Do you still have lingering attachments left?

684
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:42,348
Give me one chance. I already told you I committed a grave sin.

685
01:02:42,756 --> 01:02:45,641
That doesn't mean you're going to die.

686
01:02:46,451 --> 01:02:49,795
Then I have one last request.

687
01:02:51,217 --> 01:02:56,803
- One last request? - Let me leave Kyung-soo behind.

688
01:03:00,334 --> 01:03:03,576
- What? - You like Kyung-soo.

689
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:07,670
When I see him, I think of you, so I won't be able to live with him.

690
01:03:08,311 --> 01:03:12,111
Have I become a woman you don't even want to think about?

691
01:03:13,154 --> 01:03:14,209
I'm tormented as well.

692
01:03:15,076 --> 01:03:19,466
Then are you really saying we should end everything?

693
01:03:22,701 --> 01:03:26,951
Is this why you forced me to marry you?

694
01:03:28,873 --> 01:03:31,552
We didn't get married because I loved you.

695
01:03:33,295 --> 01:03:36,716
Don't you feel the tiniest bit sorry to me?

696
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:42,365
Just because I feel sorry to you doesn't mean I can forgive you.

697
01:03:44,381 --> 01:03:49,474
Thanks to you, I might be over as a man.

698
01:03:50,756 --> 01:03:55,177
If I remember this embarrassment, betrayal, and inferiority complex,

699
01:03:56,826 --> 01:03:59,263
how will I be able to embrace another woman?

700
01:04:01,436 --> 01:04:02,654
Inferiority complex?

701
01:04:03,443 --> 01:04:09,515
Even though I have so much wealth and power, I was pushed aside by

702
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:15,249
a pathetic man for the sole reason of not having youth anymore.

703
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:18,513
It's okay for you to suffer from inferiority complex.

704
01:04:21,623 --> 01:04:22,623
What?

705
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:27,966
Long time ago, you had an affair, too, while leaving your Choi Kyung-ae at home.

706
01:04:28,983 --> 01:04:29,983
What?

707
01:04:30,045 --> 01:04:32,887
Do you think women won't suffer from inferiority complex

708
01:04:32,912 --> 01:04:35,603
if their husbands have an affair with a younger woman?

709
01:04:37,483 --> 01:04:42,529
What kind of inferiority complex do you think she suffered from while

710
01:04:43,545 --> 01:04:47,295
you left her at home and had affairs with all sorts of pathetic women?

711
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:58,849
Just think of this as punishment for that and give me one chance.

712
01:04:59,764 --> 01:05:04,537
Why should I be punished by you for that?

713
01:05:05,115 --> 01:05:10,341
Because it's your madness that ruined my life!

714
01:05:22,131 --> 01:05:25,802
Do you still have something left to say?

715
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:31,982
Stop spouting nonsense and get the hell out of my life.

716
01:05:32,404 --> 01:05:33,404
Let go of me.

717
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:39,210
I have a lot of pathetic attachment to this life, so I'm letting you off the hook.

718
01:05:40,373 --> 01:05:43,248
Or else, I would've killed us both.

719
01:05:53,046 --> 01:05:54,713
(Choi Kyung-ae/To My Son)

720
01:05:56,264 --> 01:06:00,357
I should give this letter to Park Hyun-joon before I sign the divorce paper.

721
01:06:01,717 --> 01:06:07,060
As soon as he gets this letter, it will be over for you before we even divorce.

722
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:09,303
Do you know that?

723
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:47,076
("You Are Too Much")

724
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:51,861
Don't roll those greedy, worldly eyes in front of me and get out.

725
01:06:52,045 --> 01:06:53,693
To me, you're done.

726
01:06:53,826 --> 01:06:56,693
All the people who ruined my life are here.

727
01:06:57,185 --> 01:06:59,693
My life started to become messed up because of you!

728
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,107
Hyun-joon became a contract employee at the company.

729
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:05,419
I can't just live by breathing only. It wouldn't

730
01:07:05,444 --> 01:07:07,178
be my life if there was no greed in it.

731
01:07:07,451 --> 01:07:09,451
The letter is in my hands now.

732
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:14,427
You lost your one and only weapon to destroy me.

733
01:07:14,529 --> 01:07:18,329
When Kyung-soo snuck into this house, why did you come to suspect him?

734
01:07:18,623 --> 01:07:21,375
There's a tree in the front yard that only my mom and I know about!

735
01:07:21,799 --> 01:07:24,399
