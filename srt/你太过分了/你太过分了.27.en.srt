<i>[Episode 27]</i>

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,910
<i>Kyung Soo, are you in there?</i>

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,050
<i>Kyung Soo, come out if you're in there!</i>

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,810
Kyung Soo! Kyung Soo, come out
if you're in there! Kyung Soo!

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,170
<i>No! No, Kyung Soo! Kyung Soo!</i>

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,080
Kyung Soo!

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,070
What are you doing here at this hour?

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,770
Kyung Soo.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,490
What are you doing?

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,210
You... you plan on leaving, don't you?

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,990
Are you thinking of
leaving with Jung Hae Dang?

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,200
- What's it to you?
- Don't be ridiculous.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,850
How can you think of doing that?

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,030
Are you... okay with
never seeing me again?

16
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,200
I told you several times it would be
better if we never see each other again.

17
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,810
You can't do that.
You can't do that!

18
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,560
That is your problem, Madam Yoo Ji Na.

19
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,850
What?

20
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,070
You still have more
important things than me.

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,870
That's why you can't tell
the world that I'm your son.

22
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,460
What would become of us if we do that?

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,650
That's why we're going away. So you
two never have to see each other again.

24
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,350
What's the problem?

25
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,690
You're going to run away so you
can live with Jung Hae Dang, right?

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,820
Still... I got to see you before I left.

27
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:56,090
I'm sorry for causing you so much
trouble since the day I was born.

28
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,360
Jung Hae Dang asked you
to run away, didn't she?

29
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,320
Why do you think she said that?

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,410
Probably because you torture me so much
when you have no right to be my mother.

31
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,270
Stop saying such naive things.

32
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,200
Why would she go to such lengths
and leave her family behind?

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,530
Stop saying such naive things, please!

34
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,740
And how do you think her family felt?

35
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,690
They are willing to let her go.

36
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,980
It's because she can't be with
you if they don't let her go.

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,340
They're all on the same team.

38
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,420
The whole family is in
on it so they can use us.

39
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,330
What are you talking about?

40
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,160
Why would they do that?

41
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,050
Because you are my son.

42
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,980
Because they think they can fix
their lives if they catch you.

43
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,840
Watch what you say.

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,070
Hae Dang's family is my family now.

45
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,110
Family?

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,740
You may have given birth to me

47
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,780
but there was never
a moment when we were family.

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,600
Family, my butt.

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,250
They're a bunch of swindlers, not family.

50
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,670
- Watch what you say!
- Jung Hae Dang...

51
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,920
She lived with a man for 10 years
who she considered her husband...

52
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,690
and I... stole him from her.

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,290
What?

54
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,280
Her whole family knows that fact.

55
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,290
We both lived with the same man.

56
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,370
How can she marry my son?

57
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,050
Her father is the same too.

58
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,940
He comes to you with such a sweet
face. Don't you think he's amazing?

59
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,280
Is that really true?

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,970
How can we live as in-laws
when we lived with the same man?

61
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:21,510
Does that clue you in at all
about that girl and her family?

62
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,770
Get out.

63
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,280
They all fooled both of us.

64
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,370
And they don't care what happens my son.

65
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,990
I want to be alone, so get out.

66
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,990
Please, get out.

67
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,490
It's been a long time since I've played
golf. I'm not sure if I will do well.

68
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,420
Yoon Hee, try this on.

69
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:27,880
They say it's a golf gathering but
it's pretty much a school reunion.

70
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,270
Your class has always
been very extraordinary.

71
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,780
Women got married into
well-to-do families.

72
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,210
Or are active in society.

73
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,390
There's never a quiet
day in that neighborhood.

74
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,500
We're all supposed to meet up and hit
some balls. It's not a school reunion.

75
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,020
It's all about credentials
when you go there.

76
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,740
By the way, you must not
be an alumna, Stepmother.

77
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,800
Why? Can you not live
in this country if you aren't?

78
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,650
Why are you so offended?

79
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:03,020
If you go there, they ask which
school you graduated from.

80
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,780
I'm telling you because
you might get flustered.

81
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,190
Why would I get flustered?

82
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,120
If you go there, you will.

83
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,750
You're probably the only
one who isn't an alumna.

84
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,630
That's true.

85
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,340
Do you just want to
stay home, Stepmother?

86
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,940
Yoon Hee and I can just go.

87
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,910
Why? Why shouldn't I go?

88
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,650
It won't be very fun.

89
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,430
It's just a bunch of extraordinary women
bragging about extraordinary things.

90
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,870
I mean, even I get
intimidated when I go there.

91
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,300
I can't imagine what
you would feel like.

92
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,580
I'll go and check it out.
Let's see how extraordinary everyone is.

93
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,110
Those women are pros
at trampling people.

94
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,140
The way they look down
on people is so cruel.

95
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,960
I guess ignorant people don't even
know they're being made fun of.

96
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,660
So, are you worrying about me now?

97
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,230
Just let it be, Na Kyung.

98
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,110
She'll realize it on her
own when she gets there.

99
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,370
I'm afraid she'll embarrass
the family, that's all.

100
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,130
What if we get embarrassed by her?

101
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,750
I'm going to leave now.

102
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,510
Why are you you making her nervous?

103
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,280
You know no one is going to ask
her what school she graduated from.

104
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,450
It's fun.

105
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,780
You played along with me, Yoon Hee.

106
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,310
Where do you plan on living?

107
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,570
I want to live far away from Yoo Ji Na.

108
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,550
Go ahead and do that.

109
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,880
But how can I do that when
I'm the eldest daughter-in-law?

110
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,770
You have me.

111
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:25,410
You leave. You're not the eldest
and you've done so much already.

112
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,280
Move out and live comfortably now.

113
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,040
I can't do that.

114
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,840
You can't do that?

115
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,560
Is she crazy?

116
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,440
Nothing has been guaranteed.
How can I just back away?

117
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,590
If we just back away because
the eldest son is married now

118
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,710
than everything we have
done was for nothing.

119
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,540
It would all have been a waste.

120
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,010
Did you not you see me coming out?

121
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,360
I did. So what?

122
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,670
Why are you so rude? Have you no fear?

123
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,390
Seriously, I just wanted
to read for a bit.

124
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,570
Park Hyun Joon came home drunk

125
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,160
because the woman he has
feelings for is leaving.

126
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,250
He muttered that he
still has a lot to say.

127
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:33,640
How does it feel to marry a man
who can't get over another woman?

128
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,570
What feelings?

129
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,510
When did you get in?

130
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,950
Come inside for a bit.

131
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,420
Did you just get back
from the other house?

132
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,830
What are you up to?
Why would you say that her?

133
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:30,630
Are you really saying that Hyun Joon
can't see another woman get married?

134
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,550
It's not like that.

135
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,880
Then what is it?

136
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,250
She won't greet her
mother-in-law properly.

137
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,320
Behave properly if you want
to be treated with respect.

138
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,610
What?

139
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,060
You keep antagonizing
her whenever you see her.

140
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,700
Do you think she would want to
greet her mother-in-law properly?

141
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,850
Why won't you believe me?

142
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,630
I don't have feelings
for Park Hyun Joon.

143
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,690
I don't believe you.

144
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,150
What?

145
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,100
It's hard for me to believe you.

146
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,170
"You gave birth to your son and
you don't know who the father is."

147
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,350
Is that it?

148
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,990
Inside that glamour shell of yours...

149
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,410
I wonder what your true identity
is. That's what I'm afraid of.

150
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,720
I thought that was the only way
to survive at that foolish age.

151
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,240
How old do you think I was back then?

152
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,070
I can understand it with my head.

153
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:35,200
You were only an 18-year-old woman. I
don't expect you would have behaved well.

154
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,980
Behaved well?

155
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,580
But honestly, I don't know
when you looked beautiful to me.

156
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,870
I can barely remember.

157
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:50,900
I no longer look beautiful
to you... is that it?

158
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,810
<i>I'm going to continue to nag at my son </i>

159
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,980
<i>until he thinks you're
too dirty to touch.</i>

160
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,620
<i>What are you going to do about it?</i>

161
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,840
Tell me where you want to live.
We need to get the house.

162
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,070
Where would my oldest grandson live?
He's going to live with me.

163
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,220
Yoon Hee's opinion is important.

164
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,700
What do you think, Hyun Joon?

165
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,930
I have memories of my mom here.
I have no intention of leaving.

166
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,250
As newlyweds, why don't you
move out and live on your own?

167
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,290
What are you afraid of? That you can't
live with me under the same roof?

168
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,600
Hyung Sung, take this
opportunity and move out.

169
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,920
That's okay, Father.

170
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,810
Even if Yoon Hee moves in,
Grandmother still needs us.

171
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,930
Let's all live together then.

172
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,660
How can we all live together?

173
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,750
What luck could I have at my age?

174
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,070
I'd be happy to have all my
grandchildren live with me.

175
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,570
Hyun Joon's room is
too small for newlyweds.

176
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,370
That's true.

177
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,210
Then let's do this.

178
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,900
You guys take the room your
father is using right now.

179
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,780
What about us then?

180
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,550
Go live at the other house.

181
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,270
You can do yoga in the morning
in peace and drink in peace.

182
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,420
Live comfortably.

183
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,620
You don't do shows lately
or even get your hands wet.

184
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,530
What's the point of staying here?

185
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,460
How can you say that?

186
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,280
What can I say?

187
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,110
Even so, how can you tell the lady
of the house to go to the other house?

188
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,360
Who is the lady of the house?

189
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,190
I am still the lady of the
house and Yoon Hee will be next.

190
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,670
I don't like her walking around the house
dressed like a coffee shop owner.

191
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,800
Just stuff her into the other house
and you can come and go as you please.

192
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,150
Bong Soo! Bong Soo!

193
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,150
- Oh!
- Hey.

194
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,850
Why are you looking for Bong Soo?

195
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,740
Did Bong Soo get swindled by any chance?

196
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,050
How do you know that?

197
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,180
Did he get swindled?

198
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,200
Did someone else get swindled, too?

199
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,660
The digital golf range owner was
swindled out of 20 million won.

200
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,970
She's a con artist.
She's a con artist.

201
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,370
Goodness.

202
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,310
He was her prey.

203
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,690
Bong Soo got swindled, too?

204
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,000
Ah.

205
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,770
Goodness, I'll feed myself.

206
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,930
I'll feed you, so just eat it.

207
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,970
Ah.

208
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,920
Ah.

209
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,900
The texture is different, isn't it?

210
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,250
You're not supposed
to share wild rockfish.

211
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,100
I bought one thinking of you.

212
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,510
- You did?
- Hurry up and drink.

213
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,120
Ah, yes, yes.

214
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,640
Ah.

215
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,730
- Who cares?
- No!

216
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,380
- Sit here.
- Oh my goodness.

217
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,720
- Here I go.
- It's fine.

218
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,730
Oh my. That feels good.

219
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,080
That feels good.

220
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,340
- Does it feel good?
- It feels good.

221
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,550
It's already bad enough that
10 million won was thrown away.

222
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,680
You blew 10 million won.

223
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,590
You still want to go your own way?

224
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,840
Women are truly scary. So scary.

225
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,820
What craziness are you saying?

226
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,050
Hurry up and beg for forgiveness.

227
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,620
Beg for what? Begging won't
bring the 10 million won back.

228
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,600
Get out. Get out and earn
back the 10 million won.

229
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,780
Hurry up and get it back!

230
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,830
<i>I do not regret it.</i>

231
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,550
<i>And I do not cry.</i>

232
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:53,500
<i>After you left me</i>

233
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,500
<i>when I become lonely...</i>

234
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,370
<i>When I become wet in the rain.</i>

235
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:12,720
<i>Underneath the sad streetlamp...</i>

236
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,680
<i>When I turn around...</i>

237
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:24,880
<i>I say goodbye and cry.</i>

238
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,230
Oh my gosh.

239
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,330
- Da Eun.
- I'm going to go crazy.

240
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,030
Mother, please do
something with this man.

241
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,710
You cry? What gives you the right to cry?

242
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,680
I'm the one who wants to cry!

243
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,290
I want to cry for giving
birth to you! I want to cry!

244
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,390
- You rascal! You rascal!
- Mom!

245
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,980
<i>Goodbye!</i>

246
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,340
Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. What?

247
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,860
Leave this neighborhood.

248
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,950
You listed the cafe for sale anyway.

249
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,860
No. Do you want to move
into the other house?

250
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,780
The other house?

251
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,910
- How can I go there?
- Why not? You're my son.

252
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,790
Should I marry Hae Dang
and move in there then?

253
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,540
What are you saying?

254
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,520
- Nothing has changed.
- Why not?

255
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,930
Because I don't plan on living my life
with any connection to Yoo Ji Na.

256
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,050
Take it easy, will you?

257
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,100
Do you think I'm
bearing all those insults

258
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,320
so I can turn Jung Hae Dang
into a wealthy wife?

259
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,290
Thank you for telling the chairman
that I don't know who the father is.

260
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,500
Do you know how he looks at me now?

261
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,280
Why did you steal the man of a poor girl?

262
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,370
Did you do it because she
lived off of your songs?

263
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:51,490
So, even after all that I said, you
still plan on marrying her? Is that it?

264
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,600
I can't lose Hae Dang
just because I am your son.

265
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,480
I'd rather forget
the fact that I'm your son.

266
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,950
You told Kyung Soo?

267
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,470
That's right, I told him.

268
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,250
How dare you think of
running away with him?

269
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,100
How brazen of you.

270
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,420
Then what becomes of my son's life?

271
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,620
Is that the right thing to do?
Seducing a young man?

272
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,800
What's to become of my son?

273
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,980
How dare you think of
running away with him?

274
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,530
Where are you going?

275
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,000
Your father is home, isn't he?

276
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,090
He's not at the gas station,
so he must be at home.

277
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,380
If you have something to say, say it
to me. My father did nothing wrong!

278
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,330
How can a man of your
father's age think like that?

279
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,060
Is his daughter's life
the only life that's important?

280
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,600
What will happen to my son's life then?

281
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,860
Why are you worried about my life?

282
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,780
Why are you here again?

283
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,580
I had a feeling you would come here.

284
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,410
Hae Dang, listen to me carefully.

285
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,800
My life has nothing to
do with this person here.

286
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:23,460
And I have no intention of
crossing paths with her in the future.

287
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,530
It doesn't matter to me what happened
between you and this person in the past.

288
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,000
This person?

289
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,330
It doesn't matter what your ex-boyfriend
did with this person in the past.

290
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,520
Don't listen to what this
person says to you in the future.

291
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,890
What?

292
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,180
Get lost this instant.

293
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,460
Don't ever come here again!

294
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,920
If you do, I will turn your world
upside down and reveal that I'm your son.

295
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,640
Isn't it one of your marriage
conditions? That I keep my mouth shut?

296
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,900
Isn't it one of your
damn marriage conditions?

297
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,380
You... how can you say
that to your mother?

298
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,130
How are you my mother?

299
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,650
Because you gave birth to me?
Because you abandoned me?

300
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,320
How can you say "mother" in front of me?

301
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,340
You have no idea the life
I lived when I was blind.

302
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,450
How can you say "mother"
in front of me now?

303
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,760
I don't know about anyone else...

304
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,670
but don't talk back
to me in front of her.

305
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,090
Why?

306
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,480
What?

307
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,180
Hae Dang's ex-boyfriend rejected
you and wanted to go back to her.

308
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,280
So you prevented him from
going back by killing him?

309
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,940
What?

310
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,890
Because you want to love Park Hyun Joon,
but he still loves Hae Dang instead?

311
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,270
Are you done talking?

312
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,430
You may be a star singer and
Hae Dang is just your impersonator.

313
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,630
But no matter how hard you try,
you can't win against her.

314
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,570
It hurts your pride so you bristle
whenever it comes to Hae Dang, right?

315
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,180
The great and mighty star
singer, Madam Yoo Ji Na.

316
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,210
It's true... children are your enemies.

317
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,000
There are no other enemies.

318
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,690
You are my child... how can you...

319
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:50,410
I really... don't know who my child is.

320
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,540
I don't know.

321
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,030
Kyung Soo.

322
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,880
Don't say anything.
Let's just sit here for a moment.

323
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:47,450
Why did you say such hurtful things? You
know they're going to break your heart.

324
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,640
I really don't know how a child
and parent are supposed to interact.

325
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,900
Kyung Soo.

326
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,880
Whenever I see her face...

327
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,280
I get so angry that I
can't think straight.

328
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,120
And then when I turn around,
I feel sorry for her.

329
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,610
I'm sorry that I hid it
from you this whole time.

330
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,740
Didn't you do that
so you could stay with me?

331
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,830
I know you.

332
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:03,050
When I found out that
Park Hyun Joon was the son of GR Group

333
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:07,880
you said that it didn't matter.

334
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,960
All you needed was me.

335
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:20,720
I was so happy but I also
felt sorry at the time.

336
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:31,250
Ah, how can this person love
me without any hesitation?

337
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,490
If I get the chance...

338
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:41,890
I'm going to make this person
feel how much I love her.

339
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,630
That was my decision.

340
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,900
Thank you for telling me that.

341
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,970
But, Kyung Soo--

342
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,570
Nothing has changed.

343
00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:00,390
No, even if it has, even if
the whole world has changed...

344
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,380
it doesn't matter as long
as you and I haven't changed.

345
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:18,380
Nothing will change as
long as we don't change.

346
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,670
So, there's no need for us to leave now.

347
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,740
Just be aware of that.

348
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,060
I'm going to go in now.

349
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,220
Poor Hae Dang.

350
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,200
Can't they just run away and live?

351
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,580
They planned on running away.

352
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,220
That was only because Kyung Soo
didn't know that fact.

353
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,140
They won't be able to live together
now that they know.

354
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,160
Even if they live together, trying to
find faults in one another is marriage.

355
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,380
And from a man's perspective

356
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,550
you can't live together because
you'll constantly think about it.

357
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:15,570
Even if Kyung Soo knows
and they do run away

358
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,660
it's only a matter of
time until they break up.

359
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,770
Of course, of course.

360
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,280
Goodness.

361
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,290
<i>Come to our house and eat dinner.</i>

362
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,950
<i>I don't want to bother you.</i>

363
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,480
<i>You're not bothering us. We're family.</i>

364
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,210
<i>Family?</i>

365
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,730
What are you doing here?

366
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,850
Ah, yes. I was just...

367
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,020
I came for dinner.

368
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:47,130
Oh... let's go somewhere and talk.

369
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,830
You know that I wanted to take you
in as a part of my family, right?

370
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,110
Yes, Father.

371
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:03,350
Then this time, look kindly upon me.

372
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,050
Let go of our Hae Dang.

373
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,750
Father.

374
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,080
You have a lot of love to give.

375
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:29,270
You're angry at your mother right
now because you're upset with her.

376
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:35,560
Later on, you will eventually
forgive your mother.

377
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:45,540
I had hoped you would never find
out and just run away with Hae Dang.

378
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,610
But...

379
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,810
it won't work now that you know.

380
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,080
Father.

381
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,660
Let go of our Hae Dang.

382
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,320
What are you doing here?

383
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,840
I had no place to go.

384
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:20,570
I imagined living
in a world without you.

385
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:29,280
It felt like I was blind again.

386
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,880
It was scary and frustrating.

387
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,560
Don't be scared.

388
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:52,150
I'll always remember you
even if we're not together.

389
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,770
I'm afraid that I'll be lonely.

390
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,990
I'm afraid...

391
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,280
of being so alone again.

392
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,970
I'm scared...

393
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:20,190
that there will be nothing
to look forward to again.

394
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,840
There will be no one...

395
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,810
waiting for me.

396
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,340
To be living those days again...

397
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,900
I'm afraid.

398
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,220
Think of me if you get lonely.

399
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,740
Even though you can't see me...

400
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:51,440
Just know that somewhere out there,
I am thinking of you.

401
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:57,090
Because I will always
be thinking of you.

402
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:04,510
I will never forget you.

403
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,920
Hae Dang.

404
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,320
When you find yourself walking alone

405
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,490
and you feel so lonely that
you can feel your own shadow

406
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,750
think of that shadow as me.

407
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,330
I won't be with you physically

408
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:30,420
but think of my heart,
that's always with you.

409
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,270
Hae Dang.

410
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,990
Don't be lonely.

411
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,710
It's only because you can't see it.

412
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:50,220
Wherever I am, I am always,
without a doubt, thinking of you.

413
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,250
Hae Dang.

414
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,770
I'm back.

415
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,030
Why? Is there a problem?

416
00:36:54,030 --> 00:37:00,700
Well... please find some
work for me to do again.

417
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,710
What do you mean?

418
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:14,200
Yoo Ji Na told Kyung Soo
about Sung Taek.

419
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,380
Are you serious?

420
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:23,910
It's meaningless for us to leave
after everything that's happened.

421
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,270
There was a reason
why I was always so nervous.

422
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,180
Just what is this?

423
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,350
Other people easily get married
and live happily ever after.

424
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,790
What's wrong with you, Hae Dang?

425
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,770
The same thing with that dead guy.

426
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,890
And that guy you're dating right now.

427
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:55,050
It's all because of that one person
in my life who I can't get rid of.

428
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,180
Who is that?

429
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,330
Yoo Ji Na.

430
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:08,500
That woman is probably thinking
the exact same thing as me.

431
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:17,880
<i>I can't lose Hae Dang
because I'm your son.</i>

432
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:22,980
<i>I'd rather forget
the fact that I am your son.</i>

433
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,480
What does he have to say?

434
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:36,650
Of course he says nothing has changed.

435
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,400
How can nothing have changed?

436
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,010
I'll go and talk to him.

437
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,180
I heard from Hae Dang what happened.

438
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,980
You might think that
I ran here to be her protector.

439
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,210
I came because I wanted
to hear your perspective.

440
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,750
I heard from Hae Dang that you
believe nothing has changed.

441
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,030
That is what I think.

442
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:36,960
But it doesn't change the fact
that Yoo Ji Na is your mother.

443
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,600
Weren't you helping us run away?

444
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,860
That was before you found
out about that fact.

445
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,440
Are you really confident about this?

446
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,040
I can live without
ever seeing Yoo Ji Na.

447
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,650
There is no problem at all.

448
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,380
You can't just think about
how you feel right now.

449
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,990
Because marriage is a promise of
being together for a very long time.

450
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,320
I'm not trying to be selfish

451
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,530
and cut ties with Yoo Ji Na because of
how I feel about the current situation.

452
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,970
Have you heard that
Yoo Ji Na got legally married?

453
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,230
I heard.

454
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,480
She's determined to for me to be
Chairman Park Sung Hwan's son.

455
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,730
Even Chairman Park Sung Hwan
says he will accept me as his son.

456
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,970
I hear Chairman Park Sung Hwan and his
sons do not have a good relationship.

457
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,090
And?

458
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:33,840
So, she wants to get rid of you two
and have me receive all of his love.

459
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:40,600
Yoo Ji Na plans on giving me
an opportunity that I can't even imagine.

460
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,530
"An opportunity that you can't imagine?"

461
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,800
Do you understand what that means?

462
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,310
Yoo Ji Na said that, is that it?

463
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,680
If there was even a one percent chance
of living as Yoo Ji Na's son

464
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,210
would I say this to you?

465
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,240
You plan on having your son be
Chairman Park Sung Hwan's son

466
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,380
and throwing me and Hyun Sung to the side

467
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,240
so he can take over the company?

468
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,380
What?

469
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:20,700
If he's my son, isn't he also
Chairman Park's son?

470
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:27,300
Sure, I don't care if your son
becomes Chairman Park's son or not.

471
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,000
But do you think the company
belongs to Chairman Park Sung Hwan?

472
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,010
Then who does it belong to?

473
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,420
Is it yours?

474
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,180
My grandfather built that company
with his blood, sweat, and tears.

475
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,300
What makes you think
your son will possess it?

476
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,130
So you do have some
desire for the company.

477
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,930
I don't care if Hyung Sung takes it.

478
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,270
Because I know that he can
do a better job than I can.

479
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,600
Right now, the company
belongs to Chairman Park.

480
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:59,550
It will only belong to the person
he decides to hand it over to.

481
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,260
Don't be ridiculous.

482
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,040
That's how the world is.

483
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,650
There are people who make
money and people who spend it.

484
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,230
There are people who work
hard to build a company

485
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:14,460
and there are people who get
to enjoy its riches and honor.

486
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,090
Are you just getting in?

487
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,050
I'm coming in.

488
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,170
Listen carefully to what I say
from here on out, Grandmother.

489
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:47,940
Madam Yoo Ji Na is dreaming of making
her son Chairman Park's son

490
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,210
and having him take over
the whole company.

491
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,820
What?

492
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,380
What do you think, Grandmother?

493
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,880
What are you talking about right now?

494
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,480
Did you say those words?

495
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,900
No.

496
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,590
If not, then what is all
this nonsense I'm hearing?

497
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:08,230
There are two legitimate sons
living and breathing in this house.

498
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:10,740
Who are you planning on
giving the company to?

499
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,060
What is this nonsense?

500
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,200
Please calm down.
You're going to collapse again.

501
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,820
Are you crazy?

502
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,690
I know that this company is in your hands

503
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,990
but you're even more arrogant
and shameless than a gangster.

504
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:28,920
If this isn't a gangster than what is?

505
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:32,180
Honey, we need to talk.

506
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:36,610
No! I never said such a thing!

507
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,120
Hyun Joon said that because
he's afraid it might actually come true.

508
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,360
What?

509
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,950
So basically you pretended you
weren't interested, but you really are.

510
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,030
When did I say that?

511
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,640
I never even imagined it in my dreams.

512
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:01,900
You never dreamed of it,
but you told your son, huh?

513
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,160
What?

514
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,950
Your son said it with his own lips.

515
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,940
Chairman Park Sung Hwan and his
sons do not have a good relationship

516
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,750
so that will become an opportunity
your son can't even imagine.

517
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,590
- From his own lips.
- No!

518
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,330
No.

519
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:26,660
Why would he say that
to Park Hyun Joon unless he's crazy?

520
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,280
It's a lie. It's a lie!

521
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,420
There's not even a one percent chance

522
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,560
of him wanting to live
as Yoo Ji Na's son.

523
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:37,230
That's why he told me.

524
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,070
What?

525
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:53,070
What? You're going to give
this company to your child?

526
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,910
You just got married to my son!

527
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,190
Oh my. Goodness.

528
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,290
Grandmother, please calm down.

529
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:05,220
Honey, let's take
Grandmother to her room.

530
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,480
Grandmother, let's go in.

531
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,240
Goodness.

532
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,010
Goodness.

533
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,150
When my son takes over the company...

534
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:27,030
you will be the first one to go.

535
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,370
Fine.

536
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,960
Let's see this through.

537
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,110
Goodness.

538
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:43,400
That monster is eventually
going to be the death of me.

539
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,160
Her son is not even
remotely related to us!

540
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,700
She and Father have talked about it.

541
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,180
There's no way she would've
planned it on her own.

542
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,390
I think Father really lost his mind.

543
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,570
What in the world are you thinking?

544
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:04,350
You said you would treat him
just like one of your own sons.

545
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:08,830
Isn't it possible for him to take over
the company if he is the most loved?

546
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:11,610
Yes, but how can you
actually tell people that?

547
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:15,380
You said you would make him love you.

548
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:20,270
No matter what I said, I haven't decided
who will take over the company yet.

549
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,980
How can your son be so reckless?

550
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,610
Your son?

551
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:32,200
How could he say that to Hyun Joon
if he had any consideration for you?

552
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,330
He's just crazy about that woman.

553
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,400
It's not because he's
crazy about a woman.

554
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,010
It's because he's scared of
what Lee Kyung Soo knows.

555
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,530
What?

556
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,230
Your father suspects he knows something
concerning your mother's death.

557
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,580
That's probably why he threw the bait.

558
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,010
You still don't know your father?

559
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:03,330
He holds a carrot
over his own sons' heads

560
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,770
and antagonized you
two your whole lives.

561
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:12,180
Why would he give everything to
someone who is not his flesh and blood?

562
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:17,370
He might just be doing it for show.

563
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:20,970
To prevent him from opening his
mouth about your mother's death.

564
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:24,710
That's true. He's more
than capable of doing that.

565
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,460
But...

566
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:32,480
I can't believe Yoo Ji Na dared to
expect her son be a prospective heir.

567
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,180
I can't forgive that woman.

568
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,160
Ever.

569
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,630
She's already a part of the family

570
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,700
and there is no tradition
in the household, anyway.

571
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:52,290
So why not bring the stepson in
and have my two sons battle it out.

572
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,390
What?

573
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,690
No wonder Grandmother
said you're a gangster.

574
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,650
I'm disappointed in my sons

575
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:06,250
so I'm thinking of taking a child
not of my flesh and blood as my son.

576
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,390
Understand?

577
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:10,990
He's your son if he's good to you
and if he's not, than he's a stranger?

578
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,780
If that's not a gangster than what is?

579
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:33,530
I need to tell him that Lee Kyung Soo is
the one who got the letter from mother.

580
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,670
Not yet.

581
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,790
Didn't Hyun Joon meet
Yoo Ji Na's son today?

582
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,160
Didn't he hear those
words because they met?

583
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,230
- That's true.
- But...

584
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:49,510
Yoo Ji Na's son, Lee Kyung Soo
can see now.

585
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,790
Hyun Joo can't imagine
that he used to be blind.

586
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:55,270
I think so.

587
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:58,040
So we need to tell him
and get that letter.

588
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,130
We need that letter to discover
the secret behind my mom's death.

589
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,890
I told you that Lee Kyung Soo
lost that letter.

590
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:08,530
We can't force him to give us
the letter when he says he lost it.

591
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,230
Then what do you propose?

592
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,940
No matter what happens, we need
to get our hands on that letter.

593
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,160
How?

594
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,260
He lost it, so how?

595
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,950
I'm pretty sure there will be a chance.

596
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,160
When?

597
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,880
It's your father's weakness that's
related to your mother's death.

598
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,660
We must find it.

599
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,990
That way, we can finally
go up against your father.

600
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:30,920
So when is that exactly?

601
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,590
Why are you in a rush?

602
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:38,180
What does it matter if the company
is not handed over to you?

603
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,150
Are you kidding me?

604
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,170
Rushing this is not
going to bring your mother back.

605
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,660
He used you all this time.

606
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,840
And now, handing over
the company to Hyun Joon

607
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,750
because he's the oldest is
a bit ridiculous, don't you think?

608
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:00,680
I feel sorry for your mother,
but hang in there a little bit longer.

609
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,320
I told you to get your father-in-law.

610
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,190
- He says later.
- Later?

611
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,710
Where is he right now?

612
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,220
Formally tell everyone
at the next board meeting

613
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:33,960
that you will be stepping
down from your position.

614
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,020
Step down from your position,
call Hyun Joon to the company...

615
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,390
and transfer your
responsibilities over to him.

616
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,420
I can't do that.

617
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,300
Are you going to take it
with you to your grave?

618
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:52,200
You need to hand it over before you die.

619
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,350
If you don't think Hyun Joon
is fit to take over

620
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,300
then hand it over to Hyun Sung.

621
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,070
I have not made a decision yet.

622
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:05,640
Are you seriously going to hand
it over to that monster's child?

623
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:10,410
I said I have not made a decision yet.

624
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,540
Then decide now.

625
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:19,110
Whether it will be Hyun Joon or
Hyun Sung, hurry up and decide now.

626
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:32,000
Do you think I destroyed
your father-in-law

627
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,050
and had you inherit the company

628
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,660
just so you could hand it
over to that monster's child?

629
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,280
I got it, so stop it already!

630
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:43,130
I can only take so much!
Stop it already!

631
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:48,220
You were both at the cliff
when your wife died.

632
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,800
I made sure it was taken care of

633
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,410
with a single piece of paper
stating it was suicide.

634
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,700
And?

635
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:04,070
I'm going to have the police
formally investigate it again.

636
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:06,070
I did not kill her.

637
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:09,100
Then go ahead and try to get out of it.

638
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,490
Mother.

639
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:13,770
The way I see it, you're crazy.

640
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,890
You are not in your right mind.

641
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:21,810
Two of your flesh and blood are
living and breathing in this house.

642
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:26,450
You want to hand the company over to a
stranger? You think I'll stand for that?

643
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:33,220
So... what do you plan on
doing against your own son?

644
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,500
You may be my son...

645
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,580
but if you have given up on being
a human being, then I won't stand for it.

646
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:53,440
Every street Park Sung Hwan
walked, I, Sung Kyung Ja was there.

647
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:59,610
In some ways, you...
are a monster I made.

648
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:06,280
So I'm going to end you
with my own hands.

649
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:14,840
It must be time for me
to do something for your late wife.

650
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,170
Mother.

651
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:24,900
Life is so... hopeless.

652
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:32,860
It seems this is the price I must pay...

653
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,650
for your wife's unfair death.

654
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,920
I know what your father
and family are worried about.

655
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:04,440
But my conclusion is just...
leave with that guy.

656
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,150
Hyun Joon.

657
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:13,890
That guy is struggling to do
the right thing by his mother.

658
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,650
But he's trying to choose you.

659
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,620
I feel his sincerity.

660
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,490
He's still young. He might not be
capable of looking at the bigger picture.

661
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:27,810
No.

662
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:31,860
He's young in age but
he knows what he wants.

663
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:38,850
I can't do it for his sake.

664
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,110
You said you love that man.

665
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:47,610
No matter what the circumstance,
that man will not abandon you.

666
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,050
It's hard for me to say
this with my own lips.

667
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:56,500
But who else will say
these words to you if not me?

668
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,700
Leave, even if your whole
family tries to stop you.

669
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,350
Leave, even if the whole
world tries to stop you.

670
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:08,880
It's okay. He will
protect to you to the very end.

671
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:14,520
He may be younger than you,
but he is definitely a man.

672
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:17,340
So trust him and leave.

673
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,170
Hyun Joon.

674
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:24,370
Don't back away and don't
let people push you away.

675
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:28,040
Think of yourself and be
confident for even one moment.

676
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,470
Please be happy.

677
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:57,930
<i>It's okay. He will
protect you to the very end.</i>

678
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:02,420
<i>He may be younger than you,
but he is definitely a man.</i>

679
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:05,060
<i>So trust him and leave.</i>

680
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,790
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

681
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:14,610
Of all the things to say
to Park Hyun Joon, you had to say that?

682
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:17,360
How does that make me look
in front of Chairman Park

683
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,580
and what do you think those
people will think of you?

684
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,920
I don't care what those
people think of me.

685
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,790
Why don't you care? Why? Why?

686
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:26,320
Who are you doing this for?
Making me his son...

687
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,390
For once, please tell the truth!

688
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:33,280
Of course it's for you. I can tell you
12 times and it'll still be for you.

689
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,750
Then listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

690
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:44,360
I was under Madam Choi Kyung Ae's
care before she passed away.

691
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,940
What?

692
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:59,150
I was blind, looking for my
mother, and she felt sorry for me.

693
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:04,060
She comforted me and
held me in her arms.

694
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,090
She held my trembling
hand and put me to bed.

695
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:19,010
You expect me to play Chairman Park's
son while he has two biological sons?

696
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,790
I'm sorry for her...

697
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:38,830
but there's no reason for you
to not be Chairman Park's son.

698
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,170
You said you wanted
to pay back in kind, right?

699
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:45,300
Give up on making me
into Chairman Park's son.

700
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,780
I can't do that.

701
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,690
Who is it for? Is it for me?

702
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:53,350
Or is it for you to have
your son be the heir?

703
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,650
I'm scared of you now.

704
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:05,360
The type of person you are,
what you did, what you're doing

705
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,640
and what you plan on doing.

706
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,770
You really scare me.

707
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:12,320
What?

708
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,440
I'm scary?

709
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,410
It's not for me.

710
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:19,900
It's for yourself.

711
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:24,550
You want your son to
beat his biological sons

712
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:31,110
so you can have that man's
power, money, and authority.

713
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:35,860
And of course, you want to get rid
of all the ladies of that household.

714
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,670
That way, you can do as you please.

715
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,390
That is the truth.

716
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:45,940
The truth is very cruel.

717
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:48,540
Fine.

718
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:53,850
If you truly want me
to become Chairman Park's son

719
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,020
I will become his son.

720
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,080
Solely for you.

721
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:00,420
In exchange...

722
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,970
I'm going to marry Hae Dang.

723
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,280
- What?
- I'm going to marry Hae Dang

724
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,040
and we will live as Chairman Park's
son and daughter-in-law.

725
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,150
- Absolutely not!
- Then what?

726
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,340
I don't love Chairman Park
and I didn't marry him

727
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,310
to make Jung Hae Dang
a wealthy daughter-in-law!

728
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:20,450
Then what can I do?

729
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,660
Children are so... scary.

730
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:34,250
That's right. I committed
a lot of sins during my life.

731
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:38,840
You won't believe how sincere
I am no matter what I do.

732
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:45,040
I can't relay my sincerity
to my own child.

733
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,350
But I swear to you, it's all for you.

734
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,360
It's for you.

735
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,330
Are you done packing Dad's meal?

736
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:08,360
Yeah. I'll take it to him.
Go in and rest.

737
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:11,460
I'm not even working.
I don't need to rest. I'll take it.

738
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:23,840
<i>Don't back away and don't
let people push you away.</i>

739
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:27,830
<i>Think of yourself and be
confident for even one moment.</i>

740
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:30,540
<i>Please be happy.</i>

741
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:40,280
Ah, she forgot the soup.
Oh goodness.

742
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:17,110
Let's go somewhere and talk.

743
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:19,130
I need to give my dad his meal.

744
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:21,210
It's one last request.

745
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:29,770
Leave without Kyung Soo and go
somewhere where he can't find you.

746
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,420
What?

747
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,340
Don't worry about your family.

748
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,840
I'll make sure they
live 10 times better

749
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,800
than what you can provide for them.

750
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,890
I can give you everything
I have if you want.

751
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:46,180
So please, please...

752
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,580
Go somewhere where
Kyung Soo can't find you.

753
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:58,980
If he hadn't been abandoned by me...

754
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:04,480
he would never have fallen in
love with an older woman like you.

755
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:10,970
He was blind and hurt at
a young age because of his mother.

756
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:14,240
That's why he can't leave you.

757
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:20,300
If not, there's no way a guy his
age would be so hung up on you.

758
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,860
That is how scary scars are.

759
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:33,930
As long as you are with him,
he will never be able to leave you.

760
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:37,740
What would you do if he were your son?

761
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:41,700
He's been through everything and
he has a bright future ahead of him.

762
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:45,180
He's thinking of dedicating his life
to a woman eight years older than him.

763
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,010
How would you feel?

764
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:52,790
And what if it was because of
the pain his mother caused him?

765
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:56,520
How would you feel?

766
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,530
Plus, the fact that his future wife

767
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:03,480
and his mother once lived
with the same man...

768
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:12,830
And he has to live with that
memory for the rest of his life.

769
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:17,910
What do you think that will do to him?

770
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:26,820
I am a mother and I can't have
my child live a life like that.

771
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:37,450
I understand what you are saying.

772
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,640
But...

773
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:44,190
I can't do it.

774
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,580
Why not?

775
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:52,220
I'm thinking of trusting Kyung Soo.

776
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:56,060
Even if I come to regret it later...

777
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:00,870
Even if there comes a time when I
feel so sorry for Kyung Soo...

778
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:05,850
Right now, just for this moment,
I'm going to trust Kyung Soo

779
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:08,830
and do whatever he says.

780
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,860
What?

781
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:18,460
I also have the right to be happy.

782
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:35,200
Then... let's both die together.

783
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:41,670
Let's die together! Let's die together!
Let's die together!

784
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:47,080
I can't see my son sacrifice
himself for your happiness.

785
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,960
It's too sad and I feel so bad.

786
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,710
So let's just die together!
Let's die together!

787
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:55,160
- Why are you doing this?
- Let's die together.

788
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,110
This will all end if we die together.

789
01:04:57,110 --> 01:05:00,920
If we die together, my poor
son can end it with you.

790
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,960
Die! Let's die together!
Let's die together!

791
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,800
- No!
- Let's die together!

792
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,460
Hae Dang!

793
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:28,440
Hae Soo. Hae Soo.

794
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,460
Hae Soo!

795
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,980
Hae Soo!

796
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:36,840
Hae Soo! Hae Soo! Hae Soo!

797
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:46,230
Hae Soo! Hae Soo!

798
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:48,130
Hae Soo!

799
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:52,900
Hae Soo! Hae Soo! Hae Soo, wake up!

800
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,940
Hae Soo!

801
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:58,720
Hae Soo!

802
