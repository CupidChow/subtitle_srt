<i>[Episode 2]</i>

3
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:12,166
Yes, come on in!

4
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,727
Welcome! Two people!

00:00:14,727 --> 00:00:19,038
<i>[The Singing Sightseeing Medley Night!]
[Yoo Jui Na]</i>

6
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:35,484
Next up, the impersonator
of the popular singer Yoo Ji Na!

7
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:38,119
It's Yoo Jui Na!

8
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,435
Please give her a round of applause!

9
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:45,226
Hello! Hello!

10
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:51,023
I'm the best Yoo Ji Na impersonator,
Yoo Jui Na.

11
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:56,796
Because the weather is gloomy,
why don't we start with a hot song?

12
00:00:56,796 --> 00:00:59,753
That's right! There's nothing to it!

13
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:03,161
Nothing will stop us
from going crazy tonight!

14
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:07,245
This is Yoo Ji Na's
hot new song, "Emerald!"

15
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:09,343
Let's go!

16
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,163
If you think of Yoo Ji Na,
this expression comes to mind.

17
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:27,972
Open your eyes wide, like this.

18
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:31,604
What do you think? Do I look sexy?

19
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:34,455
Those men are going wild.

20
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,762
Are you happy just watching me?

21
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:39,192
Open your eyes as wide as--

22
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,776
<i>Whether you mock me by impersonating me</i>

23
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:43,926
or make money off of my hit songs

24
00:02:43,926 --> 00:02:47,219
or depend on my songs to live,
I don't care

25
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,390
so stay out of my sight from now on.
Get out of here right now.

26
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,621
Get out of here!

27
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:57,930
- What's going on?
- What's wrong with her?

28
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,675
Jui Na! Keep going! Keep talking!

29
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:04,776
What are you doing?

30
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:13,883
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I will compensate you for this!

31
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:20,705
How about pollack?
I will give you pollack on the house!

32
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:23,769
I'll give you 10 pieces each!
No, six pieces!

33
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:30,116
What was that about?

34
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:33,657
I'm human too.

35
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:40,087
How do you expect me to impersonate
someone else 365 days a year?

36
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,055
- What?
- I said, I'm human too.

37
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:45,550
Not this again.

38
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,262
Wow, you're driving me crazy here.

39
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:08,304
<i>This is why I shouldn't become close
to someone who has nothing to lose.</i>

40
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:10,844
It's because they're careless.

41
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:16,149
If I embrace them out of pity,
I'll end up paying the price.

42
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,838
Stop the car.

43
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:05,266
I'm sorry to bother you
when you're so busy.

44
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:15,555
Geez, I'm so sorry.

45
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:20,553
- I have to get back to work soon.
- Yes, then...

46
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,612
What was it...

47
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:29,146
My child has admired you for a long time.

48
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:33,492
And it wasn't because she wanted to
benefit from you, but the truth is...

49
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:37,062
I know you helped her in many ways

50
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:39,567
but the thing is...

51
00:05:41,814 --> 00:05:44,177
That girl...

52
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,935
doesn't have anyone
to rely on in this world.

53
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:51,165
She has you.

54
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:52,875
No.

55
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,540
Even if she likes me
and pities me...

56
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,884
I am unable...

57
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:03,956
to be a father she can rely on.

58
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:07,591
I heard from one of her siblings

59
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:10,764
that after her mother passed away

60
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:14,040
she was living in a house without a roof.

61
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:17,365
She doesn't have anyone
who can protect her from the rain

62
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:19,982
yet she has a lot on her shoulders.

63
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:24,918
That's the kind of pitiful child
she is to me.

64
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:33,035
When she had no one
to lean on, she met you.

65
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,690
Yes.

66
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,942
I'm sure just watching you
gave her strength.

67
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:42,598
- I actually haven't done much for her.
- Ma'am.

68
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:45,884
Please forgive my child just this once.

69
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:48,095
Please drop the honorifics.

70
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:50,649
I feel bad if you call me "ma'am."

71
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:54,627
Ma'am. I only have one wish.

72
00:06:55,437 --> 00:07:00,396
I haven't given anything
to that child in my life

73
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:03,550
but before I'm dead...

74
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,216
I want to do something
for her before I die.

75
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:10,531
She's so young.

76
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:15,408
But when I watch her walk
in front of me, I tremble with pity.

77
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:20,112
At that age, she's working
to send my other kids to school

78
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:23,523
so I'm unable to send her off
for marriage.

79
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:27,413
I knew she was dating someone
from the beginning

80
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,850
but I pretended like I didn't know.

81
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:33,062
Ma'am.

82
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:37,959
As her incapable father,
I'm begging you. Please forgive her.

83
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:41,473
Please forgive her.

84
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:23,691
<i>Did you see if she
killed them or saved them?</i>

85
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:25,663
And you.

86
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:29,154
What? She's famous in Gwangju?

87
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,062
Yoo Ji Na isn't from Gwangju.
She went to high school in Cheongju!

88
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:39,730
How dare you talk about something
without any basis?

89
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,221
You're so pathetic you wouldn't even
make eye contact with her in real life.

90
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,884
Is Yoo Ji Na your toy?

91
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:49,922
Is she a toy you can play with
when you're stressed?

92
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,212
I told you to stop!

93
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:54,182
What are you going to do?

94
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,113
Are you going to hit me?

95
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:59,761
Fine. Hit me. Hit me!

96
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:04,409
I won't sing until I lose my voice,
and earn money a different way!

97
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:07,097
- Hit me! Hit me! Hit me!
- Geez, seriously!

98
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:11,044
You're annoying me!
And she graduated in Gwangju!

99
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,927
- It was Cheongju!
- It was Gwangju.

100
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,256
It was Cheongju!

101
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:23,240
<i>It was an honor to meet you. Thank you.</i>

102
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,696
Stay healthy. Goodbye!

103
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:30,903
Stay healthy! I'll work hard!

104
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:54,989
<i>You're saying in order to pay
for your siblings' tuition</i>

105
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,331
you gave up your dream
of becoming a singer

106
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:00,923
and became an impersonator to make money?

107
00:11:00,923 --> 00:11:04,712
It's because I worked
very hard all my life

108
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:10,025
with the thought of staying alive
until all my siblings graduate college.

109
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:24,230
<i>I thought you were a cold person</i>

110
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,994
<i>but I'm relieved to know that
you're a warm person.</i>

111
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:43,400
That's enough. It's overflowing.
Let's toast. It's overflowing.

112
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:47,778
Enjoy your drinks.

113
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:52,474
I need to prepare for my next
performance. Have a good night.

114
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:56,630
Hey, where are you going?
Sit down for a little longer.

115
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:01,241
Hey, what are you doing? Get ready.
I apologize. I apologize.

116
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:03,664
Geez, I'm losing my appetite.

117
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:06,775
Hey, you're the boss.
What are you teaching your guys?

118
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:10,408
Manager Kim, don't be like that.
Ask someone else to replace her.

119
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:13,488
Pardon? I can't do that.

120
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:17,320
I'm sorry, sir.
I must perform my own number.

121
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,509
Wow. Hey, when I called you cute,
it must have gotten to your head!

122
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,576
You have no right to act naive!

123
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,904
- Let go of me.
- What?

124
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:28,575
Let go of me.

125
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:33,029
You're dead. I better teach you a lesson!

126
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:36,730
Hey, I can take her outside, right?
Follow me.

127
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,131
Hey, did you come prepared to die today?

128
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:40,658
What's this?

129
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:52,246
A singer's job is to sing.
Is she your toy?

130
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:57,278
I dare you to bother her again.
I'll ruin you.

131
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:04,278
Yoo Ji Na, you're so cool!

132
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:07,835
Hey, is that Yoo Ji Na?
She's a total gangster!

133
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:10,293
Yoo Ji Na, it's an honor!

134
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:13,681
Please perform for us one day!

135
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,879
Thank you. Thank you.

136
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:35,605
Do you know what I did first
when I auditioned for this job?

137
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:39,625
It wasn't my facial expression.

138
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,828
It was my walk when I came in.

139
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:49,030
Your expression is important.

140
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:53,398
"Don't mess with me.
I'm Yoo Ji Na."

141
00:13:53,398 --> 00:13:55,436
It's that kind of expression, isn't it?

142
00:13:56,716 --> 00:14:00,241
Let's see. That man didn't come today.

143
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:04,130
You know that man
who's always here looking for me.

144
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:09,870
I wonder what he's doing
on a night like this.

145
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,647
Everyone, you will be shocked
to see the next performance.

146
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:18,341
It's a performance you will never
be able to see again.

147
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:22,408
She's an eternal diva that you all love.

148
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:25,969
She's not an impersonator of Yoo Ji Na

149
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:31,856
but the real Yoo Ji Na.

150
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:33,484
Here she is!

151
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,864
The truth is...

152
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:07,008
It was all anger that was
directed toward myself.

153
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:11,200
It was the rage that is
directed toward my past.

154
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:16,525
I didn't want to face it,
so I kept it hidden inside.

155
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,360
But when it explodes, I end up taking
it out on innocent people around me.

156
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:30,557
Are you curious about who that child is?

157
00:16:32,164 --> 00:16:36,525
I took my anger out on you
like a crazed madwoman

158
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:38,511
so I'm sure you guessed right.

159
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:43,091
No. I'm not curious.

160
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:48,739
Don't worry too much.
I know I'm lacking

161
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:51,941
but I'm not completely clueless.

162
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:57,990
If you knew...

163
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,888
what an evil and shameless person I am

164
00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:06,787
you wouldn't see me
as a human being either.

165
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:09,275
Especially from your standpoint

166
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:14,349
as someone who lives the way
you do with your siblings.

167
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:20,256
Sometimes...

168
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:25,066
It feels like life is a joke.

169
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:30,181
The star, Yoo Ji Na,
that everyone knows about...

170
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:35,382
and my true self.

171
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:41,627
There are times when
I want to tell someone

172
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,827
about the life I lived.

173
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:47,711
Even if it's just one person.

174
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:51,047
If it's something
you don't want to tell everyone

175
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:54,714
don't tell that one person either.

176
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,657
You'll regret it.

177
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:07,332
I didn't expect something so deep
from someone who seems transparent.

178
00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:10,800
In my life, I suffered as well.

179
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:15,657
I'm in trouble.

180
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,925
I think I'm starting to like you.

181
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:23,630
It becomes bothersome
when I start liking people.

182
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:28,277
I like you too.

183
00:18:30,655 --> 00:18:34,412
- I heard you're dating someone.
- Did my dad visit you?

184
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:36,479
What kind of person is he?

185
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:40,411
- He's unemployed.
- Oh my.

186
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:43,439
You must love him.

187
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:46,943
When someone dates an unemployed person,
does it always mean love?

188
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,807
He gives me a ride
when I go to events in the countryside.

189
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:55,863
I guess I can call him my manager,
but I pay him in allowance money.

190
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:59,182
I'm sure you have your reasons.

191
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:01,614
Would you like to meet him?

192
00:19:01,614 --> 00:19:03,250
Me?

193
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:06,699
No. Are you crazy?

194
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,607
"I mean, how could a young woman
be so close-minded?"

195
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:20,010
"People make mistakes!"

196
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,324
"Even if you're a star,
this is unacceptable!"

197
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:28,280
I gave her a scolding as an older adult.

198
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:33,817
- What are you looking at?
- Fat chance.

199
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:35,940
Fat chance?

200
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,438
Wait, why are you speaking
so carelessly, Mother-in-law?

201
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:42,067
When did I do that, Father-in-law?

202
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:47,053
Wait, are you assuming
I cried and begged her?

203
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,763
You're so naive, you even say it
through your own lips.

204
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:57,318
- Hey, Mother-in-law!
- Yes, Father-in-law.

205
00:19:57,318 --> 00:20:01,251
Even if we're elementary school
classmates and friends from the same town

206
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:03,537
we're in-laws now

207
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:07,125
so shouldn't we be embarrassed to have
no formality in front of the kids?

208
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:11,180
Why are we talking about formality again
when it's so unnecessary?

209
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:17,210
Now that spring has come around,
it's bringing back old memories.

210
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,838
- Geez, here you go again!
- What old memories?

211
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:22,946
You know, in our first year
of high school

212
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:26,921
whenever I was about to go home,
she'd wait for me out front.

213
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,082
Stop it!

214
00:20:28,082 --> 00:20:33,547
The class president of our school
was quite a catch, you know!

215
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:37,134
Her standards were just as high
back then as they are now.

216
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:39,614
- I told you to stop!
- Why?

217
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,912
I should finish what I started!

218
00:20:41,912 --> 00:20:46,616
Later on, she even wrote
long, 10-page letters

219
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:51,633
and cried her eyes out
as she delivered them.

220
00:20:55,381 --> 00:21:00,723
Um, I will tell you the continuation
of this story later on in Part Two.

221
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:04,307
You were pretty cool back then.

222
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:08,241
Yeah, it was a historic
dating incident at our school.

223
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:10,905
Isn't that so, Mother-in-law?

224
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:16,289
I'm not the only one who left
a historic incident at our school.

225
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:20,209
- What do you mean?
- In third grade on a field trip.

226
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:22,920
Back then, our parents packed
hard-boiled eggs for our field trips.

227
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,526
They usually pack a few,
so we always had some left over.

228
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:26,821
Don't do it.

229
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:30,034
"Do you have any eggs left over?"

230
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:33,943
He had a huge appetite,
so he always mooched off others.

231
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:38,415
- Hey, stop it!
- Why? You had your turn!

232
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:43,810
Later, we lined up to go home,
but he was nowhere in sight.

233
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,904
When I turned around,
he was very far back

234
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:50,262
limping like this.

235
00:21:50,262 --> 00:21:52,285
Why was he doing that?

236
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:55,622
- Why else?
- Baek Mi Sook!

237
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,353
Dad! That's too much!

238
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:03,238
Hey, what are you talking about?

239
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:07,252
On our way down,
there were no bathrooms anywhere!

240
00:22:07,252 --> 00:22:12,377
I held it in, thinking one
would show up at any moment...

241
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:16,915
You should have seen
the look on his face!

242
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:24,511
If we had cell phones back then,
we would have taken pictures for records!

243
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,877
- Are you finished?
- I'm not finished!

244
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:31,750
I will continue this story
in Part Two as well.

245
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,109
Geez! Hey!

246
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,065
Geez, there's nothing
she can't talk about.

247
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:46,125
Why do you always start
when you don't stand a chance?

248
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:50,159
How will I look at my kids from now on?

249
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:56,105
It's Sunday.
Why don't you do other things as well?

250
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:58,596
Do you have a lot to study for?

251
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:00,432
Mother.

252
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:03,970
Why are you scaring me
with that low tone?

253
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,000
- Didn't Sister-in-law get a divorce?
- How would I know?

254
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,144
At first, she was supposed to stay
for a few days.

255
00:23:11,794 --> 00:23:16,255
I'm living in my in-laws' home.
Please consider my situation as well.

256
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:18,722
I'm also being careful
around the family members downstairs.

257
00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:23,503
I even made kimchi for dumplings
when I'm not feeling so well.

258
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:28,121
Your father doesn't eat dumplings
that are store bought.

259
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:31,933
Gosh. My back.
It hurts from making kimchi today.

260
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:34,334
Gosh. Gosh.

261
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:37,086
Oh my goodness.

262
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:45,518
Anyway, who is that person?

263
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:47,928
It's her niece.

264
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:50,326
She did that when it's her niece?

265
00:23:50,326 --> 00:23:55,502
If she's a celebrity, she probably
just tried to avoid misunderstandings.

266
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:58,030
If that's the case,
why take it out on someone else?

267
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:01,959
- I better go talk to her.
- Hey!

268
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:04,760
Please just stay still!

269
00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:07,925
Did... Did you just yell at me?

270
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:11,451
I want you to sit still
instead of causing a ruckus.

271
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,113
Why did you yell
at someone who was eating?

272
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:23,431
She's not someone under you.
She's your older sister.

273
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:28,063
My wife is sensitive
because of her as it is.

274
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:35,107
In life,
we run into difficult situations.

275
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:38,284
Who else could she lean on
in her situation?

276
00:24:38,284 --> 00:24:42,612
Father-in-law, I have no excuses.

277
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:45,756
Even if she's a good person

278
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:48,717
who doesn't have their own opinions?

279
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:51,127
Let's consider her side as well.

280
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:53,912
The truth is, she's just feeding her

281
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:57,253
but she doesn't have anyone
to help her financially.

282
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:05,027
Last time, you should have seen how happy
she was after receiving a used coat.

283
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:07,522
It made me sad and bitter inside.

284
00:25:08,903 --> 00:25:11,343
It's because I'm so lacking.

285
00:25:18,088 --> 00:25:21,857
Hey. Hey. Let's talk for a minute.

286
00:25:26,212 --> 00:25:29,458
I'm sorry about earlier.

287
00:25:30,173 --> 00:25:32,755
It was in front of our family
from downstairs.

288
00:25:34,548 --> 00:25:37,720
- What?
- Buy yourself something nice.

289
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,042
What is this? Is it money?

290
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:42,095
Hey, put it away!

291
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:44,797
Hey, I should check how much it is--

292
00:25:44,797 --> 00:25:47,967
Hey, go inside and check!

293
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,642
- Check in your room!
- Fine! Fine!

294
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,704
Did you give her money?

295
00:25:56,704 --> 00:26:01,787
What? No, I was just...
No. That's not it.

296
00:26:01,787 --> 00:26:05,439
Hey, let go of me!

297
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,938
Why should I meet that woman?

298
00:26:07,938 --> 00:26:09,826
Figure it out!

299
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:13,762
Hey. Wait, hey! Hey!

300
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:15,921
You must have waited for a while!

301
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,923
Not at all.

302
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,160
What are you doing? Say hello.
Don't you know who she is?

303
00:26:27,243 --> 00:26:30,832
What was that? Greet her properly.

304
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,753
Hello, nice to meet you.

305
00:26:35,753 --> 00:26:39,432
It's not our first time meeting.
We already met last time.

306
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:42,952
Oh, that time when I gave you
that necklace in the car.

307
00:26:42,952 --> 00:26:45,959
Oh! I'm sorry.

308
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:49,542
- But what shall we do today?
- Good question.

309
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:52,978
What should we do? How about a movie?

310
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,707
- A movie?
- I hate movies!

311
00:26:55,707 --> 00:26:57,719
I hate sitting for hours
in a movie theater.

312
00:26:57,719 --> 00:27:00,859
Then what should we do?
How about riding bikes?

313
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:02,247
Are we children?

314
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:05,180
What do you two normally do for fun?

315
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,801
We don't have much time to play.

316
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:12,856
When we have free time,
we eat ramen at home and sleep.

317
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:14,578
You sleep?

318
00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:18,002
But the three of us can't do that.

319
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:21,835
- Let's go fishing then!
- Geez, I hate that the most.

320
00:27:21,835 --> 00:27:25,077
You'll go fishing while I sit
in timeout by myself.

321
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,298
It's not by yourself. There's two of you.

322
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:29,926
Let's go!

323
00:27:32,704 --> 00:27:35,111
He's not the soft type.

324
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,993
He's just being shy. He's embarrassed.

325
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:39,496
Really?

326
00:27:47,912 --> 00:27:52,160
You can stay. I just need to get changed.
I should dress comfortably, right?

327
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,548
Don't try to look cool.
Dress warmly. It's still cold out.

328
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,012
What's wrong with him today?

329
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:05,717
What? He's just worried I'll be cold.
He's pretty manly.

330
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,567
But he's not the manly type.

331
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:12,763
Why is he straining himself
to be manly today?

332
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:14,993
I'll just be 10 minutes.

333
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,663
Why am I so excited?
It's nothing special.

334
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:41,922
Walk slowly! Let's go together.

335
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,241
She's keeping up just fine.

336
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:47,537
I think I should wait in the car.
I feel like people will mob me.

337
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:53,230
Oh, please do that then. I'll shop
for some basic groceries for our meals.

338
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:55,756
Hey.

339
00:28:55,756 --> 00:29:00,247
Who said you can stay in the car?
You should shop with us if you're here.

340
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:12,084
If you make a big deal out of it,
people will actually see you.

341
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,174
What are you doing?

342
00:29:18,647 --> 00:29:20,396
You look prettier that way.

343
00:29:22,855 --> 00:29:25,549
We won't be able to shop
if we get mobbed.

344
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:29,842
Pick out some vegetables.
I'll get the pork belly.

345
00:29:29,842 --> 00:29:34,625
Who's staring? No one's staring at you.

346
00:29:37,094 --> 00:29:41,954
Yeah, no one recognizes me.

347
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:45,458
Is it that scary to face people?

348
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,686
I'm not scared!

349
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:53,002
You should live life with other people.

350
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:55,499
Do you plan on
only watching other people?

351
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:56,833
I'm only watching other people?

352
00:29:56,833 --> 00:30:00,980
Isn't being a celebrity a job
that you have so you can earn money?

353
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,769
Yet you're constantly whining about
your popularity going down.

354
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:09,869
That's not necessarily true. Even if I
lose popularity, I made enough already.

355
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:12,990
- As you probably know.
- Then what is it?

356
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,934
Then it's just a disease! Claustrophobia.

357
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:19,554
- Hey!
- Yes?

358
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:23,721
I mean, excuse me. How could you make
a healthy person into a mental patient?

359
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:29,310
Well, it seems like your job is
to stay home and drink by yourself.

360
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,084
Then you'll actually get sick.

361
00:30:32,084 --> 00:30:36,380
That's why you shouldn't be
afraid of facing people

362
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,509
and come out to the real world,
if it's not too difficult.

363
00:30:44,692 --> 00:30:47,836
Did Hae Dang tell you that I got angry
at her over a necklace?

364
00:30:47,836 --> 00:30:50,965
Are you taking
your girlfriend's side right now?

365
00:30:51,674 --> 00:30:54,628
Do you think Hae Dang is like you?

366
00:30:54,628 --> 00:30:57,001
How old are you?

367
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:12,654
Why are you dumping these in here?

368
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:15,565
We'll go broke at this rate!

369
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,545
Geez, that...

370
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:27,630
Why am I angry because of him?

371
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:03,295
- When are we eating pork belly?
- We can't eat it here.

372
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:06,582
- We'll eat it at our guest house.
- I see.

373
00:32:06,582 --> 00:32:10,868
- You must be hungry.
- No, that's okay. Let's have coffee.

374
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:14,201
Sung Taek! Let's drink coffee!

375
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:33,667
Gosh, it's colder than I thought.

376
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:37,945
- I told you to dress warmly.
- I didn't know it'd be this cold.

377
00:32:37,945 --> 00:32:41,272
That's okay! Don't worry about it!

378
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,634
I said I'm okay!

379
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:55,436
Isn't this strange? It doesn't suit me...

380
00:32:57,567 --> 00:32:59,849
It doesn't suit me though.

381
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:02,647
Who are you trying to impress?

382
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:10,090
What's this? What is this smell?

383
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:14,819
It smells like you haven't
washed it in five years!

384
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:17,181
Stop acting like a clean freak.

385
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:23,009
Wow. The coffee is delicious.

386
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:27,482
It's really delicious when you
drink coffee at a place like this.

387
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:42,696
Oh my goodness.

388
00:33:43,328 --> 00:33:47,682
They say a princess-in-law
is the worst you can have.

389
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:54,308
It's a relief that I have an appropriate
granddaughter-in-law like you.

390
00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:58,007
If it weren't for you, this marriage
wouldn't have been possible.

391
00:33:58,007 --> 00:34:00,923
My parents are forever grateful for it.

392
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:02,789
No need for that.

393
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:07,330
You grew up learning
from your modest parents

394
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:11,072
which is why I know
you'll stay nicely by my side.

395
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,896
Thank you for looking favorably upon me.

396
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:28,668
- Hello, Yoon Hee.
- Is Grandmother home?

397
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:39,516
Oh my. This is so beautiful.

398
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:42,235
The human cultural asset
professor made this.

399
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:44,411
How did you acquire such a precious item?

400
00:34:44,411 --> 00:34:46,429
I'm relieved you like it.

401
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:52,523
It sure is different
when an educated man sends a gift.

402
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:56,083
- Please tell him I said thank you.
- Yes.

403
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:58,764
Gosh, after your mother-in-law

404
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:02,634
abandoned the world,
the women left in her household

405
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:06,929
grew up in a humble environment,
which seemed unfortunate to others.

406
00:35:07,512 --> 00:35:12,528
When you told me you wanted to join
my family, I couldn't have been happier.

407
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:15,192
How is the president doing?

408
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:19,304
He's very worried that
I haven't married yet at such a late age.

409
00:35:19,304 --> 00:35:23,739
Don't worry about that!
You're already a part of our family!

410
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:28,614
What are you doing?
Bring her something to drink.

411
00:35:30,844 --> 00:35:32,751
What would you like?

412
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:35,391
Yoon Hee, we have the Omija tea
that you like.

413
00:35:35,391 --> 00:35:40,027
You can't call her "Yoon Hee."
She's already family.

414
00:35:40,027 --> 00:35:42,632
Call her "sister-in-law" from now on!

415
00:35:43,597 --> 00:35:47,221
Then can you bring me
a cup of Omija tea?

416
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:49,543
I'll get it ready.

417
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:53,393
- Sister-in-law.
- Thank you.

418
00:36:00,556 --> 00:36:03,567
- I'm going on a business trip.
- I prepared your things.

419
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:05,675
I'm going to leave as soon as I change.

420
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:09,913
Grandmother, I'm here.

421
00:36:11,722 --> 00:36:16,530
She's hard on me already and now
she's out to get her grandson's wife.

422
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,766
Did something happen?

423
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:20,972
She says a princess-in-law
is the worst to have.

424
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:26,431
Who's the person who birthed
an heir for a mere clerk?

425
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:30,237
That old lady made her
commit suicide by harassing her.

426
00:36:30,237 --> 00:36:31,670
Lower your voice.

427
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,262
If she was old, I wouldn't fall for her,
but because she's smart too...

428
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:38,802
She knows how to irritate someone
without lifting a single finger.

429
00:36:38,802 --> 00:36:41,733
Are you going to say everything
you want from now on?

430
00:36:43,797 --> 00:36:48,974
<i>Hong Yoon Hee, let's wait and see
if you can marry Park Hyun Joon.</i>

431
00:36:53,552 --> 00:36:55,831
She told me to stay for dinner.

432
00:36:55,831 --> 00:37:00,960
I bet it's not comfortable to come here
when Brother-in-law isn't here.

433
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,958
Not necessarily.

434
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:07,887
You look like a crown princess who was
left alone after the crown prince died.

435
00:37:08,722 --> 00:37:12,106
But then again, the way
Father hates Brother-in-law

436
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:15,757
isn't too different from a king
and crown prince relationship.

437
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:18,706
- Go Na Kyung.
- Yes, Sister-in-law.

438
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:22,030
Do you know how I can tell
if someone's from a lowly household?

439
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:25,175
They don't know their place.

440
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:35,184
What does Brother-in-law do
in his free time?

441
00:37:35,184 --> 00:37:37,871
There's a lot of fun things
to do in America.

442
00:37:37,871 --> 00:37:40,458
He's in America?

443
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:44,510
- Then where else could he be?
- He came back to Korea a few days ago.

444
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:49,922
You didn't know about that?

445
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:57,664
I might not know my place
because I'm from a lowly family

446
00:37:57,664 --> 00:38:01,387
but I know how to differentiate
between a fight I can win

447
00:38:01,387 --> 00:38:03,851
and a fight I can't win.

448
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:11,226
- Go inside and make the rice.
- Yeah, I'll wash the rice.

449
00:38:16,938 --> 00:38:19,306
What do you want me to do with that?

450
00:38:19,306 --> 00:38:21,262
Are you telling me to wash them?

451
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:23,157
Me?

452
00:38:27,384 --> 00:38:30,333
You don't give me a break.

453
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:46,039
I always wondered
why people came to these places

454
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:48,110
but now that I'm here, I understand.

455
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,634
This isn't your first time, is it?

456
00:38:49,634 --> 00:38:52,896
Why would I come here
if it's not for a shoot?

457
00:38:53,686 --> 00:38:56,213
Where do you spend all your money?

458
00:38:57,764 --> 00:39:01,155
But do you never look
at the person you're talking to?

459
00:39:01,155 --> 00:39:03,101
There's nothing to look at.

460
00:39:12,318 --> 00:39:13,731
Here.

461
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:16,715
- No garlic, right?
- Of course.

462
00:39:23,117 --> 00:39:25,751
Is the meat cooked right?

463
00:39:30,398 --> 00:39:33,909
- You'll know if you try it.
- Why are you staring at me now?

464
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:36,914
You told me to look at you
when I talk to you.

465
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,983
- Did you wash your hands?
- You have mysophobia too?

466
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:56,931
The meat was cooked well.
It's delicious.

467
00:39:56,931 --> 00:40:01,579
The Korean seasoned
green onions bring pork belly to life.

468
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:09,889
How many years has it been
since you two met?

469
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:14,588
- It's been 10 years.
- 10 years?

470
00:40:16,644 --> 00:40:18,675
You're pretty much married.

471
00:40:18,675 --> 00:40:21,264
You must be sick of me.

472
00:40:21,264 --> 00:40:24,081
Aren't you sick of me yet?

473
00:40:24,081 --> 00:40:27,297
I cheated on you more than
12 times in my mind.

474
00:40:27,297 --> 00:40:30,286
What? You did what?

475
00:40:30,286 --> 00:40:32,528
- You cheated?
- Don't do that.

476
00:40:32,528 --> 00:40:34,822
- Gosh.
- I told you to stop!

477
00:40:34,822 --> 00:40:38,773
- Why not? Why not?
- Hey, I told you to stop!

478
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:41,268
- Hey, okay! I'm sorry!
- You don't listen!

479
00:40:41,268 --> 00:40:44,326
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

480
00:40:44,326 --> 00:40:46,313
Stop it already!

481
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:49,824
You shouldn't have an excessive
lovers' spat in front of an old woman.

482
00:40:53,896 --> 00:40:56,576
Do you have anyone you're meeting,
even if it's just as a friend?

483
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:00,619
At my age? I'm at an age where I'd even
kick out my husband if I had one.

484
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:02,646
Hey, no way.

485
00:41:02,646 --> 00:41:06,110
I think my life as a woman is over.

486
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:12,545
Can it really be over
just because you want it to be?

487
00:41:12,545 --> 00:41:14,606
Pardon? What did you say?

488
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:18,521
Sung Taek, don't you think
she's still really beautiful?

489
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:22,552
She's way past that.

490
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:31,664
Hey, please slow down.
You're drinking too quickly.

491
00:41:31,664 --> 00:41:35,559
I'm strangely craving alcohol today.

492
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,963
Why are you trying to stop her?

493
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:40,032
She can sleep when she gets too drunk.

494
00:41:40,032 --> 00:41:44,936
That's true. Since we're here,
please drink as much as you'd like!

495
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:49,711
Let's relieve our stress
while we're here! Cheers!

496
00:41:49,711 --> 00:41:52,851
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

497
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:15,351
I feel like I drank too much today.

498
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:17,952
All you have to do is sleep now.

499
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,197
I'm sorry, Hae Dang!

500
00:42:21,197 --> 00:42:24,768
I'm happy to see that
you're in a good mood!

501
00:42:24,768 --> 00:42:26,648
Hae Dang.

502
00:42:26,648 --> 00:42:30,583
That man won't do.

503
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,291
Break up with him!

504
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:35,556
Should I do that?

505
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:40,135
I feel like he'll give you
a hard time later on.

506
00:42:40,135 --> 00:42:42,762
This won't do! This won't do.

507
00:42:42,762 --> 00:42:45,204
He's in a poor state!

508
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:49,016
I'm not sure why, but his state...

509
00:42:49,016 --> 00:42:52,021
is a bit poor.

510
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:55,182
- Please be careful.
- Ouch.

511
00:42:55,182 --> 00:42:58,416
It always turns out this way
when an old woman drinks.

512
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:01,646
Hey, that won't work. You'll get hurt.

513
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:05,751
Wait, what's going on? Wait, put me down!

514
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:09,414
- Be careful! Be careful!
- What's going on?

515
00:43:25,275 --> 00:43:29,320
I'll be back soon.
I'll be back very soon, Kyung Soo.

516
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:41,934
Mom! Mom...

517
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:48,019
Mom!

518
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:56,262
Mom! Mom!

519
00:43:56,262 --> 00:43:58,771
Mom!

520
00:44:05,106 --> 00:44:07,958
Mom!

521
00:44:21,748 --> 00:44:24,844
I'll be back. I'll be back soon.

522
00:44:24,844 --> 00:44:28,840
I'll be back. I'll be back for you.

523
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:34,061
It's okay, I'll be back.

524
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:38,972
Mom! Mom!

525
00:44:38,972 --> 00:44:41,768
Mom!

526
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:45,612
Kyung Soo!

527
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,532
What's the matter?

528
00:45:25,114 --> 00:45:27,884
Why are you sweating so much?

529
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:33,119
What's wrong? Are you sick?

530
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,085
I'm scared. I'm scared.

531
00:45:36,085 --> 00:45:38,355
Lie down.

532
00:45:43,012 --> 00:45:47,960
Um, it'll be all right. Try to breathe.

533
00:45:59,545 --> 00:46:02,775
He must have been so scared.

534
00:46:02,775 --> 00:46:06,110
He must have missed me so much.

535
00:46:08,413 --> 00:46:11,402
He could have died from fear.

536
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:17,146
He could have cried
until he stopped breathing.

537
00:46:19,221 --> 00:46:23,460
Please hold me. Please hold me.

538
00:46:33,913 --> 00:46:35,938
It's okay.

539
00:46:37,034 --> 00:46:38,697
It'll be okay.

540
00:46:41,172 --> 00:46:45,978
I'm right here, so it'll be all right.

541
00:46:45,978 --> 00:46:50,896
I need some air.
Let me get some fresh air.

542
00:47:06,887 --> 00:47:11,155
Waking up in the middle of the night
is my biggest fear.

543
00:47:11,155 --> 00:47:14,692
At 2:00 or 3:00 a.m.

544
00:47:14,692 --> 00:47:18,628
if I wake up in the middle of the night

545
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:23,311
but there are no people around

546
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:28,365
in that empty house,
where I'm all alone.

547
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:37,036
If I wake up like that,
I won't be able to go back to sleep.

548
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:47,077
Should I hold your hand?

549
00:48:03,623 --> 00:48:06,561
You tremble if I just hold your hand.

550
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:10,465
Your life as a woman is over?

551
00:48:15,356 --> 00:48:17,974
Why can't I look at you
when I talk to you?

552
00:48:21,463 --> 00:48:23,507
It's because...

553
00:48:26,641 --> 00:48:28,670
your eyes are so deep.

554
00:48:51,253 --> 00:48:54,271
I wonder if your older sister slept well.

555
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:58,972
I'm sure she slept well. Why are you
worried about someone on vacation?

556
00:48:58,972 --> 00:49:01,840
She went there with that man.

557
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,257
There's no way they enjoyed
their vacation all carefree.

558
00:49:05,257 --> 00:49:07,177
But she likes that man.

559
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:12,052
Even if she likes him...
that's not all that matters.

560
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:15,288
That's right! I didn't take out
the soy sauce braised beef.

561
00:49:15,288 --> 00:49:18,005
We ate all the meat,
so only eggs must be left.

562
00:49:18,005 --> 00:49:20,777
Hey! Don't talk about eggs!

563
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:30,572
Please eat slowly.
I'm late, so I'll get going first.

564
00:49:32,695 --> 00:49:36,692
Don't put eggs on the table
for the time being!

565
00:49:36,692 --> 00:49:38,601
Don't even put eggs in the fridge!

566
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:41,643
But you have to put eggs in your ramen.

567
00:49:41,643 --> 00:49:43,983
I'm going to stop eating eggs.

568
00:49:43,983 --> 00:49:47,835
I'm not going to eat
a single one from now on.

569
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:52,894
What are you eating? There was nothing
in the fridge when I checked yesterday.

570
00:49:52,894 --> 00:49:56,690
I just made a pot of soup. What is this?

571
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,391
Steamed eggs.

572
00:49:59,516 --> 00:50:02,070
There are a lot of eggs everywhere.

573
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,817
You can finish a bowl of rice
with this and kimchi.

574
00:50:04,817 --> 00:50:07,532
- I stopped eating eggs.
- Why?

575
00:50:07,532 --> 00:50:11,063
You didn't hear, did you?
I'll tell you later.

576
00:50:11,063 --> 00:50:15,724
Why would you tell her later?
There's no need for her to know!

577
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,650
Jung Hae Sung!

578
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:24,536
- Why did you come down so early?
- Why are you wearing that jacket?

579
00:50:24,536 --> 00:50:25,934
I had nothing else to wear.

580
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:28,163
That doesn't mean
you should wear my clothes!

581
00:50:28,163 --> 00:50:30,438
I'll never wear it again after today!

582
00:50:30,438 --> 00:50:33,420
- How can I trust you?
- Gosh, you're so petty.

583
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,802
It's because the school inspector
is coming today!

584
00:50:35,802 --> 00:50:37,148
Hey!

585
00:50:37,148 --> 00:50:40,092
I only wore it two times
because I cherish it so much!

586
00:50:40,092 --> 00:50:42,592
You wore my shoes last time!

587
00:50:42,592 --> 00:50:45,873
Hey! Hey! Hey! Jung Hae Sung!
Jung Hae Sung!

588
00:50:45,873 --> 00:50:49,237
She might chase her all the way down
to the bus station.

589
00:50:49,237 --> 00:50:53,809
In high school, she was so worried
her sister would steal her new clothes

590
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:56,144
that she even brought
her clothes to school.

591
00:50:56,144 --> 00:50:59,882
That's right. She did.
I remember that now.

592
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:06,403
Are the steamed eggs good?

593
00:51:07,112 --> 00:51:08,876
They're not good?

594
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:11,518
Really?

595
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:16,900
Then let's see how bad it tastes.

596
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,340
Hey, this is a secret.

597
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:23,855
I don't know.
Do secrets exist in this house?

598
00:51:23,855 --> 00:51:25,409
What?

599
00:51:26,206 --> 00:51:29,784
Geez, I didn't know you were my enemy.

600
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:36,431
It's so big...

601
00:51:43,014 --> 00:51:44,708
You must be tired.

602
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:48,293
But after a few months,
you'll want to come back.

603
00:51:48,293 --> 00:51:49,670
Would you like some tangerine?

604
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,708
No, that's okay. You eat it.

605
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:55,503
You look tired.
It looks like you have no strength.

606
00:51:55,503 --> 00:51:58,293
No, it was fun.

607
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:02,539
Sung Taek, are you tired too?

608
00:52:05,686 --> 00:52:09,932
I need to keep feeding you
so you don't fall asleep.

609
00:52:09,932 --> 00:52:11,432
I said I'm okay.

610
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:13,670
Then do you want some squid instead?

611
00:52:14,934 --> 00:52:16,275
Here.

612
00:52:39,117 --> 00:52:42,838
Thank you, Hae Dang. I got some fresh air
and had a good time thanks to you.

613
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:45,467
Let's go again sometime.

614
00:52:48,773 --> 00:52:54,188
Would you like to come in
for some tea? No, how about lunch?

615
00:52:54,188 --> 00:52:57,277
- Shall we?
- In a place where she lives alone?

616
00:53:04,121 --> 00:53:06,760
Let's keep it simple and eat some bread.
You can stay seated.

617
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,117
- Let's prepare it together.
- I'm fully capable of doing this myself.

618
00:53:10,117 --> 00:53:12,240
Then what should I do?

619
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,358
Can I wash up?

620
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:19,003
Sure, use the bathroom in the main room.
Everything you need should be there.

621
00:53:19,003 --> 00:53:20,795
Really?

622
00:53:27,501 --> 00:53:29,416
I'll wash the vegetables.

623
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:33,472
- I said you can stay seated.
- There's nothing to do here anyway.

624
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:38,371
You have to wash those carefully.
They'll fall apart.

625
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:51,318
I'm going to rip them up anyway.

626
00:53:51,318 --> 00:53:53,356
I guess that's true.

627
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:01,911
Let's eat it with milk.

628
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:17,168
What are you doing?

629
00:54:20,235 --> 00:54:22,885
What if Hae Dang comes out?

630
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:25,324
She'll take 20 minutes.

631
00:54:33,914 --> 00:54:35,755
You...

632
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,905
look so delicate.

633
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,260
Please give me coffee with milk.

634
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:24,750
Yum, this salad is so good.
It's so crispy.

635
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:29,860
Why aren't you eating? It's delicious.

636
00:55:31,414 --> 00:55:32,934
Why aren't you eating?

637
00:55:33,643 --> 00:55:37,958
I don't have an appetite anymore.
I guess I'm tired.

638
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:41,431
We'll eat this quickly and leave
so you can get some rest.

639
00:55:41,431 --> 00:55:44,086
Hurry up and eat so we can go.

640
00:55:47,938 --> 00:55:50,922
This salad is so good.

641
00:56:00,431 --> 00:56:05,034
Why did you sit there so bluntly?
You made me feel ashamed.

642
00:56:05,034 --> 00:56:07,590
- Let's get married.
- What?

643
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,983
Your second eldest sibling got a job too.

644
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:14,708
Even if your eldest sibling is busy,
shouldn't your second eldest cover it?

645
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:16,998
I can't tell her
to take care of all of it.

646
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:20,769
- What?
- Her entire pay will be taken from her.

647
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:24,610
If we want money for our marriage,
I have to use my savings.

648
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:27,748
Not much will be left after that.

649
00:56:27,748 --> 00:56:29,684
How can they live with that?

650
00:56:29,684 --> 00:56:33,371
Why can't they live?
They can make it work!

651
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:36,514
Why are you acting like this
all of a sudden?

652
00:56:36,514 --> 00:56:38,108
Help them after we get married.

653
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:41,759
My family will feel sorrier
if I help them after I get married.

654
00:56:41,759 --> 00:56:43,949
Is your family the only thing
you can think about?

655
00:56:43,949 --> 00:56:46,702
We agreed to get married
when the youngest gets a job.

656
00:56:46,702 --> 00:56:50,074
Do you think getting a job
is that easy these days?

657
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:52,682
I'm sure she'll find one soon.

658
00:57:17,603 --> 00:57:21,909
I want to meet that person.
Who is it...

659
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:25,012
that's bothering our Yoo Ji Na?

660
00:57:28,088 --> 00:57:31,733
I can't believe
I'm feeling jealousy at this age.

661
00:57:31,733 --> 00:57:34,697
Well, it's not a bad feeling.

662
00:57:35,802 --> 00:57:39,447
- He's eight years younger.
- Damn it.

663
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:44,563
He has the one thing I can't have.
What does he do?

664
00:57:44,563 --> 00:57:46,282
He's unemployed.

665
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,429
He's younger and unemployed.

666
00:57:50,184 --> 00:57:53,168
- This can't be any more dangerous.
- It's dangerous?

667
00:57:53,168 --> 00:57:57,643
I know a lot about women.

668
00:57:57,643 --> 00:58:01,333
And I know even more about men.

669
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:06,907
You will end up degenerating
into a woman he needs.

670
00:58:06,907 --> 00:58:08,405
I'll degenerate?

671
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:13,954
Isn't it a good thing to be needed?

672
00:58:13,954 --> 00:58:18,418
It's good if a man is needed by a woman.

673
00:58:18,418 --> 00:58:22,929
But if it's the other way around

674
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:25,923
that love will come to an end.

675
00:58:26,797 --> 00:58:31,414
It's a result of a man's pride.

676
00:58:32,702 --> 00:58:36,838
For a woman, it's most
comfortable to be loved

677
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:41,514
like a dog, by an owner with strength.

678
00:58:42,797 --> 00:58:44,405
Is that so?

679
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,278
Good job! Come here.

680
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,172
Wait.

681
00:59:06,103 --> 00:59:07,577
That's right!

682
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:13,481
You should have called me first
if you came back.

683
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:16,505
Imagine what your family thought of me.

684
00:59:17,523 --> 00:59:20,143
Hyun Joon, you can't win over
your father. Do you understand?

685
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:22,387
No one can win over him!

686
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:27,170
I'm not trying to win.
I'm trying to irritate him.

687
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:31,335
No matter what your intent is,
you can't do any of that here.

688
00:59:31,335 --> 00:59:33,387
Go back home right now.

689
00:59:34,143 --> 00:59:37,619
Do you think your father
will outlive you?

690
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:39,655
He could live for a long time.

691
00:59:39,655 --> 00:59:42,679
He can do whatever he likes,
eat whatever he likes

692
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:47,891
and get plenty of insults from people.
Isn't that what extends your life?

693
00:59:47,891 --> 00:59:49,297
Are you complaining?

694
00:59:49,297 --> 00:59:51,740
Grandmother outlived my mother.

695
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:55,047
Who says Father can't outlive me?

696
00:59:55,815 --> 00:59:57,751
He might live a lot longer than me.

697
00:59:57,751 --> 01:00:01,278
If you want to win over your father,
can you treat me like this?

698
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:05,965
After your mother passed away,
who else do you have besides me?

699
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:29,590
<i>When I return to Korea,
I'll call you back.</i>

700
01:00:54,503 --> 01:00:59,561
<i>Don't let anyone,
especially anyone in our family</i>

701
01:00:59,561 --> 01:01:02,945
<i>find out about this letter.</i>

702
01:01:05,938 --> 01:01:08,847
Father will arrive shortly.

703
01:01:12,313 --> 01:01:16,215
- You must be here because of the rumors.
- What rumors?

704
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:20,083
He was waiting for Yoo Ji Na in his car
outside her broadcasting station

705
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:22,744
but I think reporters saw him.

706
01:01:22,744 --> 01:01:26,311
What does Yoo Ji Na do for a living?

707
01:01:26,311 --> 01:01:30,581
She's a singer.
She's a lot younger than Father.

708
01:01:32,978 --> 01:01:36,114
It wasn't long after Mother passed away

709
01:01:36,114 --> 01:01:40,003
and even if it's just a rumor,
it's still upsetting.

710
01:01:45,032 --> 01:01:46,625
Hyun Joon!

711
01:01:48,108 --> 01:01:52,333
Are you trying to make him fight
with Father so soon after his return?

712
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:56,123
No, I thought he knew.

713
01:02:26,556 --> 01:02:28,728
Stop right there!

714
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:32,498
You're acting arrogant.

715
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:37,068
- Don't you think of your children?
- That's right, I don't.

716
01:02:38,447 --> 01:02:41,534
Do you think parents
look at their children out of fear?

717
01:02:41,534 --> 01:02:44,391
We only pay attention
if we adore our children.

718
01:02:45,237 --> 01:02:50,438
You only learned about how to look down
on your father as soon as you matured.

719
01:02:50,438 --> 01:02:55,143
At your age, your taste is quite cheap.
This isn't child's play.

720
01:02:55,143 --> 01:02:57,331
Worry about yourself.

721
01:02:57,331 --> 01:03:00,538
Even if you want to act cocky,
I'm sorry...

722
01:03:00,538 --> 01:03:02,360
but you're...

723
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,161
- Park Sung Hwan's son.
- I'm begging you.

724
01:03:10,115 --> 01:03:15,166
Please don't make our late mother
any more pitiful than she already is.

725
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,503
This is my first and last request.

726
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,411
How unfortunate.

727
01:03:19,411 --> 01:03:23,880
Even though this is
your last request, I feel no emotion.

728
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,023
If a request doesn't work,
I'm warning you.

729
01:03:28,824 --> 01:03:32,090
You're warning me? What warning?

730
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:34,780
In your eyes

731
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:38,228
does it look like I want
to live for a long time?

732
01:03:58,012 --> 01:03:59,980
Sung Taek!

733
01:04:04,045 --> 01:04:05,905
Sung Taek!

734
01:04:14,856 --> 01:04:16,619
Hae Dang.

735
01:04:22,695 --> 01:04:27,273
Did you see the man who just went inside?
Wasn't that Sung Taek?

736
01:04:27,273 --> 01:04:31,036
- Jung Hae Dang.
- Yes.

737
01:04:31,036 --> 01:04:36,623
What do I have to offer you to make you
break up with Jo Sung Taek?

738
01:04:37,481 --> 01:04:38,963
Excuse me?

739
01:04:38,963 --> 01:04:42,751
Give me that man.

740
01:04:43,389 --> 01:04:47,318
- Yoo Ji Na.
- I must...

741
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:49,764
live with that man.

742
01:04:49,764 --> 01:04:51,965
So give me...

743
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,253
that man.

for singing my songs for money.</i>

747
01:05:36,202 --> 01:05:39,420

someone I know.</i>

- Are you asking me that question?</i>

753

<i>My daughter-in-law is so smart.
I wonder whom she resembles.</i>

754
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:05,050
<i>It feels like I'm you, and you're me.</i>

755
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:08,186
<i>The person who can save her
is not you, but me.</i>

756
01:06:08,186 --> 01:06:10,407
<i>Do you even know
what kind of person she is to me?</i>

757
01:06:10,407 --> 01:06:12,664
<i>She's getting married!</i>
