(Episode 14)

3
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:18,914
Hyun-joon...

4
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:22,711
Hae-dang, what are you
doing here at this hour?

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:28,734
- What about you? What are you
doing here at this hour?
- Well, the thing is...

6
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:35,741
Yoo Ji-na said she has to urgently
see me, so I came to meet her.

7
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:39,914
If you need to see me, you
should come to me yourself.

8
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:41,898
Why are you telling me to come and go?

9
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:45,312
Jung Hae-dang, did you see this
clearly with your own two eyes?

10
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:49,718
He'll come running to me when I call him.

11
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,771
Now do you realize the truth? You do know
he approached you because of me, don't you?

12
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:01,335
He signed a contract with you
in order to infuriate me.

13
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,358
Or else, who would glance your way?

14
00:01:05,977 --> 00:01:10,389
You entered a contract on behalf of me, so
why are you putting on such a haughty air?

15
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:17,117
What? Even if you die, you'll
never live as my shadow?

16
00:01:18,265 --> 00:01:20,438
Isn't it an honor for a
business singer who performs

17
00:01:21,157 --> 00:01:23,898
in shabby nightclubs like
you to act as my shadow?

18
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:27,328
- Are you done talking?
- Then why else did you
come here at this time of night?

19
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,500
Is this your house?

20
00:01:32,797 --> 00:01:35,864
Now do you realize how
embarrassing it is for

21
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:38,821
you to act up because
of your belief in him?

22
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:46,024
Hae-dang. Hae-dang.

23
00:01:47,414 --> 00:01:48,614
Hae-dang, hold on.

24
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:51,156
Hae-dang, please get out for a moment.

25
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:53,914
Hae-dang. Hae-dang, hold on.

26
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:57,031
Hae-dang! Hae-dang! Hae-dang!

27
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:05,329
Did you really have to talk that way?

28
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:06,563
Why not?

29
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:10,060
Or else, you should've just been
honest with her and told her

30
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:12,750
this is your house and that
you're the son of a wealthy CEO.

31
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:18,806
You heard everything, so why are you getting
angry at me now? What did I do wrong?

32
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:49,821
If you just go, how do you
expect me to sleep tonight?

33
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:55,126
Are you interested in Yoo Ji-na?

34
00:02:57,021 --> 00:03:00,521
- What?
- Did you use me during your love quarrel?

35
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:04,630
Don't be ridiculous.

36
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,193
You were anxious because you couldn't
find a reason to sign a contract with me.

37
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,144
- That's not it.
- Do you know how I feel right now?

38
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,306
When I think about how I believed
your words and attempted to leave

39
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:21,967
that woman's shadow, I become so
embarrassed that I want to die!

40
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:26,044
- I told you. That's not it.
- Then what is it? What is it?

41
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:28,365
Am I crazy? Why would I like her?

42
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,974
Then...

43
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:33,568
just date me.

44
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,302
- What?
- Let's date, Jung Hae-dang.

45
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,857
When I think of that woman, I shudder, too.

46
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:45,380
In order to prove my
innocence, I need to date you.

47
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:47,467
Let's just date.

48
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:50,607
I'll just assume we're
dating now and go home.

49
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:53,873
Look here!

50
00:03:54,513 --> 00:03:57,247
When your family members or
anyone else ask what kind

51
00:03:57,482 --> 00:03:59,724
of relationship we're in,
say we're dating. Okay?

52
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,272
It's all settled now! I feel much better!

53
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,849
Then why did you go there at that hour?

54
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:12,217
- I told you I went because she called me.
- You go just because she called you?

55
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:14,750
She threatened to stop you from
appearing on TV again if I

56
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:17,155
didn't come, so I went to argue with her.
You happy now?

57
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,161
- Are you serious?
- Of course!

58
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,801
While we're at it, I'll tell your
father that we're dating now.

59
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:33,677
Mr. Jung, I'm here! Starting from today,
Hae-dang and I are officially dating-

60
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:35,162
Are you crazy?

61
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:37,716
Okay, okay.

62
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:41,302
How dare you put me with that woman.

63
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:57,818
By any chance, do women
like things like this?

64
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,310
Or...

65
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,057
what about this?

66
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,046
This is pretty bad.

67
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:15,242
I was about to get in my car when I saw
someone selling these on the streets.

68
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,735
Well, it's better than a necklace
worth the price of a house.

69
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,430
You're beautiful when you smile.

70
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:34,633
If I want to see you smile like this again,
what do I have to buy you next time?

71
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:38,243
It would be easy if I told you
to buy me a building, right?

72
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:41,516
Right.

73
00:05:43,665 --> 00:05:45,649
- I'll be going now.
-Okay.

74
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:55,914
Yes!

75
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,702
You're a woman who is as fragile as glass,

76
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:16,328
and yet, you fearlessly
pretended to be tough.

77
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:35,508
It seemed like you were
going to be there for

78
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,524
a while, but why did you came back so soon?

79
00:06:38,985 --> 00:06:41,196
I have something urgent to
take care at the company.

80
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:43,926
Did you see the summer line photo shoot?

81
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,277
I'll excuse myself first.

82
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,551
Who is it? If it isn't
urgent, let's talk later.

83
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,843
Why would you come in here?
My family might see you.

84
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:13,196
Did you decide not to make
eye-contact with me anymore?

85
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:16,279
What are you worried about? You're
not interested in me anyways.

86
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:17,849
What's going on?

87
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,741
- I need some time to organize my thoughts.
- What thoughts?

88
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:26,852
What thoughts?

89
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:32,899
Even if you're curious, be patient.
You should learn to be patient now.

90
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:51,266
Something is definitely unusual, isn't it?

91
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:57,867
Do you think he's doing this
because he's tired of Yoo Ji-na?

92
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,504
I'm not sure. It didn't seem like he was
going to get tired of her so easily.

93
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,894
I think the moment has finally
come when you need me.

94
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,985
- It's time to find out the reason.
- Find out the reason?

95
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:13,657
His feelings didn't change. He
discovered a shocking fact.

96
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:17,758
- A shocking fact?
- That's why he's troubled.

97
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:21,190
I understand what you're saying.

98
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:24,036
We must find out what that is.

99
00:08:24,446 --> 00:08:27,338
But what if we did find out and
your father-in-law decides

100
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:30,009
to just sweep everything under
the rug and accept her?

101
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:33,055
- Then we need to use Yoo Ji-na.
- Yoo Ji-na?

102
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:39,742
Seeing that father is so heartbroken and
troubled, it must definitely be a fatal fact.

103
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:46,770
That woman has a weakness. She's a
celebrity who will even die for fame.

104
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,387
That woman didn't have much interest
in father from the beginning.

105
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:55,149
She won't throw away
everything and choose him.

106
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,170
I understand what you're saying.
You're better than I expected.

107
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:03,935
- I've worked under you for many years now.
- What?

108
00:09:05,673 --> 00:09:07,101
Now it's a race against time.

109
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:10,726
Father can find out first and cover it up.

110
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:13,008
Just look at her.

111
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:19,125
By the time she's my age, she could destroy
at least twenty people from her seat.

112
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:25,620
Did you call for me, sir?

113
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:30,415
If you examine the hospital
record of the boy, wouldn't

114
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,400
you be able to find out
personal details about him?

115
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:38,123
The hospital will not show the records
to someone who isn't related to him.

116
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:46,397
- Did her nursing friend retire?
- Yes, I heard she retired quite a long time ago.

117
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:52,405
I must be the first one to find that boy.

118
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,370
I have something to discuss with you.

119
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:04,282
Discuss what?

120
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:09,774
Mom, should I work as a housekeeper?

121
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,399
What?

122
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:16,375
That's a great idea!

123
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:20,428
Mother is home, so you don't
need to be home, too.

124
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:23,625
- Hey.
- You chose to do the right thing.

125
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:26,985
All occupations are equally honorable.
You should make money when you can.

126
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:33,321
- No. Just stay home.
- Mother, what kind of prejudice is that?

127
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,901
Have you ever worked at
someone else's house before?

128
00:10:38,157 --> 00:10:44,257
Any job is difficult. No
one makes money easily.

129
00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:48,383
- So how much do you make at your job?
- Excuse me?

130
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:51,048
How are you and Bong-sun so
different from each other?

131
00:10:51,314 --> 00:10:53,137
You don't make a single
penny lecturing at a

132
00:10:53,162 --> 00:10:55,414
university, but you expect her
to work as a housekeeper?

133
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:57,539
How can you compare me to her?

134
00:10:58,735 --> 00:10:59,735
What?

135
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:05,781
Bong-soo, what do you think about
Bong-sun working at someone else's house?

136
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:11,063
Mom, stop saying it like that.
I'm just being a housekeeper.

137
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,743
What do you think about Bong-sun
becoming a housekeeper?

138
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:16,367
I don't know...

139
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,938
You must have an opinion as
the head of the household.

140
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:20,766
No, I don't.

141
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,984
Your wife is so smart that
she's filled of things to say,

142
00:11:24,423 --> 00:11:26,203
so why don't you have an opinion?

143
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:31,750
It's been a long time since
I've had any opinions.

144
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:34,617
I just live without any thoughts.

145
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:37,893
If I say my opinion, will
any of you listen to me?

146
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:44,860
Oh, come on, mom. Why did you get
up without finishing your dinner?

147
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,354
Don't look at me.

148
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:57,781
If I tell people I'm living
off of my family's house with

149
00:11:57,806 --> 00:12:00,103
my widowed mother-in-law and
divorced sister-in-law,

150
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,586
the city hall might present me with an
award for being a devoted daughter-in-law.

151
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:05,938
What? An award?

152
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:11,047
"How can you compare me to her?"

153
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:13,606
My goodness!

154
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:19,000
It's ten dollars an hour. That means
I can make seventy dollars per day.

155
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:21,781
You're too tactless to work
at someone else's house!

156
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:23,852
You have to walk on eggshells in that job!

157
00:12:24,313 --> 00:12:27,117
I'd rather walk on eggshells
around other people.

158
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:32,528
There's nothing more miserable than walking
on eggshells around your own family.

159
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,703
Did I say something wrong? All
occupations are equally honorable.

160
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,578
Just teach those "right things"
to your students at school.

161
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:46,446
Did anyone accuse you of being
rude because you were wrong?

162
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:50,281
- What?
- How can you say that in front of my mother?

163
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:53,686
It doesn't matter if Bong-sun is her
daughter, and I'm her daughter-in-law.

164
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:55,564
She shouldn't compare us like that.

165
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:59,054
Mrs. Jung Hae-jin, no matter how
smart you are, you are still

166
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:02,152
Yeon Bong-soo's wife and
mother of Yeon Bong-soo's kid.

167
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:08,063
- What?
- So enough with your conceited act.

168
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:11,367
- What?
- What did you say? They'll give you an award?

169
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:14,655
Did all those people who deserve
awards freeze to death last winter?

170
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:17,150
- Are you done talking?
- Yes, I am.

171
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:20,686
I have nothing to lose. I don't
care if I get a divorce.

172
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:23,961
- I'm going to say everything
I want to say from now on.
- How dare you!

173
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:27,852
You should know living with your
husband's paycheck is the happiest time.

174
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:31,383
What will you do if we get divorced?
You can't even pay for your own books.

175
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:34,343
Do you think living with your
family after you divorce

176
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:37,070
is the same as living with
them before you got married?

177
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:39,414
Are you picking a fight with me?

178
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:43,821
Mrs. Jung Hae-jin, who can't stand not
bragging about herself at least once a day,

179
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,867
enough with your conceited
act while you still have

180
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:49,946
people to listen to you and
get a hold of yourself, okay?

181
00:13:51,555 --> 00:13:55,020
Gosh, I feel so refreshed acting crazy
and saying everything I wanted to!

182
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:56,384
Gosh!

183
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:21,657
Dad.

184
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:24,243
Welcome!

185
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:28,000
- It's me.
- What are you doing here at this hour?

186
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:31,086
Did something happen at home?

187
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:38,993
Dad.

188
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,595
I dropped.

189
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:47,392
Where? Where did you drop
Did you get hurt anywhere?

190
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:48,602
No...

191
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,797
I dropped out from the writer's contest.

192
00:14:55,282 --> 00:14:56,282
Oh, dear...

193
00:14:56,307 --> 00:15:00,336
When I used to write while being a
teacher, I thought if I quit and put

194
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:04,165
my everything into writing, I would
be able to become a writer soon.

195
00:15:06,415 --> 00:15:09,771
But when I really did it,
it wasn't like that.

196
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:16,617
- I'm slowly starting to become
afraid of quitting my teaching job.
- What?

197
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:23,773
If you were able to become a writer in one
shot, then everyone would become one.

198
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,504
What's more important than
actually achieving success?

199
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:33,539
It's to make an effort until the end.

200
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:38,757
In today's world, starving isn't a problem.
So what if you starve?

201
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:42,555
If you starve to death while doing what you
love, then you'll die without any regrets.

202
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:49,309
I may be ignorant, but while
raising four kids, I thought...

203
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:55,156
kids these days think too much
compared to their actions.

204
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:58,891
If you did it, you don't
need to think about it.

205
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,934
After that, the one with perseverance wins.

206
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,179
You're very persevering.

207
00:16:05,617 --> 00:16:10,766
It might happen much later, but one day,

208
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:15,281
I'll be able to see the
drama you wrote on TV.

209
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:19,158
Do you think I'm really persevering?

210
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:20,539
Yes!

211
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:24,440
A long time ago when we made kimchi
and I told you girls to peel ginger,

212
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,830
you wouldn't get up until you were
done peeling all of the gingers

213
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,596
while your sisters collapsed without even
being able to even peel ten of them.

214
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:37,002
I guess I am persevering.

215
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:40,826
Perseverance is the best trait
to have to live in this world.

216
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:44,065
That means you're the best.

217
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,113
To Hae-dang, you said she's the best.
To Hae-jin, you

218
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:51,065
said she's the best. To Hae-soo,
you said she's the best.

219
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:56,593
That's because all of you are the best!
Why? Because you're my daughters!

220
00:16:58,596 --> 00:17:05,346
Thanks, dad. If I do become a writer,
it's because of what you told me tonight.

221
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:09,252
- All right. Cheers.
- Cheers.

222
00:17:12,393 --> 00:17:16,072
My contract with the nightclub is expired.
I have to renew with them.

223
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:18,307
All right. We'll take care of it.

224
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:23,134
Mr. Jang, please create conditions for
Hae-dang's renewal with the nightclub.

225
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:24,823
Yes, sir.

226
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:28,541
- By the way, Mr. Jang.
- Yes?

227
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:32,861
Are you curious what kind of
relationship Hae-dang and I are in?

228
00:17:34,073 --> 00:17:35,626
- No.
- You're not curious?

229
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:39,963
What do you mean? Aren't you the agency
CEO and she's a celebrity at your agency?

230
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,002
No. We're dating.

231
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:47,447
Got it? Spread the news.

232
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:53,807
Not many people know about her yet, so I don't
think I'll be able to spread it around.

233
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:58,580
- What?
- Sir, you'll get in trouble
if you make such jokes nowadays.

234
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:06,033
You're embarrassing me! Are you
going to keep saying that?

235
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:10,166
Embarrassing? Why would you be embarrassed
about dating a man at your age?

236
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:12,416
I'm a good guy.

237
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:17,579
I have the ability to take care of a woman,
and I can passionately love her, too.

238
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:20,934
Gosh, you scared me. You're so cheesy.

239
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,835
Enough with the nonsense.
Just take good care

240
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,776
of the contract renewal with the nightclub.

241
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:33,208
Aren't you going to say
bye to your boyfriend?

242
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,650
What's wrong? Is there
something making you angry?

243
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:49,128
Gosh. The more I think about
it, the angrier I get.

244
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,299
Why? What is it?

245
00:18:55,557 --> 00:18:58,635
- It's about the CEO of my agency.
- What about him?

246
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,791
His assistant wasn't even curious,
but he told him that we were dating.

247
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:05,581
Really?

248
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:09,791
I was right there, too.
Does he think I'm easy?

249
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:18,393
- I don't think it's that.
I think he's interested in you.
- No way.

250
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:21,392
It wasn't like that.

251
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:26,627
Well, then, unless he was a lunatic,
he wouldn't have a reason to say such a thing.

252
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,643
- He is a bit of a lunatic.
- Really?

253
00:19:33,362 --> 00:19:36,065
I mean, he's not a bad person...

254
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:40,572
Anyways, I can't say he's
completely normal either.

255
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:47,242
Gosh, I'm jealous!

256
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:50,963
- You're what?
- Jealous.

257
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:53,502
Yeah, right.

258
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:55,486
I saw him before.

259
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,596
- Where?
- I was passing by your house
one day when I saw him.

260
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,932
I was too far to get a good look at his
face, but he seemed tall and handsome.

261
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:10,603
That's because you saw him from far away.

262
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:15,135
When you get a closer look at him,
he looks like a potato doll.

263
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:16,315
A potato doll?

264
00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:20,829
Wait, that means he's cute.

265
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:23,393
So he looks cute!

266
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,424
He's not my style.

267
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:28,080
Oh, this is a big problem.

268
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:32,588
- Why?
- He's handsome and rich.

269
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:35,479
- Who's rich?
- He's the CEO of your agency.

270
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:38,330
He built that agency with
investments from other people.

271
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:40,932
He probably has a lot of debt.
It's obvious.

272
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:43,518
Is that so?

273
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:46,991
He said he has no money,
but he bought a luxurious

274
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:49,634
suit to pay in monthly
installments for twelve months.

275
00:20:50,697 --> 00:20:52,229
That's a bit problematic.

276
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:56,111
His father sells clothes at a
market, so how can he do that?

277
00:20:57,307 --> 00:20:58,942
Now you know what he's like, right?

278
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:02,565
- But that's strange.
- What is?

279
00:21:03,057 --> 00:21:06,760
I have a feeling you like him, too.

280
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:10,144
What are you talking about?

281
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,087
I'm jealous. I'm not kidding.
I'm seriously jealous.

282
00:21:15,197 --> 00:21:16,197
Really?

283
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:19,900
Good, good. I like things like that.

284
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:23,284
You like it?

285
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:25,463
To be honest, I do.

286
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:28,230
Please keep being jealous.

287
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:31,158
What did you say? Are you done talking?

288
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:35,503
- Come here. Hurry up.
- Oh, come on.

289
00:21:36,214 --> 00:21:37,902
- Come here.
- Why are you doing this?

290
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,777
- You like it?
- Don't!

291
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:44,693
- Keep being what?
- I surrender!

292
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:48,166
Nope. I can't accept it.
You can't surrender.

293
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:51,284
What should we eat for dinner?

294
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:54,869
Shouldn't I eat whatever you
make me in order to be loved?

295
00:21:55,987 --> 00:21:57,916
- Seafood spaghetti?
- Okay.

296
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:02,893
- Then let's buy some vegetables
we'll need for the salad.
- Sure.

297
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:13,604
People will think we're a newlywed couple.

298
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:18,716
Gosh. Will your agency CEO show up here?

299
00:22:20,057 --> 00:22:23,432
- Why would he?
- So we can show him how cozy we are.

300
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:26,697
Stop it. It's not funny.

301
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:31,153
I'm too nervous. I need to hurry up
and take you to the countryside.

302
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,775
I told you to stop.

303
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:37,143
Just tell him you're dating someone then.

304
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:41,088
Are we really dating each other?

305
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:46,221
Yes. Then what do you call this? Why
would we come to buy groceries together?

306
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:48,776
Do people who buy groceries together date?

307
00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:53,963
Oh, so you want me to confirm
that we're dating for sure?

308
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,924
I didn't know you had such a complaint.

309
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,092
What are you talking about?

310
00:23:00,284 --> 00:23:02,330
You don't know what
embarrassment is, do you?

311
00:23:04,643 --> 00:23:05,643
Lee Kyung-soo!

312
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:11,190
You better not say anything weird again.

313
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:15,112
Don't!

314
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:18,049
Stop! Stop!

315
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:25,181
It smells great already.

316
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:27,229
Take out the plates.

317
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:44,330
- What are you doing?
- I'm so happy.

318
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:47,155
This will burn. Go over there.

319
00:23:47,486 --> 00:23:48,731
Just let it burn then.

320
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:50,975
Let's stay like this for just a moment.

321
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:59,213
There's a delicious smell in my room.

322
00:24:00,276 --> 00:24:05,666
I get to see the person I love
making delicious food for me.

323
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:10,246
I never knew such a day would come for me.

324
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:19,627
I'm so happy right now.
Are you as happy as I am?

325
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:29,627
This isn't anything special, but I
feel the world has become peaceful.

326
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,299
It's burning! Oh, no!

327
00:24:45,893 --> 00:24:48,916
What did you need to tell me that
you brought me all the way here?

328
00:24:51,276 --> 00:24:52,752
What do you need to tell me?

329
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:56,791
The thing that is on your mind right now.

330
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,541
You want to break up?

331
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:01,940
There's someone I like.

332
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:05,659
- The woman Yoo Ji-na was talking about?
- Yes.

333
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:10,479
I thought you liked her by yourself.
Did she say she likes you, too?

334
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:15,065
No. I'm going to officially confess to her.

335
00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:18,463
Before that, I wanted to tell you first.

336
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:22,175
- What if I say no?
- I didn't tell you this because
I wanted your permission.

337
00:25:22,612 --> 00:25:24,957
- Then why would you tell me?
- Because I feel sorry.

338
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:28,533
If you tell me, will you
not feel sorry anymore?

339
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:32,454
Anyways, thank you for waiting
for me for a long time.

340
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,452
It's my fault that I didn't
end things with you sooner.

341
00:25:40,151 --> 00:25:47,519
Yoon-hee, staying with a man who doesn't
love you is harder than you think it is.

342
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,150
I know. I'm having a hard time already.

343
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:58,197
Why would you endure it?

344
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:04,502
You can find a man who loves you dearly.

345
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,424
Are you worrying about me right now?

346
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:10,147
I'm going to wait.

347
00:26:12,198 --> 00:26:14,281
I'm going to wait until you come back.

348
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,049
Even if you wait, I won't come back.

349
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,268
I won't come back to you.

350
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:38,604
Which tree is it?

351
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,057
Na-kyung went out today, so I'll have to
make your snack. What would you like to eat?

352
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:09,994
Did you lose something again?

353
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,940
No.

354
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:23,205
- Did you do this?
- No.

355
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:25,424
It seems like you're looking for something.

356
00:27:25,573 --> 00:27:28,650
I like trees and the smell of dirt.

357
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,190
What kind of excuse is that?

358
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:34,299
You said you didn't do this.

359
00:27:34,995 --> 00:27:38,354
- Didn't you go out?
- Oh, I forgot something.

360
00:27:39,385 --> 00:27:40,971
I see. I'll be going now.

361
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,768
Excuse me.

362
00:27:50,323 --> 00:27:52,528
Next time, instead of just
eating a snack after the

363
00:27:52,553 --> 00:27:54,714
lesson, how about you eat
a meal at the main house?

364
00:27:55,987 --> 00:27:57,654
Thank you, but it's fine.

365
00:27:58,034 --> 00:28:00,111
When your lesson is over,
it's time to eat anyways.

366
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:02,964
There's something fishy.

367
00:28:03,752 --> 00:28:07,330
It could be a chance to find out
something about her family.

368
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:09,744
If you're uncomfortable, it's okay.

369
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:13,940
No, I'll eat, if that's okay with you.

370
00:28:14,368 --> 00:28:17,322
Of course it is. Okay, let's do that then.

371
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:41,072
- You can play a harder song now.
- Really?

372
00:28:41,557 --> 00:28:45,072
- I'll prepare a music score that you can play.
- Sure.

373
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:47,190
Drink some tea before you go.

374
00:28:47,948 --> 00:28:51,775
It's a bit stuffy in here.
Can we drink it outside?

375
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,830
- You must like trees.
- I like the smell of trees.

376
00:29:05,697 --> 00:29:08,486
But it seems like you're looking at them.

377
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:11,101
I'm smelling them.

378
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:20,688
Last time, you asked if I have
any blind family members, right?

379
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:24,487
Yes.

380
00:29:25,885 --> 00:29:26,885
I don't.

381
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,158
Is that so?

382
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:37,642
I'm being nice to you because
I want to be close to you.

383
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:42,581
- Don't you have any close friends?
- Friends?

384
00:29:47,557 --> 00:29:48,643
No, I don't.

385
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:55,737
I was about to be friends with Jung Hae-dang,
but it didn't work out.

386
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,197
Did something happen between you two?

387
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:03,250
You don't need to know.

388
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:06,031
Let's sit over there.

389
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:25,338
- The coffee is cold now.
- It's fine.

390
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:31,598
The spring sun is very nice.

391
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:37,494
Why did you ask if I have any friends?

392
00:30:38,057 --> 00:30:39,869
I had a close friend, too.

393
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,878
- Not your girlfriend?
- Yes. He's blind.

394
00:30:47,784 --> 00:30:52,533
His name is Lee Kyung-soo.

395
00:31:02,596 --> 00:31:05,353
What's wrong? Did you drop something?

396
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:15,792
L-Let me go change my clothes.

397
00:31:28,424 --> 00:31:31,611
No. I'll be going now.

398
00:31:34,682 --> 00:31:35,682
Will you?

399
00:31:42,503 --> 00:31:43,503
Wait!

400
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:49,581
What is it?

401
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:52,607
Is there anything else you want to ask me?

402
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:58,541
No. I'll see you next time.

403
00:32:02,151 --> 00:32:03,151
Go home safely.

404
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,139
Is there anything else you want to ask me?

405
00:32:53,174 --> 00:32:56,760
No. I'll see you next time.

406
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:13,346
No... No...

407
00:33:15,464 --> 00:33:16,869
He's blind.

408
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:23,021
His name is Lee Kyung-soo.

409
00:33:57,534 --> 00:33:59,001
One person is missing.

410
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:05,097
- She said she can't eat today, too.
- It's been four days already.

411
00:34:07,276 --> 00:34:09,654
I heard from a broadcasting
station that she

412
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,267
didn't show up for a program
and went home early.

413
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:14,486
What happened?

414
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:18,111
I'll excuse myself first.

415
00:34:45,932 --> 00:34:49,088
You didn't even eat, so why
are you drinking so much?

416
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:50,721
None of your business.

417
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:54,119
- What is it?
- I said it's none of your business.

418
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:57,330
Do you know what you look like right now?

419
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:01,143
Don't look at me that way.

420
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:04,049
It offends me.

421
00:35:04,776 --> 00:35:10,354
Tell me. I'm the only one who can help you.

422
00:35:12,432 --> 00:35:14,190
What did you come this far for?

423
00:35:22,393 --> 00:35:25,787
Is this what you wanted the popular
singer Yoo Ji-na to look like?

424
00:35:26,284 --> 00:35:28,651
Yes. So what?

425
00:35:29,198 --> 00:35:32,080
What state must I prepare to see you in?

426
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:35,627
If you came here to piss me off, leave.

427
00:35:37,643 --> 00:35:39,976
I'm not in a good condition.

428
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:48,361
- Leave me some room for me to endure you.
- Don't endure it!

429
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:55,886
Why would you endure? Did
I tell you to endure?

430
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,627
Who are you to endure me?

431
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:02,119
Did I ever beg you to endure?

432
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:04,714
Are you my husband?

433
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:07,229
Stop making me laugh and get out.

434
00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:14,635
Get out! Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

435
00:36:15,235 --> 00:36:21,416
- Get out!
- What am I supposed to do with you?

436
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:24,982
What am I supposed to do?

437
00:36:26,557 --> 00:36:28,283
Did I tell you to do something for me?

438
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:36,088
Retire. Just retire and
quietly live next to me.

439
00:36:37,557 --> 00:36:38,752
Please. I'm begging you.

440
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:47,526
You had thought about retiring when
you had been with that man who died.

441
00:36:48,362 --> 00:36:54,455
You said you didn't care about money
and just wanted to live next to him!

442
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:03,010
I did.

443
00:37:04,596 --> 00:37:08,222
But? But why not now?

444
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:11,768
You don't know?

445
00:37:13,323 --> 00:37:14,533
You're a fool.

446
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,369
Because I don't love you.

447
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:23,322
Because I don't want to throw
everything away and be next to you!

448
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,768
Why would I retire for
someone like you? Why?

449
00:37:33,471 --> 00:37:34,471
What?

450
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:39,627
If Park Hyun-joon told me to
retire, I probably could.

451
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:44,908
What did you say?

452
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:52,870
If Park Hyun-joon told me to retire and
stay next to him, I probably could,

453
00:37:54,135 --> 00:37:56,002
Mr. Park Sung-hwan.

454
00:37:58,518 --> 00:38:02,526
You really are crazy to the core.

455
00:38:06,706 --> 00:38:11,924
You really are crazy to the core.

456
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:25,492
Do you know what I did to get here?

457
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:33,354
Do you know how hard I'm trying
to stay in this position?

458
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:38,309
Who are you to tell me what to do?

459
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:42,729
Who are you? Who are you?

460
00:38:43,464 --> 00:38:48,651
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?

461
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,870
Kyung-soo...

462
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:15,799
Kyung-soo...

463
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:19,659
Kyung-soo...

464
00:39:22,924 --> 00:39:23,924
I'm sorry.

465
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:29,838
I'm sorry.

466
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:05,885
What was that noise? Did you hear it, too?

467
00:40:06,268 --> 00:40:07,735
That's father's voice.

468
00:40:08,135 --> 00:40:10,260
Something is definitely wrong.

469
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:13,166
We must find out what
we need to know and get

470
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:15,439
our plan together before
things settle down.

471
00:40:15,924 --> 00:40:18,057
Goodness. This is so mortifying.

472
00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:19,565
- Grandmother.
- Yes?

473
00:40:20,581 --> 00:40:25,190
Please tell Hyun-sung to buy me
something delicious outside.

474
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,643
There's no such thing as a free lunch, huh?

475
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:34,682
You're quick. Goodness. I can't
find anything stable about you.

476
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,690
- What if something happens between him
and Yoo-jin in the meantime?
- All right.

477
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:45,651
If Park Hyun-joon told me to
retire, I probably could.

478
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:54,510
If Park Hyun-joon told me to retire and
stay next to him, I probably could.

479
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:07,682
Stop and go inside. It's embarrassing.

480
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:13,908
You left without eating, so I was
curious and came to check on you.

481
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:29,705
Oh, Bong-sun! Where are
you off to this morning?

482
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:36,948
- Mr. Jung, I'm starting work today.
- Really? Congratulations! What job is it?

483
00:41:37,893 --> 00:41:41,838
I'm late. You can hear it from my mom. I
can't be late on my first day of work.

484
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,986
- Bye, mom.
- Hold on. Come here.

485
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:45,495
What is it?

486
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:50,979
If the work is too hard, or if the
owner is mean to you, just come home.

487
00:41:51,128 --> 00:41:55,151
Am I kid? I'll buy something delicious
with my pay on my way home after work.

488
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,354
- What should I buy?
- Hurry up and go.

489
00:41:57,908 --> 00:41:58,908
I'll be back.

490
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:09,431
- Where did she suddenly get a job?
- She's working as a housekeeper.

491
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,463
Oh, really?

492
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,760
Plenty of people are housekeepers,
so my child can be one, too,

493
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:23,026
but this morning, for some reason, I
cried tears of blood in my heart.

494
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:35,431
There are all kinds of
people in this world.

495
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,432
How does she know what kind
of family she'll work for?

496
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:41,401
Don't be so heartbroken.

497
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:47,026
If she sees you heartbroken,
how would she feel?

498
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:51,916
I didn't raise her with such hardships
so that she can be a housekeeper.

499
00:42:52,158 --> 00:42:55,783
Oh, come on. There aren't any parents who
raise their children without any hardships.

500
00:42:56,635 --> 00:42:59,791
However, you need to release her
into this world with a firm heart.

501
00:43:00,268 --> 00:43:02,821
You can't just make her stay
with you because you pity her.

502
00:43:03,695 --> 00:43:06,591
You need to teach her how
to live before you die.

503
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:09,049
It's not like you can take
her to the grave with you.

504
00:43:13,714 --> 00:43:15,409
Shut your mouth.

505
00:43:15,987 --> 00:43:16,987
Pardon?

506
00:43:17,557 --> 00:43:21,736
Mrs. Baek, I'm your in-law...

507
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:26,244
No one better make any smart
comments in front of me again.

508
00:43:26,924 --> 00:43:30,591
- Pardon?
- I've heard enough smart comments from your

509
00:43:30,616 --> 00:43:33,948
daughter, so you don't need
to add onto them, too.

510
00:43:35,253 --> 00:43:36,471
I'm sorry, Mrs. Baek.

511
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:40,989
She said to my face, "All
occupations are equally

512
00:43:41,014 --> 00:43:44,323
honorable. How can you compare me to her?"

513
00:43:44,698 --> 00:43:47,065
Hae-jin really spoke that way to you?

514
00:43:47,284 --> 00:43:51,494
What is so different about
your daughter and mine?

515
00:43:51,854 --> 00:43:53,314
What's so different?

516
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,455
Nothing is different, of course.

517
00:43:57,487 --> 00:44:01,135
For your information, I never
said they were different.

518
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,179
You seem to be unable to focus today.

519
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:19,892
I've had a headache since morning.

520
00:44:20,549 --> 00:44:22,111
You appear haggard as well.

521
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:25,408
Yes. I couldn't sleep very well.

522
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:31,557
What did you just say?

523
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:36,440
- Pardon?
- You said I appear haggard.

524
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:39,359
It's not like you can see my face.

525
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:40,909
Well...

526
00:44:43,189 --> 00:44:48,057
You sound exhausted, so you
must appear haggard as well.

527
00:44:49,198 --> 00:44:53,197
- Anyways, should we call it a day?
- Yes.

528
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,940
Then I'll see you at the next lesson.

529
00:45:01,714 --> 00:45:02,788
Hold on.

530
00:45:06,392 --> 00:45:10,072
Do you know where...

531
00:45:12,581 --> 00:45:14,283
your friend Lee Kyung-soo lives right now?

532
00:45:14,932 --> 00:45:16,940
No, I don't.

533
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,994
Did you lose contact with him?

534
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:24,307
However, I can find out
through my other friends.

535
00:45:25,698 --> 00:45:26,783
Would you like me to?

536
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:32,197
If I tell them popular singer Yoo Ji-na
is searching for him, they'll

537
00:45:32,572 --> 00:45:35,282
definitely help me, and I'll be
able to find him in no time.

538
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:37,799
No!

539
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:42,572
- Why not?
- You can never mention me.

540
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:49,229
When a popular celebrity like me searches
for someone, the rumors will quickly spread.

541
00:45:51,596 --> 00:45:54,565
My name can never be mentioned.

542
00:45:56,416 --> 00:46:00,979
All right. I'll make
sure that never happens.

543
00:46:23,643 --> 00:46:26,026
Why do you seem so tired?

544
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,471
Should we really leave to the countryside?

545
00:46:33,456 --> 00:46:34,947
I suddenly hate being in Seoul.

546
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:37,503
Why?

547
00:46:38,557 --> 00:46:42,338
If you were my mom who had abandoned me,

548
00:46:44,964 --> 00:46:49,111
would you want to find me later on?

549
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:51,408
Of course I would.

550
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:57,283
Your mom had been at an immature
age when she had left you.

551
00:46:58,604 --> 00:47:04,053
She could have been afraid to raise
a blind child by herself back then.

552
00:47:04,464 --> 00:47:06,088
That's what I had thought, too.

553
00:47:10,143 --> 00:47:11,442
But I don't think that's true.

554
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:15,604
Did you hear about your mom from somewhere?

555
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:21,416
I don't think she wants to meet me.

556
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:30,283
She probably has another family by now.

557
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:36,952
If she has other children, it would be
difficult for her to show herself to you.

558
00:47:37,408 --> 00:47:40,197
No. I don't think that's the case.

559
00:47:41,995 --> 00:47:43,352
She's just purely selfish.

560
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:46,926
She's afraid her life will collapse.

561
00:47:48,651 --> 00:47:49,651
Kyung-soo.

562
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,033
What? Hyun-joon broke up with you?

563
00:48:04,198 --> 00:48:09,174
- Yes.
- Why? Is it because of that wicked woman
who is staying in the annex?

564
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:11,713
- I don't think that's it.
- Then what is it?

565
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,503
I think he has another woman.

566
00:48:14,948 --> 00:48:16,932
Who says he can? Who says he can?

567
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:19,799
Grandmother, what do I do?

568
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,377
That fool!

569
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,174
Where is he right now? Call him and
tell him to come home at once!

570
00:48:26,326 --> 00:48:29,807
I don't want to call him in this mood.

571
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:34,971
What is it, grandmother?

572
00:48:35,104 --> 00:48:38,041
Call Hyun-joon and tell him
to come home immediately!

573
00:48:38,385 --> 00:48:40,713
Why? Did something happen?

574
00:48:40,948 --> 00:48:43,838
Don't you think it's strange
if there's a day of peace

575
00:48:43,863 --> 00:48:46,542
in this family? Hurry up
and tell him to come home!

576
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:48,831
Okay.

577
00:49:02,432 --> 00:49:03,502
I'm coming inside.

578
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:10,401
Did something happen with Hyun-joon?

579
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:18,322
- Are you happy?
- I'm not in the position to be happy
over someone else's misery.

580
00:49:18,604 --> 00:49:20,119
Then just keep quiet.

581
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:24,971
What's wrong? Did Hyun-joon
break up with you?

582
00:49:26,705 --> 00:49:29,682
If you're curious, go into that
room, sit next to them, and listen.

583
00:49:29,956 --> 00:49:32,041
What are you getting mad at me for?

584
00:49:35,245 --> 00:49:38,533
How dare you do this to her after
you made her wait so long!

585
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,627
Get married to her next month!

586
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:47,572
- No.
- Don't you hear what I'm saying?
Get married at once!

587
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:52,276
I'm sorry, but I have no intention
to do that. I'll be going now.

588
00:49:52,301 --> 00:49:55,026
How dare you! I'm not done talking yet!

589
00:49:55,337 --> 00:49:57,743
Do you still think we're the trembling kids

590
00:49:57,768 --> 00:50:00,119
who were afraid to breathe in front of you?

591
00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:05,643
- What?
- I'm thirty-seven.
Thirty-seven! I'll be forty soon!

592
00:50:06,104 --> 00:50:11,237
Your mother has raised her kids very
wonderfully before she died, didn't she?

593
00:50:11,713 --> 00:50:13,971
How dare you speak that
way to your grandmother!

594
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:16,002
I'm glad you brought that up, grandmother.

595
00:50:17,033 --> 00:50:22,783
How would our mom have raised us right
when you were busy making her miserable?

596
00:50:24,447 --> 00:50:28,877
You couldn't even stand it when your
son and his wife smiled at each other!

597
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:31,643
How dare you raise your voice at me!
Oh my goodness...

598
00:50:32,268 --> 00:50:34,846
Oh, my head.

599
00:50:39,823 --> 00:50:41,658
Can't you see that I fainted?

600
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:45,079
I was watching to decide
if you had really fainted

601
00:50:45,104 --> 00:50:48,080
or if you were up to one
of your old tricks again.

602
00:50:48,331 --> 00:50:52,268
What? Perhaps you wished that I had
really fainted and kicked the bucket.

603
00:50:52,471 --> 00:50:56,378
You must have a headache, considering
you had made such an effort

604
00:50:56,403 --> 00:50:59,894
to kill my mom only to have a
foolish woman take her place.

605
00:51:00,049 --> 00:51:01,104
What did you say?

606
00:51:09,581 --> 00:51:10,926
How can you just go upstairs?

607
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:14,815
I'm through talking with you. I
have nothing else to say to you.

608
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:27,925
It's at times like this that
you must hang in there.

609
00:51:28,182 --> 00:51:30,911
I don't know if there's anything
I can hang onto at this point.

610
00:51:30,994 --> 00:51:33,072
How can you say something so weak?

611
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:37,609
It's not like you endured all this time
because Hyun-joon clung onto you with love.

612
00:51:38,385 --> 00:51:41,004
- Are you really going to be like this?
- What did I do?

613
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,456
When are you going to buy me lunch?
Didn't grandmother tell you anything?

614
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:52,151
She did. I'll try to make time.

615
00:51:53,323 --> 00:51:54,856
This is why I like you.

616
00:51:56,057 --> 00:51:57,505
You're different from Hyun-joon.

617
00:51:58,299 --> 00:52:00,322
- What do you mean?
- You're still walking on

618
00:52:00,604 --> 00:52:02,486
eggshells around your
father and grandmother.

619
00:52:02,604 --> 00:52:04,904
- What?
- You're full of substance.

620
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,033
Are you being sarcastic with me?

621
00:52:07,151 --> 00:52:11,903
I was never in this place
because you protected me.

622
00:52:12,393 --> 00:52:18,088
Sometimes, I'm confused whether
you're smart or stupid.

623
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:19,721
What?

624
00:52:22,245 --> 00:52:23,512
Where are we going?

625
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:26,792
I'm trying to buy you
some clothes you can wear

626
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:28,644
when we meet people from
broadcasting shows.

627
00:52:29,826 --> 00:52:33,818
- Still, how can you drag me to a luxurious store?
- It's because I'm embarrassed.

628
00:52:35,772 --> 00:52:39,464
All right. I'll buy some new clothes.

629
00:52:40,998 --> 00:52:43,154
What would you possibly bu
with your fashion sense?

630
00:52:49,904 --> 00:52:52,076
Okay. Not bad.

631
00:52:53,553 --> 00:52:56,630
Since we're already here, let's
choose a couple more outfits.

632
00:52:56,967 --> 00:53:00,261
That one over there, that one,
and that one as well, please.

633
00:53:01,615 --> 00:53:02,951
Why more?

634
00:53:05,709 --> 00:53:07,998
You don't have money,
so what are you doing?

635
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:13,062
You, I mean, Yoo G-na will make a
lot of money for me in the future.

636
00:53:13,545 --> 00:53:14,545
What?

637
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,193
Right this way.

638
00:53:25,397 --> 00:53:26,397
Good.

639
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:32,636
You look so pretty all dressed up.
You look like a different person.

640
00:53:33,818 --> 00:53:36,752
Good. Let's go for it.
I'll get all of them.

641
00:53:38,842 --> 00:53:39,975
You can pay here.

642
00:53:43,998 --> 00:53:47,415
- What if you exceed your card limit?
- Are you scared I'll embarrass you?

643
00:53:48,443 --> 00:53:49,893
- I'll pay in lump sum.
- Sure.

644
00:53:50,506 --> 00:53:52,349
- Lump sum?
- Lump sum.

645
00:53:55,662 --> 00:53:59,023
- Do you know how much all of these cost?
- I'm still paying in lump sum.

646
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:03,832
- Please sign.
- Sure.

647
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,677
Why are we here?

648
00:54:17,693 --> 00:54:18,936
Have you ever come here before?

649
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:24,186
Let's go. If you eat one thing here,
it's the cost of an entire meal!

650
00:54:24,716 --> 00:54:26,608
Let's go and have a bowl of ox bone soup.

651
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:30,357
People are watching. I'm so embarrassed.

652
00:54:33,748 --> 00:54:36,326
Embarrassment lasts a second,
but substance lasts forever.

653
00:54:36,897 --> 00:54:38,685
Why do you have no substance?

654
00:54:39,584 --> 00:54:40,651
Let's go. Hurry.

655
00:54:41,818 --> 00:54:44,794
All right! Why are you so strong?

656
00:54:45,998 --> 00:54:47,888
Hurry up and come. I'm embarrassed, too.

657
00:55:13,193 --> 00:55:16,201
This is food that people eat.
Hurry up and eat.

658
00:55:16,365 --> 00:55:18,990
You have an old man's taste.

659
00:55:19,998 --> 00:55:24,360
- You're an unmarried woman.
- Are unmarried women
supposed to just drink water?

660
00:55:26,826 --> 00:55:29,833
After we eat ox bone soup here,
where do we drink coffee?

661
00:55:30,232 --> 00:55:32,765
There are vending machines everywhere.

662
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:35,397
Eat up. Eat up.

663
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:51,896
We ate dinner and drank coffee.
How much did it cost in total?

664
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:57,276
It's pretty similar to eating one item
at such a fancy restaurant, right?

665
00:56:00,881 --> 00:56:02,146
What did you want to tell me?

666
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:04,107
I wanted to dress you nicely...

667
00:56:06,037 --> 00:56:08,170
take you to a nice restaurant...

668
00:56:08,897 --> 00:56:10,419
and tell you.

669
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:16,052
But here we are stuck drinking vending
machine coffee on the streets...

670
00:56:16,358 --> 00:56:17,685
What is it?

671
00:56:20,623 --> 00:56:22,740
Did the nightclub say they
can't renew my contract?

672
00:56:23,834 --> 00:56:25,034
That can't happen!

673
00:56:26,006 --> 00:56:29,225
Hae-sung quit her teaching
job, Hae-jin is pretty

674
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,404
much jobless, and Hae-soo
is officially jobless.

675
00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:37,310
What do I do about the bank loan? Hold on.

676
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:41,998
I have so many bills to pay.

677
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:46,052
You didn't answer when
I said we should date.

678
00:56:51,897 --> 00:56:54,030
Can I just assume you said okay?

679
00:56:54,763 --> 00:56:56,201
You weren't joking?

680
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,271
Do you think I'm bored out of my
mind to joke about such a thing?

681
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:05,209
Just trust me.

682
00:57:13,561 --> 00:57:14,561
Why?

683
00:57:15,678 --> 00:57:20,169
What do you mean why? Does a man
need a reason to like a woman?

684
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:22,427
I just like you.

685
00:57:23,451 --> 00:57:26,552
Why do you like someone like me?

686
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:32,162
I always had a unique taste.

687
00:57:33,943 --> 00:57:40,716
Even clothes that people don't
glance at look good on me.

688
00:57:43,076 --> 00:57:46,044
I think I'm the right one for you.

689
00:57:49,459 --> 00:57:51,787
I have a boyfriend.

690
00:57:55,545 --> 00:57:56,612
Are you serious?

691
00:57:58,506 --> 00:58:01,404
Last time, you said you didn't.

692
00:58:04,217 --> 00:58:08,021
Wasn't that dead ex of yours the
only man you had in your life?

693
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:13,068
Oh, he was gone for a moment but came back.

694
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:18,367
Why are you staring me so seriously?

695
00:58:18,475 --> 00:58:19,914
Why didn't you tell me he was back?

696
00:58:20,005 --> 00:58:22,028
Because we're not in a
relationship where we tell

697
00:58:22,053 --> 00:58:23,990
- each other such things.
- Who says we're not?

698
00:58:24,474 --> 00:58:26,482
- Pardon?
- Who says we're not?

699
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:29,115
I can't accept this.

700
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:35,347
- Park Hyun-joon.
- I'm going to pretend I didn't hear it,
so just drink your coffee.

701
00:58:37,076 --> 00:58:40,130
This isn't something you
need to accept or not.

702
00:58:40,357 --> 00:58:44,576
Usually celebrities can't date anyone
without the agency's permission.

703
00:58:46,108 --> 00:58:47,108
What?

704
00:58:55,467 --> 00:58:59,638
After my mom unfortunately passed away,

705
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,365
all I do is fight with my
father whenever I see him

706
00:59:08,365 --> 00:59:12,310
and I didn't have anyone
I could warm up to.

707
00:59:13,966 --> 00:59:18,240
I didn't even have the
slightest will to live.

708
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:20,373
Then from some point on,

709
00:59:21,654 --> 00:59:24,224
whenever I thought about
you or your family,

710
00:59:26,225 --> 00:59:30,435
I would start to smile and be at peace.

711
00:59:33,725 --> 00:59:36,091
It made me want to live with you guys.

712
00:59:38,693 --> 00:59:43,123
Thanks to you, I was able to start
reconciling with the world again...

713
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:50,935
so how can I give up on you?

714
00:59:56,998 --> 01:00:02,263
I really love him...

715
01:00:02,615 --> 01:00:04,388
Don't say such things.

716
01:00:27,716 --> 01:00:33,013
I really love him...

717
01:01:16,271 --> 01:01:19,271
- Who are you?
- I'm Yoo Ji-na.

718
01:01:19,897 --> 01:01:22,927
Oh. What are you doing here at this hour?

719
01:01:24,162 --> 01:01:27,865
About your friend Lee Kyung-soo...

720
01:01:29,334 --> 01:01:30,334
Pardon?

721
01:01:33,527 --> 01:01:38,296
Never mind. I'm sorry. It's nothing.

722
01:01:39,015 --> 01:01:45,187
By any chance, does he know you?

723
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:48,117
What?

724
01:01:49,117 --> 01:01:51,851
One time, he told me that...

725
01:01:53,498 --> 01:02:01,437
the singer Yoo Ji-na sounds
exactly like his mom.

726
01:02:08,969 --> 01:02:10,390
Really?

727
01:02:12,578 --> 01:02:18,749
We're extremely sensitive
to people's voices.

728
01:02:23,335 --> 01:02:24,335
No way.

729
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:33,562
Lee Kyung-soo really said that...

730
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:40,640
my voice sounds exactly like his mom's?

731
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:45,305
Yes, he did.

732
01:03:23,677 --> 01:03:26,202
(You Are Too Much)

733
01:03:26,297 --> 01:03:29,367
I'll send you to the future strategy team,
so get married to Yoon-hee.

734
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:32,281
Do you remember I told you I would
tell you the next part of the story?

735
01:03:32,306 --> 01:03:33,726
It has to do with her will.

736
01:03:33,751 --> 01:03:36,765
- Hyun-joon didn't come home last night?
- Yoo Ji-na didn't either.

737
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:38,311
I'm asking you. What did you two do?

738
01:03:38,337 --> 01:03:41,292
- Are you getting angry at me?
- You're such a fool.

739
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,757
You won't be able to win against Na-kyung.

740
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:46,039
If you're not busy tomorrow,
can you come over?

741
01:03:46,258 --> 01:03:47,650
I have something to tell you.

742
01:03:47,674 --> 01:03:49,674
