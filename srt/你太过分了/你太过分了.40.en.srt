(Episode 40)

3
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:13,855
Stop spouting nonsense and get the hell out of my life.

4
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:15,211
Let go of me.

5
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:20,898
I have a lot of pathetic attachment to this life, so I'm letting you off the hook.

6
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:25,140
Or else, I would've killed us both.

7
00:00:34,847 --> 00:00:36,514
(Choi Kyung-ae/To My Son)

8
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:42,156
I should give this letter to Park Hyun-joon before I sign the divorce paper.

9
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:48,984
Once he gets this letter, it will be over for you before we even divorce.

10
00:00:50,086 --> 00:00:51,219
Do you know that?

11
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,757
Why do you have that letter?

12
00:00:57,055 --> 00:01:02,078
The location of the clue is clearly written in this letter.

13
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:08,296
If he reads this, he'll be able to find it within 30 minutes.

14
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:14,274
Do you still dare to push divorce papers to me?

15
00:01:15,813 --> 00:01:17,710
The moment I sign the divorce paper...

16
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:21,085
this letter will end up in his hands.

17
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,439
Do whatever you want.

18
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:28,195
What?

19
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:34,593
You won't be able to give it to Hyun-joon.

20
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:41,484
Not even if you experienced something far worse than divorce.

21
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:50,343
- Why not? - Once Hyun-joon gets the letter, he'll get all my shares.

22
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:56,765
Are you saying you'll make Jung Hae-dang into the wife of a CEO with your own hands

23
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:00,513
Your career as a singer is over.

24
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:03,007
You'll end up being kicked out of the house without anything.

25
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:06,955
On the other hand, she'll become the wife of the CEO.

26
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:12,376
Can you endure that?

27
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,359
You'd be better off quietly getting a divorce.

28
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:21,101
Even though you die, you wouldn't be able to witness that.

29
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:24,743
It's true that my fate rests on that letter.

30
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:31,656
However, you won't benefit from that letter either.

31
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:38,202
The man I wanted to love was Park Hyun-joon.

32
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:44,826
If my son doesn't have anything to do with your family,

33
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:49,811
then I believe the company should belong to Hyun-joon.

34
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:56,312
I once told you to give the company to him, didn't I?

35
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,007
Don't you dare make a prediction about a woman like me.

36
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,669
No one can predict what's going through my mind.

37
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:09,530
If you think it's over, you never know where I will go next.

38
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:15,323
I could end up giving this letter to Hyun-joon in

39
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,691
order to pay you back for ruining my life like this.

40
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:25,898
I may hate Jung Hae-dang, but not as much as I hate you who ruined my life.

41
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:37,554
I won't ask you to take me back. Just let my son stay in your house.

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,488
Then for my son's sake, do you think I'll give this letter to Hyun-joon?

43
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:51,765
If my son gets kicked out, then this letter will end up in Hyun-joon's hands.

44
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:58,226
I'll leave after giving it to him as a gift for

45
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,577
not being able to love him because of you.

46
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,257
Your career as a singer is over.

47
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:30,476
You'll end up being kicked out of the house without anything.

48
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:34,187
On the other hand, Jung Hae-dang will become the wife of the CEO.

49
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:37,210
Can you endure that?

50
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:58,718
Don't you dare make a prediction about a woman like me.

51
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:01,537
No one can predict what's going through my mind.

52
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,960
The man I wanted to love was Park Hyun-joon.

53
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,040
Why did you urgently want to see me?

54
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:38,491
Did you give the letter to your mom?

55
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:42,851
- The letter? - Didn't you give it to her?

56
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:46,819
Why would I give it to her?

57
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,734
Didn't you give her the letter so that she

58
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,405
could make a deal with me about the divorce?

59
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:53,515
No.

60
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:58,460
Then are you saying she stole the letter?

61
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:05,030
She's been spending a lot of time at the annex, so she must have eventually found it.

62
00:06:05,484 --> 00:06:08,234
If you weren't going to give it to me when I asked for it,

63
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:11,984
you should've hid it well so that nobody else could find it.

64
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:14,859
Even for my sake.

65
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,250
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:26,405
For your mom to have that letter is as dangerous as a maniac to have a gun.

67
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,913
What are you going to do about it now? What will you do?

68
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,300
How did she find the letter?

69
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:49,447
(Choi Kyung-ae)

70
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:09,048
Are you still thinking of staying by Mr. Park's side after what you've done?

71
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:10,822
You told me to stay alive.

72
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:15,384
You told me to at least do that for you.

73
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,788
Can't you just live?

74
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:25,009
Yes. I can't just live while breathing.

75
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,025
I need to have a motivation to get something in order to live.

76
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:34,908
It's not my life if there's no greed in it.

77
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:49,368
I can't believe there's such a relaxing day in my life.

78
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,712
Hae-dang, call your family and invite them over.

79
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:58,385
Thanks to them, I was able to safely leave the

80
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:01,126
hospital, so we should have a meal with them.

81
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:02,986
You don't have to do anything.

82
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,298
That would be going against etiquette.

83
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:09,564
Then I'll invite them.

84
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:17,861
And tell Hyun-joon to search for a gas station near your family's home.

85
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:23,954
- That's not necessary, grandmother. - I should keep my promise.

86
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:28,564
- My arms hurt. - Then quit it.

87
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:39,834
My mother lives in such a tiny apartment.

88
00:09:40,263 --> 00:09:42,515
Every time she calls me, she complains that she

89
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,791
wants to live in a bigger house before she dies.

90
00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:49,298
I can't even help her out, so I feel so bad.

91
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:54,118
Get pregnant. Once I hear that you have a child, I'll move her into a bigger house.

92
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,923
Do you mean it? Thank you!

93
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:01,596
But how much does it cost to set up a gas station?

94
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:08,236
- Why do you ask? - It doesn't seem like it will compare to a mere house.

95
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:10,759
Hae-dang is the eldest daughter-in-law.

96
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:16,009
How many square feet should the apartment be?

97
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:20,986
- She can look for one once you get pregnant. - That means you might not buy her one.

98
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:24,978
Then get kicked out of here. You can buy her a house with three million dollars.

99
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:30,118
Grandmother, I'm the one who got rid of Yoo Ji-na!

100
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:34,954
Anyways, you two should get along and take good care of the family.

101
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:39,572
Women need to play their roles right in order for the men to get along.

102
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,657
I'll keep that in mind.

103
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:44,673
If you want us to get along, you need to be fair.

104
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:49,111
I got it. Tell her to look for an apartment.

105
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:56,564
- Something around 1779 square feet? - Hey, aren't her two cheeks full of jealousy?

106
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,743
My goodness.

107
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:08,415
You should eat before the rest of the family eats.

108
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:14,814
- Don't mind us. We can eat out. - I'm tired of eating out. Let's just go eat.

109
00:11:18,197 --> 00:11:20,048
Do you want me to bring your food here?

110
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:24,439
No. That's bothersome. I'll just go and eat.

111
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:34,556
What are you doing here?

112
00:11:35,814 --> 00:11:38,189
Can't you tell? I'm eating.

113
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:42,493
Just look at Hae-dang's personality. This is the kind of person she is.

114
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,612
She's being thoughtful to you people who have to beg

115
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,807
for food by letting you eat earlier than the family.

116
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:52,126
- What do you mean we're begging for food? - Bring a cup of tea to my room.

117
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:57,751
My son hasn't been kicked out yet. He's still Mr. Park's son.

118
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:01,525
I'm eating here because of him, so what do you mean I'm begging for food?

119
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:04,454
Don't you think your expression is a bit low?

120
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:09,408
Ms. Fancy-yoo-ji-na, be quiet and eat your food.

121
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:12,708
When will you leave my house?

122
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,876
We found an apartment. We'll be moving out soon.

123
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:32,314
Oh my goodness. Why are all of these so pathetic?

124
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,555
Oh, my. All of these turned yellow.

125
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,376
Just bring me anything.

126
00:12:39,703 --> 00:12:42,043
These don't cost much anyways!

127
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:45,212
Why can't you just throw out the old ones and replace them with new ones?

128
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:48,033
It would be nice if we could put these in a pretty set.

129
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:51,368
Containers are all the same. Why would you worry about such a thing?

130
00:12:51,477 --> 00:12:54,165
These are all so cheap. They don't match either.

131
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,594
The food is what matters. Who cares about the containers?

132
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:00,719
These small things can reveal how poorly we live.

133
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:02,283
Are you going to keep nagging me?

134
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:08,790
She has a point. When you watch TV, well-off homes have matching, clean containers.

135
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:11,095
That's all for the photos.

136
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,971
Even if you do have matching sets, they all end up somewhere else overtime.

137
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:19,462
That's true. Where did all our containers go?

138
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,080
They go missing when you share food with other people.

139
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:26,009
Once containers go missing, they never come back.

140
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:28,908
Hurry up, will you? We need to drop by the hair salon as well.

141
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:32,837
I bet the second daughter-in-law will say something.

142
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:34,554
My pride is wounded.

143
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:36,939
Goodness. You have pride to spare, don't you?

144
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:39,212
Why would your pride be wounded over containers?

145
00:13:57,096 --> 00:14:01,205
It must be this house. Wow! The house is fantastic!

146
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:05,019
Goodness. I guess wealthy people do live differently.

147
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:08,814
Mom, how do I look? Do I look okay?

148
00:14:08,994 --> 00:14:12,181
- How could you leave work early for this? - Mom, what about me?

149
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:16,376
All of you are being so countrified. Why are you so hyper?

150
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,845
Should we ring the doorbell or call Hae-dang?

151
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,880
Gosh. We couldn't prepare a lot. All we brought were pickled vegetables.

152
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:25,800
We brought flowers.

153
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:29,399
Why do the flowers look so tacky? Why are they all different colors?

154
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:32,224
The neighborhood florist did her best!

155
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,408
I'm just afraid our class will be revealed.

156
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:37,610
If you go to the mall, there are plenty of pastel-colored pretty bouquets!

157
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:39,931
You have nothing, but you have such high standards.

158
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:42,533
Oh, come on. Let's hurry up and go inside. They must be waiting.

159
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:43,558
All right.

160
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:47,743
Hey, hold the pickled vegetables properly, or they'll leak.

161
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:49,517
They already leaked!

162
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,783
Which one is the doorbell? Oh, it must be this one.

163
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:58,189
Hurry up and come here!

164
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,025
Hae-dang!

165
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,900
- Hi, dad. - Hi! How are you?

166
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,064
Hi, Mrs. Baek.

167
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:16,986
You look like a wealthy madam standing in this kind of house!

168
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:21,478
You've never seen wealthy madams before.

169
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:27,243
Welcome! Have you been well?

170
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:30,165
Yes, thanks to you.

171
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,540
I didn't know you'd come here, too.

172
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:39,837
- You didn't? - I thought only Hae-dang's family was coming.

173
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:47,064
She always has to start a fight. That's a disease, you know. A disease.

174
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:49,579
- Welcome. - Hello!

175
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:50,861
How are you feeling?

176
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:55,861
I heard you made a lot of effort while I was in the hospital.

177
00:15:56,517 --> 00:16:00,486
Thanks to you, I safely discharged from the hospital. Thank you.

178
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:05,486
Truth be told, I even washed your feet with a wet towel.

179
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:09,220
I know. Who would do such a thing?

180
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,393
You have a very nice house.

181
00:16:14,524 --> 00:16:16,806
All houses are the same.

182
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:19,501
May we look around?

183
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:22,627
There's nothing to see.

184
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:28,658
If you want to look around, feel free to do.

185
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:34,134
- You came, too? - Hello.

186
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,790
Aren't those for me?

187
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,158
Oh, yes! I was just in a daze.

188
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:43,462
Congratulations on your discharge from the hospital!

189
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:45,103
Thank you!

190
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:50,798
- Have you been well? - Yes, thanks to your concern.

191
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:54,978
Why do you still have your jacket on when you sweat a lot?

192
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:57,134
Just take it off and leave it somewhere.

193
00:16:58,361 --> 00:17:04,181
- Yes, ma'am. - Must I tell you everything? You're not very good at adapting.

194
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:08,689
I don't know if you might be offended by this or not,

195
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:11,353
but you seem like my late mother.

196
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:13,790
I'm grateful you think of me that way.

197
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:17,947
What's this smell?

198
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:23,806
What's that?

199
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:29,329
Now that we're here, I feel a bit embarrassed that we brought these.

200
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:32,743
- What did you bring? - Pickled vegetables...

201
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:38,470
Oh, I love those! Did you make them at home? Please open them up.

202
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:42,251
It's a bit strange to open them up on a mother-of-pearl table.

203
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:44,728
I think the sauce kind of spilled as well.

204
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:49,533
- I'll leave it in the kitchen corner later. - I told you so...

205
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:53,822
It's fine. If the sauce spills, we can just wipe it.

206
00:17:56,244 --> 00:18:00,165
- Your mother-of-pearl table is beautiful. - Is it?

207
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:04,012
This is like the room of a queen.

208
00:18:05,728 --> 00:18:08,236
Thank you for the compliment.

209
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:23,454
- Wow! Nice painting! Wealthy homes sure do have different paintings. - What's this?

210
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:29,564
Oh my god! That scared me!

211
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:36,043
That's a TV! This is a TV!

212
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,017
These homes have unique televisions!

213
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,954
We're so tacky!

214
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:46,540
- Are we? - Are we?

215
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:49,017
See! It is a TV!

216
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:57,415
- What's this place? - I think it's a wine bar.

217
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:02,822
If we had such a place, we could just drink wine the whole day.

218
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:06,306
Goodness. I'm sure it's a place to serve guests.

219
00:19:06,431 --> 00:19:09,231
When will I be able to have a bar at home?

220
00:19:13,994 --> 00:19:16,407
- This is good wine. - How do you know?

221
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,001
- What's the name of that wine? - Oh, please.

222
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:23,876
"Chateau Mouse."

223
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:26,847
I can't even read it.

224
00:19:27,423 --> 00:19:30,525
- Oh my gosh. Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth! - Hold on.

225
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:41,923
It's delicious. I didn't have much of an appetite. I'll enjoy these.

226
00:19:51,463 --> 00:19:52,904
Lunch is ready.

227
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,688
I didn't think we could all fit at the table, so I set it up in the yard.

228
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:58,603
- Let's go outside. - Okay.

229
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:06,556
- Father! - Oh, Hyun-joon!

230
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:12,462
It's not like you guys are a separated family. You guys saw each other a few days ago.

231
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:19,376
I'm even happier to see you here! I had no idea you lived in such a nice place!

232
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:23,134
Seeing you here makes me want to cry as well.

233
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:24,884
Oh, come on! Don't joke like that!

234
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:28,650
- Wasn't it tiring to come here? - Of course not.

235
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,462
You two have a good relationship.

236
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:34,954
- They're very close. - That's how it should be.

237
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:36,925
- Let's go out. - Okay.

238
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,712
- Please go out. - Let's go.

239
00:20:45,197 --> 00:20:46,759
Cheers!

240
00:20:57,603 --> 00:21:00,533
We have so many things to make a toast about.

241
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:04,728
Why aren't you letting me talk?

242
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:10,197
- Let's have a drink and enjoy the food. - Yes, ma'am.

243
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:13,862
I don't know if the food will suit your taste.

244
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:16,283
Thank you.

245
00:21:18,502 --> 00:21:20,184
Thank you for the wedding gift.

246
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,540
It's nothing. We prepared to the best of our ability, but it was just plain.

247
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:29,718
No. There were quite a few useful things in there.

248
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:32,765
What? There were quite a few useful things in there?

249
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,882
She's so rude.

250
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,523
Why would you speak so rudely?

251
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:40,929
It's all my fault for teaching her the wrong manners.

252
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:46,819
You made quite an effort preparing them when you're not even her mother.

253
00:21:47,147 --> 00:21:50,140
If her mother was alive, she would've done a better job.

254
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:54,757
But isn't it awkward for in-laws to live together?

255
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:04,924
We're not uncomfortable, although it might be uncomfortable for those who see us.

256
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:11,194
Anyways, it's an honor that there were a few useful things in your wedding gift.

257
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:17,140
- An honor? - Yes. It seems like you have such high standards.

258
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:24,796
Let me know if you need anything else.

259
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:29,601
Okay. I'll tell you after I eat first. The meat is very juicy.

260
00:22:39,437 --> 00:22:41,913
How could you drink like that when you're going to drive?

261
00:22:44,703 --> 00:22:47,632
- I'll call for a chauffeur service. - In broad daylight?

262
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:49,757
You don't need chauffeur service.

263
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:52,762
I'll have one of my company employees take you home,

264
00:22:52,787 --> 00:22:55,164
so don't worry and drink as much as you want.

265
00:22:56,663 --> 00:22:57,663
Thank you.

266
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:05,929
But you two seem very comfortable with each other.

267
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:13,093
Yes. We are childhood friends who went to the same elementary school.

268
00:23:13,773 --> 00:23:19,046
- Somehow, we became in-laws. - I see.

269
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:26,398
It would be nice to age with someone to talk to in your later years.

270
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:27,937
Grandmother.

271
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:34,051
I mean, Mrs. Sung. Let's stop talking about that.

272
00:23:34,765 --> 00:23:40,054
- Why? - I would like it if Mrs. Baek became my mother-in-law.

273
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:41,796
Hyun-joon.

274
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:46,905
That would be great. Where else would you find such a perfect partner?

275
00:23:48,648 --> 00:23:50,671
No one would know how you two are related.

276
00:23:51,117 --> 00:23:56,124
- Still, what's wrong is wrong. - That's not true.

277
00:23:57,765 --> 00:24:03,538
- My father-in-law just needs me. - We should ask him then.

278
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:05,281
Oh, yes...

279
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:12,616
I have my son-in-laws who are like my own sons and kind daughters. I'm not lonely.

280
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:14,718
Still, that's not it.

281
00:24:19,242 --> 00:24:20,242
Hello.

282
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:24,483
Why don't you join us?

283
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:30,468
Enjoy yourselves.

284
00:24:34,687 --> 00:24:37,983
Don't mind her. There's no need to.

285
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:42,265
She'll be leaving here soon. She's not part of our family anymore.

286
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:46,554
Why? It hasn't been long since she got married.

287
00:24:47,406 --> 00:24:49,429
Didn't Hae-dang tell you anything?

288
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,296
Something happened for things to turn out that way.

289
00:24:54,461 --> 00:25:00,601
Hae-dang knows how to be secretive. She's thoughtful and kind as well.

290
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:03,632
How did you raise your daughter so well?

291
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,429
I didn't do anything. She was born like this.

292
00:25:09,265 --> 00:25:12,640
Grandmother, you like Hae-dang, don't you?

293
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,116
Of course I do.

294
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:24,116
- Mrs. Sung, don't you have housekeepers? - Of course I do.

295
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:27,937
Then can I work here, too?

296
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:30,741
I'm a housekeeper-

297
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:33,538
You're a housekeeper?

298
00:25:35,515 --> 00:25:42,327
Oh, you are? It must be hard work. I should find a job for you.

299
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:47,523
Oh, it's fine. She can just work at the gas station with me later on.

300
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:57,796
Honey...I'm sorry.

301
00:25:58,717 --> 00:26:03,444
The meat was so delicious that I must have lost my mind.

302
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:25,445
Why are you crying?

303
00:26:27,812 --> 00:26:32,015
I'm embarrassed to death!

304
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,937
What are you embarrassed about?

305
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:37,491
I'm embarrassed about everything!

306
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:41,710
There's nothing to be embarrassed. They're naive, that's all.

307
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:48,093
Don't worry. I told Hyun-joon to find a gas station.

308
00:26:48,414 --> 00:26:53,765
Oh, dear. You seem like my granddaughter, so I dropped the honorifics with you.

309
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:59,218
Don't cry. Oh, stop your tears.

310
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,194
If you cry while eating meat, you'll get indigestion.

311
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:05,374
- Have some water. Here you go. - Thank you.

312
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:07,945
Oh, dear.

313
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:19,421
What brings you here without an appointment?

314
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:26,015
- Have you thought about it? - About what? I told you to do whatever you want.

315
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:29,323
Are you really prepared to acknowledge your sins,

316
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:32,302
give everything to Hyun-joon, and go to prison?

317
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:38,155
Do you believe I can't give the letter to Hyun-joon because of my hatred for Hae-dang?

318
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,179
I came this far with solely my temper.

319
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:55,128
I already threw away my life with my temper.

320
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:59,499
But you dare threaten me?

321
00:28:00,617 --> 00:28:01,617
I'll die.

322
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,149
I'll die for having messed with your temper.

323
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,204
- You'll die? - I truly want to die.

324
00:28:11,454 --> 00:28:15,383
If I die, will you accept my son?

325
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,672
Of course you would want to die, since you lost everything.

326
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:21,860
However, you won't be able to die.

327
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:26,524
All you do is say you want to die with your words.

328
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:34,641
I'm sorry, but a woman like you with filthy attachment to this world can't die.

329
00:28:36,243 --> 00:28:39,891
On top of that, do you think someone like you is capable of dying for her own child?

330
00:28:41,673 --> 00:28:45,645
Do you think wanting to die because you have nothing to take

331
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,446
your anger out on is the same as dying to protect someone?

332
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:56,946
The woman who really wanted to die to protect someone is my ex-wife, not you.

333
00:28:58,548 --> 00:29:02,961
Do you even know what it means to risk your life, Ms. Yoo Ji-na?

334
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:09,946
Don't roll your greedy, secular eyes in front of me. Get out.

335
00:29:11,392 --> 00:29:14,383
I'm through with you.

336
00:29:28,282 --> 00:29:30,508
Oh my gosh! I'm so embarrassed!

337
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:34,008
Why are you so angry?

338
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,430
W-Why would you bring up housekeeping there?

339
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:41,883
- I-I know... - What's wrong with that?

340
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:45,477
Didn't you see the second daughter-in-law's eyes shine brightly at that?

341
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:48,039
How could you be so embarrassed of your own family?

342
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,993
I'm just scared she'll give Hae-dang a hard time!

343
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:54,766
Hae-dang isn't you. She's not the type to be offended because of something like that.

344
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:58,243
Weren't all of you worried about her moving into a wealthy house. Look at her.

345
00:29:58,268 --> 00:30:00,704
She overcame everything and is living well.

346
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:05,719
In the end, you dare mention the gas station there?

347
00:30:07,321 --> 00:30:13,680
I know. Do you think my true character will change just because I go somewhere else?

348
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:15,493
Oh my gosh.

349
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:21,508
Anyways, it seems like she's really going to give me a gas station.

350
00:30:22,212 --> 00:30:24,805
What? Are you being arrogant already?

351
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,579
The owner of a gas station, huh?

352
00:30:31,017 --> 00:30:33,782
He must feel like he's the owner of a gas station already.

353
00:30:34,392 --> 00:30:38,204
Anyways, I feel so happy after seeing Hae-dang living well.

354
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:45,060
- But why is Yoo Ji-na getting a divorce? - I know, right?

355
00:30:45,188 --> 00:30:49,875
Who cares what the reason is as long as she leaves that house?

356
00:30:50,258 --> 00:30:51,438
Goodness! Serves her right!

357
00:30:51,587 --> 00:30:54,368
- Did she have an affair? - No way.

358
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,954
It could happen after living with an older man.

359
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,907
- Is that true? - No way. No human can stoop that low!

360
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:11,313
- Welcome home. - Hi. I already ate dinner.

361
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:16,016
Are you not going to eat at home anymore? Come and see me.

362
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,211
Hyun-joon was so thrilled to see his father-in-law.

363
00:31:25,024 --> 00:31:26,986
It made me realize it was because he had never

364
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,931
felt a father's love before, and I pitied him.

365
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:32,875
His father-in-law seemed rather warm-hearted.

366
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:37,938
The most pitiful people in the world is one's own children.

367
00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:42,745
There are many correct sayings in the world, but the

368
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:46,605
truest words are that no parent can overcome his child.

369
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:50,118
That's only true if it's a child who you love.

370
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:52,914
Then will you never love him as long as you live?

371
00:31:53,196 --> 00:31:56,164
More than anything, I would want to love him.

372
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:59,391
- Let me ask you something. - What is it?

373
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:04,961
If Hyun-joon obtains the letter that is a clue to his mom's death,

374
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:07,743
what do you think he'll do?

375
00:32:10,165 --> 00:32:15,844
See? You can't answer me. Don't you think he'll go to the police right away?

376
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,407
How could I ever love him, even though he may be a greater being than my own son?

377
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,079
Do you feel unjustified by that?

378
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:31,891
It's your fault that he grew up that way. Why don't you realize that?

379
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,344
Hyun-joon entered the company as a contract employee.

380
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:41,211
- What? - I heard you were hiring new contract employees this time.

381
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:44,032
He's working in a low level-entry position.

382
00:32:44,845 --> 00:32:47,016
Now that he got married, he came to his senses.

383
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:49,454
Isn't this something we should be grateful about?

384
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:55,110
It's his way of apologizing to you.

385
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,642
How is that apologizing to me?

386
00:32:58,915 --> 00:33:02,897
He's reflecting on his previous ways, so that's apologizing.

387
00:33:03,056 --> 00:33:05,211
Don't stretch the point.

388
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:07,024
He's the eldest son of this family.

389
00:33:07,454 --> 00:33:10,280
Do you think it's easy for him to drop by the stores

390
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:12,969
and check if the products are selling well or not?

391
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:14,579
On top of that, at his age?

392
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:22,782
Hae-dang isn't a normal girl. A treasure has come into this house.

393
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:31,555
- Hello. - Hello.

394
00:33:32,173 --> 00:33:36,173
The headquarters is doing a survey on customer satisfaction.

395
00:33:36,524 --> 00:33:40,305
If you give us your valuable feedback, we will make sure to listen to them.

396
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:42,251
Hello.

397
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:44,267
Here you go.

398
00:33:54,673 --> 00:33:56,289
Are you drinking in broad daylight?

399
00:33:57,274 --> 00:34:01,289
What else would I do trapped in this stuffy annex?

400
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,227
If you're feeling stuffy, then go out.

401
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:12,110
Once I leave the front gate, people will start to recognize me.

402
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,694
Do you want me to go outside and be miserable?

403
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:19,928
We have to save money from now on, too.

404
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,959
I don't have money to spend frivolously anymore.

405
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,897
Still, how can you just sit here and drink?

406
00:34:31,545 --> 00:34:33,819
It's all over.

407
00:34:35,546 --> 00:34:38,381
It's all over.

408
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:41,600
You have to get used to this.

409
00:34:44,905 --> 00:34:45,905
Get used to what?

410
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:54,655
Waiting for no one, expecting nothing, resenting

411
00:34:54,680 --> 00:35:01,217
nobody, and just breathing like some kind of plant?

412
00:35:03,663 --> 00:35:04,740
Come and eat.

413
00:35:06,553 --> 00:35:09,428
Not right now. She's drunk.

414
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,412
Should I bring the food here?

415
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,772
Did we commit a crime? Why do we have to eat here?

416
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:27,319
Who am I scared of that I should eat in here?

417
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:50,186
Slow down. You'll get indigestion. Do you want one more egg?

418
00:35:51,264 --> 00:35:55,498
Oh, my. How caring you are.

419
00:35:56,577 --> 00:35:59,537
You're taking care of your younger brother-in-law with utmost kindness.

420
00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:01,319
What do you mean by that?

421
00:36:01,514 --> 00:36:05,037
Do you really feel nothing when you see Kyung-soo?

422
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,967
Are you drunk? Why are you picking a fight with her again?

423
00:36:08,077 --> 00:36:11,208
Are you saying you feel nothing more and nothing less than platonic feelings

424
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:14,038
of how a sister-in-law is taking care of her brother-in-law's lunch?

425
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:19,303
Oh my god. Why does it reek of alcohol in broad daylight?

426
00:36:21,624 --> 00:36:25,092
Yes. I drank because I'm about to be chased out

427
00:36:25,117 --> 00:36:28,150
of here, thanks to you two. Got a problem?

428
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:32,725
Drinking in broad daylight is dangerous, after all. You're not even a man.

429
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:37,725
You shouldn't have drank so much in a house with an elder in it.

430
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,615
Oh, how terrifying. Other people would think

431
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,233
I'm getting kicked out of here for drinking.

432
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:46,498
Yoo Ji-na, how dare you act drunk here?

433
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,739
Did you drink because you were too embarrassed about what

434
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:54,569
you did to come to the main house in a sober condition?

435
00:36:55,608 --> 00:36:57,873
How dare you act drunk when we're feeding you!

436
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:01,303
Na-kyung, are you trying to pick a fight with a drunkard?

437
00:37:01,592 --> 00:37:03,983
If you're going to drink, you should've drank quietly.

438
00:37:04,194 --> 00:37:06,394
One of you doomed me into a trap.

439
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:11,340
And the other one spent nights at the hospital room

440
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:14,405
just in case I would do something to Mrs. Sung.

441
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:23,443
In the end, Mrs. Sung safely woke up and ruined my life. So what?

442
00:37:25,303 --> 00:37:31,294
- Please stop it! - Let her be. It's amusing. Let's see how far she goes.

443
00:37:32,146 --> 00:37:35,638
I should drink, too. This is such a waste to see with a sober mind.

444
00:37:35,709 --> 00:37:40,935
Are you amused? Are you entertained after ruining my life like this?

445
00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:44,818
Are you entertained when my life is about to end?

446
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:47,685
Did you just say you're amused?

447
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:49,505
Stop eating and leave.

448
00:37:51,654 --> 00:37:53,454
- Let's go. - Let go of me!

449
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:59,654
This is all your fault. I'll make sure to remember you until I die, Ko Na-kyung!

450
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:02,740
What on earth is going on in the kitchen?

451
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,615
She drank in broad daylight and is now throwing a fit.

452
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,333
If you drank, you should quietly sleep! What on earth are you doing right now?

453
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:14,224
She can't live a day without alcohol, drugs, and men.

454
00:38:14,803 --> 00:38:19,505
Are you done talking? I told you to watch what you say in front of my son!

455
00:38:20,193 --> 00:38:22,536
So you know how to be embarrassed in front of your son.

456
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,708
You're not that drunk yet, are you?

457
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:28,529
- Na-kyung, that's enough. - Why waste your energy on someone who will leave soon?

458
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:29,638
Hold it in.

459
00:38:29,663 --> 00:38:31,193
Mrs. Sung Kyung-ja...

460
00:38:33,763 --> 00:38:35,708
- Hello. - What?

461
00:38:36,185 --> 00:38:41,029
I can't greet you every morning and night now. It's been a while since I've seen you.

462
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:50,810
Our almighty Mrs. Sung Kyung-ja with a stinking long life...

463
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:56,500
Thanks to you shortening my lifespan, I'm afraid I won't be able to

464
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:59,975
live until a hundred years old. Do you have a problem with that?

465
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:06,052
- Hey. Bring my lunch to my room. - Okay.

466
00:39:12,162 --> 00:39:14,294
I'm not done talking! Where are you going?

467
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,740
Do you still have something left to say?

468
00:39:16,943 --> 00:39:18,880
- It's unfair. - Unfair?

469
00:39:19,084 --> 00:39:20,084
It's unfair!

470
00:39:21,217 --> 00:39:22,967
That's enough to make a cat laugh.

471
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:25,732
 You did such a thing, and yet, you think it's unfair?

472
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:32,591
Do you think all of you can sleep peacefully after teaming up to take me out?

473
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,286
My grudge will become a curse in this house!

474
00:39:37,771 --> 00:39:41,224
The fact that someone like you came into this house is a curse!

475
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:45,615
The curse is slowly starting to fade away since you're being chased out of here!

476
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:48,927
So everything will be fine as long as you're gone! Do you understand?

477
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:53,224
As long as I'm gone?

478
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:59,099
Did Mr. Park murder his wife because I was in this house?

479
00:39:59,124 --> 00:40:02,122
- Shut your mouth! - This family will be destroyed!

480
00:40:02,451 --> 00:40:04,638
How dare you curse us!

481
00:40:04,732 --> 00:40:06,592
Do you think I'll leave quietly?

482
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,950
I'm going to go out into the world and humiliate this family!

483
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:15,716
I'm going to humiliate this family by telling everyone how messed up this family is!

484
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:20,036
As long as you leave, there will be nothing humiliating about our family!

485
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:23,966
So quit your rampage and go to sleep!

486
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:29,013
What are you doing home at this hour?

487
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:34,255
Well, my head hurt, so I came home early.

488
00:40:36,755 --> 00:40:42,146
All the people who ruined my life are here.

489
00:40:45,678 --> 00:40:48,130
Bronze medal goes to Ko Na-kyung.

490
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:51,552
Silver medal goes to Jung Hae-dang.

491
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:55,685
Gold medal goes to Mrs. Sung Kyung-ja.

492
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:02,021
And the worst of the worst goes to Mr. Park Sung-hwan!

493
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:05,974
What do you think you're doing in broad daylight?

494
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:12,990
Give me my life back!

495
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:17,638
It's your fault! It's because of you that my life started to become a wreck!

496
00:41:18,513 --> 00:41:21,622
Why are you doing this to me? Why do you only hate me?

497
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:27,982
Is this why you said you loved me? Is this why?

498
00:41:33,896 --> 00:41:35,990
Kyung-soo, what are you doing? Help her.

499
00:41:39,896 --> 00:41:43,349
I really can't stand to watch this! Good grief!

500
00:41:48,185 --> 00:41:51,052
What are you doing? Take her out right now.

501
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:56,318
Get up! Please come to your senses!

502
00:42:12,787 --> 00:42:16,453
You really can't trust a man's love.

503
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:20,243
He married a woman who is 18 years younger than he is,

504
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:23,208
so how can be be so cruel to her for having one affair?

505
00:42:44,037 --> 00:42:49,615
At one point, Ji-na was loved by everyone and the role model of every woman.

506
00:42:50,037 --> 00:42:56,294
But when I saw her sprawled on the floor drunk, I realized life is meaningless.

507
00:42:56,537 --> 00:42:59,660
It was too much of an honor for her to bear.

508
00:42:59,957 --> 00:43:02,335
She was too greedy for her own good when the only

509
00:43:03,211 --> 00:43:05,355
thing she had to believe in was your father's love.

510
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:21,035
I put my seal on the divorce paper.

511
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:29,089
(Choi Kyung-ae/To My Son)

512
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:35,183
No one else knows what's written in this letter besides Kyung-soo and me.

513
00:43:36,855 --> 00:43:41,183
As long as we keep quiet, the truth about Choi Kyung-ae's

514
00:43:41,723 --> 00:43:44,745
death that held you back will be buried forever.

515
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,427
Why are you giving me this?

516
00:43:51,511 --> 00:43:53,691
You're the one who ruined my life...

517
00:43:55,449 --> 00:44:01,472
but you're also the one who made an effort to love me until the end.

518
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,222
It was tiring, wasn't it?

519
00:44:23,371 --> 00:44:27,425
- I don't know how many stores I went to. - You did a good job.

520
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,488
I did this because you told me to.

521
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:33,962
If not for you, I would've never decided to do this.

522
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:36,925
Thank you. Wash up and then eat.

523
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:40,331
Hold on. I need to hug you once.

524
00:44:45,722 --> 00:44:47,956
I missed you so much the entire day.

525
00:44:53,668 --> 00:44:55,878
What should I buy you when I get my first paycheck?

526
00:44:57,043 --> 00:44:58,605
You don't need to buy me anything.

527
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:04,495
- It's the money I made by working hard. - I'm fine.

528
00:45:04,776 --> 00:45:07,142
Then should I buy long underwear for your father? I heard

529
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:09,808
that's what you're supposed to buy with your first paycheck.

530
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,843
Sounds good. He'll like it.

531
00:45:12,136 --> 00:45:16,659
Of course he will. He'll be so proud and happy of me.

532
00:45:18,105 --> 00:45:19,339
- Come and eat. - Okay.

533
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:27,534
I heard you entered the company as a contract employee.

534
00:45:30,558 --> 00:45:32,839
Does this mean you're going to start from the basics?

535
00:45:34,355 --> 00:45:38,245
- What are you going to do after that? - Mind your own business.

536
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:42,269
After starting from the basics, where do you think you'll end up in?

537
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:46,425
I'm going to find a spot that is right for me.

538
00:45:47,332 --> 00:45:50,167
As a contract employee who wanders from store to store?

539
00:45:51,027 --> 00:45:54,253
Even though I'm a contract employee, I'm the owner of the company.

540
00:45:55,738 --> 00:46:00,575
Even though you're sitting in the CEO's seat, you're not the owner of the company.

541
00:46:02,035 --> 00:46:07,105
The owner of the company? I thought you said you had no interest in the company.

542
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:12,269
- I have interest now. - Who says you can? I never gave you permission.

543
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,159
I never needed your permission from the beginning.

544
00:46:17,636 --> 00:46:21,870
Whether I have interest in it or not is up to me.

545
00:46:23,051 --> 00:46:24,941
I decided to have interest in it now.

546
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:31,199
Why don't you acknowledge that the owner of the company right now is me? How arrogant!

547
00:46:31,418 --> 00:46:34,253
Because you didn't get the company through a proper manner.

548
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,839
Hyun-joon, isn't work difficult?

549
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,409
All work is difficult, but I learn a lot in the store.

550
00:46:59,613 --> 00:47:01,433
Good. Do your best.

551
00:47:01,691 --> 00:47:05,253
I think listening to the opinions of our store products

552
00:47:05,278 --> 00:47:08,266
from the customers will help me a lot later on.

553
00:47:08,441 --> 00:47:15,823
Of course. Most successors start from the basics.

554
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:17,961
I'll do my best.

555
00:47:19,433 --> 00:47:24,339
Starting from tomorrow morning, tell Kyung-soo to join us at the table.

556
00:47:27,191 --> 00:47:28,324
What do you mean?

557
00:47:28,504 --> 00:47:31,628
It's his mom that did wrong. He didn't do anything wrong.

558
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:38,128
- What did you say? - I won't see Ji-na, but Kyung-soo is already my son.

559
00:47:43,324 --> 00:47:47,370
- What does he mean? - He doesn't like the fact that I'm coming near the company.

560
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:55,777
Still, how could he accept Kyung-soo as his son when he detests Ji-na so much?

561
00:47:56,894 --> 00:48:00,894
- Maybe that's how much he likes Kyung-soo. - Or maybe he hates me that much.

562
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:07,933
- Darn it! - Damn it. I lost! I lost to Mr. Park Sung-hwan!

563
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:14,316
What can we do?

564
00:48:15,238 --> 00:48:21,394
What's the point of chasing out Ji-na when he insists on making Kyung-soo his son?

565
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,988
This is a dangerous signal.

566
00:48:25,465 --> 00:48:28,254
Even though Ji-na did something so awful, he's

567
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:30,829
still going to accept Kyung-soo as his son.

568
00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:35,628
It's not overboard to say that he already made up his mind.

569
00:48:36,394 --> 00:48:40,154
It wasn't a complete bluff when he kept saying he would transfer his shares to him.

570
00:48:40,746 --> 00:48:44,464
Did that letter go into Yoo Ji-na's hands?

571
00:48:45,136 --> 00:48:46,136
What?

572
00:48:46,886 --> 00:48:50,073
She made a deal with father using that letter.

573
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:57,206
If not that, he wouldn't be able to make such a decision in this situation.

574
00:48:57,316 --> 00:49:01,972
So, Kyung-soo ended up giving the letter to his mom.

575
00:49:03,136 --> 00:49:09,745
She committed an unforgivable act and is about to get divorced.

576
00:49:10,777 --> 00:49:13,510
So he couldn't resist and gave it to her.

577
00:49:18,746 --> 00:49:21,813
I didn't give it to her. She found it herself.

578
00:49:23,066 --> 00:49:25,722
- Are you sure? - Good-bye.

579
00:49:42,277 --> 00:49:46,722
She eventually found that letter because she was chased out to the annex.

580
00:49:47,996 --> 00:49:49,785
There's no safe in there.

581
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:55,292
We shouldn't have made her move there! We should've just chased her out of the house!

582
00:49:55,535 --> 00:50:00,488
We didn't think it mattered where she went because they were going to divorce anyways.

583
00:50:01,386 --> 00:50:03,120
What can we do now?

584
00:50:13,402 --> 00:50:14,669
What are you doing?

585
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:18,097
We're going to stay at the hotel before we move into our apartment.

586
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:22,433
I think it would be unreasonable for us to keep staying here.

587
00:50:24,081 --> 00:50:28,073
Starting from tomorrow morning, you're going to join us at the table.

588
00:50:35,097 --> 00:50:36,164
Are you serious?

589
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:39,818
That's what my father-in-law said.

590
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:04,519
Why did you come in here without knocking?

591
00:51:04,544 --> 00:51:10,144
- Did you use the letter to make a deal with Yoo Ji-na? - It's not a deal.

592
00:51:10,441 --> 00:51:13,609
Didn't she threaten to give the letter to me if her

593
00:51:14,117 --> 00:51:16,550
son has nothing to do with this family anymore?

594
00:51:18,314 --> 00:51:24,495
So you took her son's side solely because you didn't want me to have the letter?

595
00:51:29,988 --> 00:51:36,159
No. I'm going to side with Kyung-soo simply because I hate you.

596
00:51:37,324 --> 00:51:39,789
- What did you say? - What are you going to do about it?

597
00:51:40,621 --> 00:51:42,355
I'm not going to forgive you.

598
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:47,269
You will never have the power to forgive me or not.

599
00:51:48,675 --> 00:51:52,475
There's zero possibility that you'll have the letter now.

600
00:51:53,965 --> 00:51:54,965
Why?

601
00:51:57,269 --> 00:51:59,644
Because it's in my hand now.

602
00:52:01,543 --> 00:52:07,003
You lost your one and only weapon to destroy me...

603
00:52:09,457 --> 00:52:10,457
forever.

604
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:15,176
Cheers!

605
00:52:17,418 --> 00:52:21,917
Anyways, what do I do about the room Hae-dang used to use?

606
00:52:22,207 --> 00:52:26,042
- It's a bit of a waste to leave it empty. - Hae-dang's room?

607
00:52:26,722 --> 00:52:32,839
I want to just leave it be and go in there whenever I miss her, but it's a waste.

608
00:52:32,988 --> 00:52:36,219
Of course it is. It's a huge waste.

609
00:52:36,457 --> 00:52:40,097
Ask your sister if she wants to use that room.

610
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:42,839
Bong-sun? Ask if she wants to use that huge room?

611
00:52:44,816 --> 00:52:48,216
I don't want to. What would I do in that huge room?

612
00:52:48,241 --> 00:52:51,456
I'm already ashamed living here as it is. Forget it.

613
00:52:51,753 --> 00:52:56,894
- Should I move in there? - Calm down. Why would you live downstairs?

614
00:52:57,011 --> 00:53:02,701
I want to live in a big room before I die. I want to use a bed, too.

615
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:08,144
- The bed is uncomfortable for old people. - I'm not that old yet.

616
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:11,479
So you're really going to stay downstairs?

617
00:53:11,504 --> 00:53:13,738
Gosh, I was just kidding!

618
00:53:13,832 --> 00:53:16,073
I'm already the center of gossip for living above him.

619
00:53:16,098 --> 00:53:18,284
If the neighborhood ladies find out, they'll go nuts!

620
00:53:20,081 --> 00:53:21,348
Then what do we do?

621
00:53:21,988 --> 00:53:27,511
- Hold on. Should we put it up or rent? - That's a great idea!

622
00:53:27,926 --> 00:53:30,503
That room is big, so you'll be able to get a good price for it.

623
00:53:31,332 --> 00:53:34,425
Gosh, but I don't like having strangers in my house.

624
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:37,284
Then should we just leave that huge room empty?

625
00:53:37,426 --> 00:53:43,269
Then how about we find a quiet tenant? It's a waste to leave it empty anyways.

626
00:53:47,722 --> 00:53:52,355
I'll actively find a quiet tenant to move in!

627
00:53:52,558 --> 00:53:55,019
You will? Thank you!

628
00:54:01,793 --> 00:54:06,675
Why would I rent a room in someone else's home when I have my own house?

629
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,706
It's not easy to achieve love.

630
00:54:10,129 --> 00:54:13,159
Do you think it's so easy to become the wife of the owner of a gas station?

631
00:54:13,184 --> 00:54:16,261
- That's true. - He's the owner of a gas station.

632
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:18,448
- You're right! - Way to go!

633
00:54:26,324 --> 00:54:28,331
What brings you here again?

634
00:54:28,527 --> 00:54:31,519
- I came to check out the room. - Check out the what?

635
00:54:32,011 --> 00:54:37,472
She lost her house to debt suddenly, so she doesn't have a place to stay.

636
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,238
You have a lot of money, so why would you lose your house?

637
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:47,128
She made a daring investment and her house was repossessed.

638
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:49,691
Please come in.

639
00:54:55,465 --> 00:54:58,941
She's so scary when it comes to money, so what did she invest into?

640
00:54:59,715 --> 00:55:02,316
Father! Father!

641
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:07,777
Oh, dear. What brings you here again?

642
00:55:07,802 --> 00:55:11,887
- I came to check out the room. - The room?

643
00:55:12,457 --> 00:55:13,784
- Is it this room? - Yes.

644
00:55:13,809 --> 00:55:16,183
I'll go inside and take a closer look.

645
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,472
What do you think you're doing?

646
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:25,703
I put up the room for rent, but people these

647
00:55:25,728 --> 00:55:28,260
days want to rent a room that has a separate

648
00:55:28,285 --> 00:55:33,169
kitchen and bathroom, so it's hard to find a tenant who wants just a room these days!

649
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,498
Then we won't look for a tenant!

650
00:55:35,523 --> 00:55:39,584
She's perfect though! You know her, and she can become part of the family!

651
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:42,977
- Stop spouting nonsense! - How is that nonsense?

652
00:55:43,538 --> 00:55:46,756
- Give me two reasons why this is nonsense. - How dare you!

653
00:55:51,741 --> 00:55:55,492
I like it! The room is big and clean.

654
00:55:55,874 --> 00:56:02,975
Yes, well, I have to discuss this with the family first.

655
00:56:03,132 --> 00:56:06,811
Mr. Yeon told me the discussion was over.

656
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:11,069
Yes, it's over! We were about to put it up for rent anyways!

657
00:56:12,624 --> 00:56:18,883
- But the thing is... - What? Do you not want me as a tenant?

658
00:56:19,101 --> 00:56:22,092
No, of course not.

659
00:56:22,788 --> 00:56:25,538
Then let's sign the contract right away!

660
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:28,413
But...well...

661
00:56:33,546 --> 00:56:36,920
So that shaman lady came to check out the room?

662
00:56:37,218 --> 00:56:38,709
Bong-soo must have dragged her here.

663
00:56:39,356 --> 00:56:42,639
She didn't seem like the style to be pushed away so easily...

664
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:50,084
- By who? - Huh? Oh, it's nothing. But why her out of everyone else...?

665
00:56:53,569 --> 00:56:56,836
You can't get much putting up this room for rent.

666
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,422
You can't get that much digging up dirt.

667
00:56:59,447 --> 00:57:03,935
You'll be afraid of women once you lose all your fortune in your later years.

668
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,893
There's no reason for me to lose my fortune.

669
00:57:06,918 --> 00:57:09,088
Isn't it obvious that the gold digger is all over you

670
00:57:09,114 --> 00:57:11,444
because you're going to become the owner of a gas station?

671
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:16,053
- Don't gold diggers have to be pretty? - Do you think all gold diggers are pretty?

672
00:57:16,335 --> 00:57:18,436
How could ugly women be gold diggers?

673
00:57:18,461 --> 00:57:22,350
They can, if there are many foolish men like Jung Kang-sik.

674
00:57:22,537 --> 00:57:26,889
- Mrs. Baek Mi-sook! - She's not a gold digger! She's a money-lender!

675
00:57:26,914 --> 00:57:29,467
Who knows what she did to make that kind of money?

676
00:57:31,343 --> 00:57:35,018
So, as of today, Mrs. Oh Soon-jung used to be a bully

677
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:38,488
in her school days, lived as a gold digger for some

678
00:57:38,858 --> 00:57:42,139
time in order to make some money to become a money-lender,

679
00:57:42,288 --> 00:57:45,397
and will soon become a shaman. After that...?

680
00:57:46,827 --> 00:57:49,366
I'm against having that woman as our tenant.

681
00:57:49,607 --> 00:57:51,207
- Me, too. - I'm for it.

682
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:54,647
The landlord's opinion is the most important.

683
00:57:55,444 --> 00:57:57,811
What do you think, Mr. Jung Kang-sik?

684
00:57:58,115 --> 00:58:04,608
If you ask me that way, it's difficult to give you an exact answer, Mrs. Baek Mi-sook.

685
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:14,030
We're going to clean up the guest room on the second floor.

686
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:17,647
You can stay there from now on, Kyung-soo.

687
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:24,295
Then what about the annex? Are you just going to leave his mom there?

688
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:27,905
I can't tell her to leave for Kyung-soo's sake.

689
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:41,428
Bring me some snacks to the annex.

690
00:58:42,655 --> 00:58:46,147
- Take them yourself. - "Take them yourself?"

691
00:58:48,226 --> 00:58:52,733
You're no longer my mother-in-law, since you and my father-in-law are over now.

692
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:58,717
However, my son may become the owner of the company in the future.

693
00:58:59,491 --> 00:59:02,092
That means I'm the owner's mother.

694
00:59:02,226 --> 00:59:05,998
Who says that will even happen? Don't be ridiculous.

695
00:59:06,366 --> 00:59:11,428
It may be ridiculous for other families, but it makes perfect sense in this family.

696
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:16,350
Especially when it pertains to Park Hyun-joon, Park Hyun-sung, and Park Sung-hwan.

697
00:59:18,163 --> 00:59:23,189
Later on when my son becomes the owner, will you or will you not

698
00:59:23,214 --> 00:59:28,085
beg me to make Hyun-sung into a higher position than Hyun-joon?

699
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:58,568
I gave the letter to Mr. Park because of you.

700
01:00:00,647 --> 01:00:04,600
- Because of me? - Because I couldn't make you the wife of the CEO.

701
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,858
It looks like Hyun-joon, who was born as the son of the CEO,

702
01:00:10,436 --> 01:00:15,084
will end up as nothing more than a contract employee because of unlucky you.

703
01:00:27,015 --> 01:00:29,952
The letter ended up in Mr. Park's hands.

704
01:00:32,163 --> 01:00:36,827
I can neither solve the mystery of my mom's unfair death nor destroy Mr. Park now.

705
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:41,514
If we find the clue, that letter becomes meaningless.

706
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:47,084
- Think of a place where she could have hid the clue. - I can't think of a place.

707
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:51,178
Isn't there a place that only you and your mother know about?

708
01:00:51,421 --> 01:00:56,803
Where in the house is a place that only my mom and I know about?

709
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:07,897
When Kyung-soo snuck into this house, why did you start to suspect him?

710
01:01:08,913 --> 01:01:12,483
You must have suspected him because he did something strange.

711
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,608
Think about the moment when you first started to suspect him.

712
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,655
At first, I thought he was blind,

713
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:27,569
but one day, he said he had dropped something and was looking for it.

714
01:01:29,413 --> 01:01:33,709
However, he was searching for something like a normal person would.

715
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,795
What are you doing here?

716
01:01:44,264 --> 01:01:48,170
- I dropped something, so I was looking for it. - What did you drop?

717
01:01:51,905 --> 01:01:54,467
But was this how you were searching for it?

718
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:57,319
You're searching for things like normal people do.

719
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:04,444
At first, I didn't think much about it.

720
01:02:05,702 --> 01:02:10,998
But one day, he was digging under a tree when he was blind.

721
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:19,209
Did you lose something again?

722
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:26,210
No.

723
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:32,350
- Did you do this? - No.

724
01:02:32,788 --> 01:02:34,600
You look like you're looking for something.

725
01:02:34,796 --> 01:02:37,863
I've always liked trees and the smell of dirt.

726
01:02:38,741 --> 01:02:40,498
What kind of excuse is that?

727
01:02:41,726 --> 01:02:43,593
You said you didn't do this.

728
01:02:44,241 --> 01:02:47,530
- Didn't you go out? - Oh, I forgot something.

729
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:50,298
I see. I'll be going now.

730
01:02:57,139 --> 01:03:00,139
Was there something under that tree?

731
01:03:00,851 --> 01:03:04,248
I dug under it later on, but there was nothing.

732
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:14,991
That's it! It's a tree!

733
01:03:17,718 --> 01:03:20,522
There's a tree in the yard that only my mom and I know about!

734
01:03:36,538 --> 01:03:37,538
It's this tree.

735
01:04:31,232 --> 01:04:33,794
("You Are Too Much")

736
01:04:34,132 --> 01:04:38,959
Who the heck has the crucial evidence to end him once and for all?

737
01:04:38,984 --> 01:04:41,834
- Did you dig for the evidence? - You, too?

738
01:04:41,859 --> 01:04:44,233
Our father-in-law probably dug it up.

739
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:46,178
Lee Kyung-soo knows about that tree, too.

740
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:50,694
Ms. Yoo Ji-na, you should know enough about men by now.

741
01:04:50,897 --> 01:04:52,746
Do you think you two can become a married

742
01:04:52,772 --> 01:04:54,796
couple again after he saw such a horrid video?

743
01:04:54,936 --> 01:04:56,873
Yoo Ji-na's real name is Kim Hae-jung, isn't it?

744
01:04:56,898 --> 01:05:00,320
It has been confirmed that a huge amount had been deposited into Mr. Yoon's account.

745
01:05:00,744 --> 01:05:03,044
