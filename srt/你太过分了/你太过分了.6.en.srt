<i>[Yoo Ji Na]</i>

4
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,452
Meet me once.

5
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:33,378
I already told you
there is no need for us to do that.

6
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:35,950
I think there's a misunderstanding.

7
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,862
Whether you believe me or not,
that was not my intention.

8
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:43,319
<i>Let's meet and talk. Please.</i>

9
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:45,509
I'm in your neighborhood.

10
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:49,323
I saw a cafe nearby
that looked pretty quiet.

11
00:00:50,588 --> 00:00:52,737
I'm going to wait for you.

12
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,673
Welcome. The worker left temporarily.

13
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:24,275
Do you mind waiting?

14
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:26,352
It doesn't matter.

15
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:54,534
Oh my goodness! Yoo Ji Na!

16
00:01:57,572 --> 00:01:59,673
You work here?

17
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:02,384
I came here to meet Hae Dang.

18
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:04,384
It's been a while.

19
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:11,568
Hey.

20
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:17,661
- Let's go somewhere to talk.
- Shall we?

21
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:20,604
See you again.

22
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:29,598
Just now...

23
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:35,665
- Was that the singer, Yoo Ji Na?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:38,687
Does she meet with Hae Dang
from time to time?

25
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:43,055
They used to meet often,
but not since last year.

26
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:59,421
Why don't you accept...

27
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:01,341
the offer?

28
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:09,665
I'm not doing this because I'm
worried about the child in the picture.

29
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:12,638
How could I even think that way?

30
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:15,731
Your calculations are
cleaner than I thought.

31
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:19,961
You said to forget about him
as a way of paying my debt.

32
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:23,003
Do you want me to pay with my life now?

33
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,895
Jung Hae Dang.

34
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:28,501
I remember clearly that you said

35
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:31,180
you did not seduce him.

36
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,347
So you don't need to feel responsible.

37
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:39,520
I'm not doing this
to make myself feel better.

38
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:46,897
I made a promise to Sung Taek.

39
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:53,455
He felt terrible knowing that
you spent your youthful days

40
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:56,356
at night clubs.

41
00:03:56,356 --> 00:04:00,038
That doesn't mean you
have any right to interfere.

42
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:05,335
I actually find it extremely rude
for you to go out of your way

43
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:07,034
to get me a ridiculous contract offer.

44
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:11,298
I came out here to tell you that.

45
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:12,830
Jung Hae Dang.

46
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:19,641
How was it when you lived with him?

47
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,190
The man I considered to be my husband,
whom I lived with for 10 years...

48
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,711
You told me to give him to you
because you had to live with him once.

49
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:35,197
So, how was it living with him?

50
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:37,291
Hae Dang.

51
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,559
Do you know that it was
more cruel for you to tell me

52
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:43,341
to give him to you than to
think of it as paying my debt to you?

53
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:50,682
- That's...
- If I didn't live off of your songs

54
00:04:50,682 --> 00:04:53,653
do you think you could
have said it so easily?

55
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:56,571
- Hae Dang...
- You want to help me?

56
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:01,898
Then, just like you said

57
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:06,903
if I live off of your
hit songs or your success...

58
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:11,711
just forget everything,
as if we had never met.

59
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:44,149
Hae Soo, go to your tutor.

60
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,721
What's going on?

61
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:49,226
It's nothing. Hurry up
and go. I'll do that.

62
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:56,327
I won't be late. I'll be back!

63
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,370
I heard that Yoo Ji Na was here.

64
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:09,798
It was nothing.

65
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:11,851
Then why didn't you just talk here?

66
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:17,127
It might have worried you and Hae Soo
if you had heard the conversation.

67
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,891
Do you...

68
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:24,639
know what Yoo Ji Na's real name is?

69
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,880
Real name?

70
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,425
She had a different name?
I don't think that's on her profile.

71
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,274
Really?

72
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:35,389
Why?

73
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:38,846
- Just because...
- You want me to find out?

74
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:41,773
No.

75
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:47,435
- Do you want coffee?
- Later.

76
00:06:47,435 --> 00:06:49,334
I'm going to go rest.

77
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,091
Are you okay? What? Are you dizzy?

78
00:06:58,254 --> 00:06:59,937
No.

79
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,759
I'm okay.

80
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:38,903
Thank you. Good bye!

81
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:44,723
<i>You can try to meet
with the family members.</i>

82
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:48,619
Welcome!

83
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,519
Come on in!

84
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:53,610
Thank you!

85
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,303
- How much would you like?
- Fill it up, please.

86
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:58,004
Okay! Fill it up!

87
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:10,312
Your car's nice.

88
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:13,247
Let me clean this part.

89
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,062
You don't need to do that, sir!

90
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:24,127
Wow!

91
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:29,629
I thought the car was nice,
but the car owner is also good looking.

92
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:32,302
Someone's son is very handsome.

93
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:34,672
Thank you.

94
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:37,224
Actually, I came here
about your daughter...

95
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:39,373
My daughter?

96
00:08:39,373 --> 00:08:41,611
Which one?

97
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:43,434
I have four daughters.

98
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:45,995
Jung Hae Dang.

99
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:48,664
- Are you Hae Dang's friend?
- What?

100
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:51,176
Oh... Are you not her friend?

101
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:52,876
We are friends!

102
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,518
Who knew Hae Dang had
such a handsome friend?

103
00:08:57,518 --> 00:08:59,922
I'm so glad to meet you!

104
00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:02,797
But what to do...

105
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:05,960
I need to treat you with something...

106
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,932
Hold on.

107
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,206
Take these at least.

108
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:19,769
Drink these in the car.

109
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,388
Thank you!

110
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:23,902
Can we go somewhere for some tea?

111
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:26,402
With me? Tea?

112
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:36,837
My goodness.

113
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:45,001
No matter how much
I look at you, you are handsome!

114
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,903
- You can speak to me casually, Father.
- Father?

115
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:50,605
Okay, okay.

116
00:09:50,605 --> 00:09:55,860
Hae Dang recently had a contract offer
from a company... Did you hear about it?

117
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,326
Of course!

118
00:09:57,326 --> 00:10:02,230
I heard the offer was pretty good.
Why do you think she's not signing it?

119
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,354
I heard those guys were con men.

120
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:09,120
- Con men?
- Who cares if the offer is good?

121
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,219
They were con men.

122
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,325
Ah... They were con men...

123
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:22,682
By the way

124
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:25,486
our Hae Dang is really kind.

125
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:28,126
- She seems very brave.
- She sure is!

126
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:32,287
She's kind and brave and that's
why I have nothing more I could ask for!

127
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:34,672
You're right.

128
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:38,301
Parents know their kids best.

129
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:41,485
For the man who marries Hae Dang

130
00:10:41,485 --> 00:10:43,945
he will be so fortunate,
as if gaining half of the world.

131
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,831
- Half?
- Of course!

132
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:51,131
She is not someone
who would hurt anyone.

133
00:10:51,131 --> 00:10:53,932
- I see...
- I have four daughters.

134
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:56,768
My next oldest daughter is smart

135
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:59,653
but she has a way of poking
her family members' buttons.

136
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:04,875
My third daughter has a lot of affection,
but she can't control her temper.

137
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:09,788
And my youngest is kind,
but she is not brave.

138
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:14,114
- I see...
- That's why Hae Dang is the best!

139
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:16,474
I think so too!

140
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:20,789
Please be good to Hae Dang.

141
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:23,187
You seem like a good person.

142
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:28,533
I wouldn't say I'm good,
but I've had experiences

143
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:33,431
and I'm not someone who just
compliments my children, you know?

144
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:35,714
- I'll come visit from time to time.
- Sure, sure.

145
00:11:35,714 --> 00:11:40,217
Today's main point was
that Hae Dang is the best.

146
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:41,892
I will remember that.

147
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:45,765
- Did I talk too much?
- No, no!

148
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:48,302
- So, I'll be going now.
- I will as well.

149
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:51,092
- Nice to meet you!
- Yes.

150
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:54,042
- Come again!
- Okay.

151
00:11:58,738 --> 00:12:02,197
See you. Drive safe!

152
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,000
Goodness.

153
00:12:05,873 --> 00:12:07,572
Let me clean this.

154
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:20,625
See you!

155
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,301
You should go wash up and eat.
Why are you in here?

156
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,357
So...

157
00:12:51,357 --> 00:12:53,807
Take a look at this.

158
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:56,369
Oh my gosh... What is this?

159
00:12:59,323 --> 00:13:01,272
It's a ring!

160
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:05,975
You're... giving this to me?

161
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,667
It's not an expensive thing.

162
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:10,894
Wear it for the youngest
aunt's 60th birthday celebration.

163
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:13,638
Mom, you hit the jackpot!

164
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:15,833
Oh my goodness....

165
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,960
Is this a dream or real life?

166
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,265
You were always saying how your finger
felt empty because you didn't have a ring

167
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:25,297
to wear whenever you
met up with your friends.

168
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:28,474
- It's so beautiful.
- Do you like it?

169
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,426
Like it? I more than like it!

170
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:34,636
Your father sold the wedding ring

171
00:13:34,636 --> 00:13:38,104
and later bought me a pearl ring
to replace it, and I wore it for awhile

172
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:41,946
until we had no money.
We went to a jewelry shop

173
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,754
but he said the pearl
was only worth 30,000 won.

174
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:47,802
But you sold it
and took the 30,000 won.

175
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:50,913
- How do you know that?
- Because I went with you.

176
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,081
I think it was around middle school?

177
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:57,690
We didn't talk at all when
we walked back home that day.

178
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,399
This is the first ring
I've worn since then.

179
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,861
Good job. She has two children

180
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:08,783
but neither of us ever bought her a ring.

181
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:12,330
If you wear a ring like this,
don't you have to do this?

182
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,306
Oh my head... Why does
my head hurt so much?

183
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:21,340
Wear it well and then
before you pass away

184
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,054
- make sure you give it to me.
- What?

185
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:26,878
What? Are you going to give
it to your daughter-in-law?

186
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:32,198
All my friends are wearing a ring.
Now I have one too!

187
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:34,431
You like it that much?

188
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:36,854
I should have bought it sooner.

189
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:39,870
Did you tell her?

190
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,278
You can't tell my wife.

191
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:46,576
Okay. I'll wear it secretly
from time to time when I go out.

192
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:48,225
Okay.

193
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,827
Careful, careful.

194
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:56,730
Here you go, Mother.

195
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,280
I was in a rush, so there are
not a lot of side dishes.

196
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,847
That's okay! This is enough to eat!

197
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:06,148
Come over here! Let's eat with Grandma!

198
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:08,184
Clean up whatever you eat.

199
00:15:08,184 --> 00:15:09,802
Oh okay.

200
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:12,688
We can at least do the dishes.

201
00:16:10,181 --> 00:16:12,503
Are you not going to eat dinner?

202
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:20,739
I'm sorry. Why don't you
go ahead and eat by yourself?

203
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:24,793
Are you sick? If you're sick,
you should go to the hospital.

204
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:27,567
I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

205
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:45,246
They're freesias.

206
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:46,946
Do you like freesias?

207
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:49,307
I like the scent of all flowers.

208
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:06,130
Can you take me outside?

209
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,372
I feel really trapped today.

210
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:12,115
Where can we go at this hour?

211
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:18,661
You'll feel better once you
smell the scent of flowers.

212
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:26,626
What is this?

213
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:30,281
A rose.

214
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:35,167
Let's see...

215
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:41,432
What is this?

216
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:44,821
A tulip.

217
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:46,820
You're good.

218
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,119
I'm going to ask a hard one this time.

219
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,219
What do you think this is?

220
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:59,127
Hyacinth.

221
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:01,041
Hyacinth?

222
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,012
Make sure you remember.

223
00:18:03,012 --> 00:18:06,913
I'm going to buy one flower
every day and ask you what it is.

224
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:12,617
I guess that means I have
to wait for you every day.

225
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:15,310
What flower will she bring me this time?

226
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:19,611
A woman with a flower...

227
00:18:19,611 --> 00:18:21,536
I like it.

228
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:24,307
Do you know what I hate doing the most?

229
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:30,570
Waiting for someone.

230
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,319
In the midst of complete
darkness and fear

231
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,089
I waited for one person... My mother.

232
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:42,843
But in the end, she didn't come.

233
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:49,541
<i>I thought I was going to stop breathing
because I missed my mom so much.</i>

234
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:55,321
<i>I have no idea how I survived
that time at that age...</i>

235
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:04,972
I couldn't even think about
my suffering during that time.

236
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:10,415
I didn't feel anything.
I didn't hope for anything.

237
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,563
I didn't resent anybody.

238
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:15,705
In those days, I tried my hardest...

239
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:21,137
not to wait for anyone.

240
00:19:23,571 --> 00:19:25,625
Nowadays

241
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,990
I'm always listening to the sound
of the cafe door opening.

242
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,525
Are you waiting for me?

243
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,599
Don't worry.

244
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:43,333
I'll always show up.

245
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,978
For how long?

246
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,673
You brought your phone, right?

247
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:08,244
<i>[Hae Dang. Saved.]</i>

248
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:10,313
Here.

249
00:20:10,313 --> 00:20:14,442
I saved my number in
your speed dial as one.

250
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:18,330
If I don't come when you're
waiting for me, call me.

251
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:45,490
Why do I hear the sound of a music globe?

252
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,219
Isn't the sound so pretty?

253
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:53,145
Your present.

254
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:54,815
Present?

255
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,397
It's the first time you've gotten
a present from a woman, right?

256
00:20:58,397 --> 00:21:04,224
Student volunteers always give me gifts
on Valentine's Day and Christmas.

257
00:21:04,224 --> 00:21:06,974
You're popular with the college
of music students, aren't you?

258
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,817
I probably have at least 30
music globes in my drawer.

259
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:11,551
Really?

260
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,851
- I'm going to throw the rest out though.
- You don't have to throw them out.

261
00:21:17,673 --> 00:21:21,060
I think this one makes
the prettiest sound.

262
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:38,067
You can leave right now
if you're not up for it.

263
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:40,337
I can tell Father.

264
00:21:40,337 --> 00:21:42,007
It's fine.

265
00:21:45,942 --> 00:21:47,973
Your mother is actually here?

266
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,374
Yoo Ji Na is not someone who
goes back on her word, is she?

267
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:55,329
Oh my gosh...
I shouldn't have said anything.

268
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:57,829
All right. Let's go.

269
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,932
Mother, you said you
had something to say?

270
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:14,061
I apologize for what happened last time.

271
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:16,496
I believe I misunderstood you.

272
00:22:16,496 --> 00:22:20,510
I would also like to apologize
for the trouble I caused.

273
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,984
Please stay at our house.

274
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:26,728
To be honest, I was not
planning on doing that.

275
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:29,453
You were not planning to stay?

276
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:31,446
Then, why did you come out?

277
00:22:31,446 --> 00:22:34,144
Are you trying to teach me a lesson?

278
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:40,627
- Mother.
- I will receive this as an apology

279
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:42,227
and pretend it did not happen.

280
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:45,285
You are rude and impudent
even to the very end!

281
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:46,414
Mother!

282
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:50,673
When an adult speaks to you,
you should just agree respectfully.

283
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:54,374
Did your family teach you
to talk back to an elder?

284
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,692
You are a vulgar one!

285
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:59,194
Mother!

286
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:02,731
Like you said, I didn't
learn much growing up

287
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:06,126
so there may be many things
that might displease you.

288
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:08,612
- Are you sure you're okay with that?
- What?

289
00:23:08,612 --> 00:23:12,762
If you're not comfortable with me
moving in, I can tell Chairman Park.

290
00:23:12,762 --> 00:23:15,482
Since he listens to everything I say.

291
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:18,574
If you're afraid of your son...

292
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:26,329
What are you doing?

293
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:36,592
It is my sincere hope

294
00:23:36,592 --> 00:23:39,958
that you stop rejecting us

295
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:43,990
and come stay at the house
as if it were your own.

296
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,707
Let's go.

297
00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:49,781
Father, I'll be going.

298
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:53,567
Okay. I'll see you later.

299
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,425
I will see you next time.

300
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:05,843
I'd like to live in your house once
to see how great a household it is.

301
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:09,887
No. I think I made a mistake.

302
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:12,358
It's only going
to stir up trouble if you stay.

303
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:16,760
No.

304
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,532
I don't have a place to live
for a month anyway.

305
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:38,622
Go ahead!

306
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:42,451
Try coming into my house
and see what happens!

307
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:51,261
- Welcome home.
- I already had dinner.

308
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:56,684
Yoo Ji Na is staying at our house.

309
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:02,102
Grandmother approved?

310
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:04,563
We're going to see her morning and night

311
00:25:04,563 --> 00:25:06,755
so we'll have to treat her
like family from now on.

312
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,665
See her morning and night?

313
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:12,564
Your father also said that she will
be joining us for breakfast and dinner.

314
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:17,280
Where is he right now?

315
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,290
He is not in a good mood right now.

316
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:35,186
We're going to eat at the same table?

317
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:39,125
I am not in the mood to deal
with you right now. Get out.

318
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:42,260
Am I really the son of
Chairman Park Sung Hwan?

319
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:48,916
- What?
- Nowadays, I wonder

320
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:52,541
if you really are my father.

321
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:55,896
I'm sorry to say but
you are indeed my son.

322
00:25:55,896 --> 00:26:00,211
Then, what do your children mean to you?

323
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:02,484
- What did you say?
- Are we just parts to you?

324
00:26:02,484 --> 00:26:06,310
Are we simply parts to be used
that you don't care about?

325
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,313
So...

326
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,516
what am I to you?

327
00:26:10,516 --> 00:26:13,625
You should see how other
parents treat their children!

328
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,801
As a grown man,
you are talking way too much.

329
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:19,788
There is a father
who thinks only of his children

330
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,542
while he is filling up cars with gas.

331
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:26,428
Then, you can be his son
and live with him!

332
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:39,058
What do you mean you don't need
to sign a contract with Yoo Ji Na?

333
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:43,421
I'm about to see her for every meal,
so what's the point of a contract?

334
00:26:43,421 --> 00:26:45,068
What?

335
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,820
Who knew Hae Dang had
such a handsome friend?

336
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,086
I'm so glad to meet you!

337
00:26:56,086 --> 00:26:58,256
But what to do...

338
00:26:58,256 --> 00:27:01,262
I need to treat you with something...

339
00:27:01,262 --> 00:27:04,163
- Take these with you.
- Okay.

340
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:20,400
Come on in!

341
00:27:25,972 --> 00:27:29,584
I have to change, so get out.

342
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:33,358
Would you work with me if the contract
had nothing to do with Yoo Ji Na?

343
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:35,546
Now you're really trying to scam me.

344
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:38,063
Am I not already
a con man because of you?

345
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:39,473
Hey. Hello?

346
00:27:39,473 --> 00:27:44,109
You should stop being so arrogant
and think about your hard-working father.

347
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,781
- Are you interested in me?
- What?

348
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:52,647
If not, then why do you keep coming
here and rambling on about nonsense?

349
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:55,609
Rambling on about nonsense? Wow...

350
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:59,305
The more we talk,
the nicer your words become.

351
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,134
Don't be this way.
Just sign the contract.

352
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:03,798
Why? What is it that you see
in a club singer like me?

353
00:28:05,272 --> 00:28:09,134
You talk really nicely.

354
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:12,157
Plus, your English pronunciation is good.

355
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,945
Let's just try it.

356
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:17,622
Hey, who knows? Maybe you're
the pearl hidden underneath the dirt.

357
00:28:17,622 --> 00:28:19,546
You have a red pepper flake
stuck in your teeth.

358
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:21,005
What?

359
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:22,667
Really?

360
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:30,631
What red pepper?

361
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:33,494
I have to change!

362
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:36,635
- You can change over there!
- Silhouette!

363
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:40,560
There is nothing to see.
You're a stick! What silhouette?

364
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,086
Get out. Get out! You're being
an asshole! Get out! Get out!

365
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:45,405
For someone who's single,
you're doing a lot of touching.

366
00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:47,022
I'm taken!

367
00:28:47,022 --> 00:28:48,752
I'll leave on my own!

368
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,906
What an asshole!

369
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:01,730
It's not working out well?

370
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,747
You are really torturing yourself.

371
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:08,948
The competition ends this month.

372
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:12,616
This is not something
humans should be doing.

373
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:15,113
Because I'm trying to force
myself to come up with things...

374
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:16,958
And you deliver packages during the day.

375
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,826
What if you faint?

376
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:23,512
I don't even have time.
I'm going to go crazy!

377
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:27,405
Stop hitting yourself!

378
00:29:27,405 --> 00:29:31,205
I still can't come up with anything
even after hitting my head.

379
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:33,630
Your hard work is going to make me cry.

380
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,965
<i>Hae Dang, are you home?</i>

381
00:29:40,965 --> 00:29:44,538
Yes. I just came home. Go to sleep.

382
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:46,753
<i>Okay. Wash up and go to sleep!</i>

383
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:48,480
Okay.

384
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,185
Oh my gosh! You scared me!
What are you doing up?

385
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:01,282
What? Preparing for my lesson.

386
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:05,839
You got a nose bleed?
What's wrong with your hair?

387
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:08,815
Don't talk to me.

388
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:11,646
Why are you preparing your lessons
like you're about to go war?

389
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:13,696
It's not like you've only
done this a few times.

390
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:17,175
I heard Yoo Ji Na went to the cafe.

391
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:18,669
Did Hae Soo tell you?

392
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:21,594
Last year, when that man
got into an accident

393
00:30:21,594 --> 00:30:24,743
a woman picked up the phone.

394
00:30:24,743 --> 00:30:27,920
- And?
- Who was she?

395
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,844
Why are you talking about the past?

396
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:32,275
Isn't that when you stopped
talking to Yoo Ji Na?

397
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:35,434
Stop talking nonsense and go to sleep.

398
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:41,127
Am I just imagining all kinds of things
because I'm trying to write a drama?

399
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:43,588
You're writing what?

400
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:49,020
I mean... I must be sleepwalking
since I haven't slept.

401
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:23,675
You're going to wear it out.

402
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:27,616
Do you think it's fake?

403
00:31:27,616 --> 00:31:29,608
Don't be ridiculous!

404
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:32,688
I'm just so happy!

405
00:31:32,688 --> 00:31:35,288
Turn off the lights. It's so bright.

406
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:40,242
Oh my goodness!

407
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:59,586
What are you doing?

408
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:03,840
Ironing my pants so I can wear them.

409
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,409
Keep working diligently.

410
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:10,821
My head's been hurting this morning.

411
00:32:10,821 --> 00:32:13,624
- Your head hurts?
- Look at my hand. My hand.

412
00:32:13,624 --> 00:32:16,057
Hand? Why does your hand hurt?

413
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:18,438
You don't see the ring?

414
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:21,732
Oh... the ring.

415
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,361
Where did you get the ring?

416
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:28,102
My son secretly bought
the ring without telling Hae Jin.

417
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:29,824
Without telling Hae Jin?

418
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:33,759
I'm scared of her, so I wear it
when she's not home.

419
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,338
For someone who's scared of her,
you call all your relatives to come over?

420
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:40,284
Would I have done it if
things weren't that bad?

421
00:32:40,284 --> 00:32:42,826
Be reasonable and let it go.

422
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:45,435
Her face got thinner.

423
00:32:45,435 --> 00:32:47,982
If she were an object, I could
take her to a repair shop

424
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:49,128
but I can't kick her out

425
00:32:49,128 --> 00:32:51,575
and send her back to her family
now that she lives with us.

426
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:54,805
I'm also having a hard time trying
to teach her since we live together.

427
00:32:54,805 --> 00:33:00,607
Oh, really? Then please
go ahead and kick her out!

428
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:04,849
I will give her back once
Hoon's dad's situation gets better.

429
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,737
What's wrong with my son's situation?

430
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,971
They say if you have even
three bags of unhulled barley

431
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:12,324
you shouldn't be living off your in-laws!

432
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,606
Are you saying whatever you want now?

433
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:18,478
You're the one who kept talking
about kicking out my daughter.

434
00:33:18,478 --> 00:33:21,204
You shouldn't say that even
if you don't mean it!

435
00:33:21,204 --> 00:33:23,897
At this rate, we might not
get along anymore either!

436
00:33:23,897 --> 00:33:29,205
I don't plan to get along with someone
who bothers my daughter anyway!

437
00:33:29,205 --> 00:33:31,117
Not at all!

438
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:34,794
Wow!

439
00:33:34,794 --> 00:33:37,826
Did you think I would be scared if you
ran off and shut the door like that?

440
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:42,673
He's taking her side
because she's his daughter.

441
00:33:42,673 --> 00:33:45,053
He usually listens to anything I say.

442
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:46,884
Did I go too far?

443
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:52,163
I don't know! Whatever!

444
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:57,888
All I need is my ring!

445
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:05,040
Hello, Uncle! What?

446
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,895
Did you ask if something good happened?

447
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:09,811
No, not really.

448
00:34:11,992 --> 00:34:14,623
What do you mean?

449
00:34:14,623 --> 00:34:16,329
Bong Soo said what?

450
00:34:18,172 --> 00:34:22,960
I called Eldest Aunt and
explained our situation.

451
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,483
- Who told you to do that?
- It wasn't realistic.

452
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:28,280
What wasn't realistic?

453
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,925
She absolutely hates having people over.
She might actually lose her mind.

454
00:34:33,925 --> 00:34:36,719
Did you tell them that we
argued about our living expenses?

455
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:42,280
I thought they would understand better
if they knew the whole situation, so I...

456
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:47,246
If you were going to cancel it,
you should've let me do it!

457
00:34:47,246 --> 00:34:49,237
Why would you do that and humiliate me?

458
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:53,195
- Who cares? It's Eldest Aunt.
- Stop it!

459
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:57,083
Don't you know that I had to beg for
money from them after your father died?

460
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,543
Why wouldn't I know that?

461
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:01,505
What are they going to think of me

462
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:03,744
when they hear that I'm asking
for 50,000 won from my daughter-in-law!

463
00:35:03,744 --> 00:35:05,519
You're close with the aunts.

464
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:07,726
No matter how close we are,
they're still my sisters-in-law!

465
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:10,702
Even if your sister and wife are close,
how close do you think they really are?

466
00:35:10,702 --> 00:35:13,844
Do you know how many times
my pride was hurt in front of them?

467
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:17,300
She hasn't been sleeping
the last couple of days.

468
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,623
You care that your wife
hasn't been sleeping

469
00:35:19,623 --> 00:35:22,492
but you don't give a shit that
your mother's pride has been hurt!

470
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:30,331
I knew it!

471
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:33,123
It was too good to be true
to get a ring like this.

472
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:34,695
Mom!

473
00:35:34,695 --> 00:35:36,784
I didn't know that this
ring was meant for that

474
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:40,574
and here I was so excited to wear it
to the party that I couldn't even sleep!

475
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,797
Wait, Mom! Mom! Mom!

476
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:46,175
Mom!

477
00:35:46,175 --> 00:35:49,726
- Wait, Mom!
- Hae Jin! Come out!

478
00:35:49,726 --> 00:35:52,416
- Mom, please calm down.
- Mom.

479
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:59,427
You! Wear this ring!

480
00:35:59,427 --> 00:36:02,344
He bought this ring for me
to go easy on you

481
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:04,891
because he was worried that you
weren't getting enough sleep!

482
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:08,387
I'm sorry, but I'm never
going to forgive you!

483
00:36:08,387 --> 00:36:11,751
So, you can wear this!

484
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:13,706
Mom, Mom! Mom!

485
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:16,746
Mom! What are you doing?

486
00:36:16,746 --> 00:36:19,603
- Mom!
- Move!

487
00:36:19,603 --> 00:36:22,329
Why are you being so childish?

488
00:36:28,822 --> 00:36:32,181
I'm so sad!

489
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:35,949
My situation is so pitiful!

490
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:42,273
Mom...

491
00:36:44,965 --> 00:36:46,965
Get out. Get out!

492
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,820
Are you just getting home now?

493
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,525
I told you to just go to sleep.
What's the point of waiting for me?

494
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,668
I'm about to go to sleep.
It was hard, right?

495
00:37:10,668 --> 00:37:12,813
No. Good night.

496
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,032
All right. Good night.

497
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:20,027
<i>[Kyung Soo]</i>

498
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:24,621
It's me. You're not asleep yet?

499
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,775
I just got in.

500
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:30,387
I was listening to music
because I couldn't fall asleep.

501
00:37:30,387 --> 00:37:32,909
I figured you'd be done
with work and at home by now

502
00:37:32,909 --> 00:37:37,376
so I called to hear your voice
before going to sleep.

503
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:39,768
Sorry.

504
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:43,760
Why are you sorry?
I was going to call you too.

505
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,146
I was hesitating because
I thought you were already asleep.

506
00:37:47,503 --> 00:37:49,844
I'm good now that I heard your voice.

507
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:52,387
Hurry up and go to sleep.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

508
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:55,231
Good night. See you at the cafe.

509
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:57,893
<i>[Kyung Soo]</i>

510
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:01,952
Is it the cafe owner?

511
00:38:01,952 --> 00:38:06,213
<i>You two are close enough to
talk to each other at this hour?</i>

512
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:10,925
- I heard he's handicapped.
- Y... Yes.

513
00:38:10,925 --> 00:38:13,485
You had to say goodbye to your
last boyfriend due to an accident

514
00:38:13,485 --> 00:38:17,603
you should meet someone
normal and live without any regrets.

515
00:38:18,724 --> 00:38:21,954
- Yes.
- Whenever I think about you

516
00:38:21,954 --> 00:38:25,302
I can't really fall asleep.

517
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:30,512
You and the cafe owner
aren't anything... Right?

518
00:38:30,512 --> 00:38:37,012
Of course not. He has a hard life,
so I wanted to help him in some way.

519
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:50,784
All right. Go to sleep.

520
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,291
Why are you here?
What about your job at the cafe?

521
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,474
I got fired.

522
00:40:06,474 --> 00:40:08,550
Fired? Why?

523
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,856
I got fired, but...

524
00:40:10,856 --> 00:40:14,081
he gave me six months of severance.

525
00:40:40,911 --> 00:40:43,213
There is no worker today,
so we are closed.

526
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:46,273
It's me.

527
00:40:48,835 --> 00:40:51,257
Did Hae Soo do something wrong?

528
00:40:56,322 --> 00:40:59,114
No.

529
00:40:59,114 --> 00:41:04,043
I'm looking for someone who
can work full time in the cafe.

530
00:41:04,043 --> 00:41:07,157
It has more to do with me
being uncomfortable.

531
00:41:07,157 --> 00:41:11,452
Since Hae Soo quit, you won't
have any reason to come here either.

532
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:15,371
Is it because of me?

533
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:17,597
Because you might have to wait?

534
00:41:17,597 --> 00:41:20,463
Because I might not come
even after you waited?

535
00:41:20,463 --> 00:41:23,032
I found something

536
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:25,409
that's harder than waiting for someone.

537
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:31,661
You're always thinking about
what you can do for me

538
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:36,599
but there is nothing
I can do for you in return.

539
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,735
What do you mean
there is nothing you can do?

540
00:41:39,735 --> 00:41:43,454
As long as you don't disappear on me...

541
00:41:43,454 --> 00:41:45,887
To this day

542
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:50,295
I've never really felt like a man.

543
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,851
Even though I'm a man...

544
00:41:53,851 --> 00:41:58,329
the fact that I can't do anything
for the person I care deeply about...

545
00:41:59,635 --> 00:42:01,809
is a lot more painful
than I thought it would be.

546
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:06,416
I just want you to meet a normal person

547
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:08,873
and live a happy life.

548
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:11,152
- Really.
- Kyung Soo.

549
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:14,521
Please let me be able to pray
for you and watch you from afar.

550
00:42:16,072 --> 00:42:17,856
So please...

551
00:42:19,418 --> 00:42:21,483
Just pretend you didn't see me.

552
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:26,349
Please do this one last favor

553
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:28,679
for me.

554
00:42:31,273 --> 00:42:33,121
Kyung Soo...

555
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:37,358
Please, I'm begging you.

556
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:30,679
You're here?

557
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:32,829
Just wash up and study.

558
00:44:37,364 --> 00:44:40,420
<i>If you'd like to check
your balance, please press one.</i>

559
00:44:43,572 --> 00:44:45,661
Mother's preparing dinner.

560
00:44:45,661 --> 00:44:49,094
- Oh, really?
- I knew she'd come around.

561
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:55,371
- Who are you calling?
- Today's pay day.

562
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:58,436
I'm sure the money was deposited
without a problem.

563
00:44:58,436 --> 00:45:00,925
I have to check to see
if the amount is correct.

564
00:45:03,295 --> 00:45:04,954
It's not all there.

565
00:45:07,056 --> 00:45:09,766
Why are we missing 1.5 million won?

566
00:45:09,766 --> 00:45:12,847
I gave it to my mom.

567
00:45:12,847 --> 00:45:15,273
- Why?
- What do you mean why?

568
00:45:15,273 --> 00:45:18,023
- For allowance.
- What?

569
00:45:18,023 --> 00:45:19,619
We give her money anyway

570
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:22,253
so I made it easier for you
and gave it to her all at once.

571
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,860
It's your salary, so you think
you can do whatever you want!

572
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,697
Please forgive me this one time.

573
00:45:26,697 --> 00:45:30,541
She was crying.
How could I just ignore her?

574
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:35,159
Without consulting me at all... Who said
you could just take out the money?

575
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:38,878
Hit me. Just hit me!

576
00:45:38,878 --> 00:45:41,398
It's better that you just beat me up!

577
00:45:41,398 --> 00:45:44,641
Hit me! Go ahead! Hit me! Hit me!

578
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:55,050
Did you unpack everything?

579
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,416
I just brought what I needed,
so there wasn't much unpacking to do.

580
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:00,391
What did you do with
the rest of your stuff?

581
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,715
I have a place to store it.

582
00:46:02,715 --> 00:46:06,735
If you need anything,
please don't hesitate to ask.

583
00:46:06,735 --> 00:46:08,900
Okay. Thanks.

584
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,434
I'll escort you when it's dinner time,
so please get some rest.

585
00:46:21,273 --> 00:46:24,626
It feels like she's the court lady
serving her queen.

586
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:34,387
You know that today's the day
Yoo Ji Na moves into the house, right?

587
00:46:34,387 --> 00:46:38,420
Make sure you're not late for dinner.

588
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,429
Why aren't you saying anything?

589
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:42,356
At some point...

590
00:46:43,702 --> 00:46:46,338
I feel like we started to be
not compatible with each other.

591
00:46:46,338 --> 00:46:48,251
What do you mean?

592
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:50,503
You and me.

593
00:46:50,503 --> 00:46:55,474
Go home, even if
I have to give in to my father?

594
00:46:55,474 --> 00:46:58,719
How can you tell me to give in...

595
00:46:59,822 --> 00:47:03,322
when you know how much I hate my father?

596
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:06,001
Think about my position too.

597
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:09,360
- Do you even love me?
- How can you say that?

598
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,757
Would I have waited all
this time if I didn't love you?

599
00:47:11,757 --> 00:47:15,282
- What were you waiting for?
- What?

600
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:18,570
Are you waiting for me to become
CEO of GR Group by any chance?

601
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:19,809
Hyun Joon.

602
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:25,454
I feel like we are becoming
more and more distant.

603
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:33,092
If you don't go into the company,
then they won't approve us.

604
00:47:33,092 --> 00:47:36,164
I'm doing this because
I want us to get married.

605
00:47:38,172 --> 00:47:41,418
I'm talking about the problem between us.

606
00:47:41,418 --> 00:47:43,650
Why do you keep bringing
my family members into it?

607
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:47,822
Are you trying to say I'm using
your family as an excuse?

608
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:52,773
Fine.

609
00:47:52,773 --> 00:47:56,876
If your family doesn't approve us and
I tell you we should still get married

610
00:47:56,876 --> 00:47:59,061
will you marry me tomorrow?

611
00:48:00,322 --> 00:48:02,762
Why can't you answer?

612
00:48:02,762 --> 00:48:05,440
Why can't you answer me?

613
00:48:06,954 --> 00:48:08,659
You and I...

614
00:48:11,277 --> 00:48:14,460
Don't you think it's already
become difficult for us?

615
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,612
Do you think we're trying
to make something work...

616
00:48:18,351 --> 00:48:20,436
that's already falling apart?

617
00:48:20,436 --> 00:48:25,362
Even if it's hard, we're at the point
where we have to push through it.

618
00:48:26,672 --> 00:48:29,224
So save your breath.

619
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:38,157
Please come in.

620
00:48:40,572 --> 00:48:42,373
Welcome.

621
00:48:44,273 --> 00:48:46,672
I will let you know when
everything is ready.

622
00:48:54,773 --> 00:48:57,139
Do you want see my room?

623
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:58,829
No need to do that.

624
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:01,760
You have to at least see my room.

625
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:14,804
What if your family starts
to have weird thoughts about this?

626
00:49:14,804 --> 00:49:19,554
It does feel strange to think
that Yoo Ji Na is in my room.

627
00:49:19,554 --> 00:49:22,643
I'm also having a hard time
wrapping my head around the fact

628
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:25,023
that I am in
Chairman Park Sung Hwan's room.

629
00:49:25,023 --> 00:49:26,878
I did decide to move in because...

630
00:49:26,878 --> 00:49:30,840
Regardless of how it happened, I'm happy.

631
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,090
What if a family member comes in?

632
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:36,367
Nobody can come in
unless they knock first.

633
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:41,577
I saw everything, so let's go out.

634
00:49:43,672 --> 00:49:45,400
What are you doing?

635
00:49:47,023 --> 00:49:48,556
Nothing.

636
00:49:48,556 --> 00:49:51,514
I just wanted to see your face.

637
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:59,186
You look really pretty today.

638
00:49:59,186 --> 00:50:01,675
Okay. Let's go out.

639
00:50:01,675 --> 00:50:05,282
I'm just looking at your face.
Why are you so embarrassed?

640
00:50:05,282 --> 00:50:09,268
It's weird for the two of us
to be in a closed room.

641
00:50:09,268 --> 00:50:10,916
How is it weird?

642
00:50:10,916 --> 00:50:13,666
Do you really feel weird about it?

643
00:50:15,204 --> 00:50:19,148
All of my hair is standing on end
because I feel so uneasy.

644
00:50:19,148 --> 00:50:21,827
Okay? So let's go out.

645
00:50:32,773 --> 00:50:36,387
You always have a way to ruin the moment.

646
00:50:39,172 --> 00:50:43,739
Even though you're living
in the other house

647
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:45,755
my heart feels full
knowing that you're here.

648
00:50:58,172 --> 00:50:59,867
Let's eat.

649
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:18,686
How does it taste?

650
00:51:18,686 --> 00:51:21,695
It's better than most restaurants.

651
00:51:21,695 --> 00:51:24,949
I'm sorry for the late introduction.
My name is Park Hyun Sung.

652
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:28,099
This is my second son.

653
00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:31,545
- Nice to meet you.
- Where is your brother?

654
00:51:31,545 --> 00:51:34,664
I told him to come home early,
but he's running a little late.

655
00:51:35,452 --> 00:51:39,101
Thanks to your contribution,
our sales went up a lot.

656
00:51:39,101 --> 00:51:40,994
Really? That's good to hear.

657
00:51:40,994 --> 00:51:43,469
Why are you talking
so much during a meal?

658
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:46,179
It's distracting. Eat quietly.

659
00:51:47,452 --> 00:51:49,599
If there is anything you need

660
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,197
please let her know, and if anything
happens that was discourteous

661
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:54,744
please be understanding.

662
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,507
Discourteous? I'm worried
because it's excessive.

663
00:51:57,507 --> 00:52:01,099
She was so courteous that I felt
like I was filming a historical drama.

664
00:52:10,572 --> 00:52:15,405
Now it feels like a home!
We can laugh at the dinner table.

665
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:21,409
Try this one. Here. This is good.

666
00:52:21,409 --> 00:52:23,050
It's okay. I can get my own food.

667
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,369
It looks like you've just
been eating the same thing.

668
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:27,686
You have to eat a variety of things.

669
00:52:28,773 --> 00:52:32,083
You two look like newlyweds.

670
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:34,246
Hyun Joon.

671
00:52:34,246 --> 00:52:37,090
This is nice. Very friendly.

672
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:41,293
If you're here, introduce yourself.
Why are you just standing there?

673
00:52:41,293 --> 00:52:43,429
This is my eldest son.

674
00:52:45,773 --> 00:52:47,251
Nice to meet you.

675
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:49,804
It was so difficult to meet you before

676
00:52:49,804 --> 00:52:53,195
but now here we are,
meeting in our kitchen.

677
00:52:53,195 --> 00:52:54,838
Have a seat.

678
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,737
I thought you were something great

679
00:52:57,737 --> 00:52:59,898
because everyone kept saying,
"Yoo Ji Na, Yoo Ji Na."

680
00:53:10,273 --> 00:53:12,175
Wait.

681
00:53:13,172 --> 00:53:14,871
Stop right there.

682
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:19,295
What kind of attitude is that
in front of a new guest?

683
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:22,559
I'm doing what I was taught.

684
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,630
- Why? Are you embarrassed?
- Apologize to her right now.

685
00:53:26,657 --> 00:53:28,657
Apologize to her right now!

686
00:53:41,273 --> 00:53:43,972
You think I have nothing better
to do than apologize to that woman?

687
00:53:43,972 --> 00:53:45,809
That woman?

688
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:47,996
How dare you talk that way?

689
00:53:47,996 --> 00:53:51,525
Think about Mother!

690
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:55,010
As a husband... As a man...

691
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:59,168
you could not be dirtier, more cowardly,
and more like a piece of trash than this!

692
00:53:59,168 --> 00:54:01,543
What? Trash?

693
00:54:01,543 --> 00:54:04,157
Just because you have
the power and the money right now

694
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,967
you think everything is solved.
To bring that woman to our house

695
00:54:06,967 --> 00:54:09,559
sit her at the dinner table,
and laugh together...

696
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:12,646
What? You'd better watch what you say.

697
00:54:12,646 --> 00:54:15,132
I love her.

698
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:17,206
Your father loves her!

699
00:54:17,206 --> 00:54:22,550
That kind of cheap love is
an insult to that woman as well!

700
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,505
- What did you say?
- Please stop.

701
00:54:24,505 --> 00:54:28,351
I will leave tomorrow.
I'm sorry I offended you.

702
00:54:29,572 --> 00:54:31,666
You're the same.

703
00:54:33,108 --> 00:54:36,429
How dare you come into this house?

704
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:38,494
If you want to become
the chairman's woman

705
00:54:38,494 --> 00:54:42,275
you should at least know your place.

706
00:54:42,275 --> 00:54:44,657
It's like you're some
kind of cheap woman...

707
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:49,079
How dare you come in here and
fill this house with your cheap laughter?

708
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,668
Can you please

709
00:55:01,668 --> 00:55:04,342
shut your mouth?

710
00:55:20,023 --> 00:55:23,922
You saw something
you shouldn't have seen.

711
00:55:23,922 --> 00:55:26,309
I don't know what to say.

712
00:55:38,822 --> 00:55:40,782
This is me.

713
00:55:40,782 --> 00:55:44,902
This is the human Park Sung Hwan.

714
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:52,570
My mother always put herself

715
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:54,943
above her children.

716
00:55:56,963 --> 00:56:01,840
My son's goal in life
is to humiliate his father.

717
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,994
Plus, my wife, who left this world first

718
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:10,579
stigmatized me for
the whole world to see.

719
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:14,083
It is different from
what I saw from the outside.

720
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,494
I'm beginning to understand now.

721
00:56:19,494 --> 00:56:24,327
Why you spent so much time
searching for something outside.

722
00:56:26,172 --> 00:56:28,757
Is that why you said you were lonely?

723
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:34,492
Does a sinful man have
the right to feel lonely?

724
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:38,641
If a sinful man says he's lonely,
isn't that still loneliness?

725
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,981
A sinful man also gets
hungry when he's hungry

726
00:56:43,981 --> 00:56:46,284
and cries

727
00:56:46,284 --> 00:56:48,284
when he wants to cry.

728
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:52,603
I understand, so let's go inside.

729
00:56:52,603 --> 00:56:55,664
The air is still cold at night.

730
00:56:56,713 --> 00:57:01,072
I thought everything would be fine
if we lived under the same roof.

731
00:57:01,072 --> 00:57:05,402
I didn't ever think something
so mortifying would happen.

732
00:57:07,512 --> 00:57:10,739
I feel like you can see right through me.

733
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:16,411
I'm not a woman who gets
attached to people

734
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:20,539
to get involved in their lives
and judge them.

735
00:57:20,539 --> 00:57:22,672
I'm going.

736
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:29,672
When do you think you will start
to become curious about my life?

737
00:57:31,425 --> 00:57:35,425
I already know everything. I never
had time to become curious about it.

738
00:57:35,425 --> 00:57:39,114
We didn't even say
good night to each other.

739
00:57:39,114 --> 00:57:41,280
Really?

740
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,157
Good night.

741
00:57:44,422 --> 00:57:48,309
I'm always the fool in this.

742
00:57:50,472 --> 00:57:56,358
By the way, why do you think your
eldest son wanted to see me?

743
00:57:56,358 --> 00:57:58,929
- What?
- That's what he said earlier.

744
00:57:58,929 --> 00:58:01,157
He said it was so difficult
to meet me before

745
00:58:01,157 --> 00:58:03,103
but we finally ended up
meeting in the kitchen.

746
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:05,791
Have you been thinking
about that this whole time?

747
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,920
No.

748
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,603
I was just curious all of a sudden.

749
00:58:11,603 --> 00:58:13,400
Why are you curious about that?

750
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,876
I'm not sure...

751
00:58:15,876 --> 00:58:18,635
What kind of work does
he do at the company?

752
00:58:18,635 --> 00:58:20,630
He doesn't work at the company.

753
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,686
He's wandering around uselessly
talking about some entertainment business

754
00:58:23,686 --> 00:58:27,099
as always.

755
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:30,170
An entertainment company?

756
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:33,197
What's the name of the company?

757
00:58:33,197 --> 00:58:38,231
How would I know? I have no interest.

758
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:40,577
Really?

759
00:58:40,577 --> 00:58:44,061
I didn't hear any rumors
about Chairman Park's son

760
00:58:44,061 --> 00:58:46,335
starting an entertainment business.

761
00:58:46,335 --> 00:58:49,474
Of course he's hiding it.

762
00:58:49,474 --> 00:58:53,431
He thinks being my son is a living hell.

763
00:58:53,431 --> 00:58:55,731
An entertainment company...

764
00:59:16,438 --> 00:59:19,407
- Check, please!
- Good bye.

765
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:27,547
<i>Even though I'm a man...</i>

766
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:32,449
<i>the fact that I can't do anything
for the person I care deeply about</i>

767
00:59:32,449 --> 00:59:35,527
<i>is a lot more painful
than I thought it would be.</i>

768
00:59:35,527 --> 00:59:39,657
<i>Please let me be able to pray
for you and watch you from afar.</i>

769
00:59:53,675 --> 00:59:57,231
Miss, you're a lady.
Why are you drinking so much?

770
00:59:57,231 --> 01:00:00,284
We're closed.
Please get ready to leave.

771
01:00:33,117 --> 01:00:35,003
Hello?

772
01:00:40,922 --> 01:00:42,684
Hello?

773
01:00:52,121 --> 01:00:56,054
You shouldn't call me anymore either.

774
01:00:58,141 --> 01:00:59,842
I'm sorry.

775
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,012
I'm going to hang up.

776
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:12,876
Don't hang up! Hello!

777
01:01:12,876 --> 01:01:15,081
She's so drunk and she just passed out.

778
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:17,027
<i>I have to close now.
What am I supposed to do?</i>

779
01:01:17,027 --> 01:01:18,664
<i>Pick her up right now.</i>

780
01:01:18,664 --> 01:01:20,619
Where are you?

781
01:01:20,619 --> 01:01:23,335
I'm sorry, but I can't get there.

782
01:01:23,335 --> 01:01:26,871
<i>I'm just going to leave her outside
and close the door. You take care of her!</i>

783
01:01:26,871 --> 01:01:28,619
I...

784
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:09,666
Hae Soo, it's me.

785
01:02:14,168 --> 01:02:16,407
No.

786
01:02:16,407 --> 01:02:18,755
I'm sorry to call you at night.

787
01:02:18,755 --> 01:02:20,621
Okay. Bye.

788
01:02:29,373 --> 01:02:33,271
Taxi!
Taxi!

789
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,532
Is anyone there?

790
01:02:38,112 --> 01:02:39,938
Taxi.

791
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:41,572
Taxi!

792
01:02:42,556 --> 01:02:44,657
Is anyone there?

793
01:02:48,626 --> 01:02:51,445
Is anyone there?

794
01:02:51,445 --> 01:02:54,697
Please help me!

795
01:02:54,697 --> 01:02:56,795
Taxi!

796
01:02:56,795 --> 01:02:58,795
Is no one there?
