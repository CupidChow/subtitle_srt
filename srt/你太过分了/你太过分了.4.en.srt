<i>[Episode 4]</i>

<i>[One year later]</i>

4
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:18,118
<i>Saying goodbye to someone who died...</i>

5
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:22,713
<i>means you will never be able to see
that person again.</i>

6
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:29,077
<i>You will never hear that person's
voice again.</i>

7
00:00:34,344 --> 00:00:37,837
<i>Still, you must live out
the daily routine of your life.</i>

8
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:41,466
<i>It takes us to another place.</i>

9
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:46,576
<i>Every now and then,
the sadness slips out.</i>

10
00:00:47,384 --> 00:00:49,402
<i>As time repeats itself...</i>

11
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:53,768
<i>it quietly settles into our daily life.</i>

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,317
Hae Soo.

13
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:56,926
What took you so long?

14
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,280
You should eat some.

15
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:01,536
You should eat some when there
aren't any customers.

16
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:03,945
I'm late. I'm late.

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,570
I'll be back, sir.

18
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,751
Come back as soon as
you're done at the academy.

19
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:14,227
You got in trouble last time
for being late.

20
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:33,299
They're dumplings.

21
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:39,156
I think I get more free food than
Hae Soo gets paid for her work.

22
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:41,668
There's no part-time job
like this these days.

23
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:45,305
You let her go to classes at her
academy and go on interviews.

24
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,557
What's wrong with going on
interviews twice a month?

25
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:52,825
I hand out resumes here and there
for people to look at.

26
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:54,844
I never hear back from anyone.

27
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:11,877
Are you looking somewhere right now?

28
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:15,798
Ah... I'm looking out the window.

29
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:18,689
It looks like spring is coming.

30
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:25,072
That's 68,000 won.

31
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:27,455
Here you go.

32
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:28,990
Thank you.

33
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:31,086
Thank you!

34
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:33,516
- Hello.
- Oh, hey.

35
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:36,615
Eat this before it gets cold.

36
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:42,079
We're trying to eat up all the kimchi.

37
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:44,626
It's dumplings every two days.

38
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:47,050
You're going to see a dumpling ghost
in your dreams, right?

39
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,943
Seeing that we're trying to
eat up old kimchi

40
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:52,943
I guess it is spring, after all.

41
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,961
Oh my.

42
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,375
Welcome!

43
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:01,098
Fill it up with gasoline.

44
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,050
Filling up with gasoline.

45
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:08,694
Good, right?

46
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:15,080
Oh, wait. Hold on.

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,917
I'm sorry. Please, wait. Sorry.

48
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:25,717
Sorry. Please hold the door.

49
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:28,383
Sorry. I'm sorry.

50
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:34,731
This is Kim Young Jae's home, right?

51
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,544
I'm leaving a package in front of
your door.

52
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:38,984
Oh, wait!

53
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:50,200
Yes, Dad.

54
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:53,305
I'm at school. I still have classes.

55
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:55,941
Yes.

56
00:03:56,644 --> 00:04:01,352
Culture and literature reflect the
changes in current society.

57
00:04:01,352 --> 00:04:06,002
Korean society is affected by
internal and external factors.

58
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,764
These caused many of
the modern changes.

59
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:11,093
The specific reasons and process
of the changes to society

60
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:13,841
as well as the modes for these changes.

61
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:19,057
By looking at how those
who struggle with conflicts

62
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:24,242
and how society deals with them,
we get to gain secondhand experience.

63
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:30,178
How did you learn to play the piano?

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,769
I learned thanks to my guardian.

65
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,048
My guardian wanted me to have
something to do to amuse myself.

66
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:38,940
I suppose that's why
I was given this chance.

67
00:04:48,512 --> 00:04:50,730
Do you buy everything you need yourself?

68
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,680
If I write it down, a worker from
a charity buys everything.

69
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,899
It seems like you're
always at this cafe.

70
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:09,389
Don't you find it frustrating?

71
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:23,310
It's coffee. It's hot.

72
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:24,560
Be careful.

73
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:38,310
I do go to see a music performance
when I feel that way.

74
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:43,262
Students who major in music
volunteer to help.

75
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,651
I see you have people who help you
with everything you need.

76
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:50,052
Then you should do things with me
that you don't need to do.

77
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,113
Think of me like an older sister.

78
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:57,961
Think of something
you want to buy or eat.

79
00:05:57,961 --> 00:05:59,355
You can just tell me.

80
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:06,206
Am I asking too many questions?

81
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,435
Am I making you uncomfortable?

82
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,115
No, I prefer it that way.

83
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:15,786
When people are too careful,
I feel different.

84
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:21,512
Things I want to eat or buy...

85
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:24,795
I'm honestly not used to asking for that.

86
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:28,716
I eat what I can and live life
doing what I can.

87
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:31,067
I only think about what I need.

88
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:34,232
Still, there must be a place
you want to go.

89
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:37,836
I lost my sight at six
and was left in an orphanage.

90
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:39,677
I've never really been to many places.

91
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,726
To tell you the truth

92
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:46,398
I just try not to be a burden
on the world as I live.

93
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:48,396
That's what I think.

94
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:55,084
<i>I'm not particularly good at anything.</i>

95
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:57,540
<i>I need to make a living.</i>

96
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:00,608
I'm a burden to people here and there.

97
00:07:00,632 --> 00:07:04,396
If I don't have a happy face,
it would very shameless of me.

98
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:08,449
You're a young lady and you keep
talking about being a burden.

99
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:09,937
It's not nice to hear.

100
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,487
Who is a burden on anyone's life?

101
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:18,466
Everyone just accepts their life
and works hard.

102
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,721
Who is a burden on anyone's life?

103
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:29,127
Everyone just accepts their life
and works hard.

104
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:34,555
Can I ask you one thing?

105
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:37,043
Of course.

106
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:38,677
It could be a little impolite.

107
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:41,682
You can be very impolite.

108
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:44,293
We should be very impolite
to each other.

109
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:47,622
That day you first came here...

110
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:51,872
why were you crying so much?

111
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:58,221
I wanted to ask you once.

112
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,350
You remember that?

113
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:04,221
I remember the sound of you crying.

114
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:14,120
How is it?

115
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,759
It's good. Let's go.

116
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,512
We'll start shooting. Okay.

117
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:19,399
Look here. One, two.

118
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,466
Great. One, two.

119
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,757
That's great. One, two.

120
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:25,247
Very good. Of course.

121
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:27,177
One, two. Very good.

122
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:28,896
One, two. Looks great.

123
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:31,220
One, two. So good.

124
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,376
One, two. Great!

125
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:35,625
Pose again. One, two.

126
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,191
Okay. Let's change and go again.

127
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:56,413
Tell him I have something scheduled.

128
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:58,312
I already told him you don't.

129
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:01,464
He's the client for the ad.

130
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:03,662
The client for the ad
is more important than anyone.

131
00:09:11,644 --> 00:09:15,985
Thank you so much for signing me
as your model, Chairman.

132
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:18,364
That sounds so formal.

133
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:21,664
It's been a year since I've seen you
and that's all you have to say?

134
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,144
Oh, yes.

135
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:34,254
Are things going well with that man?

136
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:38,111
When I was down and in need,
he left.

137
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,732
I didn't give it a chance
and things ended.

138
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:43,417
Too bad. How unfortunate.

139
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:48,222
You must take care of things mercilessly,
so you don't make the same mistake twice.

140
00:09:49,643 --> 00:09:53,682
Did he leave quietly...
I mean cleanly?

141
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:56,562
I was harsh, so don't worry.

142
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,722
Just as you wished.

143
00:09:58,192 --> 00:09:59,572
I'm curious.

144
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:04,763
I don't know why I'm so curious
when it comes to you, Ji Na.

145
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:07,535
I usually don't care much
about the lives of others.

146
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:10,572
Are you going to continue being curious?

147
00:10:10,572 --> 00:10:11,816
Does it make you uncomfortable?

148
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:19,864
He died.

149
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,234
The steak is good.

150
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:33,023
Why? He was a young man.
What happened?

151
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:34,924
You should just eat.

152
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:36,214
We should talk.

153
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:38,306
I really am curious.

154
00:10:39,594 --> 00:10:40,730
Why at that age?

155
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:44,832
He died because of me.

156
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,597
You weren't a young child.

157
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:58,841
I hadn't heard
an adult woman sobbing before.

158
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,331
That's when I first wondered.

159
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:07,597
Why is that woman crying so sadly?

160
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:11,028
What is making her so sad?

161
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:14,226
Who is she crying over?

162
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:44,917
Things will get better over time.

163
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:48,004
It looks like things are
still difficult for you.

164
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:50,455
I have no right to be okay.

165
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:54,693
I need to shut up and accept it.

166
00:11:55,653 --> 00:11:58,095
You don't need to try
so hard in front of me.

167
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:03,899
In order to get through this,
you need to be able to talk about it.

168
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,174
Whether it's anger at yourself
or whatever it may be.

169
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:15,346
I really feel like I could brace myself
against a wall and talk about it.

170
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,655
What kind of life is this?

171
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:27,625
I hurt every person that I meet.

172
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:31,138
I'm scared.

173
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:34,347
I can't even open my mouth
too carelessly.

174
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:39,582
If that's what it is,
I'm pretty helpful.

175
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:42,625
I will never get hurt.

176
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:47,192
No matter what anyone does...

177
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:52,673
my personality handicap
is that I never get hurt.

178
00:12:58,464 --> 00:12:59,488
Here.

179
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,070
What kind of person
was your late wife?

180
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,208
I see you're going after my target.

181
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,921
She was a very clean person.

182
00:13:23,698 --> 00:13:27,980
She was an innocent soul.

183
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,899
She was like a clear mirror.

184
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:34,509
When I was with her...

185
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:40,058
I realized what a dirty person I was.

186
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,009
To put it simply,
I felt like I was being punished.

187
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:49,309
So, it was hard being punished.

188
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:55,033
You found dirty souls
in all the other women?

189
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,889
You are very amusing.

190
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:02,043
You are a mere employee.

191
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:05,629
You caused trouble for the only daughter
of a rich private company.

192
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:09,620
Even if you were punished,
isn't it natural you should be punished?

193
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:12,341
It wasn't that I didn't know
I should be punished.

194
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:15,942
It was because I was lonely.

195
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,851
Sometime later...

196
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:25,211
she didn't believe I loved her
no matter what I did.

197
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:29,371
She didn't and neither did the world.

198
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:34,993
My sincerity could not
be conveyed to her.

199
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:36,941
Nothing makes one more weary.

200
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,529
Nothing makes one more lonely.

201
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:47,322
Are you curious to know why
your sincerity couldn't be conveyed?

202
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,491
It's because your soul
has sinned too much.

203
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:56,350
I admit that.

204
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,240
I know a bit about that.

205
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,823
Your eyes finally seem relaxed now.

206
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:13,147
Wait, wait.

207
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,043
You haven't left yet?

208
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:19,153
By any chance...

209
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,629
do women like these things?

210
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,909
Or...

211
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:32,407
this?

212
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:40,442
This is pretty severe.

213
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:43,269
I was about to get into my car.

214
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:45,940
They were selling them on the street.

215
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:55,596
Still, it's better than a necklace
that costs as much as a house.

216
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:03,067
You look so pretty when you smile.

217
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,514
To see you smile like this again...

218
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:09,167
what do I need to buy next?

219
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:12,794
It would be easier for you
if I asked you to buy me a building.

220
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,087
Yes, it would.

221
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:19,740
- I'll be going then.
- Yeah, okay.

222
00:16:47,212 --> 00:16:49,033
I'll clean the living room later.

223
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,014
I should do it
while I'm already cleaning.

224
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,485
I need to clean and go to the market.

225
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:55,761
I said I will do it later.

226
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:57,863
I should clean while I'm at it.

227
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:00,006
Hoon rolls around and plays on the floor.

228
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:02,741
All this dust will go up his nose.

229
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:15,792
All right. I'm done, okay?

230
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:22,656
Hey, do that later.

231
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,489
Go throw this out.

232
00:17:25,457 --> 00:17:28,107
You should pretend to help out
on days you don't have class.

233
00:17:28,107 --> 00:17:32,047
I have to put this online tonight,
so that the kids can prepare for class.

234
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:37,047
If your sister-in-law is vacuuming,
you should get up and help out.

235
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:38,696
Is your work going to get you a medal?

236
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:41,180
You just sit in front of the computer.

237
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,007
Forget it, forget it.
I'm all done.

238
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:47,574
Give me money for the groceries.

239
00:17:47,574 --> 00:17:49,320
What are you going to buy?

240
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:52,061
I don't know. What should we eat?

241
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:54,910
Just give me 50,000 won.

242
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,435
I'll just shop with that amount.

243
00:17:57,435 --> 00:17:59,987
I give you 50,000 won
every time you go.

244
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:04,326
I can't get much with 50,000 won anyway.

245
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:06,556
Hey, come see me.

246
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:23,169
Give me the account
where my son gets his income.

247
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,179
What?

248
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,196
You don't even do household work.

249
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:27,275
Mother.

250
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:30,713
It's just awful to have to come
to you for money all the time.

251
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:32,083
But, Mother...

252
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:35,451
If you don't like it,
quit your job and be a housewife.

253
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:36,472
What?

254
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:38,076
You don't even raise kids.

255
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:42,981
You don't do chores, so what right
do you have to that account?

256
00:18:44,097 --> 00:18:46,146
I will assume you understand.

257
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:51,195
Put the account information
and seal by the TV.

258
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:02,884
Mom, what's with you?

259
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:04,944
Things will get noisy.

260
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,065
What if they kick us out?

261
00:19:06,065 --> 00:19:09,105
I'm going to live in my son's house.
Who's going to kick me out?

262
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:11,015
You don't believe that.

263
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:12,344
Who does she think she is?

264
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:14,673
Acting like royalty
with no fear of her mother-in-law?

265
00:19:14,673 --> 00:19:16,711
I'm going fix that habit of hers.

266
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,773
Where is she going?

267
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:29,180
She says she's busy.
Why start a fight?

268
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,682
She must be going
to tell her family about us.

269
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,751
What are you doing here?

270
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:45,109
Mother says I should quit my job,
raise kids, and become a housewife.

271
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,869
Really?

272
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:49,664
I can't work in peace there.

273
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:53,008
I should just forget about my studies.

274
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:05,798
What are you doing, Mi Sook?

275
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:07,548
Can't you tell?

276
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:09,949
I am cooking in place of my great
daughter-in-law.

277
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:11,561
My daughter is crying.

278
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:15,363
How can I know what she's thinking?
I don't know what my daughter's thinking.

279
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:18,191
You didn't need to go so far.
Why make her cry?

280
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:22,060
My daughter cleans, does laundry, and
pulls her back when it's not her home.

281
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,771
I found her face so annoying
just sitting there. So what?

282
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,131
What about her face?

283
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,440
You've gone too far.

284
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:36,589
Since things turned out this way,
she could give me one month's expenses.

285
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:40,709
She tosses me 50,000 won
every time I go to the market.

286
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:43,124
It is so upsetting.

287
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:45,465
Does she really toss it?

288
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:47,905
It's not money she earned.
My son did.

289
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:49,150
Oh, seriously?

290
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:53,076
Are you going to be petty about
who earned the money?

291
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:56,917
As for me, with both
Hoon's dad and aunt

292
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:59,769
I have never treated them like
they were not my children.

293
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:01,506
What do you think about that?

294
00:21:01,506 --> 00:21:03,644
It's not that I doubt you.

295
00:21:03,644 --> 00:21:07,066
You sure did not teach your daughter
good manners.

296
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:10,239
Teaching doesn't always work with
kids these days.

297
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,102
How can she be so detestable?

298
00:21:15,102 --> 00:21:18,550
She was just born that way.
What can I do?

299
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,114
Think of her as your own and
look upon her kindly.

300
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,173
She gave 50,000 won to someone
going to the market.

301
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:28,000
"I give you 50,000 won
every time you go."

302
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,625
What is that supposed to mean?

303
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,931
Is she saying we're stealing?

304
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,454
Every single thing she says....

305
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:37,655
I'm sorry about that.

306
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:40,636
I have nothing I can say about that.

307
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:45,526
It is all my fault
for not teaching her properly.

308
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:47,737
Oh dear.

309
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:51,226
Please let it go for my sake.

310
00:21:51,914 --> 00:21:55,544
If you could send
a plate of those downstairs...

311
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:59,365
I would be very grateful
and enjoy them.

312
00:21:59,365 --> 00:22:03,347
Though, they weren't bought
with money that my daughter earned.

313
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:07,107
Gosh, how absurd this is.

314
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:11,076
Then, I will assume you will let it go
since you have a good personality.

315
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:14,416
I will be heading down. Goodbye.

316
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:18,711
There's no way.

317
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:21,324
I won't let it go this time.

318
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:24,407
I'll see if she hands over
one month's living expenses or not.

319
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:27,387
What if she uses it all at once?

320
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,580
Hae Jin.

321
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:33,869
You're not the only precise
and smart person in the world.

322
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:35,820
I don't trust anyone.

323
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:39,244
If that's true...

324
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:42,164
how did you end up marrying Hoon's dad?

325
00:22:42,164 --> 00:22:44,201
- Dad!
- Huh?

326
00:22:44,603 --> 00:22:47,463
Never mind. Get to work.

327
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:56,297
Goodness.

328
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:01,063
You said the volunteer had something
come up and couldn't come.

329
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:03,488
I could have figured something out.

330
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:05,354
Why would you do that?

331
00:23:05,354 --> 00:23:07,282
We can come out and buy things.

332
00:23:07,282 --> 00:23:09,836
You'd be more comfortable on your own.
Why bring me?

333
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:11,843
We could just go to a grocery store.

334
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:14,653
It's so frustrating
to go to a grocery store.

335
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:17,413
For some strange reason,
I like the smell of markets.

336
00:23:17,993 --> 00:23:21,733
It's a little stinky and dirty.

337
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:24,799
But, it smells fresh too.

338
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:27,231
I need to buy towels.

339
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,755
Don't worry. We'll buy everything.

340
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:30,826
Let's go.

341
00:23:33,943 --> 00:23:35,665
Have you ever eaten pork hocks?

342
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:38,205
Of course, I've tried them.

343
00:23:38,205 --> 00:23:41,798
Is there anyone who lives in this country
who hasn't tried them?

344
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:43,776
Then what about noodles
in black bean sauce?

345
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:45,868
Don't you want to eat noodles
in black bean sauce?

346
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:47,851
I order that once a week.

347
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:49,759
Do you?

348
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,702
Let's just buy towels.

349
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:52,767
Let's go.

350
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:57,313
What smells so good?

351
00:23:57,684 --> 00:23:59,415
Something smells good.

352
00:23:59,415 --> 00:24:00,955
It's the smell of fried chicken.

353
00:24:01,384 --> 00:24:02,921
I quit chicken recently.

354
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,238
You ate so much that you had to quit?

355
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:08,647
Then...

356
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,538
It seems like you've been living life
eating most everything.

357
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:16,898
I'm reminded of a time when
I went to the market with someone.

358
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:17,980
Someone?

359
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,319
I had a mother once too.

360
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:28,588
There was a market in the country
where they fried donuts on the spot.

361
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:30,968
They had a place
where they made tofu, as well.

362
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:34,289
I guess the smells
are bringing back your memories.

363
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:39,688
Then what are some smells
you want to smell again?

364
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,917
Or something you want to feel again?

365
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:43,526
Think about that.

366
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,726
Strangely, I like the flat smell of tofu.

367
00:24:50,396 --> 00:24:52,895
You're the first person I met who
likes the smell of tofu.

368
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:56,846
I like the flat smell of beans
from cold tofu.

369
00:24:57,075 --> 00:25:00,875
When a warm piece of tofu is put
into my mouth

370
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,036
the soft and sweet feel.

371
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:07,185
You have a lot of memories
connected to tofu.

372
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,846
For a while, when I smelled tofu

373
00:25:10,846 --> 00:25:12,910
I was reminded of someone.

374
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:17,126
You should just say your mom.
Why do you do that?

375
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:21,404
Because it's been so long
since I called her that.

376
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:29,436
<i>When you miss someone so much...</i>

377
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:32,912
<i>you cannot speak their name
so carelessly.</i>

378
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:40,929
<i>The longing that has built up
overwhelms the sadness.</i>

379
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:44,237
<i>It becomes fear and people
who have experienced this...</i>

380
00:26:01,138 --> 00:26:03,362
<i>No matter what they do</i>

381
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:06,728
<i>when confronted with
a separation that is final...</i>

382
00:26:07,808 --> 00:26:11,848
<i>they cannot bring up
that person so carelessly.</i>

383
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:22,356
What is this?

384
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:34,981
Nothing happened for a year.
I thought he had grown tired of her.

385
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,714
It was not a breeze that blew by.

386
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:48,175
We only put green onions in the clam
stew and nothing else.

387
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:50,695
Then how do you get any flavor?

388
00:26:50,695 --> 00:26:54,404
There is no dignity in getting flavor
by putting all the ingredients in it.

389
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:58,156
If they like clean, simple foods,
you should use little neck-necked clams.

390
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:00,527
The little neck clams don't have
a strong taste.

391
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:02,935
She must be very picky.

392
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,776
It took me about five years just to
get the flavor of this stew right.

393
00:27:09,923 --> 00:27:11,474
I need to see you.

394
00:27:12,886 --> 00:27:14,125
Now?

395
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:25,471
Set up a time for me to see
Yoo Ji Na or whoever she is.

396
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:26,878
Yoo Ji Na?

397
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:28,849
Why all of sudden?

398
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,977
Just set up a time if I tell you to.

399
00:27:31,497 --> 00:27:33,506
Yes, all right.

400
00:27:34,596 --> 00:27:38,042
I'll find her contact information,
but what if she refuses to come.

401
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:40,496
Do whatever is necessary
to get her here.

402
00:27:40,496 --> 00:27:43,405
Do whatever you must
to get her in front of me.

403
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:44,862
Yes.

404
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:47,924
Call Yoon Hee
and tell her to come that day.

405
00:27:47,924 --> 00:27:49,413
I can go with you.

406
00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:51,724
I should bring someone worth taking.

407
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:56,595
How dare that celebrity woman
come after...

408
00:27:58,194 --> 00:27:59,310
Yes.

409
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:16,395
Chairman Park wanted to meet me here?

410
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:20,355
Actually, it wasn't him but his mother.

411
00:28:21,227 --> 00:28:22,305
What?

412
00:28:22,808 --> 00:28:25,359
The agency president said you had to go.

413
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,570
You're not going to stand up
an old woman, are you?

414
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:34,167
You never know.

415
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:36,917
She might want to see her future
daughter-in-law quickly.

416
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:39,238
It must be time for you to leave.

417
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:40,679
You'd better shut that mouth.

418
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:56,384
So, what does your father do?

419
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:58,969
I'm sure I will not see you again.

420
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,867
We should start with proper greetings.

421
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:06,298
You should answer
if an elder asks you a question.

422
00:29:07,317 --> 00:29:10,179
He sold tofu in a country market.

423
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:11,749
Tofu?

424
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:16,219
People stopped buying market tofu
because of the supermarkets.

425
00:29:16,219 --> 00:29:18,940
He passed away from drinking too much.

426
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,041
What's the daughter of a tofu seller
thinking seeing Chairman Park?

427
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:26,009
What you're worried about won't happen,
so don't jump to conclusions.

428
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,345
You can trust me on this.

429
00:29:29,345 --> 00:29:30,509
I don't trust you.

430
00:29:31,221 --> 00:29:33,769
I don't trust things people say.

431
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:37,661
I'm here to look into your eyes.

432
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:44,019
People with that look in their eyes
can't become part of my household.

433
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,599
What is the look in my eyes?

434
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:49,700
The reason you can't become my
daughter-in-law...

435
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,660
it's not because you're
the daughter of a tofu seller.

436
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,099
It's because of that shallow...

437
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:57,763
and insolent look in your eyes.

438
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:02,894
Use those eyes on the men.

439
00:30:04,835 --> 00:30:07,243
It will not work on me.

440
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:11,519
I've seen it all.

441
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:14,584
I can clearly see what you're thinking.

442
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:16,987
How dare you in front of an elder?

443
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:18,022
What?

444
00:30:18,323 --> 00:30:20,212
Don't jump to conclusions?

445
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:23,762
Do you really want to try it with me?

446
00:30:24,502 --> 00:30:26,832
If you don't want to be ripped to shreds

447
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:29,103
get out of Chairman Park's sight now!

448
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,596
Let's go.

449
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:44,857
It's not a small amount,
so you won't be disappointed.

450
00:30:44,857 --> 00:30:48,894
If we meet in a formal setting,
we should greet each other.

451
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,468
Give that to Chairman Park.

452
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:02,799
Change agencies right now.

453
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,400
We still have time left on the contract.

454
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,859
I'll pay the breach of contract fee.

455
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:08,161
Change it now.

456
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:36,064
Are you really going to change agencies?

457
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:38,184
Have you seen me say
the same thing twice?

458
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:41,644
Who do they think they are
to send me wherever they please?

459
00:31:41,644 --> 00:31:44,672
Then do you have a place in mind?

460
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:45,673
No.

461
00:31:46,394 --> 00:31:48,501
I only have one condition.

462
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:49,603
A condition?

463
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:54,788
There's an impersonator who sings
at nightclubs named Yoo Jui Na.

464
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,680
The one who practiced with you
at one point.

465
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,695
I want her guaranteed
to get on broadcast TV.

466
00:32:00,057 --> 00:32:02,688
I'm looking for an agency
that will support all her activities.

467
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:06,067
Ask them to sign her on along with me.

468
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:08,564
That's my only condition.

469
00:32:08,564 --> 00:32:09,761
Yoo Jui Na.

470
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:11,541
Her real name?

471
00:32:15,451 --> 00:32:16,694
Jung Hae Dang.

472
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,571
Father is home.

473
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,597
Why are you being this way?

474
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,948
It was harder for me because you,
not because of my late wife.

475
00:32:40,351 --> 00:32:42,618
Do you want me to die too?

476
00:32:43,826 --> 00:32:47,357
I need someone to give affection to
in order to live too.

477
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,377
My children treat me like an enemy
who killed their mother.

478
00:32:52,377 --> 00:32:56,590
You used your son
to destroy this family.

479
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,209
I am tired of it.

480
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,038
I am tired of being your son, Mother.

481
00:33:02,938 --> 00:33:04,480
If something like this happens again

482
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,465
I will not see you again, Mother.

483
00:33:08,517 --> 00:33:10,907
These are not empty words.

484
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,509
I will not see you. I won't!

485
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,196
Are you done now?

486
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:20,138
Go eat if you're done.

487
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,242
Get ready. Let's go eat.

488
00:33:26,642 --> 00:33:30,760
Even when Mother was alive,
there were always other women.

489
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,301
The house never got noisy.

490
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:37,111
I think Father is planning
something this time too.

491
00:33:38,623 --> 00:33:40,672
It's only just been a year.

492
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,631
And with a woman
the world knows, at that.

493
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:49,663
From a woman's point of view,
I feel so bad for your late mother.

494
00:33:49,663 --> 00:33:53,601
He will always do what his children
try to stop him from doing.

495
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:54,682
My father.

496
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:57,551
But, there's one other person
in the family.

497
00:33:57,551 --> 00:34:00,722
A person who lives to bother my father.

498
00:34:33,481 --> 00:34:37,268
My family won't accept you
changing agencies like this.

499
00:34:37,268 --> 00:34:38,353
What if they can't?

500
00:34:38,353 --> 00:34:40,086
We delayed it because of your mother.

501
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:42,019
We should get married this spring.

502
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:44,210
It's not up to me
to go into the company.

503
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,672
- So, beg Father.
- What?

504
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:49,335
If you are always outside the company

505
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:51,862
my household might say
to cancel the whole thing.

506
00:34:53,362 --> 00:34:55,931
You need to think of me.
I've waited all this time.

507
00:34:56,242 --> 00:34:58,782
I'd rather die than beg.
Do you think I'm crazy?

508
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:07,211
Yoo Ji Na is looking for a new agency.

509
00:35:07,211 --> 00:35:09,992
- Really?
- She had trouble with her agency.

510
00:35:09,992 --> 00:35:11,954
Do whatever you can to get her.

511
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:13,550
Say you'll do whatever she wants.

512
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,626
- She has one condition.
- What is it?

513
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:18,726
She wants to sign a woman
named Yoo Jui Na with her.

514
00:35:19,846 --> 00:35:21,617
Who is Yoo Jui Na?

515
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:23,822
What does she do?

516
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:27,548
Here.

517
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:31,739
It's a tree.

518
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,722
Don't you feel better just touching it?

519
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:46,411
It will always be here
in the same place no matter what.

520
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:49,257
You mean it will still be here
even if I die?

521
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,489
Try smelling it too.

522
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,601
I really like the smell of trees.

523
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:13,030
No one ever brought me
to a place like this.

524
00:36:39,945 --> 00:36:42,481
There's a good fragrance
coming from you, Hae Dang.

525
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:44,750
From me?

526
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,490
I probably smell like cheap makeup.

527
00:36:50,195 --> 00:36:51,550
I smell hair.

528
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:00,692
I came out in a rush
and didn't wash my hair.

529
00:37:01,313 --> 00:37:04,400
I will wash my hair next time.

530
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,679
Is your hair long?

531
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:11,081
You'd know if you touched it.

532
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:21,623
Do you know now?

533
00:37:25,072 --> 00:37:28,306
I think my mother had long hair.

534
00:37:29,094 --> 00:37:32,882
Everyone has their memory of
their mother's smell.

535
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:35,974
I want to smell the grass.

536
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:39,489
When I was young,
there were fields in the country.

537
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:40,755
I'm going to catch you

538
00:37:40,755 --> 00:37:42,586
Try to catch me.

539
00:37:42,586 --> 00:37:44,096
Catch me.

540
00:37:56,262 --> 00:37:58,659
<i>I would fall asleep on someone's lap.</i>

541
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:03,059
<i>The smell of the grass in my sleep.</i>

542
00:38:10,074 --> 00:38:12,074
The smell of grass is good.

543
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:17,864
Let's run around in field this summer.
So much that we get sick of it.

544
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:20,246
Why are you being so good to me?

545
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:24,445
I know that you're a good person.

546
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:35,135
I was a burden in this world too.

547
00:38:35,135 --> 00:38:39,166
Is that why you're trying to
pull me out in the world?

548
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:45,788
Give me your hand.

549
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:04,527
This is what I look like.

550
00:39:07,865 --> 00:39:09,646
Do you think you can remember it?

551
00:39:13,077 --> 00:39:15,842
This is your first time touching
a woman's face, isn't it?

552
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:18,092
Besides your mother's face
when you were young.

553
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:25,434
You have big eyes.

554
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,344
I have uselessly big eyes.

555
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:32,335
Do I have to remember your face?

556
00:39:33,355 --> 00:39:35,643
The people I have liked...

557
00:39:36,717 --> 00:39:40,454
they tend to have a habit
of disappearing overnight.

558
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:44,884
My mom was like that.

559
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,663
That night...

560
00:39:48,726 --> 00:39:52,884
the person who made me
cry like that did that too.

561
00:39:57,423 --> 00:40:00,554
I had no time to prepare my heart.

562
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:04,157
"What am I supposed to do?"

563
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:08,344
I had no time to complain like that.

564
00:40:10,704 --> 00:40:12,246
Anyway...

565
00:40:13,338 --> 00:40:15,659
they disappeared overnight.

566
00:40:19,398 --> 00:40:24,293
And now I can never see them again.

567
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,811
It wasn't because I accepted a farewell.

568
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:33,565
It just ended suddenly.

569
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,710
It was like swallowing
all my tears all at once.

570
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,094
I had to force it down.

571
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:50,789
You must know what that's like,
Kyung Soo.

572
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:59,789
Where my pain is...

573
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:04,190
I feel like you might
understand, Kyung Soo.

574
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:07,992
For how long...

575
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:11,681
do you need me to just listen
to your words?

576
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:19,132
That is something I can do for you.

577
00:41:32,313 --> 00:41:37,233
<i>Playing during the day.</i>

578
00:41:38,617 --> 00:41:44,224
<i>I left it behind.</i>

579
00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:53,731
<i>The tree leaf boat.</i>

580
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:04,242
The person you said I sing like
is your mom, right?

581
00:42:10,315 --> 00:42:14,510
<i>Playing during the day.</i>

582
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:18,677
<i>I left it behind.</i>

583
00:42:18,677 --> 00:42:23,454
<i>The tree leaf boat.</i>

584
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:27,733
<i>By my mom's side.</i>

585
00:42:27,733 --> 00:42:30,795
<i>Lying beside her.</i>

586
00:42:30,795 --> 00:42:35,423
<i>I remember her.</i>

587
00:42:36,626 --> 00:42:41,364
<i>The blue moon.</i>

588
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:47,588
<i>White clouds.</i>

589
00:42:49,411 --> 00:42:58,931
<i>They are floating by.</i>

590
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,567
<i>In the pond...</i>

591
00:43:04,697 --> 00:43:07,666
<i>lightly, lightly...</i>

592
00:43:08,762 --> 00:43:13,759
<i>it will drift down.</i>

593
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:27,079
- Hurry up.
- Yes.

594
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:31,039
Wait just a moment.

595
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,697
She's done performing.
I don't know what she's doing.

596
00:43:34,697 --> 00:43:36,226
She must be in the bathroom.

597
00:43:41,657 --> 00:43:43,556
He's from an agency.

598
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:45,847
An agency?

599
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:48,146
They want to sign you, exclusively.

600
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:49,152
Me?

601
00:43:49,715 --> 00:43:50,804
Why?

602
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,945
My name is Jang Oh Sung.

603
00:44:11,054 --> 00:44:13,655
She doesn't seem to believe
we want to sign her.

604
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:15,688
She'd like to meet you and decide.

605
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:24,197
Is she a strange person
who can't grasp the situation?

606
00:44:26,755 --> 00:44:28,153
A contract?

607
00:44:28,545 --> 00:44:32,244
Then you finally got an agency?

608
00:44:32,244 --> 00:44:34,923
It's weird when I think about it.

609
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:37,043
Did they come to the wrong person?

610
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:38,983
There's another Yoo Jui Na impersonator?

611
00:44:38,983 --> 00:44:40,242
Is it fraud?

612
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:42,012
Why would you say that?

613
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,431
Why would she get conned?

614
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,264
What would she have to lose?

615
00:44:46,264 --> 00:44:49,023
Why not? You never know.

616
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,313
They might pay her some money
and work her to death.

617
00:44:51,893 --> 00:44:53,052
A slave contract?

618
00:44:53,052 --> 00:44:56,027
They take new rookies in
at a cheap price.

619
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,773
It's practically free for them.

620
00:44:58,253 --> 00:45:00,403
It's not like I'm an idol.

621
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:02,193
There's no use for me.

622
00:45:02,193 --> 00:45:03,818
Why wouldn't there be?

623
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:06,179
They'll take you to all sorts of
islands and unknown ports.

624
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:08,414
They'll make you sing all night.

625
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,543
Wait.

626
00:45:09,934 --> 00:45:11,617
Unknown ports?

627
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:14,231
That makes me uneasy.

628
00:45:14,231 --> 00:45:17,190
What unknown ports are there
in this day and age?

629
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,679
How can you become a celebrity
if you're going argue about that?

630
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:26,099
Yeah, I suppose even copycat singers
get on TV once they get famous.

631
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:29,467
They need an agency to get on TV.

632
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:31,797
No one is a star from the beginning.

633
00:45:32,557 --> 00:45:35,349
Just don't put your seal on anything
without thinking, okay?

634
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:36,577
That's right.

635
00:45:36,577 --> 00:45:38,768
It's the seal that's important.

636
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:42,851
You have to use your seal properly
to succeed in life.

637
00:45:49,887 --> 00:45:51,340
So, what I'm saying is...

638
00:45:51,987 --> 00:45:56,092
you will become like me
if you stamp things without thought.

639
00:45:58,311 --> 00:45:59,759
When you eat these days

640
00:45:59,784 --> 00:46:03,635
you'll be in big trouble in if you get
a chicken bone in your throat.

641
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,929
Please have more of this.

642
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,112
I'm fine. Give it to Hae Dang.

643
00:46:09,512 --> 00:46:14,105
I can just eat a couple of
these chicken breasts.

644
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,652
What? You already ate the most.

645
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:18,313
What couple pieces?

646
00:46:18,313 --> 00:46:19,882
Mi Sook.

647
00:46:19,882 --> 00:46:22,498
All right, all right. Father-in-law.

648
00:46:22,498 --> 00:46:23,688
Cheers.

649
00:46:23,688 --> 00:46:27,809
To the broadcast premiere
of my sister-in-law.

650
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:30,010
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

651
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:33,657
Whatever happens later,
cheers to you.

652
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,574
- Here, here.
- Cheers!

653
00:46:35,574 --> 00:46:36,934
One, two, three.

654
00:46:36,934 --> 00:46:39,487
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

655
00:46:40,784 --> 00:46:42,880
- Let's drink.
- Eat this.

656
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:49,760
If Hoon's aunt goes on TV

657
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,840
I'm going to follow her
and go to the station.

658
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,119
Are you that excited?

659
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,307
Of course, I am.

660
00:46:57,307 --> 00:46:59,648
I'm going to show off to everyone
in the neighborhood.

661
00:47:00,681 --> 00:47:05,347
I told the hair shop owner
about going to Yoo Ji Na's house.

662
00:47:05,748 --> 00:47:06,967
She didn't believe me.

663
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,635
Well, I suppose if you look at me...

664
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:13,557
Who do you take after
that you are so thoughtless?

665
00:47:13,557 --> 00:47:17,059
You said I was smart
up to the age of three or four.

666
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:21,329
Didn't you say I got like this after you
dropped me from the clay pot stand?

667
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:22,717
What are you talking about?

668
00:47:22,717 --> 00:47:24,659
Someone would think it's true.

669
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:32,028
You wouldn't have been pushed
aside if you had a child.

670
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,838
Why would you bring that up?

671
00:47:34,838 --> 00:47:37,579
Gosh, that awful jerk.

672
00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:40,184
You worked so hard to get him set.

673
00:47:40,184 --> 00:47:41,480
Still...

674
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,719
Things were good back when I would
go to the construction site and cook.

675
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:49,242
I am so good at getting
the food seasoning right.

676
00:47:49,688 --> 00:47:51,579
All those customers.

677
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:55,538
So many customers came
that I couldn't accept all of them.

678
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:57,518
You suffered so much for him.

679
00:47:57,518 --> 00:47:59,389
Just when our life got pretty good...

680
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,739
He started to misbehave and
spend nights in the pool hall.

681
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:06,474
He ended up cheating on me.

682
00:48:06,474 --> 00:48:07,713
That jerk.

683
00:48:07,713 --> 00:48:09,295
So, one day...

684
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:13,460
I poured a whole container
of salt in the soup.

685
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,840
- Why?
- So, we would lose customers.

686
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,052
What?

687
00:48:18,052 --> 00:48:23,150
I thought he might come back if we
were having financial troubles again.

688
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,414
My goodness.

689
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:26,329
He didn't come back.

690
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,275
I just got hit.

691
00:48:30,771 --> 00:48:35,085
Money sure is a scary thing.

692
00:48:38,018 --> 00:48:41,217
When he fell for another woman...

693
00:48:42,217 --> 00:48:46,146
he really became a stranger.

694
00:48:47,606 --> 00:48:52,018
He was so cruel in the end.

695
00:48:53,588 --> 00:48:59,286
I started to wonder if I really
shared a bed with this man.

696
00:49:01,257 --> 00:49:04,077
Come here. It's okay.

697
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:07,914
It's in the past.

698
00:49:11,606 --> 00:49:13,554
I had nowhere to go.

699
00:49:14,003 --> 00:49:16,135
How could I get divorced?

700
00:49:17,293 --> 00:49:20,114
I was going to live with it.

701
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,565
But, he kept hitting me.

702
00:49:25,534 --> 00:49:27,284
You did good. You did.

703
00:49:27,755 --> 00:49:30,755
You can live anywhere.
Why would you live with him?

704
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,713
All I need is you, Mom.

705
00:49:35,186 --> 00:49:38,396
All I need is you too.

706
00:49:49,172 --> 00:49:50,782
What if he looks at me and says...

707
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:52,873
"Forget it. Just go."

708
00:49:52,873 --> 00:49:55,539
What if that happens? How annoying.

709
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:58,010
Why did this have to happen?

710
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:00,550
What? You're totally happy.

711
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:03,317
It seems like you're excited.

712
00:50:03,317 --> 00:50:05,842
Excited? Who's excited?

713
00:50:05,842 --> 00:50:07,083
You should be.

714
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:09,143
You've been singing for over 10 years.

715
00:50:09,143 --> 00:50:11,536
Have you ever had anything like
a contract?

716
00:50:12,233 --> 00:50:13,882
This makes me think of Mom.

717
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:17,686
She would've been happy
if she were alive.

718
00:50:17,686 --> 00:50:21,193
A few years after she passed away,
I thought of her during hard times.

719
00:50:21,193 --> 00:50:24,213
Nowadays, I think of her
during good times, don't you?

720
00:50:25,378 --> 00:50:26,623
Yeah.

721
00:50:27,012 --> 00:50:29,574
By the way, what are you
going to wear?

722
00:50:29,574 --> 00:50:32,074
Just wear something tidy.

723
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:33,762
Is she going to an interview?

724
00:50:33,762 --> 00:50:35,172
I have a good idea.

725
00:50:36,184 --> 00:50:40,067
Just wear something sexy.

726
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,052
That's right. Just go with sexy.

727
00:50:44,443 --> 00:50:47,123
You won't ever go wrong
with sexy in this world.

728
00:50:48,626 --> 00:50:51,336
Hello, I'm Yoo Jui Na.

729
00:50:51,336 --> 00:50:53,842
Hey! Don't make fun of your sister.

730
00:50:54,313 --> 00:50:56,943
Ouch! Don't do that.

731
00:50:56,943 --> 00:50:59,164
You really got me.

732
00:50:59,164 --> 00:51:02,039
You need to get hurt more.
Here, eat this.

733
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:04,418
Hey, stop it.

734
00:51:04,418 --> 00:51:06,626
- I knew you would do that.
- Massage this for me.

735
00:51:11,717 --> 00:51:14,496
Wait, wait, wait!

736
00:51:14,496 --> 00:51:17,297
Wait!
Wait!

737
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,501
I think you'd be better off
without the bangs.

738
00:51:52,597 --> 00:51:53,603
What?

739
00:51:53,603 --> 00:51:56,692
You're not going on a marriage setup.
Why are you bothering with your hair?

740
00:51:56,692 --> 00:51:58,708
Mind your own business.

741
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:00,969
Don't get involved in mine.

742
00:52:01,487 --> 00:52:03,628
What a weird man.

743
00:52:03,628 --> 00:52:07,936
You look like the main character in
a 20th century black and white movie.

744
00:52:08,266 --> 00:52:09,516
Hey.

745
00:52:10,376 --> 00:52:14,237
I'm going to a one-time life
meeting right now.

746
00:52:14,237 --> 00:52:16,318
It's once in a lifetime,
not one-time life.

747
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:18,177
Yeah, so once in a lifetime.

748
00:52:18,894 --> 00:52:21,394
Anyway, don't get in the way.

749
00:52:21,394 --> 00:52:23,885
Where do you get a dress
like that these days?

750
00:52:23,885 --> 00:52:27,072
I got it online. Online, okay?

751
00:52:27,072 --> 00:52:28,844
You shouldn't wear it anywhere else.

752
00:52:28,844 --> 00:52:30,139
Why, you...

753
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:31,905
Aren't you Yoo Jui Na?

754
00:52:33,056 --> 00:52:35,496
Do you think I didn't even
look at your profile picture?

755
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:39,686
Let's get out.

756
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,706
Here.

757
00:52:50,023 --> 00:52:52,175
I don't know if you listened to it.

758
00:52:52,175 --> 00:52:55,505
These are recordings of the cover songs.

759
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,773
I don't need any of that.

760
00:52:58,737 --> 00:52:59,764
Here you go.

761
00:53:00,193 --> 00:53:03,074
Read this and stamp it with your seal.

762
00:53:07,764 --> 00:53:09,762
<i>[Entertainer Agency Contract]</i>

763
00:53:09,762 --> 00:53:11,202
There's no contract amount.

764
00:53:11,202 --> 00:53:12,617
You can write in a fair amount.

765
00:53:12,617 --> 00:53:15,097
What about the contract length?

766
00:53:15,097 --> 00:53:16,757
You can fill that in too.

767
00:53:23,027 --> 00:53:24,117
What are you looking at?

768
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,527
You're a con artist, aren't you?

769
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:26,576
What?

770
00:53:26,576 --> 00:53:28,592
Don't look down on me.

771
00:53:28,592 --> 00:53:32,244
My little sister is an instructor at
a college and she has a lawyer friend.

772
00:53:32,244 --> 00:53:33,983
I have people too.

773
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:35,797
I'm sure you do.

774
00:53:37,135 --> 00:53:40,552
I'm not interested in that,
so just stamp it.

775
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:44,034
There's no amount or length.
Am I just supposed to stamp it?

776
00:53:44,034 --> 00:53:45,614
Don't drop honorifics.

777
00:53:47,063 --> 00:53:50,952
Okay, fine. Let's write them in now.

778
00:53:52,385 --> 00:53:53,713
Let's do five years.

779
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:55,592
What year is it now?

780
00:53:55,592 --> 00:53:57,163
I will ask you once more.

781
00:53:58,449 --> 00:54:00,940
Why are you doing this contract with me?

782
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:04,300
<i>You cannot ever tell her
that Yoo Ji Na is recommending her.</i>

783
00:54:04,726 --> 00:54:07,248
Oh, well...

784
00:54:07,248 --> 00:54:08,398
It's Yoo Ji Na, right?

785
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:12,009
Yoo Ji Na requested it, didn't she?

786
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:16,356
What? Can't Yoo Ji Na request it?

787
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,958
I'm sorry.

788
00:54:31,547 --> 00:54:32,818
What are you sorry for?

789
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:35,755
Well, I don't know what I'm sorry for.

790
00:54:35,755 --> 00:54:37,871
I'm sure I did something to be sorry for.

791
00:54:37,871 --> 00:54:40,221
Why are all of you so alike?

792
00:54:40,221 --> 00:54:42,371
How are we alike? Who are we like?

793
00:54:49,528 --> 00:54:51,934
You're just being added on.
What is she being picky about?

794
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:58,260
Did you hear that?

795
00:54:59,844 --> 00:55:02,126
Get out. Get out and let's talk.

796
00:55:02,355 --> 00:55:05,824
The phrase one should say with
most care in the world...

797
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,244
is saying sorry.

798
00:55:10,655 --> 00:55:14,304
Neither you nor Yoo Ji Na know that.

799
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:20,405
What is she going on about?

800
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,764
What are you doing here?

801
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,614
I thought if I waited in the car...

802
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:49,282
it wouldn't show just how sorry I was.

803
00:55:49,282 --> 00:55:51,956
I understand, so you can go now.

804
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,501
Can't you...

805
00:55:56,172 --> 00:55:58,061
forgive me just once?

806
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,994
I couldn't do anything.

807
00:56:08,764 --> 00:56:11,840
I couldn't work.
Meetings and conferences...

808
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,313
I delayed them all.

809
00:56:14,313 --> 00:56:17,420
- Chairman.
- I thought only one thing.

810
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,789
How hard must it have been
on your pride?

811
00:56:20,481 --> 00:56:22,519
I really thought I was going crazy.

812
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:24,690
It's not as bad as you imagine.

813
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:26,681
Don't worry, just go.

814
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:31,260
I don't have Park Sang Hwan in my heart.

815
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,862
Would I be hurt to hear those words
from his mother?

816
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:39,730
"I was unlucky." I shook it off.

817
00:56:40,782 --> 00:56:44,400
If you had heard them from
his mother

818
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,126
it would have hurt.

819
00:56:46,126 --> 00:56:49,599
Do not bring him up like that.

820
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,731
I can't get into a fight with a dead man.

821
00:56:52,731 --> 00:56:55,597
It's not like he had money or anything.

822
00:56:56,688 --> 00:56:59,748
He was an unemployed punk.
What did you like so much about him?

823
00:56:59,748 --> 00:57:01,447
Don't refer to him as a punk.

824
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:04,349
Okay, fine.

825
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:08,228
That young man...

826
00:57:09,181 --> 00:57:11,021
what did you like so much about him?

827
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:23,443
I felt like if I had him,
I wouldn't need anything else.

828
00:57:24,394 --> 00:57:28,731
Money and fame,
I didn't want any of it.

829
00:57:30,394 --> 00:57:32,918
I wanted to rest on him.

830
00:57:34,007 --> 00:57:36,277
I started to think that.

831
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:40,518
I should have met him before he
left this world.

832
00:57:40,518 --> 00:57:43,418
Who was this guy?

833
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,766
From the moment we first met...

834
00:57:45,766 --> 00:57:48,398
he wasn't afraid of my exterior.

835
00:57:50,398 --> 00:57:52,487
My heart must have been
put at ease by that.

836
00:57:52,797 --> 00:57:56,851
Then you feel that I'm someone who's
gone mad for that exterior, is that it?

837
00:57:57,257 --> 00:57:58,849
Should I stop talking?

838
00:58:02,338 --> 00:58:04,688
Honestly, I'm just jealous.

839
00:58:07,273 --> 00:58:09,759
I don't know what I'm doing at this age.

840
00:58:11,516 --> 00:58:13,389
That man is dead.

841
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,177
I heard.

842
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,659
Because of me.

843
00:58:23,744 --> 00:58:26,778
You've said that five times now.

844
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:36,958
It's because of my wounds.

845
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,371
We didn't date that long.

846
00:58:41,371 --> 00:58:43,197
I wouldn't have fallen that deep.

847
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:51,230
You were old enough to know.
What was it that you saw?

848
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:52,735
What did you trust?

849
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:55,434
What was it that I trusted?

850
00:58:57,744 --> 00:58:59,766
That is the point.

851
00:59:01,197 --> 00:59:02,298
The point?

852
00:59:03,956 --> 00:59:06,525
The point that I cannot escape.

853
00:59:09,054 --> 00:59:10,186
There was...

854
00:59:12,518 --> 00:59:14,847
a girl that I liked very much.

855
00:59:16,117 --> 00:59:17,630
He was her man.

856
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,940
I trusted her.

857
00:59:25,121 --> 00:59:27,469
That's why I trusted her man.

858
00:59:30,121 --> 00:59:32,795
If a girl like her put her life
on the line for this man...

859
00:59:33,762 --> 00:59:35,467
then he must be trustworthy.

860
00:59:36,956 --> 00:59:38,818
Gosh...

861
00:59:39,657 --> 00:59:41,228
The wind is still cold.

862
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:58,726
That innocent and weak girl.

863
00:59:59,585 --> 01:00:02,025
What did I do to her?

864
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,291
Look at you.

865
01:00:23,181 --> 01:00:26,271
You break as easily as glass.

866
01:00:27,501 --> 01:00:29,242
You recklessly act strong.

867
01:00:46,255 --> 01:00:50,286
<i>Wherever I look,
there is only darkness.</i>

868
01:00:50,286 --> 01:00:55,324
<i>It's hard to breathe with
my eyes closed and ears plugged.</i>

869
01:00:56,956 --> 01:01:01,025
<i>This sadness trapped within me</i>

870
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:03,969
<i>who am I?</i>

871
01:01:07,726 --> 01:01:12,063
<i>I wear this smile like a mask.</i>

872
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:17,342
<i>I wear beauty like a coat.</i>

873
01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:22,967
<i>Shamelessly pretending like I'm happy.</i>

874
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:28,728
<i>Who am I? Who am I?</i>

875
01:01:28,728 --> 01:01:33,864
<i>I'm crying on the inside.</i>

876
01:01:33,864 --> 01:01:39,490
<i>A part of me is dying
like the tear in my heart.</i>

877
01:01:40,795 --> 01:01:50,358
<i>On my made up face,
it hides everything once again.</i>

878
01:01:50,358 --> 01:01:55,942
<i>Each day doesn't feel like
I'm truly living.</i>

879
01:01:55,942 --> 01:02:01,534
<i>I have to laugh so that
it will mask my long sighs.</i>

880
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:07,132
You're still singing my songs?

881
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:19,653
It's been a long time.

882
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:21,492
Let's go have coffee somewhere.

883
01:02:21,492 --> 01:02:23,592
I don't think we need to do that.

884
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:25,561
Don't worry.

885
01:02:26,271 --> 01:02:28,744
What you're worried about won't happen.

886
01:02:29,034 --> 01:02:30,773
What am I worried about?

887
01:02:30,773 --> 01:02:32,903
About the child in the picture.

888
01:02:34,152 --> 01:02:36,293
I won't ever speak about it.

889
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:41,244
Aren't you here because
you're worried about that?

890
01:02:41,244 --> 01:02:42,862
Why do you think that?

891
01:02:42,862 --> 01:02:44,773
You're that kind of person.

892
01:02:45,693 --> 01:02:50,242
You ended up being that kind of person.

893
01:02:50,873 --> 01:02:52,063
Jung Hae Dang.

894
01:02:52,063 --> 01:02:54,333
Of course, I am not that kind of person.

895
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:56,152
I am not you.

896
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:00,233
However, if you...

897
01:03:00,233 --> 01:03:03,184
get involved in my life
and hurt me again

898
01:03:03,184 --> 01:03:05,181
I don't know how I will change.

899
01:03:06,972 --> 01:03:09,188
Because of that child in the picture...

900
01:03:10,016 --> 01:03:13,847
there must be a reason you got that
angry and were taken aback.

901
01:03:13,847 --> 01:03:18,146
You're saying you know my weakness
and that you can destroy me.

902
01:03:18,146 --> 01:03:22,557
People can be very weak and strong
at the same time.

903
01:03:23,086 --> 01:03:25,367
Once they continue to get hurt...

904
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:27,717
you never know how they will change.

to stay with us.</i>
