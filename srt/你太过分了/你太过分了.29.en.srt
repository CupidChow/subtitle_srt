<i>[Episode 29]</i>

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,190
My name is Lee Kyung Soo.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,480
I... was abandoned
as a young child by Yoo Ji Na.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,830
I am Yoo Ji Na's son!

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,480
- What?
- Is he serious?

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,160
Yoo Ji Na gave birth to me
but does not know who my father is.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,190
She took me to an orphanage
when I was six years old.

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,120
- Oh my gosh.
- I can't believe it.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,200
I lost my sight because
of a car accident

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,920
and she sent me to
an orphanage at just six years old.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,430
She walked the path
of a glamorous singer by herself.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,240
I'll say it again.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,670
I was abandoned by my biological
mother, the famous singer, Yoo Ji Na.

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,030
I am Lee Kyung Soo!

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,280
Get him out of here.
Get him out of here.

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,070
Get him out of here right now!
I don't know that person.

18
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,150
I don't have a son.

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,790
What are you people doing? Get him
out of here! Get him out of here!

20
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,590
Are you saying that
his claims are not true?

21
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,710
It is not true at all.

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:36,310
I plan on taking legal action for
false accusations and defamation.

23
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,920
What are you doing?
Get him out of here this instant!

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,310
Do you have anything to
say in regards to this?

25
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,230
And do you plan on taking a DNA test
to confirm if you are her biological son?

26
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,560
I'm saying it very clearly,
I am Yoo Ji Na's son!

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,430
No! No! It's a lie!

28
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,350
- Let go of me! Let go of me!
- No! No!

29
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,120
Let go of me! Let go of me!

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,950
Let go of him.

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,040
That young man...

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,400
is this woman's son.

33
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,350
- Oh my gosh.
- It's true.

34
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,190
He is her son.

35
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,520
Chairman Park, have you
known this truth all along?

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,590
Yes.

37
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,150
Thank you all for loving
famous singer, Yoo Ji Na.

38
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,310
I deeply apologize in her stead.

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,630
- Oh!
- She collapsed.

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,000
Grandmother! Grandmother!

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
What is it this time?

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,280
Here.

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,590
What is this?

44
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,800
Yoo Ji Na's son turned
the press conference upside down.

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
Isn't this young man the piano teacher?

46
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,710
- Yes.
- But wasn't he blind?

47
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,590
Did you know?

48
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,470
No. How could I know that?

49
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,680
Even after all that's happened.
She still denies that he is her son.

50
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,840
Who could win against
that treacherous wench?

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,910
Her son is no joke either.

52
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,630
Father has accepted him as his son

53
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,960
and we would've given him
the company if he had asked

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,710
but he insulted his mother.

55
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,360
It's probably because he has
a lot of pent up anger against her.

56
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,000
In any case, Yoo Ji Na
is completely done for.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,840
- Completely.
- We have to wait and see.

58
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,430
It's not like this was the first time
we thought it would be the end of her.

59
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,280
The problem is it's not that
easy the more vicious they are.

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
I can't believe that woman
is Kyung Soo's mother.

61
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,520
I feel so sorry for him.

62
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,750
I think he did it for our Hae Soo
because she passed away like that.

63
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,080
He's so sweet.
Can you imagine how he's feeling?

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,150
She is his mother.

65
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,080
I can't believe this is
happening between them.

66
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,120
You are my child.
How could you do that to me?

67
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,870
You said I'm not your son.

68
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,750
You said so yourself.
You don't have a son!

69
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,920
You rejected me today.

70
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,120
Just like you abandoned me
19 years ago at the orphanage.

71
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,360
You have not changed at all.

72
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,040
So, do you feel great now that
you've confessed to the world?

73
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,920
Are you happy?

74
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,310
As my child,
how could you do this to me?

75
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,240
This would never have happened if
you had just let me live with Hae Dang!

76
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:15,000
I wanted to cut all ties with you
and just live quietly with Hae Dang.

77
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,170
I know I am indebted

78
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,430
to the late Madam Choi Kyung Ae
for the rest of my life.

79
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,190
But because you are my mother

80
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,480
I just wanted you to marry
Chairman Park Sung Hwan and live well.

81
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,920
Even if I get left out in the cold...

82
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,870
Still, I wanted you to
be happy and live well.

83
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,510
But because of you,
Hae Dang's little sister died.

84
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:44,360
You left another wound in her
heart that can't be washed away!

85
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,630
Did Jung Hae Dang tell you to do it?

86
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,700
What?

87
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,120
Did she tell you to do it
to get revenge for her sister?

88
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,370
Don't be ridiculous.

89
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,270
Or did you do this so
you can release your rage

90
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,680
to pay back the wound
in Jung Hae Dang's heart?

91
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,190
So she can feel satisfied?

92
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,120
Jung Hae Dang's tears broke your heart

93
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,390
so you did something like this to see
tears of blood come out of my eyes?

94
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,190
Do you even know tears of blood?

95
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,210
Do you really even know what
it's like to cry tears of blood?

96
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,040
Of course I know!

97
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,190
Before I graduated from high school

98
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,720
I sang at a bar.

99
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,750
I had no money or support, but I was
determined to become a singer.

100
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,680
I was slapped around
and abused behind the stage.

101
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,120
Are you curious about how I was treated?

102
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,560
Should I tell you right now?

103
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,160
Do you want to hear it?

104
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,830
Do you want to know what happened to me?

105
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,040
Why I don't even know who your
father is? Should I tell you?

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,390
I wanted so much to succeed that I
was willing to abandon my own child.

107
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:05,830
I did it because to end it that
way was so brutal and unfair!

108
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,310
Because if I didn't succeed,
I thought I would die from the pain!

109
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,560
I endured so much to get here.

110
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,070
How can my own child make
a mess of his mother's life?

111
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,830
Thanks to you,
everything is over for me.

112
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,000
My life as a singer is over

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,160
and being the wife of
a rich tycoon is over too.

114
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:47,240
You're hoping that I be miserable
for what I've done to you, right?

115
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,510
That's what you want, right?

116
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,800
Fine.

117
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,000
I will do what you want.

118
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,120
What are you doing?

119
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,560
You had it rough like me,
so watch carefully.

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,310
I'm going to end my life
right in front of you.

121
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,310
What are you doing?

122
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,310
Let go. Let go!

123
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,310
Let go! Let go!

124
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,600
- Stop it! Please!
- Let go!

125
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,000
I said I would die in front of you.
Why are you stopping me?

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,190
I abandoned my child so I'll end
my life. Why are you stopping me?

127
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,000
Why are you stopping me? Why?
Why are you stopping me? Why?

128
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,840
Please. Please stop.

129
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,720
I'm not educated and I have nothing.

130
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,000
There was no other way to
live so this is how I lived.

131
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,630
I thought there was no other way to live.

132
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,840
What am I supposed to do now?

133
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,440
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?

134
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,480
What do you want me to do?

135
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,600
Let's talk.

136
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,200
You did not keep your promise to not
tell the world about your identity.

137
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,510
I don't intend to abandon your mother.

138
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:19,440
We are fated to be together
whether we like it or not.

139
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,790
I thought of breaking
up with her many times.

140
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,000
I actually tried to get rid of her too.

141
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:35,030
Do you still plan on being married
to her even in this situation?

142
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:44,440
I'm sure you read it in the magazine.
She had feelings for my son.

143
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,030
She says she doesn't right now.

144
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,360
But I don't know if that's true.

145
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,630
Yet you still wanted to marry her?

146
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,960
Whether I hated her or thought
she was cowardly, I just...

147
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,510
had to keep her at my side.

148
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,510
I can't forgive her...

149
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,440
but I can love her.

150
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,510
Do you think this will end your
relationship with your mother?

151
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,320
I have no regrets and I don't care.

152
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,840
Most likely, it won't end.

153
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,720
Until one of you dies, it won't end.

154
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,320
I am also living a tough life
because of my own mother.

155
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,390
But a relationship between parent
and child cannot be easily ended.

156
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,910
Logically, you're angry
and you can't forgive her.

157
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,790
Emotionally, you've already
started to feel sorry for her.

158
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,200
Do you think she lived a grand
life after she abandoned you?

159
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,390
I'm not interested.

160
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,080
The truth is, she could not sleep
well without drinking or taking drugs.

161
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,840
She's been doing that for 19 years.

162
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,120
I know you had it rough but
her life was just as painful.

163
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,200
She's not the type of person
to feel that kind of pain.

164
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,750
Anyone can feel that.

165
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,240
Of course they might not
change even if they do feel it.

166
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,440
But they can feel it.

167
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,840
There is no doubt she was
in a lot of pain because of you.

168
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,750
And there will come a time when
you feel sorry for her one day.

169
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,360
You can't forgive her
but you can love her.

170
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,790
You will eventually feel that.

171
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,150
<i>Get him out of here.
Get him out of here.</i>

172
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,320
Get him out of here right now!
I don't know that person.

173
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,150
I don't have a son. What are you
doing? Get him out of here this instant!

174
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,960
Get him out of here!

175
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,270
<i>Do you really even know what
it's like to cry tears of blood?</i>

176
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,870
Of course I know!

177
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:06,200
Before I graduated from
high school, I sang at a bar.

178
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,440
I had no money or support.
I wanted to become a singer.

179
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,600
I got slapped around here
and there behind stage.

180
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,670
Do you know what I had to go through?

181
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,870
Are you curious about
what happened to me?

182
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,630
Should I tell you right now?

183
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,480
Do you want to hear it?

184
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,360
Do you know what
happened to your mother?

185
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,360
It's so bad that I don't even know
who your father is. Should I tell you?

186
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:27,150
<i>I, Yoo Ji Na, have become
the wife of a rich tycoon.</i>

187
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:32,720
<i>Look. Look if you have eyes.</i>

188
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,910
You have finally become my woman.

189
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,750
Look at the camera.
Smile please.

190
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,550
Okay, look at each other. Smile!

191
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,200
Grab her hand please. That's great.

192
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,470
<i>[Yoo Ji Na and Chairman Park's
Wedding Photo Shoot]</i>

193
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,720
The whole world has found out
that she abandoned her own child.

194
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,150
She ultimately became
a part of this family.

195
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,790
She wants to fight me
to the very end, that's what it is.

196
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,320
Father is determined to have
Lee Kyung Soo as his son.

197
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,240
He needs him, no matter what.

198
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,200
He needs him?

199
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,840
Hyun Joon and Hyun Sung
are alive and well.

200
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,790
Why would he need a child
who is not related to him by blood?

201
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,670
It's all because of you.

202
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,080
Pardon?

203
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,270
It would've been fine if you had
spilled it when I told you to.

204
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:49,080
But you thought you could ignore me
and go up against your father-in-law.

205
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,910
That's why you will forever be a fool.

206
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,960
Once a fool, always a fool.

207
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,080
<i>[Wedding Photo Shoot]</i>
She finally did it.

208
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,630
Goodness, the world is so unfair.

209
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,960
She killed an innocent person
and abandoned her own child.

210
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,720
It's like she's smirking
at the whole world.

211
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,480
She has become the lover of a tycoon.

212
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,110
So basically, there's
no need to live kindly.

213
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,270
It's the law of the jungle
to growl like a beast

214
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,270
so you don't have anything
taken away from you.

215
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:33,480
Seriously, people with lives
like us feel so small and dismal.

216
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,720
I don't know how to move forward.

217
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,720
There's one person who lost his child
all of a sudden and he looks so lost.

218
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,960
And here she is smiling
and married to a tycoon.

219
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,920
She's mocking us.

220
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,590
"You can die right now and
the world wouldn't care."

221
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,510
She's mocking us.

222
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,000
She's mocking us!

223
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,400
Goodness.

224
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,920
It's hot.
Why are you outside sitting?

225
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,790
Our Hae Soo. Our little girl.

226
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,110
Where did she go all of a sudden?

227
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,480
Hae Dang, where on earth did she go?

228
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,720
How long do you think I'll live?

229
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:01,000
How many years will l
live while I miss Hae Soo?

230
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,830
When I think like that,
I'm scared that I'm alive.

231
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,750
How are you feeling?

232
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,920
I'm better now.

233
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,310
How is your father?

234
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,160
He is still having a hard time.

235
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,270
You have to empty out the cafe soon.

236
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,550
Where do you plan on going?

237
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,270
Somewhere, I guess.

238
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,270
Hae Dang.

239
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,440
I'm sorry.

240
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:30,240
It's not like I haven't thought
about how lonely you will be.

241
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,310
You'll be in a deep
and dark place again.

242
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,110
I know it will be very
frustrating and lonely.

243
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,680
It's not like I haven't
thought about that.

244
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,070
Hae Dang.

245
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,030
But, I...

246
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,830
am not in a position to help you.

247
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,880
Please don't be so lonely.
Do this for my sake.

248
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,350
For my sake.

249
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,350
Wait.

250
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,680
Here. Take this to your father.

251
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,920
I got you a condolence envelope.

252
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,200
I knew you wouldn't
accept it so I kept it.

253
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,270
It's 100 million won.

254
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,510
Do you know now?

255
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,510
That Jung Hae Dang's life is fake?

256
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,510
I said I would make sure
your family lives well.

257
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,030
It would've been nice if you
had just listened to me.

258
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,720
You got involved without
knowing your place

259
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,960
and look what happened
to your innocent sister.

260
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,440
You still haven't
gotten your act together.

261
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,750
Look at you, staring at me
with such fury in your eyes.

262
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,240
What are you going to do about it?

263
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:46,790
I am deeply sad that Jung Hae Soo passed
away like that at such a young age.

264
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,440
However, nothing is free in this world.

265
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,590
Nothing is free in this world?

266
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,640
Are you saying my little sister died...

267
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,110
because we made
a living off of your songs?

268
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:09,590
You might feel better if
that's how you want to think.

269
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,070
Are you done talking?

270
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,510
What does a dead person know, anyway?

271
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:18,000
Whether you die at the age of 80 or 30...

272
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,880
There's no difference from
a dead person's perspective.

273
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,400
Because you don't know
anything if you're dead.

274
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,030
That's enough.

275
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,480
How do you feel?

276
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,240
To think you could
possibly be with my son...

277
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,400
Do you realize that now?

278
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,040
Do you realize how big of
a mistake it was to go against me?

279
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,350
My little sister is dead.

280
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,830
I know.

281
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,240
You can't stand to face my son, can you?

282
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,720
Because you can't stop thinking
of your little sister, right?

283
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,030
You'll probably think of your poor
little sister every time you see my son.

284
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:02,270
So... are you saying
that's good for you?

285
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,480
How could I actually say that?

286
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,350
How could I?

287
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,590
No matter what... I'm going
to become your daughter-in-law.

288
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,440
What?

289
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,400
If it's my fate to become
your daughter-in-law

290
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
then I'll accept it.

291
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,300
You have completely lost your mind.

292
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,110
I might become your
daughter-in-law and rival lover.

293
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,160
What?

294
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,680
Because in the end, the man you
wanted to love was Park Hyun Joon.

295
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,640
I'm going to become
your daughter-in-law.

296
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,310
I'm going to become Park Hyun Joon's
woman. The man you can't get over.

297
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,240
I will live happily
while he loves me.

298
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,310
You can live with the man you don't
love, who is 18 years older than you.

299
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,960
Watch how I live.

300
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,330
What?

301
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,110
You growl like an animal if
you can't have what you want.

302
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,750
When you see that I
have what you want...

303
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,680
You will probably go crazy.

304
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,510
I'm going to watch you slowly go crazy.

305
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,240
I am going to become
Park Hyun Joon's woman...

306
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,510
and become your
daughter-in-law no matter what.

307
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,030
- Ah yes, welcome.
- Hello.

308
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,960
Welcome.

309
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:47,000
Thank you so much for what
you did at Hae Soo's funeral.

310
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,720
I couldn't even thank
you properly at the time.

311
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,310
Well, we were all going
through a tough time.

312
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,640
How is Father doing?

313
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,790
Father, I'm here.

314
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,200
Goodness... welcome.

315
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,200
I know you're busy...
you didn't have to come.

316
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,240
Come out and eat.

317
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,400
You go ahead.

318
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,640
I won't eat if you don't eat.

319
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,640
I just don't feel like eating.

320
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,960
Yes, but your family
is worried about you.

321
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,310
Why don't you ladies eat with us?

322
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,400
We can eat later.
You guys can eat now.

323
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,240
Father, chew carefully and eat slowly.

324
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,750
Okay. Don't worry about it and eat.

325
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,480
Yes.

326
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,480
At least he's eating
now that you're here.

327
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,830
I should come every day.

328
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:52,110
Please do that. Come
every day for a while.

329
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,440
Should I get a room here temporarily?

330
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,720
We would be even more
thankful if you did that.

331
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,240
The whole house is so sad day and night.

332
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,400
I don't know what to do.

333
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:07,160
It's because we're
missing a family member.

334
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:13,070
Eat, drink, have fun, and
stay late before you leave.

335
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,420
He doesn't even drink lately.

336
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,880
I'll drink and talk with Father.
Should I just sleep over?

337
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,110
Yes, that would be great. The three
of us can sleep next to each other.

338
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,750
The three of you can drink until you're
drunk. Afterward, just go to sleep.

339
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,550
Tomorrow morning I'll make you guys
some hot pollack soup with bean sprouts.

340
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,440
What a perfect catch.
You were looking at the wrong guy.

341
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,240
Goodness, I can't believe
you almost got married.

342
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,640
To me, he doesn't look like
the son of a rich tycoon.

343
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,480
He's quite down to
earth, don't you think?

344
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,720
Being rich doesn't mean
he will look down on you.

345
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,240
He's so trustworthy and dependable.

346
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,960
- He's really likable.
- Geez.

347
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,400
It's at times like these,
a new person should come in

348
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,110
and help us forget the bad things.

349
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:12,640
Even sad goodbyes get
buried in your heart as time passes.

350
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:28,240
If you look carefully, there
are stars at night in Seoul.

351
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,920
Let's say her body was cremated.

352
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,790
But that sweet and kind soul of hers...

353
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:46,110
Where did it go?

354
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,440
Father.

355
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,400
Young souls that leave without
leaving their mark on the world...

356
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,590
They go up to heaven and
become angels next to God.

357
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,200
I'm sure you will see her again someday.

358
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,720
Thank you.

359
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,750
Oh please, it was nothing.

360
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,000
I have something to say to you.

361
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,240
I need to ask you one question.

362
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,640
What is it?

363
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,880
You said you want to
help me live my own life.

364
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,960
Does that still hold true?

365
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,640
Of course.

366
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,680
Then...

367
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,510
accept me as your woman.

368
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,680
If you want to help me live my own life

369
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,400
then make me your woman.

370
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,110
Hae Dang.

371
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:41,070
Make me your woman and protect me
so that no one can look down on me.

372
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,790
Make sure that no one
can harm my family again.

373
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,640
Hyun Joon.

374
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,750
Please make that happen.

375
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:59,510
Please... do that for me.

376
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,830
Hae Dang.

377
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,640
I promise to make it up to you.

378
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,350
Let me go if you love me.

379
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,680
I am deeply sorry. I mean it.

380
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,350
I am deeply sorry.

381
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,310
Then die.

382
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,070
Yoon Hee.

383
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,070
No. I didn't hear anything.
I'm not going to listen to you.

384
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,790
No! No! No!

385
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:02,000
I am going to proceed with
our wedding as planned.

386
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,590
I'll do that for you.

387
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,000
I will protect you and your family.
No one will look down on you guys.

388
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,160
Please become my woman.

389
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,240
Just one thing.

390
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,680
There is a woman I'm supposed to marry.

391
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,200
Ah, is that so?

392
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,440
Leave it to me.

393
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,680
Just be aware of it.

394
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,200
I'm sorry for that person...

395
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,480
but I don't have the luxury
to think about that right now.

396
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,720
You were always my woman.

397
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,680
And your family is already my family.

398
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,200
I don't need to hesitate
for even one second.

399
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,750
Thank you.

400
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,240
No, thank you.

401
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,590
I have one thing, too.

402
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,630
I need to tell you something.

403
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,590
What is it?

404
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,840
I'm using you.

405
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,320
You think I don't know that?

406
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,070
Use me.

407
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:36,550
Use me and get your
revenge on Yoo Ji Na.

408
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,550
I'm sorry.

409
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,760
You don't have to be sorry.

410
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,590
No matter what the reason,
I'm good as long as you're next to me.

411
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,670
Hyun Joon.

412
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:59,230
Let go of all your
burdens now and lean on me.

413
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,760
I will take care of everything.

414
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,960
I hear you have to empty out this place.

415
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,630
Yes.

416
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,190
Then, just come home.

417
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,960
Home?

418
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,920
I've become your father and the place
your mother and I live is your home now.

419
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,000
Where else would be your home?

420
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,150
They say you don't choose your family.

421
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,920
Fate decides that.

422
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,760
You don't have anywhere to go, anyway.

423
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,230
I know my late wife took care of you.

424
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,510
But she is already dead.

425
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:53,710
She was truly like a mother to me.

426
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,070
If that's the case,
please live as my son.

427
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,110
If she really thought
of you as her child

428
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:08,760
I'm sure she would've
wanted you to live as my son.

429
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,360
She was quite a warm-hearted person.

430
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,360
She was a person with
a lot of love to give.

431
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,550
To hate someone who gave birth to you...

432
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,000
that is a very painful burden.

433
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,880
Do you think she would want you
to live out the rest of your days

434
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,360
carrying that burden?

435
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:46,590
I know she would want you to forgive
your mother and live comfortably.

436
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,760
I know that without a doubt.

437
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,480
The other family members...

438
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,630
What do they think?

439
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:06,150
Honestly, I can't guarantee they
will welcome you with open arms.

440
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,400
But don't you think you
should try at least once...

441
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,230
to live in the same house as your mother?

442
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,840
Live together and decide if you
want to reconcile or cut all ties.

443
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,550
We have to live together at least once.

444
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,190
<i>The truth is...</i>

445
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,480
<i>she hasn't slept peacefully
without drinking or taking drugs.</i>

446
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,360
<i>She's been living
like that for 19 years.</i>

447
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:51,920
<i>It was just as tough for
her as it was for you.</i>

448
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,840
Ji Na's son will be
moving in this Saturday.

449
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,400
What?

450
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,070
Isn't it only natural for a parent and
child to live together under one roof?

451
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,760
I told him to stay at the other house.

452
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,960
I think it's best if you move
out after you get married.

453
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,320
Says who?

454
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,800
As the head of this household, I say so.

455
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,400
Why you little...

456
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:35,150
You can go to the police and have
them investigate me or testify.

457
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,920
You can do whatever you want.

458
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
What?

459
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,400
Send me to the police
or put me in handcuffs.

460
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,800
Do whatever you want.

461
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,000
You told me to get out of it, right?

462
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:57,920
Then go ahead and tie me
up tight so I can't get out.

463
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,030
You're going to fight me
to the very end, aren't you?

464
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,230
In the end, it's all about evidence.

465
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,920
You must have evidence to
prevent me from doing anything.

466
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,840
And I must have evidence so
there is a way for me to get out.

467
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:48,320
Dancing isn't difficult. Just listen
to the music and sway back and forth.

468
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,230
I bet I look ridiculous.

469
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,230
Not at all.

470
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,630
Good-looking people can
just sway back and forth

471
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,230
and it looks like they're dancing.

472
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,110
No way.

473
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,150
You're not so bad.

474
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,150
I think you're a natural.

475
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,800
I'm just swaying back and forth.

476
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,840
You are a musician so your
sense of rhythm is remarkable.

477
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:03,030
It's quite different from just sitting
and listening to the music, isn't it?

478
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,880
You changed your shampoo.

479
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,760
I spent some money.

480
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,710
I can hear the sound of your
breathing very close to me.

481
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,920
It's not uncomfortable, is it?

482
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,510
You smell so nice.

483
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,110
It's cheap skin lotion.

484
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,760
What do I look like?

485
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,360
I've never been curious until now.

486
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,960
Touch yourself.

487
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,440
Not by touch, but from
what other people see.

488
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,320
Why are you suddenly curious about that?

489
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,800
Why are you curious about it?

490
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,880
You're making fun of me
right now, aren't you?

491
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,920
Everyone celebrates their 100th day
anniversary or 1000th day anniversary.

492
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,880
They make lovely memories.

493
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:40,710
We've been so busy and I'm not
sure how long we have been dating.

494
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,630
So...

495
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,360
Here.

496
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,000
I guessed your size.
It fits you perfectly.

497
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,360
It's so pretty.

498
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,630
Put mine on me.

499
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,960
I know this may seem
like it's not a big deal...

500
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,300
but now that we're
actually doing this...

501
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:30,190
I feel so much closer to you.

502
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,840
Shall we make a toast?

503
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,590
Hae Dang. Hae Dang.

504
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:09,280
He must be leaving now.
I saw him putting his bags in the car.

505
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,550
You don't know when
you'll see him again.

506
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:14,400
Don't you think you should see him off?

507
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,880
Goodbye, Kyung Soo!

508
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,590
Goodbye, Kyung Soo.

509
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:03,840
Forget me and be at peace.
Forget me and be at peace.

510
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,670
Goodbye, Kyung Soo.

511
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,920
Goodbye.

512
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:30,630
Welcome.
It's been a long time, Sung Ha.

513
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,090
No, Kyung Soo.

514
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:35,550
Hello.

515
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,830
I'll have someone take
in your belongings.

516
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:39,960
Go inside and say hello to Grandmother.

517
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,700
Let's go inside.

518
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,750
Say hello, Kyung Soo.
This is Grandmother.

519
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,840
Hello.

520
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:08,780
Come inside for a moment.

521
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:19,010
I won't eat him. You just stay there.

522
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:32,870
Should I start calling
him "young master" now?

523
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,510
I got a new brother-in-law
all of a sudden.

524
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,710
This is not our first
time seeing each other

525
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,960
so there will be no need
for a long introduction.

526
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,160
I have several things I wanted to point
out. That's why I wanted to talk you.

527
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:55,520
In our house, you will end up being
used if you don't get the upper hand.

528
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,540
Even among family.

529
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:03,600
So you must choose very carefully whom
you will allow to take advantage of you.

530
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,940
And one more thing.

531
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,250
I am not the type of person
to nag or complain.

532
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:15,650
But if I tell you not to do
something, you must not do it.

533
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:17,850
Why?

534
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:21,090
I do not know how to forgive.

535
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:25,170
There are people like that in the world.
Do you understand?

536
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,660
I'll heed your words carefully.

537
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,180
Did you introduce yourself, Hyun Sung?

538
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,690
I'm Park Hyun Sung.

539
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,970
Why are you being formal
to your little brother?

540
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,390
I'm Lee Kyung Soo.

541
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,170
What about you?

542
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:44,930
I'm Park Hyun Joon.
What do you think?

543
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,850
What kind of introduction is that?

544
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,500
What do you mean, what do you think?

545
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,550
Lee Kyung Soo and I are one family now

546
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,460
and we're sitting across from
each other at the same table.

547
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:57,170
What do you think of this reality?

548
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,630
You two have met before?

549
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,770
It seems that way.

550
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:03,690
Do you know what you're up against?

551
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,180
I can't believe you came of your
own free will into this crazy family.

552
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,080
Park Hyun Joon.

553
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,160
You just worry about your future.

554
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,660
You're not in a position to tell
my son what to do with his life.

555
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,410
How dare you talk like that to
the eldest grandson of this house?

556
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,910
You forced your way into this family.

557
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:26,690
How could you say whatever
you want to the next in line?

558
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,890
Even so, you should warn him
to watch what he says to his mother.

559
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,700
Mother?

560
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,700
They're not that far apart in age.
You think watching what he says will do?

561
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,960
I can't believe you brought
someone of her ilk in here.

562
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:42,490
You've made the household
into a complete mess.

563
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:45,360
You expect me to teach
him how to behave again?

564
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:52,690
From now on, don't glare at him.

565
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,820
How dare you?

566
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:04,360
I will eat later.

567
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,300
Where are you going?

568
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,790
I thought you were quite
a decent guy in the beginning.

569
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:19,810
And I thought you were
a trustworthy person.

570
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:25,420
Seeing how this woman is your mother,
I understand why you hid the letter.

571
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,590
Because I am also someone else's son.

572
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,330
But how can you decide
to become my brother...

573
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,420
and come and sit at the same table as me?

574
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,510
You can leave if you don't like it.

575
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,960
The person who doesn't like it can leave.

576
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:58,080
Don't just treat my son
however you want in the future.

577
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,520
I will never forgive you.

578
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,830
Goodness, I'm scared.

579
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:05,370
Do it. Sure.

580
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,860
I'm sorry you couldn't eat.

581
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,220
Since you're my son now, I can
speak comfortably to you, right?

582
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,070
I will eat later.

583
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,500
Did you know that woman and
her son before they came in?

584
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,950
- Yes.
- How?

585
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,380
I didn't know he was that woman's son.

586
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,360
What kind of person is he?

587
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,660
He is Yoo Ji Na's son
but he's not like her.

588
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,900
Is that right?

589
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:01,260
She did give birth to him so he came
here because he can't keep ignoring her.

590
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,450
He's not so rude as to overthrow us.

591
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:09,060
Still, you never know
what a person is feeling.

592
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,190
Yoo Ji Na will probably persuade
him with everything she's got.

593
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,570
That's true.

594
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,280
Welcome.

595
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,280
Grandmother is taking a nap.

596
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,960
I'll have to show her later then.

597
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:27,430
I took pictures of
the furniture that I want.

598
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,260
Don't you see him standing here?

599
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,230
Where do you think you're going?

600
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,980
- I'm Hong Yoon Hee.
- I'm Lee Kyung Soo.

601
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,940
Do you want to hear me
call you "young master"?

602
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,990
You may call me whatever you want.

603
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:50,490
Absolutely not.
He is your little brother now.

604
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,230
You don't take after your mom.
You know your place.

605
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:57,240
What are you saying
in front of my child?

606
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,420
Why? Does it make you uncomfortable?

607
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:05,070
It's true that Yoo Ji Na
married Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

608
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,830
But she actually has
feelings for Park Hyun Joon.

609
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:11,200
Yoo Ji Na and I don't have
a very good relationship.

610
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,000
What?

611
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,970
I know you came in here
clinging onto your mom's skirt.

612
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,910
I get that it's uncomfortable and
you're walking on eggshells around here

613
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:22,410
but no one in this house respects her.

614
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:24,080
What are you talking about?

615
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,130
It's not like she got properly
married and had a child.

616
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,120
See?

617
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,210
We say whatever we want in front of her.

618
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,050
I'll see you again.

619
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:49,710
You'd better treat me
with some respect in front of him.

620
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:54,090
- Why?
- As women, it's too despicable.

621
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,410
She says it's despicable.

622
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:59,050
It's probably different
when she's alone.

623
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,840
I know, so why drag her child
into this? She has no fear.

624
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,720
Father, please give me
your blessing to marry Hae Dang.

625
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:23,710
It's so... unexpected.

626
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:26,680
What are you talking about?
What does it matter?

627
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,770
Go ahead.

628
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:31,680
Mom, you have no say in this.

629
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,250
That's not the problem right now.

630
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,740
At times like these, a new
person is needed in the family.

631
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,130
I like you, CEO Park.
I like you very much.

632
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,490
What are you doing?
Hurry up and answer him.

633
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:46,070
Hae Dang, what are your thoughts on this?

634
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,200
I'd like to share the rest
of my life with Hyun Joon.

635
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,110
That's perfect.
They both like each other.

636
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:00,080
Mother, please take it down a notch.

637
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,710
Of course, I like CEO Park.

638
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,840
But don't you think
another problem will arise

639
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,990
if you make such a sudden decision?

640
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:12,320
I don't think that really matters.

641
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:18,580
Are you confident about marrying
into that family and living there?

642
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,920
I plan on trusting Hyun Joon.

643
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,530
Father-in-law, just give
them your permission.

644
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,490
They were fated to be from the beginning.

645
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:37,870
They went around in circles for nothing.

646
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,220
No one will be able
to treat us with disrespect

647
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,420
if CEO Park becomes
a part of our family.

648
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,870
Absolutely.

649
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:48,890
I will never allow that to happen.

650
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:53,130
From now on, I will protect
Hae Dang and her family.

651
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,710
Look.

652
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,450
Thank you, Brother.

653
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:03,070
I couldn't do anything and I didn't
have the courage to face my family

654
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,840
after what happened
to my sister-in-law.

655
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:11,640
You are really trustworthy and
I thank you so much, Brother.

656
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:17,650
In any case, thank you.

657
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:22,860
Thank you for giving me
a daughter like Hae Dang to marry.

658
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,300
A tycoon is too much.

659
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:36,360
A family with just a couple
of buildings would've been so nice.

660
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,470
You just go and live there. A person's
family is just like any other family.

661
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,730
People live and eat there.

662
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,000
They'll have a family of their own soon.

663
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,920
She'll gain strength
with time and children.

664
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,660
She just needs to hold on until then.

665
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,830
They'll all run out
because they can't handle it.

666
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:54,060
She says she'll be patient
so what can anyone do?

667
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:57,530
When it comes to patience,
Hae Dang has it in spades.

668
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,740
Someone is going to
come here this Saturday.

669
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,110
Who?

670
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:11,720
I have someone I'd like to introduce.

671
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,980
- Who is it?
- You'll know when you see her.

672
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:19,020
What's the occasion? You hate
introducing people to our family.

673
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,370
Why did you invite a guest?

674
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:24,570
Just be aware of it.

675
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:32,070
Did one of his friends
from the States come?

676
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:33,640
I didn't hear anything.

677
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,650
We'll find out once we see his guest.

678
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,460
Call Yoon Hee too
since it's the weekend.

679
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,920
Yes, I understand.

680
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,660
Thank you for having courage.

681
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:55,970
It's something I'd
have to face eventually.

682
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,900
You look like a different
person with makeup on.

683
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,820
Is it awkward?

684
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:04,030
No. You look very pretty.

685
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:09,270
Welcome.

686
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:10,890
Hyun Joon's guest is coming?

687
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:12,250
That's what he says.

688
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:16,580
Is it a friend?
But why didn't he tell me?

689
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:38,940
Come in.

690
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,520
Say hello. This is my grandmother.

691
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:58,180
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Jung Hae Dang.

692
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,320
It's a woman?

693
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,350
Who are you?

694
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:05,300
This is Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

695
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,630
Hello.

696
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,440
Welcome.

697
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,650
I'm Park Hyun Sung.

698
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:21,000
I'm Go Na Kyung. Who are you?

699
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,310
She...

700
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,290
is the person I'm going to marry.

701
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,740
- Oh my, Yoon Hee!
- Yoon Hee! Yoon Hee!

702
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:38,430
911! 911! What are you doing? Call 911!

703
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,960
I'm okay. I'm okay.

704
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,940
You're okay? What are you guys doing?
Take her upstairs!

705
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,910
- Yes.
- Quickly.

706
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:01,580
Are you kidding?

707
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,720
I will say it again.

708
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,900
I am going to marry this woman.

709
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:15,430
Goodness.

710
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,990
Yoon Hee has finally fallen asleep.

711
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,590
What about Kyung Soo?

712
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,980
He says he will eat later.

713
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:46,000
So, what does your father do?

714
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,370
I will tell you later.

715
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,360
What does he do?

716
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,500
- The gas station...
- He owns gas stations?

717
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,450
How many gas stations does he own?

718
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:01,790
He gets paid an hourly wage
as a gas station attendant.

719
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,550
He does what?

720
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:07,890
Let's eat first and talk
about it while we drink tea.

721
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:11,140
It's uncomfortable as
it is and she can't eat.

722
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,570
Does it look like I
want to eat right now?

723
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,880
Go ahead and eat.

724
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,560
Yes.

725
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:24,980
What do you do, Miss Jung Hae Dang?

726
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,140
Do you do something?

727
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:32,000
She's a singer.

728
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,080
I've never heard or
seen a singer like her.

729
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,460
Do you know of all the singers?

730
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:41,050
I sing at a cabaret.

731
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,850
You sing where?

732
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:49,070
I am Yoo Ji Na's impersonator.

733
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,820
What is an impersonator?

734
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,190
An impersonator?

735
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:55,690
She dresses like her and acts like her.

736
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:58,490
Na Yoon Ah's impersonator,
Nuh Hoon Ah.

737
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,660
Hyun Sook's impersonator, Hun Soo.

738
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,830
What is your stage name?

739
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:09,210
It's Yoo Jui Na.

740
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:11,560
Yoo Jui Na?

741
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,900
The "jui" (cramp) you get
in your leg, that "jui"?

742
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,230
Yes.

743
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:19,930
Goodness.

744
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:21,770
Goodness, I can't believe this.

745
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:24,810
Goodness, my head. Goodness, my head.
Goodness, my head.

746
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:27,510
Is this family doomed?

747
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:30,880
I swear, it's one thing after another...

748
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,500
I'm not pleased with
the Yoo Ji Na sitting here.

749
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,520
You're not Yoo Ji Na, but Yoo Jui what?

750
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:43,860
What? Jui Na?
Goodness, what am I hearing?

751
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,090
Oh my goodness.

752
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:52,270
This all happened because your
unlucky self rolled in here.

753
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,430
- Take responsibility for it.
- Mother.

754
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,990
Why does she have to
be responsible for it?

755
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:01,380
It's her fault even if I fall!

756
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,130
She's unlucky.

757
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,970
I wanted to talk after we all ate.

758
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:13,950
But it seems no one is in
the mood to eat, so I'll speak now.

759
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,610
Hyun Joon tends to be reckless.

760
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:23,730
This rascal... has someone he
will be marrying in the summer.

761
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:28,030
It would've been nice if we had met
under different circumstances.

762
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,880
It's unfortunate.

763
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:33,350
Hae Dang, whatever this person says

764
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,780
let it go in one ear and out the other.

765
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,140
Don't worry about it, just eat.

766
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:40,670
When in the world are
you going to grow up?

767
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,840
I'm going to make this clear.

768
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:50,830
I did not bring her here today
for your permission or blessing.

769
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:55,230
I brought her here to let
you know who she is to me.

770
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:04,110
So from here on out, don't say
another word about my marriage.

771
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,010
Stand up, Hae Dang.

772
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,750
May I be excused?

773
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:16,610
Yes, go ahead and drink some tea.

774
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:26,670
Send her off before Yoon Hee wakes up.

775
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:29,710
Use any means necessary to send her away.

776
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:37,090
It would be nice if you
could rest in my room.

777
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:38,910
Would you like to drink
something at the bar?

778
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:44,500
I must be nervous.
I'd like to get some fresh air.

779
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:23,850
