(Episode 8)

3
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:11,851
(Korean Pavilion Nightclub)

4
00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:15,398
Are you done?

5
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:19,589
Did you really watch me until the end?

6
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:21,562
This is the worst manual labor.

7
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:25,327
Now I understand why you drank raw
egg mixed in seafood noodle soup.

8
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,739
Don't talk to me. I don't
have the energy to answer.

9
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:31,592
I'm hungry. Let's go eat something.

10
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,820
Did you find the reason you wanted
to sign a contract with me?

11
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:42,236
Well, you're good on stage. You'll do
anything to not make it boring up there.

12
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:44,453
Is that an insult or a compliment?

13
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:46,920
Hurry up and change so that we can leave.

14
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,633
Here are your noodles.

15
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:52,860
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:55,478
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

17
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:03,953
It's my first time eating
at a tented vendor.

18
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:12,007
It's more delicious than
I thought it would be.

19
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,648
Is this really your first time?

20
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:17,445
The people I meet don't
come to places like this.

21
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,371
Didn't you go to school?

22
00:01:21,727 --> 00:01:24,164
I went to school in America ever
since I was in high school.

23
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:28,523
You said your father sells
clothes in the market.

24
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:30,726
Oh, that's right. I did say that.

25
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:35,140
I used to be well-off before, but
my father went completely bankrupt.

26
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:40,770
If you went bankrupt, you
should save money now.

27
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:49,116
I'm the style to boast like I'm rich
when I don't even have a single penny.

28
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:51,383
Good for you.

29
00:01:52,336 --> 00:01:53,465
Just eat your noodles.

30
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,546
Eat noodles at a tented vendor and finish
it off with vending machine coffee.

31
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:08,771
It's not bad at all.

32
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:16,711
You told me to start living
my own life now, didn't you?

33
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,705
How will I be able to live my own life?

34
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,585
Are you asking me that?

35
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,510
There must have been
something you wanted to do.

36
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,460
You can start a new life with
the dream of becoming a singer.

37
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,546
I think it's too late.

38
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:39,240
Nowadays, the earliest you
should become a singer is at

39
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:41,688
the age of 18, and the latest
is at the age of 29. Right?

40
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:47,606
On top of that, there's a rumor that
imitator singers can't sing other songs.

41
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,033
- Why not?
- Out of the successful imitator singers

42
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:55,393
I know, there are a few who have
released their own songs.

43
00:02:56,937 --> 00:03:02,156
But not one of them have succeeded.

44
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,375
Really?

45
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:10,609
They're already become immobilized.
It shows in whatever they do.

46
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,429
At first, they made a huge effort to
become the same as the real ones,

47
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:21,592
but when they try to become different
later on, they can never do so.

48
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,107
So there's that.

49
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:26,510
There's only an empty shell left.

50
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:30,777
Then you just become waste.

51
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:37,426
And yet, you heard such harsh
words from your sisters.

52
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:45,382
Should we go somewhere and have a drink?

53
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:48,420
A drink? At this hour?

54
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:51,195
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

55
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:52,523
Drink up!

56
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:57,104
- Have you come to a place like this before?
- Of course I have.

57
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,960
You're not even a wealthy successor.
Stop being so dramatic.

58
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:12,681
I used my card to pay for this suit with
12 monthly payments, so I can't stain it.

59
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:17,216
Ma'am, please clean this table up!

60
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:22,144
- Please give us pork neck
and soju! Please give us the soju first!
- Sure.

61
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,578
Aren't you going to bed?

62
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:48,562
It's been way past the time Hae-dang
should be home, but she's not here yet.

63
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:54,726
- Would you like a drink?
- No.

64
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:02,461
I'm sorry, dad.

65
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:04,525
You don't have to be sorry to me.

66
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:09,015
I understand this is your life
that you can only live once,

67
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:13,273
but the same goes for your sister.

68
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:17,906
I know I was wrong.

69
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:21,294
You're disappointed in me, aren't you?

70
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm not disappointed. I'm worried.

71
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:31,507
With that kind of impatience, I wonder
what you will be able to do in this world.

72
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:38,117
The same goes for Hae-jin who
can't stand her mother-in-law.

73
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:46,389
When Hae-dang decided to go
into the world to make money to

74
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:51,126
take care of you guys, she was
younger than Hae-soo's age.

75
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,953
How could you have done this
without discussing with us first?

76
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:00,390
Where are you going?

77
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:04,775
I feel so frustrated, so I'm
going out for some fresh air.

78
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,984
Didn't you have a chance to get married?

79
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:20,265
Why are you curious about that?

80
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:22,562
I was just wondering if
you got more tied to your

81
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:24,898
family because you didn't
have anyone to marry.

82
00:06:25,258 --> 00:06:29,023
Do you know how old I am? Of
course I had someone to marry.

83
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:30,727
You did?

84
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,359
Yes, I did.

85
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,922
Then you should have just married him.

86
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:47,069
He cheated on me and ran away.

87
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,960
For ten years, I thought
of him as my husband.

88
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:14,864
As your husband?

89
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:19,364
We couldn't get married, and
we couldn't live together

90
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,980
either because of my family,
but he was like my husband.

91
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:31,750
Before he left, he asked me
to marry him one last time.

92
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,195
Then you should have done it.

93
00:07:36,327 --> 00:07:38,843
Were you unable to marry him
because of your family situation?

94
00:07:39,898 --> 00:07:43,507
I let him go so that he
can at least live well.

95
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:49,679
When you've dated him for ten years?
You're a heartless woman.

96
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:54,046
Do you think I did that
because I'm heartless?

97
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:56,035
How can he go just because
you told him to go?

98
00:07:57,422 --> 00:08:01,796
I let him go so that he
can live well, but...

99
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:06,727
he died.

100
00:08:10,805 --> 00:08:14,642
You said you were curious why I don't want
anything to do with Yoo Ji-na, didn't you?

101
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,898
Was the other woman Yoo Ji-na?

102
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,171
She told me to think of it as
repaying her and give him to her.

103
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:29,596
"Think of it as repaying her?"

104
00:08:32,507 --> 00:08:34,492
I live off of her songs.

105
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:38,453
Yet, you still sing her songs?

106
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:42,008
Don't you have any pride?

107
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:48,078
This is the destiny I must
accept in this life...

108
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,656
although there probably won't
be a next life either.

109
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:05,093
What the heck?

110
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:09,880
Get a hold of yourself. If your
father sees you, he'll be worried.

111
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:16,523
How the heck did I end up
getting drunk with you?

112
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,585
Beats me.

113
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:24,171
You're actually very annoying.

114
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:29,094
How can you say that to someone who
bought you drinks and is taking you home?

115
00:09:30,758 --> 00:09:33,015
- The look in your eyes.
- The look in my eyes?

116
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:36,062
You pity me, don't you?

117
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,109
That's why you keep
sticking to me, don't you?

118
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,248
Walk straight, will you?

119
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:48,819
- Gosh! I'm offended! I'm displeased!
- What?

120
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:50,711
That's why...

121
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:52,976
we need to go for a third round.

122
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:56,492
- Let's go for a third round!
- How can we go for a third round at this hour?

123
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:59,064
- It's going to be morning soon.
- Let's go.

124
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,089
Hae-dang!

125
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:03,344
Dad...

126
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:06,654
Why did you come out?

127
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:11,084
I should've stopped her, but she became
drunk at the last shot. I'm sorry, sir.

128
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,109
No need to be. Thank you.

129
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,787
Welcome home, my baby.

130
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,312
Dad...

131
00:10:22,313 --> 00:10:23,547
My dad...

132
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:26,078
My poor dad...

133
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:27,703
Yes, yes.

134
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:31,186
Why did you drink so much?

135
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:33,922
Dad...

136
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:36,531
My poor baby.

137
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:39,796
Let's go home.

138
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:42,493
Let's go home.

139
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,034
I'm sorry. Let's go.

140
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,359
Hae-dang!

141
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:03,281
Brat.

142
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,430
Hae-dang.

143
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:10,679
Why did you drink so much?

144
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:12,093
I'm fine.

145
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,976
I'm fine. Don't worry.

146
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:18,945
I'm completely fine.

147
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:22,523
I'm completely fine.

148
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,797
Hae-dang, I'm sorry.

149
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:35,648
I didn't know you were so upset like this.

150
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:39,601
Just scold me instead!

151
00:11:41,523 --> 00:11:43,820
Just scold me instead!

152
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:25,570
Oh! What are you doing here? Come in.

153
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:31,007
When I don't have any schedule,
I have nothing to do, and

154
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:34,515
I'm bored all day. Come by often
for tea and talk with me.

155
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,851
Who told you to ask my
father for a favor for me?

156
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:42,304
Oh, that.

157
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:47,257
Did you come here to say thank you?

158
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:51,882
How can you say thank you
with such a frightening face?

159
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,633
Let me make myself clear.

160
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,523
Don't lay a finger on my life.

161
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:58,250
I understand you.

162
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:04,718
Even if I was you, I would've
done the same thing to my father.

163
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:11,031
If I was you, I wouldn't even
come near someone like my father.

164
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,617
I understand your pain.

165
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,703
You understand my pain, so
what are you going to do next?

166
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:19,695
I won't do anything to harm you.

167
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:21,640
Don't think you're so great.

168
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,484
That's a bit harsh.

169
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:34,463
I was just trying to help
you because I pitied you.

170
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:39,671
What will you demand from me later on while
telling me to think of it as repaying you?

171
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,700
You tell someone who imitates
your singing to make a

172
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:47,640
living to think of it as
repaying you and steal her man?

173
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:54,328
Did you hear that from Hae-dang?

174
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,664
If that's not third-class,
I don't know what is.

175
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:01,540
You help them when you feel like it, and at

176
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:04,072
the most crucial moment, you stomp on them.

177
00:14:04,758 --> 00:14:09,664
That's the worst thing anyone can do because
it feels like you've been played with.

178
00:14:10,938 --> 00:14:12,653
Did you come here to say that?

179
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:14,657
Let me make myself clear.

180
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:20,523
Don't bring your dirty hand near my
life while pretending to help me out.

181
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:37,434
Why are you coming out of there?

182
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:41,303
I asked you. What did you go there for?

183
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:44,195
Why does it matter where I
go with my own two feet?

184
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:49,709
While mom was alone in the villa dying from
a disease, you were chasing that woman

185
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:52,544
around with a necklace that was worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.

186
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:57,742
Then you bring her home, as if you
were waiting for this exact moment?

187
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,014
Mr. Park Sung-hwan, who doesn't
care about his wife or children,

188
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:06,664
you're about to lose face in your
latter years because of one mere woman.

189
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:09,086
What do you mean?

190
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,961
She told me to visit her
at the annex often.

191
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,687
- Are you going to work?
- Yes.

192
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:35,265
When will your house be
done with the repairs?

193
00:15:35,492 --> 00:15:40,593
Oh, that house? I'm going
to put it on lease again.

194
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,335
- Lease it?
- It's so far that it's a problem
for me to go to broadcast stations.

195
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:49,226
Truthfully, I had bought it
to live there when I retire.

196
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:54,562
Then I'll arrange a house for you
near the broadcast stations.

197
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:58,091
Even if I have to pour
in loads of money for

198
00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,237
your new home, I'll
prepare it, so get ready.

199
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,153
- I don't want to.
- You don't?

200
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:06,406
Can't I just stay here a bit longer?

201
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,037
If I start to live alone again, I
won't be able to eat properly.

202
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:16,234
What if I have to start taking
my medication at night again?

203
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:20,414
Do you really not want to leave this
place because you're worried about that?

204
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:25,851
The weather is nice.

205
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:29,642
I guess spring is really on its way.

206
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:01,710
Sweetie, what are you doing?

207
00:17:02,383 --> 00:17:04,179
I'm washing Bong-soo's clothes.

208
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,640
From now on, I'm going to wash his
undergarments separately from mine.

209
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:09,609
It's too dirty that I
can't wash them together.

210
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:15,023
So you're using tongs because you
don't even want to touch them?

211
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:20,811
His undergarments aren't
trash, so how can you

212
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,578
use tongs to pick up trash to pick them up?

213
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:34,851
My goodness.

214
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:43,301
"When the love ends,

215
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:49,193
the world also comes to an end.

216
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,717
For me..."

217
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,414
What's this sound?

218
00:17:58,102 --> 00:17:59,250
Isn't she singing?

219
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:02,562
I'm really going to lose my mind.

220
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,998
"There's one thing I don't understand."

221
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:18,529
Still, to love someone

222
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:25,189
It seems like such a lonely thing."

223
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:27,859
Hey... sweetie...

224
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:30,703
Yes, mother.

225
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:34,085
Why are you singing when
you don't usually sing?

226
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,804
It just automatically came out of mouth.

227
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:40,507
Do those lyrics sink deep into your heart?

228
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:43,578
I feel like the song is made just for me.

229
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:48,460
Sweetie, solace your heart.

230
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:53,601
You must solace your heart. How
could you keep being absentminded?

231
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:58,904
Mother, isn't life full of vain?

232
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:03,696
What's so vain? You have a son
who's the apple of your eye.

233
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:06,561
You have a husband who only loves you, too.

234
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:12,681
He does whatever he wants
and then acts all friendly

235
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:15,626
with me. That's even
more disgusting to see.

236
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,811
What will you do if your husband
is too disgusting to see?

237
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:27,295
"Will I be able to meet someone else...

238
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:37,537
and fall in love again?

239
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:45,170
Because I don't think that I can."

240
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,873
Please take a photo with us!

241
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:56,521
- One, two, three.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?

242
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:58,357
Please go that way.

243
00:19:58,624 --> 00:20:00,865
- Hello, Ji-na.
- Hello.

244
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,487
Can I take a picture with you?

245
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,412
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

246
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:18,146
Hello, father.

247
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:21,694
Yes.

248
00:20:23,177 --> 00:20:24,577
Yes. I'll be waiting.

249
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:38,342
Did you wait long? My meeting went
on for longer than I thought.

250
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,100
- It's fine. Please have a seat.
- Okay.

251
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:48,602
What brings you here?

252
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:54,350
Is there a problem between
you and Hyun-joon?

253
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:59,686
You two must prepare for marriage.

254
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:02,725
I don't think Hyun-joon has
the intention of rushing it.

255
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:05,069
Why not?

256
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:09,293
Why would you walk on eggshells around him?

257
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,401
Tell your parents to set
a date for the wedding.

258
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:17,396
Father, I actually have
something to tell you.

259
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:20,639
Be comfortable, and tell me.

260
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:24,818
- My family worries about Hyun-joon a lot.
- Why?

261
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:29,170
They're not happy about him roaming
outside doing an entertainment company.

262
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:34,404
I understand what you mean.

263
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:51,092
I'll give you the planning office.

264
00:21:57,975 --> 00:21:59,514
Are you saying it's too excessive?

265
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:04,553
- Then what about Hyun-sung?
- I'll move him somewhere else.

266
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:10,811
Prepare some food. Dinner wasn't enough.

267
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:12,874
Yes, father.

268
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,553
While you're at it, be more generous.

269
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:30,322
Give me the future strategy office.

270
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:34,930
Then I'll come into the company.

271
00:22:36,092 --> 00:22:37,382
The future strategy office?

272
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:42,418
Bring back the executive director Kim Ji-hoon
and vice-president Oh Jin-sung also.

273
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,771
They already left the company,
so why bring them back now?

274
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,271
They were the people my late
grandfather had raised.

275
00:22:50,795 --> 00:22:54,201
You always thought of them as
your rivals when my grandfather

276
00:22:54,226 --> 00:22:57,685
was alive, and as soon as he
passed away, you fired them first.

277
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:01,558
You know that very well, and yet,
you want me to call them back?

278
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:06,114
What's going on through that mind of yours?

279
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:09,988
Why won't you even allow Hyun-sung
near the future strategy office?

280
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:14,193
Even if he's my son, I can't trust him yet.

281
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,871
Because you're afraid, just like
how you pushed your father-in-law

282
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:22,072
out of that seat, your son
will push you out of there?

283
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:27,444
So you do realize you've done
something you shouldn't have,

284
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:30,877
seeing that you can't
even trust your own sons.

285
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:35,155
Why are you living that way?

286
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:40,936
Because, unlike you, I wasn't
born into a rich family.

287
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,295
Future strategy office? Even
a passing dog would laugh.

288
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:53,639
The deal is off the table.

289
00:23:54,522 --> 00:23:55,522
Arrogant punk.

290
00:23:56,608 --> 00:24:00,529
Who pushed you to make that deal?

291
00:24:02,264 --> 00:24:03,264
What?

292
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:06,271
Do you remember how I told you
that was my last request?

293
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:09,576
You said you weren't touched.

294
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:16,357
There will be a day when you
say your last request to me.

295
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,511
Don't be presumptuous.

296
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:21,412
If you don't want to make a
last request to me, then

297
00:24:21,998 --> 00:24:24,553
drag Yoo Ji-na out of this
house with your own hands.

298
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:28,482
- I can't do that.
- We'll see if you really can't.

299
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:31,732
Stop right there.

300
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:34,509
I'm not done talking yet.

301
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:43,011
I really had no idea you
would bring my greatest ally

302
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:47,381
into this house yourself.

303
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:49,561
Don't be delusional.

304
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:56,787
She's just pitying you for acting
immature for the loss of your mom.

305
00:24:57,116 --> 00:25:00,943
That's why she's my greatest ally.
Or am I missing something here?

306
00:25:02,772 --> 00:25:04,804
Although I have a useless
life, there is one thing

307
00:25:05,823 --> 00:25:08,374
that I'm good at because I'm just like you.

308
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,850
Are you done talking?

309
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:13,334
I was talking about exercising.

310
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:18,998
What on earth were you imagining? It
doesn't matter how uneasy you are.

311
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:38,404
I prepared porridge, since
you'll be sleeping soon.

312
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:39,991
Well done.

313
00:25:40,897 --> 00:25:46,193
Father, are you going to call
Hyun-joon to the planning office?

314
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,288
Then Hyun-sung would be upset.

315
00:25:51,772 --> 00:25:54,909
It's work. It's nothing that
you should be concerned about.

316
00:25:55,444 --> 00:25:59,277
I apologize for saying this, but it's
rather difficult to take care of

317
00:25:59,302 --> 00:26:02,972
Yoo Ji-na while being
careful around grandmother.

318
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:05,039
I'm grateful for that.

319
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,015
When I suggested you bring Yoo Ji-na to
the annex, I only thought of your sake,

320
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:13,812
but grandmother is making
me walk on eggshells.

321
00:26:14,343 --> 00:26:15,343
Sweetie.

322
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:16,929
Yes, father.

323
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:18,632
I would like to eat in silence.

324
00:26:19,836 --> 00:26:20,836
I apologize.

325
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,090
I'll be going now.

326
00:26:29,593 --> 00:26:31,296
Hello, grandmother.

327
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,819
- Bring tea to my room.
- Okay.

328
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:04,063
I prepared Chinese quince tea.

329
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:11,937
I'll be going out now to
clean up father's dishes.

330
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
Stay down.

331
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:16,444
Is there something you
would like to tell me?

332
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:36,273
Why are you so pale?

333
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,720
I think she heard me.

334
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Who heard what?

335
00:27:44,858 --> 00:27:50,607
I was the one who first suggested your
father bring Yoo Ji-na to the annex.

336
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:55,444
- What?
- I think the old hag heard that.

337
00:27:58,257 --> 00:27:59,999
Why did you do such a fearless thing?

338
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:04,554
I should've known ever since
you mentioned a total war.

339
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:08,695
Then what was I supposed to do? I can't
even have your child. It looked like I

340
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,353
was about to be kicked out after serving
all the bragging women in this house.

341
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:14,406
Goodness.

342
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,273
Your father told Hyun-joon to
come into the planning office.

343
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:21,246
- He did?
- I heard him myself.

344
00:28:24,843 --> 00:28:27,269
He used you for all the dirty
work so far, and then at the

345
00:28:27,294 --> 00:28:29,843
most crucial moment, he's giving
everything to his eldest son.

346
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:31,881
How could he do such a thing?

347
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:34,554
- What did Hyun-joon say?
- I couldn't hear that.

348
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,648
I never knew your father would do that.

349
00:28:39,304 --> 00:28:41,522
How could you trust him in the first place?

350
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:44,657
He was always like that.

351
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:48,312
He uses you as if he'll have
your back anytime, but when the

352
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:52,129
situation changes, he'll ignore
you like nothing happened.

353
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,473
That's why I told you to know your place.

354
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:58,973
Please don't say such a thing to me!

355
00:29:01,223 --> 00:29:02,301
What will you do now?

356
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,621
Yoo Ji-na, you dare ignored my words?

357
00:29:16,848 --> 00:29:17,915
Is that a snack?

358
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:26,926
I have something to inquire you.

359
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:28,465
"Inquire?"

360
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,137
Since you speak like that, it seems
like I became your mother-in-law.

361
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,051
Then what should I do to
make you feel comfortable?

362
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:39,472
Just comfortably call me
"Ji-na," and when we talk,

363
00:29:39,497 --> 00:29:43,169
please don't speak like we're
filming a historical drama.

364
00:29:44,537 --> 00:29:45,537
Should I?

365
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:53,021
Then Ji-na, did you tell my father-in-law
to bring Hyun-joon to the planning office?

366
00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:55,133
- Planning office?
- Yes.

367
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:58,903
How would I know that that is?

368
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:04,036
All I told him was to get
along with his eldest son.

369
00:30:05,795 --> 00:30:07,302
I thought I told you not to do that.

370
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:09,764
"I thought I told you?"

371
00:30:13,865 --> 00:30:16,183
I told you to speak comfortably,
but since you suddenly

372
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:18,189
regarded me so casually,
I'm getting flustered.

373
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:23,528
It's wise for you to not do what
I tell you not to do, Ji-na.

374
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:34,661
You're just old. You're not
the smart style at all.

375
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,459
Is that so?

376
00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:39,068
Let me make myself clear.

377
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:46,009
There's no one in this house you can
treat so carelessly, including me.

378
00:30:58,795 --> 00:30:59,997
This is delicious.

379
00:31:01,584 --> 00:31:05,013
If you want to fulfill your goal before
my father-in-law's love cooks for you,

380
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:08,164
you must refrain from acting so rashly.

381
00:31:09,943 --> 00:31:11,200
What's my goal?

382
00:31:11,646 --> 00:31:15,943
To stay in this house and get
closer to Park Hyun-joon.

383
00:31:19,497 --> 00:31:24,885
Do you now realize there isn't anyone you
can treat carelessly in this family, Ji-na?

384
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:35,575
How dare the likes of you think I'm easy?

385
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:49,677
I heard your father called you to the
planning office, but you had rejected him.

386
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:52,739
Isn't the planning office
excessive for you?

387
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,153
Do you think he'll give me
such a position for free?

388
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:56,943
What do you mean?

389
00:31:58,107 --> 00:32:00,794
He wants me to accept Yoo Ji-na.

390
00:32:01,263 --> 00:32:03,068
- Then accept her.
- What?

391
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:05,083
Is that more important than our marriage?

392
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,497
You want me to easily accept her?

393
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,622
- What's hard about that?
- And yet, you say you love me?

394
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:15,560
I told you I'm doing
this because I love you.

395
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:19,066
I don't want that kind of love.

396
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,802
I refuse love that suffocates me.

397
00:32:24,982 --> 00:32:28,568
I'd rather not get married than
marry a woman who suffocates me.

398
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,692
Do you have another woman?

399
00:32:33,857 --> 00:32:37,302
- Not yet.
- Not... yet?

400
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:41,349
Hyun-joon.

401
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,490
Kyung-soo...

402
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,630
Welcome. Sit anywhere you like.

403
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:44,045
Kyung-soo.

404
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:00,209
Are you...

405
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:03,529
Hae-dang?

406
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:07,693
What happened?

407
00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:33,412
You look...

408
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,638
just the way I imagined you would.

409
00:34:41,341 --> 00:34:46,239
You're the first one I wanted
to see after the surgery.

410
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:49,715
Did you get the surgery?

411
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,458
I really missed you.

412
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:56,631
Kyung-soo.

413
00:35:14,052 --> 00:35:15,583
Have you been well?

414
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,447
I've been waiting a long
time for a cornea donor,

415
00:35:43,162 --> 00:35:45,411
but I never thought the
opportunity would come to me.

416
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,036
So you had become blind
after a car accident.

417
00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:52,778
Fortunately, I'm not experiencing a rejection,
so my vision is slowly getting better.

418
00:35:54,115 --> 00:35:57,622
Of course, I have a long way to go, but I
don't think there will be any problems.

419
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:01,825
I'm very happy for you.

420
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:10,654
- Can I touch your face?
- My face?

421
00:36:27,193 --> 00:36:28,326
It really is you.

422
00:36:30,326 --> 00:36:31,739
The one I had missed so much.

423
00:36:41,317 --> 00:36:43,333
You had such beautiful eyes.

424
00:36:45,216 --> 00:36:48,949
They're much more bigger and beautiful
than I had imagined them to be.

425
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:52,560
I missed you.

426
00:36:55,435 --> 00:36:58,716
You came back.

427
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:32,373
(Choi Kyung-ae)

428
00:38:41,662 --> 00:38:45,724
If I somehow end up leaving
this world, please give

429
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:49,420
the enclosed envelope to
my son Park Hyun-joon.

430
00:38:50,365 --> 00:38:52,652
No matter what happens, you
must give it to him yourself.

431
00:39:02,513 --> 00:39:06,208
- Why are you coming home now?
- I had a drink with my co-workers.

432
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:11,286
- Come here for a moment.
- Why?

433
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:15,427
From now on, wear this.

434
00:39:17,615 --> 00:39:19,747
- What's this?
- Open it if you're so curious.

435
00:39:25,943 --> 00:39:29,246
Gosh. I can't wear this. It's suffocating.

436
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:31,318
You must bear with it even
though it's suffocating.

437
00:39:31,343 --> 00:39:33,833
These are for young boys!
Just look at this!

438
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:37,130
It's not the time for you to
complain about that right now.

439
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:38,155
Gosh.

440
00:39:39,474 --> 00:39:45,255
Mom, I ate dinner, but why am I hungry?
Make me ramen.

441
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:50,200
Is eating all you think about when
you can't even earn your keep?

442
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:54,778
- Forget it then.
- Take this with you!

443
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:58,364
Gosh! How do you expect me to wear this?

444
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,131
Why is this so tight?

445
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:11,177
Did you wash?

446
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:13,685
Can't you tell?

447
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:17,184
Did you wash properly? Did you just
spray yourself with water again?

448
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,599
Check the smell then. Here.
Don't I smell like soap?

449
00:40:25,527 --> 00:40:32,307
How could you smell like an old man
even when you're not forty yet?

450
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:35,110
I don't smell like that. I smell fine.

451
00:40:38,154 --> 00:40:39,443
What are you looking for?

452
00:40:40,051 --> 00:40:41,051
Is it this?

453
00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:45,429
Yes. This is cologne.

454
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:49,068
Goodness!

455
00:40:50,177 --> 00:40:52,232
What are you doing right now?

456
00:40:53,013 --> 00:40:55,227
Your wife doesn't like
you because you smell!

457
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,841
How could you spray cologne
like it's mosquito repellent?

458
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,051
- I had something to tell him. Good night.
- Good night.

459
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:22,739
- What's this smell? My head hurts.
Did you spray cologne?
- N-No...

460
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:34,724
Are you going to sleep in
Hoon's room tonight, too?

461
00:41:36,818 --> 00:41:37,880
Go away!

462
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:40,841
Gosh! Why did you put on so much cologne?

463
00:41:44,716 --> 00:41:49,357
Honey, I love you.

464
00:41:50,443 --> 00:41:52,286
You what?

465
00:41:53,615 --> 00:41:57,060
I said I love you.

466
00:41:58,052 --> 00:41:59,052
Say it again.

467
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:05,341
Yes, well, I love you, Jung Hae-jin...

468
00:42:13,051 --> 00:42:19,885
Are you teasing me? How dare you say
you love me. Am I that easy to you?

469
00:42:19,982 --> 00:42:25,310
No, no, no. I'm really sorry.

470
00:42:25,763 --> 00:42:29,130
I dare you to say such nonsense again.

471
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:39,989
What a temper!

472
00:42:41,396 --> 00:42:43,677
I won't freaking love you! I won't!

473
00:42:44,638 --> 00:42:47,060
My goodness.

474
00:42:49,279 --> 00:42:52,357
Hey, she's taking her pajamas
and going into that room again.

475
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:56,083
- Do something.
- What can I do?

476
00:42:56,709 --> 00:43:01,285
I said one thing, and she got angry.
She was glaring wildly at me.

477
00:43:02,823 --> 00:43:05,107
- What did you say to her?
- That I love her.

478
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:09,364
- What did she say?
- That if I say nonsense
like that again, she'll kill me.

479
00:43:10,396 --> 00:43:11,463
She'll kill you?

480
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:16,393
How did you get into this mess?

481
00:43:17,037 --> 00:43:20,372
You said you love your wife, and all she
says is that you're saying nonsense!

482
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:25,841
I don't know! Do you think I care?
I feel comfortable sleeping alone!

483
00:43:26,076 --> 00:43:29,310
Already? How could you
feel comfortable already?

484
00:43:29,584 --> 00:43:32,962
- Stop it, and just get out.
- How old are you? How can

485
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:36,002
you already feel comfortable
about sleeping alone?

486
00:43:36,027 --> 00:43:37,427
I can't control that!

487
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:44,177
You fool! What did you do
with all the food you ate?

488
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,982
You need to get hit by me, too!

489
00:44:21,795 --> 00:44:23,896
Mom! Mom! Mom!

490
00:44:25,787 --> 00:44:28,950
Give me my life back. Give me my life back!

491
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,607
What's this? You scared me.

492
00:44:34,568 --> 00:44:37,083
You said you would put your
life on the stake and love me.

493
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:41,403
You said you would kill me if I
said I loved you one more time.

494
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:45,497
Every night, you would cry and
whine in front of my house!

495
00:44:46,396 --> 00:44:48,286
You said you would die
if I didn't marry you!

496
00:44:48,802 --> 00:44:52,114
You put on all kinds of show
on the rooftop of the school!

497
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,989
I got it, so please let me sleep.

498
00:44:57,014 --> 00:45:01,238
Honey, all I want to do is get some sleep.

499
00:45:01,263 --> 00:45:04,224
I'm so angry that I'm
about to lose my mind.

500
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,911
Will the world fall apart if you
don't get some sleep? Will it?

501
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:11,942
- How should I give you your life back?
- What?

502
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:15,943
So how do I give you your life back?

503
00:45:15,968 --> 00:45:18,318
How can you say that?

504
00:45:19,474 --> 00:45:21,982
If I say something, you throw
a fit because I talked.

505
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:25,823
If I keep my mouth shut, you throw
a fit because I kept silent.

506
00:45:26,677 --> 00:45:30,466
Gosh! Fine! Do whatever you want!

507
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,380
I'm so sleepy.

508
00:45:41,568 --> 00:45:43,955
Do you think I wasted my nights studying so

509
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,530
that I could be a
valedictorian in high school?

510
00:45:47,755 --> 00:45:51,303
Girls who weren't as smart
and pretty as me brag

511
00:45:51,328 --> 00:45:54,802
about their husbands who
are doctors and judges.

512
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:58,108
What's wrong with me?

513
00:45:59,668 --> 00:46:03,528
Why me? Why? Why?

514
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:17,060
- Can you sleep right now?
- Yes, I can.

515
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:31,880
Mom. Mom.

516
00:46:35,685 --> 00:46:37,302
That little punk!

517
00:46:53,974 --> 00:46:56,224
How can you sleep right now?

518
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,294
- What?
- She's crying right now.

519
00:47:00,709 --> 00:47:03,247
Can't you hear her sobbing
like her world fell apart?

520
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:06,294
I can feel I have reached my limit.

521
00:47:07,232 --> 00:47:12,950
I can feel I have reached
the limit of my life.

522
00:47:13,607 --> 00:47:18,130
Goodness! "Limit?"

523
00:47:18,155 --> 00:47:22,724
- I'm the one who has reached my limit!
- Oh my goodness! Whatever!

524
00:47:49,256 --> 00:47:56,763
I came out here at the end of Jung
Hae-dang's schedule, and now, you appear.

525
00:47:58,982 --> 00:48:01,958
There must be something you don't
know because you're still young,

526
00:48:03,177 --> 00:48:06,396
but the most painful thing for a
woman is lingering attachment.

527
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:11,028
I did that so she could accept the
situation in the least painful way.

528
00:48:11,334 --> 00:48:14,982
Oh, I see. So you did it for Hae-dang.

529
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:20,124
Then why did you block him when he
wanted to go back and make him die?

530
00:48:28,552 --> 00:48:32,200
I didn't seduce him first.

531
00:48:33,052 --> 00:48:34,474
That's no surprise.

532
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:38,552
Was it important who seduced who first?

533
00:48:39,943 --> 00:48:42,087
Do you call that an excuse?

534
00:48:42,529 --> 00:48:43,825
Let me ask you one thing.

535
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:47,505
What is your relationship with Hae-dang?

536
00:48:47,623 --> 00:48:52,435
Why would you ask me that?
What are you curious about?

537
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,047
You're crazy to the bone.

538
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:16,247
She was waiting in the front yard
without sleeping all this time.

539
00:49:30,779 --> 00:49:35,396
Park Hyun-joon said I'm crazy to the bone.

540
00:49:40,888 --> 00:49:45,786
Out of all the things people said
to me, it's the most believable.

541
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:49,568
You said you would get sick if you
can't do the things you want to.

542
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,646
How could you say something so immature?

543
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:05,607
It would be even more ridiculous
for a woman like me to mature.

544
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,677
It would be shameless of me to mature now.

545
00:50:13,474 --> 00:50:18,517
What if everyone ends up
getting hurt, just like that

546
00:50:20,315 --> 00:50:23,591
dead lover of yours, because
you do whatever you want?

547
00:50:25,357 --> 00:50:26,380
I...

548
00:50:29,685 --> 00:50:31,208
hate everyone...

549
00:50:33,107 --> 00:50:34,241
who's nice to me.

550
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,028
How could you say such
self-disparaging words?

551
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:43,763
I'm a woman who started this life by
abandoning something I should never have.

552
00:50:46,895 --> 00:50:49,060
Without becoming crazy to the bone,

553
00:50:51,068 --> 00:50:52,677
how could I have done such a thing?

554
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:05,422
Your eyes tell me that you think I'm quite
a ridiculous sight to see as time goes on.

555
00:51:08,801 --> 00:51:16,722
Are you disappointed because I'm not the
glamorous, haughty woman you thought I was?

556
00:51:19,959 --> 00:51:22,958
If you can't handle me, just throw me away.

557
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,036
If you find out everything about me,

558
00:51:30,857 --> 00:51:33,943
you won't be able to handle me anyways.

559
00:51:35,748 --> 00:51:36,815
Stop it, please.

560
00:51:39,795 --> 00:51:42,638
You're already my woman.

561
00:51:44,606 --> 00:51:51,286
There was never a woman who
made me think she was mine.

562
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:05,411
Even if I had gotten married a dozen
times, it would've been the same

563
00:52:08,528 --> 00:52:12,146
because I realized this
after I had met you.

564
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:15,383
We won't work out anyways.

565
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,833
Why don't you know my feelings?

566
00:52:21,732 --> 00:52:23,107
It doesn't matter if I don't.

567
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:29,825
No matter how you lived,
I'll never deny you.

568
00:52:35,896 --> 00:52:38,052
Even though there may be a
man who ignores his wife,

569
00:52:40,568 --> 00:52:42,638
there isn't a man who
will abandon his woman.

570
00:52:49,912 --> 00:52:53,600
So just lean against me.

571
00:52:55,771 --> 00:53:00,521
Lean against me and become
comfortable please.

572
00:53:30,591 --> 00:53:32,536
Are you going out without eating breakfast?

573
00:53:33,145 --> 00:53:34,544
I don't have an appetite.

574
00:53:35,387 --> 00:53:39,927
Why are your lips such a dark color?
Who do you want to look pretty for?

575
00:53:40,568 --> 00:53:44,247
I saw it in my dresser. I
wore it because I felt empty.

576
00:53:45,482 --> 00:53:47,396
You wore a lot of powder on your face, too.

577
00:53:48,552 --> 00:53:49,693
Bye.

578
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:53,388
Okay. Bye...

579
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,561
Should I just give up the living expenses?

580
00:54:08,224 --> 00:54:11,771
If they get divorced,
it's all over anyways.

581
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:13,982
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Oh my god.

582
00:54:14,076 --> 00:54:16,005
What's with all the fuss?

583
00:54:16,388 --> 00:54:18,568
Hae-sung quit her teaching job.

584
00:54:19,387 --> 00:54:23,463
- She quit what?
- She's going to work
part-time delivering parcels, pay

585
00:54:23,488 --> 00:54:27,396
a part of the living expenses, and do
what she wants to do in her free time.

586
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,704
Goodness. What nonsense is this?

587
00:54:38,037 --> 00:54:41,646
Kids don't turn out the
way we want them to.

588
00:54:41,787 --> 00:54:43,544
How could you tell me this now?

589
00:54:43,716 --> 00:54:47,122
I thought Hae-jin told you.

590
00:54:47,224 --> 00:54:49,732
Why the heck would she quit a teaching job?

591
00:54:49,896 --> 00:54:57,411
Nothing works out in life the way we want it
to, but we really can't control our kids.

592
00:54:57,583 --> 00:55:00,044
What did she quit her job for?

593
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:01,927
She wants to become a writer.

594
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:05,333
Goodness. Does she think
anyone can be a writer?

595
00:55:05,748 --> 00:55:08,839
She doesn't have a bit of patience.
What kind of tragic

596
00:55:08,863 --> 00:55:11,677
life did she experience for
her to become a writer?

597
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:15,638
I'm not doing anything about it, so why
are you getting all worked up about it?

598
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,536
It's because I feel like it's a waste.

599
00:55:17,724 --> 00:55:20,747
She probably has her own ideas.

600
00:55:20,966 --> 00:55:22,708
Ideas, my foot.

601
00:55:23,271 --> 00:55:26,258
You forced her to go to a
private university when

602
00:55:26,283 --> 00:55:29,209
she didn't want to, which
eventually led to this!

603
00:55:30,545 --> 00:55:34,161
Your daughters are very dogged.

604
00:55:35,052 --> 00:55:39,513
I'm starting to feel offended, Mrs. Baek.

605
00:55:40,552 --> 00:55:43,466
I think Hae-jin is having an affair.

606
00:55:44,545 --> 00:55:48,708
- What?
- She became so angry over the
living expenses, so she's having an affair.

607
00:55:49,006 --> 00:55:50,200
What are you talking about?

608
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:55,199
Just smelling her husband makes her
want to throw up, but this morning, she

609
00:55:55,224 --> 00:56:00,263
put thick powder on her face and wore
bright red lipstick before we went out.

610
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:03,318
Goodness. What are you saying?

611
00:56:05,216 --> 00:56:06,302
I saw it.

612
00:56:13,552 --> 00:56:15,818
The woman who helped you learn piano?

613
00:56:17,263 --> 00:56:19,216
She's like a mother to me.

614
00:56:20,365 --> 00:56:25,903
She took care of me so that I could somehow
survive this world in my blindness.

615
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:30,747
She must have felt bad about leaving
me behind when I was handicapped,

616
00:56:31,997 --> 00:56:36,083
so she left me enough money so that I
could live well for the rest of my life.

617
00:56:36,646 --> 00:56:38,739
She had really loved you like her own son.

618
00:56:39,865 --> 00:56:43,669
Even my biological mom had
abandoned me irresponsibly.

619
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:50,466
Why would a woman with so much
love have committed suicide?

620
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:56,339
- (Choi Kyung-ae)
- These days, I'm starting to feel the

621
00:56:56,364 --> 00:56:59,896
presence of a stranger in this
secluded villa more and more.

622
00:57:00,537 --> 00:57:04,653
I set up security cameras in the
house without my family knowing.

623
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:10,942
I don't understand why she
committed suicide when she had set

624
00:57:11,997 --> 00:57:14,378
up security cameras because of her
fear of something happening to her.

625
00:57:15,044 --> 00:57:19,466
Why did she ask you to deliver
such a letter to him?

626
00:57:19,959 --> 00:57:21,951
I think she was worried
about the letter getting

627
00:57:21,976 --> 00:57:23,724
into the hands of her other family members.

628
00:57:23,749 --> 00:57:25,825
Then she should have sent
it to her son herself.

629
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:27,849
I know.

630
00:57:28,982 --> 00:57:33,099
Wouldn't there have been a way to send it to
him? She could have even called him over.

631
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:36,130
There was no way to give it
to him while she was alive,

632
00:57:36,675 --> 00:57:39,167
so she asked me to give
it to him after she died.

633
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,544
She couldn't give it to
him while she was alive?

634
00:57:45,263 --> 00:57:47,943
- Why not?
- I'm not sure either.

635
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:51,342
Her son said he would
contact you when he came

636
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:53,547
back to Korea. He didn't contact you yet?

637
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:57,583
He probably didn't think it was
anything special and forgot about it.

638
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:00,253
Did you try calling him again?

639
00:58:01,193 --> 00:58:02,627
It's not the same number.

640
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,496
You should call his family and ask
them to give you his new phone number.

641
00:58:07,052 --> 00:58:11,060
I told them I couldn't tell
them what I was calling for,

642
00:58:11,403 --> 00:58:13,670
so they said they couldn't
give me his personal number.

643
00:58:14,638 --> 00:58:18,583
So that letter definitely said the other
family members can't know about it?

644
00:58:19,123 --> 00:58:22,877
What bothers me the most is
that she said she had written

645
00:58:22,902 --> 00:58:26,138
a will, just in case, but
that will had been lost.

646
00:58:26,865 --> 00:58:28,583
The will was lost?

647
00:58:29,576 --> 00:58:31,193
I don't think this is just a suicide.

648
00:58:33,575 --> 00:58:36,395
And according to that letter,
the key to this whole

649
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,076
thing could be hidden
somewhere inside the house.

650
00:58:40,045 --> 00:58:44,482
Is her son in America, or
did he come back to Korea?

651
00:58:47,302 --> 00:58:50,419
How about you go to the police instead?

652
00:58:50,857 --> 00:58:53,653
I don't think this is something
that can be taken care of that way.

653
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:56,716
Mrs. Choi's family is
very powerful, so I can't

654
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,028
trust how much the police
can disclose about them.

655
00:59:13,779 --> 00:59:16,614
- Hello?
- Kyung-soo? This is Mi-jung.

656
00:59:17,451 --> 00:59:19,200
Hi. What's up?

657
00:59:19,693 --> 00:59:21,200
I have an urgent request to make.

658
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,888
Go on.

659
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:28,380
I'm supposed to perform at a party, but
something urgent came up, so I can't make it.

660
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:31,646
I see. Are you asking
me to perform instead?

661
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:38,582
Ask your friends. I told you
I don't do those things.

662
00:59:39,006 --> 00:59:42,997
I can't recommend just anyone. It's for a
wealthy family, so they'll pay you well.

663
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:46,122
You know GR Group, don't you?

664
01:00:12,537 --> 01:00:13,537
Welcome.

665
01:00:15,677 --> 01:00:20,318
It's nice to meet you. I selected the
songs I'm going to play at the party.

666
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:24,286
I'm glad you came. Are you a music student?

667
01:00:24,646 --> 01:00:28,138
No. She had an emergency,
so I came on her behalf.

668
01:00:28,443 --> 01:00:29,443
I see.

669
01:00:31,123 --> 01:00:33,794
It doesn't matter anyways.
Please take a seat.

670
01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:36,763
Yes, you can sit here.

671
01:00:41,756 --> 01:00:44,341
- What's your name?
- Yoon Sung-ha.

672
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:48,286
Please wait a moment, Sung-ha.
I'll get you something to drink.

673
01:01:34,404 --> 01:01:35,404
Be careful!

674
01:01:38,888 --> 01:01:40,200
Get up. Are you okay?

675
01:01:45,373 --> 01:01:46,450
Who are you?

676
01:01:48,193 --> 01:01:50,864
I'll be the one playing the
piano during the party.

677
01:01:51,396 --> 01:01:52,724
Oh, I see.

678
01:01:56,334 --> 01:01:59,786
But I think I've seen you somewhere before.

679
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:04,935
Your face looks familiar.

680
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:08,756
Oh, that's right!

681
01:02:09,545 --> 01:02:11,024
The cafe in Hae-dang's neighborhood?

682
01:02:13,584 --> 01:02:15,224
Do you know Jung Hae-dang?

683
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:18,438
Her younger sister used
to work at your cafe.

684
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:21,170
Yes.

685
01:02:21,888 --> 01:02:23,138
So that's where I saw you.

686
01:02:24,201 --> 01:02:27,239
I thought you had special piano skills.

687
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,708
Thank you for thinking that way.

688
01:02:31,584 --> 01:02:34,083
He's blind.

689
01:02:36,584 --> 01:02:37,584
Bye.

690
01:02:42,826 --> 01:02:45,513
Should I help you?

691
01:02:50,748 --> 01:02:51,748
No, thank you.

692
01:03:21,948 --> 01:03:24,631
(You Are Too Much)

693
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:26,625
- Do you live here?
- Yes. Why?

694
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:29,176
You look like you're coming over
to your friend's house.

695
01:03:29,318 --> 01:03:30,791
I hope I won't get in trouble.

696
01:03:30,816 --> 01:03:34,869
Do you miss her?
You used to date that woman.

697
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,505
Will you really bring him to the
planning office? What about me?

698
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:39,364
Is that all the pride you have?

699
01:03:39,389 --> 01:03:41,755
If I make sure the
relationship between

700
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,407
your father and brother is ruined,
will you protect me?

701
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:46,431
