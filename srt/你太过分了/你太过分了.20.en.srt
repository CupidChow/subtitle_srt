<i>[Episode 20]</i>

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,340
Since I'm going to let you go...

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,440
I'll pretend I never met you.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,260
Wherever you go...

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,220
live and do whatever you want.

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,630
Popular singer Yoo Ji Na.
For the sake of that great name...

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,290
Live however you want.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,940
I can personally get
you a house if you want.

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,060
If you don't need me to then
find one yourself and leave.

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,780
If you don't want to live in
my house for another day...

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,240
move into a hotel.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,870
Or stay until you get a new
house. It doesn't matter.

14
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,640
Well, then...

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,710
I'll get going.

16
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,710
Why are you so distracted?

17
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,760
I think I'm going
to have to stop for today.

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,680
You can't stop practicing now.
It's an important live show.

19
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,680
You will be embarrassed if
you don't prepare properly.

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,350
I'm not in the mood
to be dancing right now.

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,960
Make a reservation at
the place I went to last time.

22
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,840
So you're going drinking again?

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,530
Do what you're told.

24
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,750
Something might happen if
you continue to do this.

25
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,210
I said to do what you're told!

26
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,810
Welcome home, Father.

27
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,590
Please don't worry. We're going to go
straight upstairs after we say hello.

28
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,080
Come to work starting tomorrow.

29
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,940
Mother, I'm home. I'm coming in.

30
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,870
He just said for you
to come to work tomorrow, right?

31
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,450
That's what I heard.

32
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,970
Father is apologizing to you.

33
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,000
We decided to break up.

34
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,560
Ji Na is going to leave as
soon as she finds a place.

35
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,720
There's no need to worry
about her anymore.

36
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,680
Are you serious?

37
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,250
You have suffered
so much this whole time.

38
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,090
Excuse me.

39
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,070
Thank you, honey.

40
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:48,490
Telling you to come to work doesn't mean
we have to get a divorce right away.

41
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,130
We'll have to wait and see
how far his apology goes.

42
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,860
I didn't know you would be so patient
when he told you not to come to work.

43
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,910
I thought you would want to divorce
me right away for your father's sake.

44
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,030
In any case, thank you.

45
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:15,090
Starting now, be careful
how you talk and act.

46
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,700
Please.

47
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,590
Okay.

48
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,340
Father told Hyun Sung
to come to work tomorrow.

49
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,740
Really?

50
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,670
You and Hyun Sung really
protected me this time. Thank you.

51
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,010
Your father-in-law said he has
broken up with that monster.

52
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,980
- Truly?
- We won.

53
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,770
Congratulations, Grandmother.

54
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,920
Goodness, it's embarrassing
to be congratulated for that.

55
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,250
In any case, we kicked her out.

56
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,580
- You worked hard.
- You too.

57
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,040
No one can beat us as long as
you and I are on the same team.

58
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,180
I think I will sleep well tonight.

59
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,790
It was really tough, wasn't it?

60
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,730
I almost lost my life trying
to get rid of that baggage.

61
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,800
I'll tell my family to send
some proper tonic for you.

62
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,150
I won.

63
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,020
It's proven that no one in
this house can beat you.

64
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,370
Goodness.

65
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,010
Is that really true?

66
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,100
He told Grandmother.

67
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,940
- Is he home?
- He's at the bar.

68
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,700
You should leave him alone today.

69
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,440
He's not feeling all that great.

70
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,060
When do you plan on leaving?

71
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,180
Did you come to ask about that
because you are in a hurry?

72
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,380
I don't know how many
times we will see each other

73
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,170
but you shouldn't use that kind of
language to someone who is beneath you.

74
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,590
- What?
- You should know since you've done it.

75
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,410
Not just anyone can
get inside this house.

76
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,580
Not just anyone?

77
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,220
It was an impossible
task from the beginning.

78
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,980
An impossible task?

79
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,180
It's done, so don't be so hurt by it.

80
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,070
I wish you well in all your endeavors.

81
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,230
Are those words of comfort?

82
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,510
The results could have been different
if you had cooperated with me.

83
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,880
You didn't take me seriously
and you ignored me.

84
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,510
Miss Yoo Ji Na.

85
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,040
What?

86
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,930
Everyone obeyed your every whim.

87
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,030
You acted like you were a queen

88
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,120
and treated people
as if they were your servants.

89
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,390
How dare you?

90
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,720
What are you going to do
besides jump up and glare at me?

91
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,050
You're the first celebrity
I ever went up against.

92
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,270
And? Are you disappointed?

93
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,510
Not at all. I never expected
anything in the first place.

94
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,460
They thought she was dead but she
came back with a whole new face.

95
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,680
And?

96
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,270
The plastic surgeon fixed her face and
she looked exactly like his late wife.

97
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,700
- And?
- And he fell in love with that woman.

98
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,170
A wild love story unfolded.

99
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,590
Then, what about the ending?

100
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,960
The ending?

101
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,820
It just ended since the time was up.

102
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,680
Mom.

103
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,940
You should be a writer.

104
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,880
I could be if I wanted to.

105
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,270
Goodness, there isn't anything
our Madam Baek Mi Sook can't do.

106
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,020
You say you could've
been a singer or a writer.

107
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,260
I received several awards in
elementary school for a writing contest.

108
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,870
All the teachers cried
whenever I wrote something.

109
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,680
They were so touched.

110
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,330
Writing from a grade school kid?

111
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,840
I was the only one who got
a return pen pal letter.

112
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,930
You were good at love letters, too.

113
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,530
What?

114
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,290
They gave out prizes for those
writing contests back then.

115
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,510
Poor kids took advantage of it.

116
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:24,690
So you never received any prizes because
you came from such a great family?

117
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,670
Honestly, you're good at
writing, singing, and running.

118
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,400
You were good at everything
except for studying.

119
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,950
Ah, I see.

120
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,030
You couldn't write, sing, or run
if your life depended upon it.

121
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,130
Why did you study like that?

122
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,920
I was good at studying.

123
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,050
I was better than you.

124
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,640
You were better than I was? At what?

125
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
What kind of nonsense is this?

126
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,630
What nonsense?
We're both from educated families.

127
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,060
Why are you upset?
Were you called a Lady?

128
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,430
Lady, as if.

129
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,530
I'm not making pollack soup!

130
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,560
Where are you going, Lady?

131
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,830
I'll send down some soup later.

132
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,630
- Thank you.
- Sure.

133
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,260
- We just need to make the rice then.
- Yes.

134
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,410
Seriously, Dad.

135
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,240
So, you must've been
really bad at studying.

136
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,580
What?

137
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,590
Well, you couldn't say a word when
he brought up the writing contest.

138
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:39,280
You're not the type to back away if
there was a chance for you to win.

139
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,050
I did not back away.

140
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,760
You always regretted not
being able to study a lot.

141
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,620
So I assumed you were good at it.

142
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,290
What?

143
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,470
Get the rice.

144
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,970
If anyone says they're going to be
in-laws with a grade school friend

145
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm going to pack some food,
follow them around, and stop them.

146
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,640
I have no privacy.

147
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,580
Mr. Jung got made fun of
much more than you.

148
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,370
You just wait and see, Jung Kang Shik.

149
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,560
Her nickname was "Big
eyes" in grade school.

150
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,040
Her eyes were huge.

151
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,450
In this day and age, she could go out
and be a child star if she wanted to.

152
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,770
She's still very pretty.

153
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,740
It's only because she
doesn't pretty herself up.

154
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,300
You praise her so much
when she's not here.

155
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,430
Why do you do that whenever you see her?

156
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,100
Hey, I did it for fun.

157
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,730
Did you see her shaking with anger?
It's fun.

158
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,960
She was shaking with anger?

159
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,950
By the way, where did
Bong Soo go after dinner?

160
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,060
Didn't he go downstairs?

161
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,590
You think so?

162
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,870
Did Bong Soo go downstairs?

163
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,760
He went out for a walk.

164
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,450
A walk? Why a walk all of a sudden?

165
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,980
I ran a goat meat restaurant.

166
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,190
We spent all our money treating my
husband's cancer and he passed away.

167
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,580
Here I am doing this.

168
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,950
It must be hard doing it alone.

169
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,300
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

170
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,030
It's so nice that
an old-fashioned cart bar like this

171
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,390
is still around in the neighborhood.

172
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,090
It reminds me of my bachelor days.

173
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,790
- Please come by often.
- I will.

174
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,180
You have a kind face.

175
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:44,650
Maybe that's why I feel so
comfortable whenever I come here.

176
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,290
You have a kinder face than I do.

177
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,860
You have a nice nose and big eyes.
An all around good-looking face.

178
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,950
Who? Me? Goodness, thank you.

179
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,560
Do you have a big sister?

180
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,560
Why?

181
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,240
If you don't, think of me as
your big sister and come often.

182
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,290
Ah, I see.

183
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,350
I don't have a big sister.

184
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,950
I don't have anyone who
is similar to a big sister.

185
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,510
I see.

186
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,740
Goodness.

187
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,330
Wait... I didn't order this.

188
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,360
You remind me of
my little brother who passed away

189
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,190
and I want to treat you well.

190
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:45,430
Your husband passed away and your
son passed away in a car accident.

191
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,580
Your brother passed away, too huh?

192
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,790
I have no one to lean on.

193
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,550
Then... you must be very lonely.

194
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,420
You look so manly every
time I look at you.

195
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,220
Oh really? Thank you.

196
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,600
<i>The bluebird has flown away.</i>

197
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,830
<i>I'm not so tired anymore.</i>

198
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,670
Where have you been?

199
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,260
- Were you out for a walk.
- Yes... I...

200
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,280
Did you drink?

201
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,830
I drank half a soju bottle
at the cart bar out front.

202
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,770
- By yourself?
- Goodness, don't worry and go to sleep.

203
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,970
<i>The bluebird has flown away.</i>

204
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,360
<i>I'm not so tired anymore.</i>

205
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,160
Did something happen?
He looks so happy.

206
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,970
What's there to be
happy about by yourself?

207
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,380
Gosh.

208
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,570
Sis, have you been well?

209
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,670
Have you been well, Sis?

210
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,990
What are you doing?

211
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,490
Yes?

212
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,510
Oh, nothing. I'm going to sleep.

213
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,770
Is Hae Jin studying in Hoon's room?

214
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,780
She must be.

215
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,380
<i>The bluebird has flown away.</i>

216
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,290
<i>I'm not so tired anymore.</i>

217
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,650
Why are you in such a good mood?

218
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,000
Goodness, stop bothering me and get out.

219
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,540
Why are you in such a good mood?

220
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,470
I'm getting healed, that's why.

221
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,790
I'm always walking on egg
shells around you and Hae Jin.

222
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,060
My eyes have shriveled up.

223
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,380
It's been a long time since I've
felt so comfortable, that's why.

224
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,750
So, why do you feel so
comfortable all of a sudden?

225
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,490
I took a walk.

226
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,810
You become comfortable
because you took a walk?

227
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,320
Don't you know about the healing course?

228
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,120
Healing, schmealing. There's
something suspicious about you.

229
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,820
I swear. What is there
to be suspicious about?

230
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,580
You...

231
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,700
- picked up money, didn't you?
- What?

232
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,060
Did you pick up money on
the street while you were walking?

233
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,590
I swear, money, money, money.

234
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,110
Goodness, I swear. I swear.

235
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,900
<i>The bluebird has flown away.</i>

236
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,820
Madam, we're going to
start taking pictures.

237
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,480
Let's just take the pictures here.

238
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,390
Yes, that's good.

239
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,560
Please stand up for a moment.

240
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,990
The women's magazine
came for an interview.

241
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,650
What interview?

242
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,040
The news of Father's broken engagement.

243
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,380
What?

244
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,330
Very good.

245
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,320
Let's do the interview inside.

246
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,710
- Yes, of course.
- Sure.

247
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,610
What are you doing?

248
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,050
Just what kind of
interview is she doing?

249
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,600
That's Grandmother's choice.

250
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,320
Don't you think the topic
would be something like...

251
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,550
"An exclusive interview with
Madam Sung Kyung Ja"

252
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,850
"about the broken engagement"

253
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,500
"between Singer Yoo Ji Na
and Chairman Park Sung Hwan."

254
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,320
If you're worried, go inside and listen.

255
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,770
Or go and take a picture next to her.

256
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,030
What did you say in the interview?

257
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,770
You can read it later in the magazine.

258
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,790
I asked what you said.

259
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,360
You've ruined my son's life. You didn't
expect there would be any repercussions?

260
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,080
I ruined his life?

261
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,710
Thanks to you, he won't be able
to talk to other eligible ladies.

262
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,730
How are you going
to compensate him for that?

263
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,500
Compensate him?

264
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,280
I took a blow, too.

265
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,920
In your position? What blow?

266
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,760
That there were talks of marriage to
a wealthy man should be an honor.

267
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,390
An honor?

268
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,630
After what happened with our engagement
and a strange interview, I swear...

269
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,240
I won't be able to hold
my head up high and sing.

270
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,890
So, why did you interfere
when you didn't know your place?

271
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,700
Without fear.

272
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,310
"There was a devastating reason"

273
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,100
"so there was no choice
but to break off the engagement."

274
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,130
That way my son can save face.

275
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,780
Look forward to it.

276
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:12,690
The whole world will be quite surprised
by the reason the engagement ended.

277
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,400
Think carefully before you do this.

278
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,280
I will sue you for defamation.

279
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,850
Defamation?

280
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,580
My team won't stand for it
if you say anything false.

281
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,180
Don't worry.

282
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,800
I didn't say one false thing.

283
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,270
The truth was enough.

284
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,020
Get out. I have no need
to see you any longer.

285
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,920
Looking at that face of yours is tiring.

286
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,250
Call now and tell them
not to release the article.

287
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,190
You receive several million won
for every song you sing

288
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,980
because you're popular, don't you?

289
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:03,090
Then you should be grateful
and be careful of your actions.

290
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,690
How dare you do whatever you want?

291
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,320
Who knows what may become of you.

292
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,390
Please stop her.

293
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,380
I can't be a singer in this country
if that old woman says something strange.

294
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,520
Why aren't you answering?

295
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,490
It's outside of my power.

296
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,320
What did you say?

297
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,550
My mother won't listen to what I say.

298
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,440
And I don't want to be mixed
up with your business anymore.

299
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,700
What did I do that was so wrong?

300
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,370
The fact that I briefly had
feelings for Park Hyun Joon?

301
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,350
Is that such a huge crime?

302
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,340
Is having feelings for
someone a bad thing?

303
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,080
Then you should've never
announced our engagement.

304
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,750
You threatened me.

305
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,290
Whether it was a threat or not...

306
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,320
You should have put up with it
even if it was worse than that.

307
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,350
Unless you revealed to the world
that you abandoned your blind son.

308
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,900
How can you say that to me now?

309
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,140
You are determined to
be the last one standing.

310
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,740
That's why you announced the engagement.

311
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,590
That's why the engagement
was forced, it was because of you.

312
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,560
You didn't care if I became
a laughingstock in front of my family.

313
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,820
You were so evil to the very end.

314
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,420
Evil?

315
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,480
Was I the only one who was evil?

316
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,570
I had no idea you were such
a filial son, Chairman Park.

317
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,550
You knew you could never
win against your mother.

318
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,850
How can you say such things even now?

319
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,300
Didn't you come here asking for my help?

320
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,250
Just how old are you?

321
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,160
How does it feel to get dumped
by Chairman Park Sung Hwan?

322
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,640
Why does everyone hate me?

323
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,730
What did I do that was
so wrong to you people?

324
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,780
Why are you doing this to me?

325
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,150
Why? Why?

326
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,900
That's right. I'm crazy to the bone.

327
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:35,020
How was I a nuisance in your life?

328
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,040
Why am I the weird one here? Why?

329
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,850
- You still don't get it?
- What do you mean?

330
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:45,340
Is it my fault that your mother
didn't receive love from her husband?

331
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,950
Is it my fault that your father loves me?

332
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,300
Is it my fault that I don't
accept your father's love?

333
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,000
Why is everyone out to get me? Why? Why?

334
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,170
Why do I hate you?

335
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:02,030
It's not because
you're crazy to the bone.

336
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,330
It's because you're a selfish
person down to your core.

337
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,360
You get sick if you
don't do what you want.

338
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,430
You don't want to be hated?

339
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:18,850
You want to be loved and you think
it's unfair that people hate you?

340
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,280
What kind of arrogant and
selfish thinking is that?

341
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,840
I'm not the one who is crazy.
It's your whole family.

342
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,830
I just got unlucky and
got caught in the middle.

343
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,520
Your family is weird and
they make people crazy.

344
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,470
I'm saying this because it will probably
be the last time we see each other.

345
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,120
You will really go crazy if
you continue to think like that.

346
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,150
So, don't live like that.

347
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,020
Hello, President Park.

348
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,970
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

349
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,200
I think Hae Dang really likes
the person she is dating right now.

350
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,060
Yes, it seems that way.

351
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,860
She's not a rash person.

352
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,150
She probably thought
about it very carefully.

353
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,580
What if she says she wants to marry him?

354
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,410
How can they get married?
It's not realistic.

355
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,050
He is way too young.

356
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,410
- You've met him?
- Yes.

357
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,350
He runs a cafe in the neighborhood.

358
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,330
What does he look like?

359
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:00,550
He's a great guy and very good looking.

360
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,320
Sir.

361
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,940
Ah. Still, I like you.

362
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:13,380
Being nice isn't going to support your
wife and children in this harsh world.

363
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,250
I'm nice, too.

364
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,580
Honestly, she can't call
that young thing her husband.

365
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,740
- Don't ever have a change of heart.
- Okay.

366
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm nervous.

367
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,880
About what?

368
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,650
You always give in to
whatever Hae Dang says.

369
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,350
It seems like you're
already half way there.

370
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,670
I haven't gone that far yet.

371
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,620
About a quarter then?

372
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:47,200
Well... it's better than just sitting
here and getting old, don't you think?

373
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,840
- Sir.
- Okay. Okay.

374
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,430
Shall I go and see him?

375
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,680
What if Hae Dang gets upset?

376
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,370
You said he runs a cafe.
I'll just go and pretend I'm a customer.

377
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,080
Ah.

378
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,590
Okay then. Don't say a word to him. Just
go, have a cup of coffee, and come back.

379
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:13,010
I'll tell you where the cafe is.

380
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,240
Welcome.

381
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,190
Is it possible to have a cup of coffee?

382
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,780
Yes. Have a seat.

383
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,610
Okay.

384
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,570
If there isn't anything particular you
want, I just made some fresh coffee.

385
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,670
Would you like some?

386
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,230
It doesn't matter.

387
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,050
Thank you.

388
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,700
You're Park Hyun Joon, aren't you?

389
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,370
How do you know me?

390
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,970
I saw you by accident in
front of Hae Dang's door.

391
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,900
She told me you are
the president of her agency.

392
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,840
Ah, I see.

393
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,980
But... have we seen each other before?

394
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:00,250
Maybe it's because you have a pleasant
face, but I think we've met before.

395
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,540
I just can't recall where we met.

396
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,290
- I don't feel that way.
- Really?

397
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,340
Did you come here to see me?

398
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,720
- Because of Hae Dang?
- Well, not exactly because of that.

399
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:20,050
Since you brought it up,
please sit down for a moment.

400
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,730
What is it that you want to say?

401
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,830
I will be 37 this year.

402
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,250
And?

403
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,630
I hear you're eight years younger
than Hae Dang. Is that correct?

404
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,920
Then, you must be 25 this year.

405
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,590
Yes, that's correct.

406
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,340
I don't think you're at
an age to know how to love

407
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,980
and be responsible for a woman.

408
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,630
What do you think?

409
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:59,310
I don't think age is important
when you're talking about love.

410
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,270
No, it is important.

411
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:09,160
If you're 25, you still
haven't learned how to give up.

412
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,280
Is that what you think?

413
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,230
You're at an age to love someone.

414
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,420
If you don't know how to give up, it'll
be hard to be responsible for a woman.

415
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,490
If you're determined to take
responsibility for someone

416
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,040
then it also means you're willing
to give up one or two things.

417
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,410
Of course, Hae Dang is
not the first woman for me.

418
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,030
But I've decided she is the one for me.

419
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:43,360
First of all, thank you for the sincere
feelings you have for Hae Dang.

420
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,600
I truly mean it.

421
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,580
I'm thankful for anyone
who cares for Hae Dang.

422
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:57,200
Because I'm Hae Dang and Hae Dang is me.

423
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,220
I know I'm lacking in many ways.

424
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:07,230
Hae Dang and I will support
each other and live well.

425
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,130
Because we truly love each other.

426
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:24,000
The truth is, I only came here to drink
some tea and take a look at your face.

427
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,930
Thank you for the coffee.

428
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,530
Sure.

429
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,740
What are you thinking?
You haven't said a word in a while.

430
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,220
Park Hyun Joon came by.

431
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,490
- Where?
- The cafe.

432
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,880
Are you serious?

433
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,690
I thought he was trustworthy.

434
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,000
What did he say?

435
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,380
He's very sure about you.

436
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,890
He's not a bad person.

437
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,480
He does tend to be
careful with what he says.

438
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,270
No, he wasn't careful at all.

439
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,570
What did he say?

440
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,990
Were you hurt?

441
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,180
Yes, I'm hurt.

442
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,320
It's not because of what he said to me.

443
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,660
I'm just hurt by his very existence.

444
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,630
Park Hyun Joon.

445
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,210
I know the feeling.

446
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:37,950
I know why it's hard for you to leave a
man who is eight years younger than you.

447
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,180
How can you ignore me like that?

448
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,740
Am I a joke to you?
I told you not to go.

449
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,010
Are you so angry because he got hurt?

450
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,540
Whatever you needed to say
should have been said to me.

451
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:54,040
How dare you go there?
Do my words mean nothing to you?

452
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,280
I went there because I love you, okay?

453
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,390
What?

454
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:06,420
I was dying of curiosity to see the man
the woman I love is in love with.

455
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,540
I just went to see his face
but he acknowledge me first.

456
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:17,320
I said he was too young to be responsible
for one woman and to back off.

457
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,030
- That's what I said. What of it?
- Who do you think you are?

458
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,970
Because you're
the president of the agency?

459
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,380
You're 33 years old.
You still don't know men?

460
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,930
What?

461
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,860
I agree that he is a lovable person.

462
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,030
But half the people
in the world are women.

463
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,520
He is going to meet many
women throughout his life.

464
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,890
What is that supposed to mean?

465
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:45,790
I'm saying he doesn't know that
patience is needed to love one person.

466
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,560
And you do?

467
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:54,020
Even women know it's hard to love
a man if they don't know when to let go.

468
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,960
You should really write a dissertation
about women since you know us so well.

469
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,220
I'm going to be patient with you.

470
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm going to treasure and love you.

471
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,430
Sorry, but I don't need your love.

472
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,750
Why? Because you're so brave.

473
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:17,480
You have no weaknesses or scars.

474
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:22,690
All in all... you're not my type.

475
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,750
Okay, I'm sorry.

476
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,440
I said I'm sorry.

477
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,780
Don't just go like that.

478
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,950
Get in on the other side.

479
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,200
Don't you need to follow your schedule?

480
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:23,020
I'm very careful because
he's been hurt a lot.

481
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,480
Okay, fine. But...

482
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,510
How do you date a guy
you're so careful around?

483
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,720
I want to protect and comfort him.

484
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,570
The man is supposed to
do that for the woman.

485
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,780
Not the other way around.

486
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,300
I'm used to doing things like that.

487
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:55,380
I know so stop being nice to
other people and live for yourself.

488
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,630
Didn't you follow me
so you could apologize?

489
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:02,170
You're so frustrating.

490
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,790
Why is there so much traffic?

491
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,260
You're going to get into an accident.

492
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,730
Don't act like you love that guy
in front of me and get on my nerves.

493
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,730
Stop the car, I'm going to drive.

494
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,870
Yeah right. We're so late.

495
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,730
Seriously.

496
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,440
Go buy the magazine if it's out.

497
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,280
Why do you want to see that?

498
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,620
If I say to go buy it, then do it.

502
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,240
It says you can't go
a day without drinking.

503
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,670
You talk back to your
future mother-in-law

504
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,010
and that you made ramen for breakfast.

505
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,070
But she says she tried
to teach you while living with you.

506
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:10,400
You broke up Park Hyun Joon
and Hong Yoon Hee's engagement.

507
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,430
What?

508
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,020
She found out
and just couldn't accept it.

509
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,780
It's written that she
drew the final line.

510
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,930
Sue them for defamation.

511
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,570

512
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,200

you went to the country is exposed?

515
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,170
You're performing live tomorrow.
You can't drink now.

516
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,000
Should I take drugs then?

517
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,840

What are you going to do?

00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
How far are you going to go
to disappoint me?

520
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,130
Huh?

521
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,140
<i>[Singer Yoo Ji Na's breakup: Exclusive
interview with Madam Sung Kyung Ja.]</i>

522
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,070
The engagement was such a fiasco.
She eventually got kicked out.

523
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,940
It feels like she didn't have a choice
about breaking off the engagement.

524
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,170
Her image will probably
take a slight blow.

525
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,520
It's not just a slight blow.

526
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,050
She'll have a hard time
coming back from this.

527
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:56,450
But they mentioned you as the man who
almost suffered a blow from this issue.

528
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,440
So?

529
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,310
I'm just saying.

530
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,600
There are many people with
the name Park Hyun Joon.

531
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,380
Would I work in a small agency like this
if I were the son of a wealthy family?

532
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,710
That's true.

533
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:19,540
How did it come to this?

534
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,730
Goodness, eat your dinner.

535
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,160
I have to prepare for the seminar
so there's no time to eat.

536
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,020
Wait, is that all you're eating?

537
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,360
Huh? It's weird, but
I've lost my appetite.

538
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,630
Yeon Bong Soo loses his appetite?

539
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,130
I'm human, too.

540
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,010
Why are you getting all sensitive?

541
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:55,190
By the way, where did you put all
the t-shirts your father gave me?

542
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,500
They're inside the closet. Why?

543
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,910
- The closet?
- Why are you looking for the t-shirts?

544
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:04,710
Don't worry about it, just eat.

545
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,900
<i>The bluebird has flown away.</i>

546
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,700
<i>I'm not so tired anymore.</i>

547
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:24,790
Why are you suddenly
wearing a new t-shirt?

548
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,230
I'm going to go for a walk.

549
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,780
You're wearing a new
t-shirt to go for a walk?

550
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,260
I want to walk with a new heart.

551
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,110
You want to walk with a new heart?

552
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:37,600
It's more like meditation than a walk.

553
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:41,300
A time for me to look
back on my cold self.

554
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,040
- Meditation?
- Yes.

555
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,980
Meditation.

556
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,140
Why are you following me?

557
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,380
No, I'm not following you.

558
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:57,320
You're going out for walks often.

559
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,070
Once you start going out it
becomes a habit. It's quite scary.

560
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,730
I'll be back.

561
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:07,260
Ah. Don't wait for me,
go ahead and go to sleep.

562
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,050
That's my choice. Just go
and get some good healing.

563
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,080
Okay, I will.

564
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,980
<i>The bluebird has flown away.</i>

565
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:38,040
Do you tend to go for walks
often if it becomes a habit?

566
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,190
Of course. They say walking becomes
an addiction once you get a taste for it.

567
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,290
An addiction?

568
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:49,630
Yes. There are a lot of
walking clubs on the internet.

569
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,990
Is it supposed to be like that?

570
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:57,180
Modern people lack exercise so they
get indigestion and are stressed out.

571
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,580
It's a good workout and helps organize
their thoughts. I think that's why.

572
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,950
Oh. Yeah, I guess.

573
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,420
I'm sure there isn't
a single woman on the streets

574
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,900
who would want to pick him up.

575
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,400
What do you mean?

576
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,850
It's nothing. I just had
a ridiculous thought in my head.

577
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:21,230
Goodness, it's finally time to switch.

578
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,820
- Did you eat dinner?
- Of course.

579
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,220
My daughter packed me
a meal and I ate it.

580
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,090
Oh, she also packed a late night snack.

581
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,050
There are some dumplings left over.

582
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,010
Go ahead and eat them
if you get hungry later.

583
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,520
I ate at the cart bar on my way here.

584
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,070
Goodness, do you think that's enough?

585
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:41,130
About your son-in-law...

586
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:46,200
- Is he having an affair?
- Who?

587
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,920
Bong Soo?

588
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,960
That's ridiculous.

589
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,750
Every man in the world could have
an affair but not my Bong Soo.

590
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,860
I saw him four times already.

591
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,250
Where?

592
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:05,970
He was always sitting alone
in that food tent stall.

593
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,760
Alone?

594
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,370
He was flirting with the female owner.

595
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,000
They were flirting?

596
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,480
You probably saw the wrong person.

597
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,800
It was your son-in-law. There aren't
a lot of people who look like him.

598
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,170
He looks like he's from Saudi Arabia.

599
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:24,900
Saudi?

600
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,880
That's my Bong Soo for sure.

601
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,600
Welcome.

602
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,130
Father.

603
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,830
What are you doing here?

604
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:47,260
Ah yes, the owner suddenly got a stomach
ache and had to go to the bathroom.

605
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,640
I'm just helping her out briefly
so the fish doesn't get burned.

606
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,130
- I see.
- Yes.

607
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,980
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Sure.

608
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,130
What brings you here, Sir?

609
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,820
I wanted to have drink before I go home.

610
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,540
- By yourself?
- Yes.

611
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:11,560
I came to have a lonely
drink by myself today.

612
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,230
But here you are grilling fish.

613
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,220
- You're his father-in-law?
- Yes.

614
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:21,520
I am his father-in-law.

615
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,150
Oh my, your father-in-law
is so dashing.

616
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,960
Dashing, huh?

617
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:31,300
- Please sit, please sit.
- Please sit. Sit here.

618
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,130
Since your father-in-law is here

619
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:39,000
I will prepare a special dish
and cook some squid.

620
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,760
No, it's fine. That's not necessary.

621
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,590
What do you mean?
He's your father-in-law, Bong Soo.

622
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,330
Bong Soo?

623
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,170
You even know your customer's name.

624
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,170
Father-in-law, please have a drink.

625
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,490
- Okay.
- Here you go.

626
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:04,880
<i>She doesn't look dangerous at all.</i>

627
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,880
Doesn't she have such a nice face?

628
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,480
Yes, she's very wide and broad.

629
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,780
She looks courageously handsome.

630
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:22,160
And her chin is very narrow as well.

631
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,220
She would've been called
a  general back in the day.

632
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,900
Sir, a woman shouldn't
be called a general.

633
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:35,480
No, she looks so stout and strong.

634
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,390
She's a woman.

635
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,570
- I know that.
- How can you say she looks stout?

636
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:45,970
You must easily weigh
over 70 kilograms, right?

637
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:49,900
Sir, what is wrong with you?

638
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,930
Goodness, you have such
a way with words, Grandpa.

639
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:57,870
- Grandpa?
- Then, should I just call you mister?

640
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,700
Grandpa? I just turned 60.

641
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,150
She has dementia already.

642
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:42,640
<i>I'm left alone on this road again.
I am sitting here staring blankly.</i>

643
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:50,350
<i>For what reason exactly
am I selling myself for laughter?</i>

644
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:57,720
<i>I can't see the end
of the road that escapes darkness...</i>

645
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,060
What is she doing?

646
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,130
Is she playing right now?

647
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:11,420
<i>Tears again even when I'm in love.</i>

648
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,560
<i>Goodbye to those nothing memories.
I'll forget them all.</i>

649
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,740
That woman has lost her mind.

650
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,210
What are you doing?
Tell her to get up quickly.

651
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:34,380
<i>Yes, right now everyone
is watching live...</i>

652
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,040
- Oh my.
- What just happened?

653
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,930
Oh my, oh my, what just happened?

654
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:42,200
It's my first time watching
something like this.

655
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,530
That woman is done for.

656
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,480
Goodness, I know it's Sunday but why are
you watching TV in the middle of the day?

657
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,340
Mom, Mom. Yoo Ji Na fell during
a live show and she just sat there.

658
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,500
And she didn't sing the whole song.

659
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,760
What?

660
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,750
Wow, she got dumped by her wealthy
boyfriend and fell during a live show.

661
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,090
That woman is going to have a tough time.

662
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,250
That's why you should always be nice.

663
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,890
The comments are going to be obvious.

664
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,320
That's right.

665
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:15,760
What just happened?

666
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,500
She has completely lost it.

667
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:20,490
What if this effects
Miss Hae Dang as well?

668
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,380
It's bad enough that
her pay has been cut.

669
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,010
What will we do if her
appearances get cut as well?

670
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:25,430
Are you worrying about that now?

671
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,000
As an employee, what
should I be worried about?

672
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,850
Should I be worried about Yoo Ji Na?

673
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,390
I feel a bit strange though.

674
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,980
What is strange?

675
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:39,820
I should feel a sense of
satisfaction, but I don't.

676
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,120
Because you're afraid
of getting a pay cut again?

677
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,750
No.

678
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:50,400
- Explain what happened.
- What happened out there?

679
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:03,180
I don't know what to do
anymore. I don't know.

680
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,480
- Miss Yoo Ji Na.
- A word please.

681
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,380
<i>How far do you plan to take this?</i>

682
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:46,030
Is the internet... in an uproar again?

683
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,600
What is everyone
laughing about this time?

684
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,290
Before the news of your breakup
even settled down, this happened.

685
00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:00,800
- Be prepared.
- What did they say?

686
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,100
"Singer Yoo Ji Na couldn't
handle her messy personal life..."

687
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,270
"so she exploded on stage."

688
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:10,600
And?

689
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,160
Among the young K-pop stars,
"Her choreography is slow and dull."

690
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,200
"Her outfit is out of style."

691
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,280
"She's gotten fat and the excessive
show of skin is vulgar."

692
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,040
"She held on with her sexy
performances, but that's over now."

693
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:35,120
They way I see it...
honestly, your career is over.

694
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,410
Over? Who is over?

695
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:42,090
Who says it's over?

696
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:44,500
I'm not over yet.

697
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,520
I'm not over yet so who says it's over?

698
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:54,310
No. No, no. No, no!

699
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:57,780
It can't end like this.

700
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,750
No.

701
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,360
I worked so hard to get here.

702
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,310
I abandoned something
precious to get here.

703
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,500
It can't end like this.

704
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,240
Never. It can't end like this.

705
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:19,030
I'm Yoo Ji Na...
It can't end like this at all.

706
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:28,900
No. No. No, it can't be.

707
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:55,020
I think it will be hard for her to
continue as a singer after this incident.

708
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,660
She can't handle her own life.

709
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,400
You ended it for her.

710
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,410
Why are you putting this on me?

711
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,760
Was that interview necessary?

712
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:12,540
Because of that shock, she couldn't get
her head on straight and this happened.

713
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,450
She is no longer a part
of this family, anyway.

714
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:18,310
Did you have to lash out like that?

715
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:22,650
We had to clean house
if a new person is to come in.

716
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:25,830
Who is going to bring a new person in?

717
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,510
What?

718
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,050
Please butt out of my business.

719
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,690
How can I do that? You are my child.

720
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,650
Think of it as fate for
having a mother like me.

721
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:43,030
I am very disappointed in you, Mother.

722
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:46,090
I have been more than
disappointed by you.

723
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,720
Do you feel empty after that breakup?

724
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,000
You have no pride in
front of your children.

725
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,310
Goodness.

726
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,250
Let's eat. Eat.

727
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,730
A person's heart is so strange.

728
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:22,350
I feel bad for her.

729
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,940
Have you forgotten
all the things she did to you?

730
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,860
Even the comments?

731
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:29,920
Of course not.

732
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,480
She screwed you over royally.
What are you talking about?

733
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:38,120
She probably has no one to talk
to about what happened today.

734
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,230
She broke up with
Chairman Park Sung Hwan as well.

735
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:45,020
Who can she talk to
and vent her feelings?

736
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,600
If that woman permed
her hair, I did it too.

737
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,680
If she gained weight so did I.

738
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,900
If she changed the way she
did her makeup, I changed it too.

739
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,970
If she came out with a new song...

740
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:14,060
I would get excited and act as if
I was the one who came out with it.

741
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:22,550
I had no idea I would see
her demise with my own eyes.

742
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,410
I'm not drinking as Jung Hae Dang today.

743
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:39,120
I'm drinking as Yoo Ji Na's
impersonator, Yoo Jui Na.

744
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,830
I get what you're saying
to a certain extent.

745
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,180
What would you like?

746
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,820
- A bottle of soju please.
- Sure.

747
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,770
Huh?

748
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:07,640
It's Yoo Ji Na.

749
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,180
Why would that woman
come to a place like this?

750
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,470
The truth is, this is
the place we first met.

751
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,800
I'm sorry, but can you leave?

752
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,420
What if she says something strange?

753
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,840
Just go. Please.

754
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,770
Can I sit with you?

755
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,240
Are you satisfied?

756
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,130
I remember the day we first met.

757
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,130
We met here.

758
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,050
Do you think I'm satisfied?

759
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,630
My career is over.

760
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:30,480
Once my life started to get
complicated... it happened in an instant.

761
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:38,520
I don't know
what you will make of this...

762
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,620
but I felt my career was over with you.

763
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:51,720
It doesn't mean that I'll
have fewer appearances.

764
00:57:53,060 --> 00:58:01,880
While watching my downfall, at least
one person felt their downfall as well.

765
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:06,150
"Don't feel so lonely." Is that it?

766
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:15,830
I know more than anyone else
how hard you tried to get there.

767
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,210
The name Yoo Ji Na.

768
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,360
I lived for that name.

769
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,050
And you succeeded.

770
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:44,080
But you couldn't fill
the emptiness inside with success.

771
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,530
That's why you were so thirsty for love.

772
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:55,340
Do you think... Would love be enough?

773
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:12,070
You still understand me.

774
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,420
You're the only one
in the world who does.

775
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:26,700
I wanted to succeed,
and I wanted to love.

776
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:32,440
That's all I wanted.

777
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,890
You don't love
Chairman Park Sung Hwang, do you?

778
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,420
You shouldn't have announced
an engagement to him.

779
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:46,160
That's when everything
became complicated.

780
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,580
He knew about the existence of my son.

781
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,160
Really?

782
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,420
He threatened to expose everything.

783
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:07,430
That's why I was forced
to announce the engagement.

784
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,530
So that's what happened...

785
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,500
Ultimately...

786
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:23,070
Ultimately, my life got complicated
because of my son's existence.

787
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:36,280
It's late. Call the car.

788
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,520
Is it okay if I leave first?

789
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,120
I...

790
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:54,380
met my son.

791
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,880
He grew up well.

792
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,030
You met your son?

793
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,020
I pretended not to know him.

794
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,070
Why?

795
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,200
What would be the use now?

796
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:21,520
If I said I am his mother
and he is my son?

797
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:28,810
As you said...
I'm ultimately this kind of person.

798
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:32,440
If I weren't this kind of person...

799
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:36,570
I wouldn't have abandoned
that young child.

800
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:44,050
If you hadn't known
of his existence, we...

801
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:49,700
would probably not be in this position.

802
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,120
Is that so?

803
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,590
I'm going to go.

804
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:51,890
For the past 10 years, not a day passed
that I didn't think about Yoo Ji Na.

805
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,920
Of course not.

806
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,530
You were her impersonator.

807
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,530
Who can understand how I feel?

808
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,080
I think I can understand.

809
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:12,700
It would've been nice if
you two got along at the end.

810
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:21,200
I know her big secret.

811
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,280
What secret?

812
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:28,070
A secret that could
shake up her whole world.

813
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:31,830
Really?

814
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,090
She said this to me today.

815
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:43,140
Our relationship wouldn't
have gotten to this point

816
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:46,800
if I didn't know that secret.

817
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:55,340
That woman's greatest secret and
greatest weakness was found by me.

818
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:01,740
Can you imagine how uncomfortable I was?

819
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,890
What is that secret?

820
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:11,430
By any chance... is it about her son?

821
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:17,640
How do you know about that?

822
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,460
I heard a similar story a long
time ago from an orphan friend.

823
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:26,840
I didn't believe it to be true.

824
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:30,550
It was true?

825
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:36,420
She met her son.

826
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,900
What?

827
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:47,370
She met him but
pretended not to know him.

828
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:54,510
Why?

829
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,930
"What would be the use now?"

830
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:00,630
"If I said I am his mother
and he is my son?"

831
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:04,850
That's what she thought.
