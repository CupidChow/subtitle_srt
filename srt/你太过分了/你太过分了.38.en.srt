00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,139
(Episode 38)

2
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:19,929
You... You vulgar creature!

3
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:24,976
- M-Mother...
- You're done for now!

4
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:31,423
I'll let you two talk. I'll be going now.

5
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:45,226
I'll change my clothes and come out.
Please leave.

6
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,539
You want me to leave?

7
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:22,406
You left your son in the
care of my old son...

8
00:01:23,937 --> 00:01:28,132
and were having fun with a
younger man behind his back?

9
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:34,632
You were desperate to use your
son to get the inheritance...

10
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:38,750
but you were doing this with
another man behind our backs?

11
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:45,896
- Please give me one chance, mother.
- Give you a chance?

12
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:50,797
- Would you if you were in my shoes?
- I'll be good to you from now on.

13
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:54,609
- You'll be good to me?
- Mr. Park can't live by himself anyways.

14
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:59,179
If he gets remarried to another woman, the
same thing will happen all over again.

15
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,117
So please give me one chance.

16
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:06,796
If you do, I'll do as you say from now on.

17
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:10,882
So, just this once, please
pretend you didn't see this.

18
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,468
- You want me to pretend I didn't see this?
- Mother.

19
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:16,248
So eventually, this day has come.

20
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:19,354
The day to settle things once and
for all with you has finally come.

21
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:24,608
You had a child whose father you don't
know and pushed him into our home.

22
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:27,960
Then you pull a repulsive stunt like this?

23
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:32,125
What did you take my son for?
How dare you do this!

24
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,085
You're done for now!

25
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:39,632
I'm a victim of your son, too!

26
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:47,492
What? "Your son?"

27
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:51,523
Your son Park Sung-hwan is the one
who had forced me to marry him!

28
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:55,843
Now you're acting up since everything
is over? How dare you, you wench?

29
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:59,765
Did you just call me "you?"

30
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:04,882
Because of your son, I've become
a wench with a twisted life.

31
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:06,632
You brat!

32
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:09,561
I'm curious to see what
your mother, who died

33
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:12,351
after having a daughter
like you, looked like!

34
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:16,085
Both of you are vulgar creatures!

35
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:22,562
"Vulgar creatures?"

36
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,148
You already made me into a
vulgar creature, so how

37
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,320
dare you accuse both of us
as being vulgar creatures?

38
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:31,460
What do you think you're doing?

39
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:37,023
Unless you're going to kill me, I suggest
you don't try to teach me a lesson.

40
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:39,977
What? Back off!

41
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:45,062
I may be a vulgar thing, but I'm better
than you who is the mother of a murderer!

42
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:46,695
What?

43
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:49,895
You gave birth to a
murderer and psychopath,

44
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,425
yet you dare call me a vulgar creature?

45
00:03:55,207 --> 00:04:00,262
- Do you think I'll quietly be chased out?
- Then what will you do?

46
00:04:00,286 --> 00:04:03,300
Your son's life is in my son's hands.

47
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:08,112
With the letter that my son has, Mr.
Park's life will be over.

48
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:13,901
So, unless you're going to
kill me, don't mess with me!

49
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:20,011
You raised your son to be a murderer, so
how dare you try to teach me a lesson!

50
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:30,378
Fine. If my son murdered someone,
then he must pay the price.

51
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:36,598
My last wishes are to make my
son pay the price for his crime

52
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:40,714
and free my grandsons from all
obstacles for their future!

53
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:44,011
So don't you dare threaten me!

54
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:50,247
I treated you graciously, so you
still can't come to your senses!

55
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,550
Come out!

56
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:58,456
I have to show my son what you looked like
while you were in bed with another man!

57
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:02,503
My son must see what you
looked like while you were

58
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,424
fooling around in bed with
another man in broad daylight!

59
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,416
Come out! I said come out!

60
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,300
Let go. Let go of me!

61
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:15,042
- Let me change first!
- What do you mean you'll change?

62
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:19,487
The entire world must see you like this!
Come out!

63
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:22,214
- I said come out!
- Let go of me!

64
00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:31,159
I suddenly feel so dizzy...

65
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:40,347
Mother! Mother! Mother, wake up! Mother!

66
00:05:42,878 --> 00:05:45,347
An ambulance. An ambulance.

67
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:37,878
It's past the time she should
be down, but she wasn't coming.

68
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:50,175
Mrs. Sung! Mrs. Sung! Mrs. Sung!

69
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:52,477
Did you call for an ambulance?

70
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:55,479
She fainted, so where do
you think you're going?

71
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,887
Talk with me first.

72
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:03,909
Now I'm the lady of GR Group.

73
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,098
I would like to give you a chance.

74
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:37,511
What happened to Mrs. Sung?

75
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,401
She's still unconscious.

76
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:45,190
- Do you mean she could pass away?
- It's heaven's will.

77
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:55,225
This is the $100,000 I promised you. Did
you bring the evidence you collected?

78
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:59,198
- I gave it all to Mrs. Sung.
- What did you say?

79
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,894
You mean you gave her everything
without leaving anything behind?

80
00:08:07,683 --> 00:08:08,798
Listen to me carefully.

81
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,917
Someone collapsed in my studio and ended
up in a situation where she might die.

82
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,003
I don't want to be
involved in this anymore.

83
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:19,595
Are you saying you already
got what you wanted?

84
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:24,039
You must not have given it to her for free.

85
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,972
I clearly told you I don't want
to be involved in this anymore.

86
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:30,876
Don't contact me again.

87
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:45,104
My mother said she had to use a lawyer,
so I gave her Im Cheol-woo's number.

88
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:49,214
But he's not even a lawyer?

89
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:52,136
What happened?

90
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:58,034
Why did you lie that he was a lawyer
and introduce him to Hyun-sung?

91
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,573
I thought he was a lawyer, too.

92
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:05,347
Didn't you say you were friends
with him since college?

93
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,167
There are many fake college
students these days.

94
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,753
We didn't even attend the same college.

95
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:15,247
Does that make sense? You said he
went to the same church as you.

96
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,445
I did see him at church, but
we weren't even that close.

97
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,128
What did Mr. Yoon say?

98
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:25,563
He said it was past the
time she was supposed to

99
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:27,770
come down, so he went up
because he was worried.

100
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:31,206
When he was able to open the door
with the help of the security team,

101
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,284
he found her unconscious
on the floor by herself.

102
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,261
Where did Im Cheol-woo go during that time?

103
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:45,698
We don't know where he went, but the
cleaning lady saw him leaving his studio.

104
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:52,550
After that, she said she heard
women fighting in the studio.

105
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:58,284
At the very least, he
didn't do something to her.

106
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,136
So who is the woman who
fought with grandmother?

107
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:05,104
- Who knows? How would we know that?
- Why wouldn't you know?

108
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:09,550
It's you.

109
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:15,174
- What?
- You were having an affair with Im Cheol-woo.

110
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,253
So grandmother had gone there
to catch you in the act!

111
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,034
What on earth are you saying right now?

112
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,972
Why don't you write a novel?

113
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,193
I know you hate me, but are you
trying to make me into a murderer?

114
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:36,819
Now that your grandmother is
unconscious and you have no

115
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:39,256
one to protect you, you dare
knock me down like this?

116
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,167
You've gone mad. You're crazy!

117
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:46,808
If I had been at the scene, wouldn't Mr.
Yoon have seen me?

118
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,852
Or at the very least, he
would have told you that

119
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:52,222
he had driven your
grandmother there to see me.

120
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,792
Mr. Yoon clearly said he had
taken her to the studio thinking

121
00:10:57,347 --> 00:11:00,197
it was an office because she
said she had to see a lawyer.

122
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:05,261
Don't you have anything to say, Na-kyung?
What about you, Hyun-sung?

123
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:10,550
Say what? So all of you
planned this out, didn't you?

124
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:15,761
Did you brothers decide
to make a plan to knock

125
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:18,457
me down because your
grandmother is unconscious?

126
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:21,683
All of you, look at me in the
eyes and say it clearly.

127
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:25,823
I will never allow you to
accuse me without any evidence!

128
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:33,535
What the hell is wrong with you?

129
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,636
We didn't gain anything, and my
grandmother fell unconscious.

130
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:40,565
I-I didn't know things
would turn out this way...

131
00:11:40,752 --> 00:11:46,293
- I told you to get Ji-Na first. Did I or did I not say that?
- You did...

132
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:48,409
You were rash to keep my
brother in check and ended

133
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:50,589
up only doing something
beneficial for Ji-Na.

134
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,808
What are you going to do? What
on earth are you going to do?

135
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:57,581
- I won't try to be smart again.
- Are you kidding me?

136
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:01,597
- I did this for you.
- You mean you did this for you.

137
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,019
I'm not in a good condition either.

138
00:12:04,152 --> 00:12:08,503
I'm disgusted by a woman like you.

139
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:11,401
- What?
- Why do you use that brain of yours?

140
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:13,987
Every time you use it, you
end up benefiting others.

141
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:19,175
I won't use it! I'll never use it again!
I'll never try to be smart again!

142
00:12:19,832 --> 00:12:23,019
- Don't worry!
- What right do you have to raise your voice?

143
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:26,722
- Fine! Let's get a divorce!
- What?

144
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:30,370
I want to get the three million
dollars and live comfortably.

145
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:34,104
It would be comfortable for me to
not have to deal with any of this!

146
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,934
Who will give you the
three million dollars?

147
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,488
You'll only get it if my grandmother
makes you get a divorce.

148
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:40,136
You didn't write that contract with me.

149
00:12:40,488 --> 00:12:42,773
I'm not going to give you a
single penny if we divorce,

150
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:44,823
so do your best to get
it from me in a lawsuit.

151
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:47,925
- What?
- You're always changing sides.

152
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:52,483
If my grandmother doesn't wake
up, you'll be the first to go.

153
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,879
Didn't you keep changing sides as well?

154
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,893
Changing sides according to the
situation is survival instinct!

155
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:04,245
Do you still have something to say? Do you?

156
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:08,331
She bought off Mr. Yoon.

157
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:12,339
Once your grandmother wakes up,
everything will be revealed.

158
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,690
- What if she doesn't wake up because of her old age?
- She'll surely wake up.

159
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:25,269
What happened that day? You should
at least tell me the truth.

160
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:27,647
There's no such thing as
the truth in this family.

161
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:30,761
There are only those who
remain until the end.

162
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:33,549
You told me something had happened
between you and Im Cheol-woo.

163
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:37,745
- Did you do something to Mrs. Sung?
- I didn't do anything.

164
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,992
Her blood pressure must
have risen because she got

165
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:44,089
dizzy and hit her head on
something as she fainted.

166
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:48,769
- Do you think I pushed her?
- Everything is over once she wakes up.

167
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:52,206
How could you blatantly lie
when you were there that day?

168
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:57,003
All I can do is hope she won't wake up
and just passes away in that state.

169
00:13:57,832 --> 00:14:02,354
- What?
- I've put my all into this, too.

170
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,839
You dug your own grave.

171
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,678
We'll have to watch until the end
to see whose grave it truly is.

172
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:49,534
You should rest at home.
Why did you come here?

173
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:51,839
Grandmother, I'm here.

174
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:59,456
She was always neat and tidy
and loved to decorate herself.

175
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:03,995
I don't remember seeing her
with a hair out of place.

176
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:12,082
She used to be a person who boasted power
like she could make a flying bird fall.

177
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:16,683
Now that she's lying here
unconscious, she just looks

178
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:19,175
like a normal elderly woman
who is in her eighties.

179
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:30,948
I don't remember holding her hand.

180
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,573
Now that she became like this,
I'm finally holding her hand.

181
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:38,894
Grandmother.

182
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:44,264
Why is she already caring for
her sick grandmother-in-law

183
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:46,410
when it hasn't been that
long since she got married?

184
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:48,153
Aren't they going to hire a caretaker?

185
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:52,487
Do you think a caretaker solves everything?
Caretakers are like masters.

186
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,354
Do you think money solves everything?

187
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:57,453
The most miserable thing is when you're old

188
00:15:57,477 --> 00:16:00,316
and have no descendents
to come and see you.

189
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:03,307
Maybe she adored Hae-dang
so much because she needed

190
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:05,964
descendents to look after
her when she's sick.

191
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,347
She probably didn't know she would faint.

192
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:13,628
I'm sorry to Mrs. Sung, but this is the
worst thing for a newly-wed bride.

193
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:20,417
Taking care of someone ill is hard work.
It's a mortal blow.

194
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:25,198
Being tired is one thing...
but who will protect her now?

195
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,870
She should've endured a bit longer.

196
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:31,101
Gosh. If you think about it now,
Yoo Ji-Na is freaking lucky.

197
00:16:31,246 --> 00:16:35,401
She was born with some kind of luck. Isn't
that why she succeeded as a singer?

198
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,604
There are plenty of good
singers in the world.

199
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:41,537
Mrs. Sung was a frightening
person, but she was

200
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:45,355
good to me, so she made me
think of my late mother.

201
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,776
Let's go check up on her often.

202
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:51,956
I bet it's Yoo Ji-na's world now.

203
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:01,761
Please just fall permanently asleep.

204
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,394
The long and tiring fight is now over.

205
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:13,847
Mrs. Sung Kyung-ja, I have won.
This vulgar creature has won.

206
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:35,591
Good morning, mother.

207
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:40,026
Now the old hag isn't here to
take your side anymore. Poor you.

208
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:45,300
This is why you'll always be Yoo G-Na.

209
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:48,948
Look how unfortunate your life is.

210
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,789
As soon as you got married into this
family, the old hag fell unconscious.

211
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:56,269
Aren't you talking too harshly about
someone lying in the hospital?

212
00:17:56,496 --> 00:17:59,698
Did you end up singing at a cabaret
because you couldn't sing as well as me?

213
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:04,684
It's because you were born
with an unlucky life.

214
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:08,155
This is why you'll never win against me.

215
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,080
Now do you realize that, Jung Hae-dang?

216
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:29,440
I told Kyung-soo to join us. I didn't like
the emptiness without your mother around.

217
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:33,517
You did the right thing.

218
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:38,620
They say a good person needs to come into
the family in order for it to be at peace.

219
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,519
The wrong person must have come in because
all these terrible things are happening.

220
00:18:43,738 --> 00:18:45,526
Who are you talking about?

221
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,136
When are you going to fix the way you talk?

222
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:53,261
- "You?" - Then must a mother
speak formally to her own son?

223
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:57,300
If you're disgusted, leave this house.

224
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:02,323
Now I'm going to be the one
to discipline the family.

225
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:05,956
I'm the oldest woman here, so
who else would do the job?

226
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:11,507
Honey, if Hyun-joon doesn't listen to us,

227
00:19:11,531 --> 00:19:14,480
- disconnect his credit cards.
- Disconnect what?

228
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:17,308
That's how you're supposed to
teach a lesson to your kids.

229
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:19,683
Let's eat.

230
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,784
The kids' dead mom must
have been too busy with the

231
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,401
household chores to teach
them some manners.

232
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:28,802
So I should teach them. Who else will?

233
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:35,456
- "Kids' mom?"
- See?

234
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:39,241
Just look at him getting up
when his elders are talking.

235
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:43,323
She taught such terrible manners
to her kids before she died.

236
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:45,557
Come out. Come out!

237
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:48,978
I'm in the middle of eating,
so where would I go?

238
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:52,034
Kyung-soo, eat a lot.

239
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:55,893
There's no one we have to be afraid
of anymore, so let's eat in peace.

240
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:03,079
Starting from tomorrow, I'm going to
leave the cooking to the housekeepers.

241
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,635
- What?
- I used to do all the cooking because grandmother had a picky taste,

242
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:10,229
but there's no reason for
me to do this anymore.

243
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,409
Do as you like.

244
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,221
Who says she can do as she likes?

245
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:18,643
You can't. Just keep cooking
like you always did.

246
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:21,906
I don't know about
anything else, but I can't

247
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,808
let others be in charge
of the family's meals.

248
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:26,730
- Then you cook yourself.
- What kind of disrespectful attitude is that?

249
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:29,424
I've done enough.

250
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,534
How dare you talk back to me? Did
your parents teach you that?

251
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:38,854
I'll cook, so please stop.

252
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,819
What do you know about cooking?

253
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:44,838
The ones who should cook are
people who ate proper food before.

254
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:49,049
You didn't eat much at home, so why
are you claiming you'll cook for us?

255
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:52,331
Let's eat in peace.

256
00:20:53,581 --> 00:20:56,635
Honey, eat this.

257
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,738
You said you were feeling under the
weather because it's gloomy lately.

258
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:02,953
I'm also worried that the family order will

259
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:05,215
be disrupted because my
mother has collapsed.

260
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:11,924
Follow your mother's orders
to avoid any commotions.

261
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,620
Finally, the family's discipline
is being properly fixed.

262
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:26,042
Don't you feel like the air of
the house has become clean?

263
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:29,950
In homes with old people, it can't be
helped that there's a certain odor.

264
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:34,932
What do you mean there was an odor in
this big house that is cleaned often?

265
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,143
To be honest, don't you feel a bit relaxed?

266
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,730
I don't know.

267
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:43,448
Your mother had ruined everything in front

268
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:45,972
of your kids before you
could get a word in.

269
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:50,737
From now on, I'm going to be
the one to keep your dignity.

270
00:21:55,722 --> 00:21:57,846
- Good-bye, father.
- Good-bye.

271
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,284
Your mother isn't even home,
so why would you go in there?

272
00:22:11,511 --> 00:22:16,456
Every morning, I used to come in here and
say good-bye to her before I left for work.

273
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:22,956
- Honey...
- I feel emptier than I thought I would.

274
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:26,843
You don't have a reason to feel empty.
You have me.

275
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,137
I grew up as an only child
and solely relied on her.

276
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:37,495
Even though he argued sometimes,
I feel empty right now.

277
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:41,745
You can rely on me now.

278
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:46,331
I really didn't know she
would collapse overnight.

279
00:22:46,737 --> 00:22:50,268
You've done enough as a filial son.
How could you be be any nicer to her?

280
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:02,870
My sons are no better than strangers.

281
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:10,162
If you hadn't been here at a time like
this, what would I have done by myself?

282
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:12,183
I know.

283
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,764
She's celebrating that a new day has come.

284
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:24,940
This is why daughters-in-law wish for
their mothers-in-law to pass away.

285
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:31,213
Father has become weak-hearted and
is walking on eggshells around her.

286
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:36,018
At times like this, we need
to be faithful to our roles.

287
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:38,737
Are you reading from a textbook
about disciplined life?

288
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:44,073
What I mean is that we should quietly do
our tasks while waiting for good results.

289
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,213
They say misfortunes never come singly.

290
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:50,128
- Sister-in-law.
- You don't have to call me that when we're not around others.

291
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:54,542
Whether we like it or not,
we're on the same boat now.

292
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:57,612
That's what the situation is like.

293
00:23:57,792 --> 00:23:59,620
Why would you split the family into teams?

294
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:01,737
At times like this, you're
so full of yourself.

295
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,729
Didn't you see what she did earlier?

296
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:10,034
You're probably more disgusted than I am,
so why are you pretending to be innocent?

297
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:16,276
Na-kyung, you can't try to win
against people by acting smart.

298
00:24:16,878 --> 00:24:21,206
Oh, really? Then how do
you win against them?

299
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:25,353
No one can beat someone who
consistently does their

300
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:28,714
job without getting tired
and waits silently.

301
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:35,135
Oh, I see. So this is how arrogant you are.

302
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:38,354
Everyone is arrogant in
their own diverse ways.

303
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:42,471
The one who has maintained
this house by preparing

304
00:24:42,788 --> 00:24:47,159
three meals a day for
grandmother is me, Ko Na-kyung.

305
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:51,135
How dare you rashly try to preach to me?

306
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,487
There's no need to get angry. I
was saying it for your sake.

307
00:24:55,753 --> 00:24:58,182
But now that I think
about it, you're right.

308
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,942
It must have been tiring
and difficult to prepare

309
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:04,222
three meals for your grandmother-in-law.

310
00:25:05,644 --> 00:25:07,971
I was wrong. Don't be angry.

311
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:10,143
You should've come out like this sooner.

312
00:25:10,534 --> 00:25:13,602
However, Na-kyung, by
trying to be smart, you

313
00:25:13,626 --> 00:25:16,958
gained nothing and just
made grandmother that way.

314
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:22,526
That's true. I gained absolutely
nothing from running around.

315
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:27,440
Ko Na-kyung, I need to speak to you.

316
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:31,160
Don't you have anything to say to me?

317
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:33,285
That's not the reason why
I'm keeping my mouth shut.

318
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:36,659
Did you pull such a stunt to do
a good deed for Park Hyun-joon?

319
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:41,667
What I mean is, do you
think you're so clever?

320
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:44,792
Are you truly that confident?

321
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:48,393
Go ahead and tell Mr. Park now.

322
00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:53,885
I bet he'd be real pleased to know
you set up a trap to get rid of me.

323
00:25:55,628 --> 00:26:00,854
- This is why you lack two percent and Hyun-sung is as dull as a bear.
- Excuse me?

324
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:07,713
How dare you pull such a trick to get me.
Do you really want to get in trouble by me?

325
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:10,237
When grandmother wakes up,
this will all be over.

326
00:26:10,714 --> 00:26:14,198
I dove into the entertainment
industry empty-handed,

327
00:26:14,762 --> 00:26:18,329
and I've met a dozen
trucks of people like you.

328
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:24,885
My special talent is to destroy
people who try to be sly like you.

329
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:26,377
Is that so?

330
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:28,706
Now that Mrs. Sung isn't
here to side with you,

331
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:32,542
try to endure to the best of
your ability on your own.

332
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:52,323
Hae-dang.

333
00:26:57,151 --> 00:27:01,260
- You came.
- The caretaker and nurse are here, so why are you here the whole day?

334
00:27:01,627 --> 00:27:05,096
Just in case she might
wake up when I'm not here.

335
00:27:05,698 --> 00:27:08,135
Someone in the family needs
to be here when she wakes up.

336
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:10,909
I'll be here, so go home and get some rest.

337
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:13,800
No. You'll become bored.

338
00:27:13,824 --> 00:27:16,784
That's why we came together.
Once my mom and I start

339
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:19,487
talking, three to four
hours pass by in no time.

340
00:27:25,097 --> 00:27:27,476
I didn't even get to properly
greet you at the wedding,

341
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:30,151
but here we are, reuniting
in this situation.

342
00:27:31,745 --> 00:27:33,987
My name is Baek Mi-sook.

343
00:27:34,597 --> 00:27:38,182
I'm not in a good situation either,
so I'm living off of my in-laws.

344
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:41,768
And now, I'm taking care
of my in-law's in-law.

345
00:27:42,597 --> 00:27:49,112
Please wake up soon and
take care of Hae-dang.

346
00:27:58,776 --> 00:27:59,776
Hey!

347
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:02,101
Go home and sleep!

348
00:28:02,823 --> 00:28:06,623
How dare you snore here! The
nurses will make fun of you!

349
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:10,776
- Goodness!
- I'm going to drink something!

350
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:19,995
The VIP patient room is sure different.

351
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:24,088
It's like a hotel. It's very cool.

352
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:28,315
I'm going to spend my summer here.

353
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:33,628
What? You're going to spend your summer
here? She must wake up before then!

354
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,870
You're right.

355
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,768
Mrs. Sung, I apologize for acting flippant.

356
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:47,315
- I'm afraid the nurses will hear you!
- All right.

357
00:29:01,995 --> 00:29:03,496
I thought Hae-dang would be here.

358
00:29:03,653 --> 00:29:06,190
I sent her home to change her clothes.

359
00:29:06,472 --> 00:29:08,838
I'll stay here, so you can go home now.

360
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,956
Oh, heavens no. Someone must
watch over the hospital room.

361
00:29:14,323 --> 00:29:18,077
What do you mean by that? I, her
daughter-in-law, said I'll stay here.

362
00:29:18,284 --> 00:29:20,986
Well, all I meant was that I
couldn't leave her in the care

363
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,574
of the caretaker and nurse. I
didn't mean anything by it.

364
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:27,768
- So why are you getting so angry?
- I'm her daughter-in-law!

365
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:33,401
- What on earth are you imagining?
- I'm not imagining anything at all.

366
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:38,307
Thank you for the wedding gift.

367
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:45,588
I accepted it, but it was so lousy
that I gave it to my housekeeper.

368
00:29:46,464 --> 00:29:49,331
What did you say? That was quite expensive!

369
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:52,276
You're below our par anyways,
so you should've just used that

370
00:29:52,786 --> 00:29:55,888
money for your living expenses.
Why would you overdo yourself?

371
00:29:55,912 --> 00:29:58,940
Are you trying to pick a fight with
me when Mrs. Sung is lying there ill?

372
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,721
Mom, this is a hospital room.

373
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:06,042
To put it bluntly, I can't leave this
hospital room because I don't trust you!

374
00:30:06,706 --> 00:30:09,071
Who knows if you'll lay
a hand on those or not?

375
00:30:09,386 --> 00:30:14,839
What did you say? The most horrid thing
is foolish, uneducated people like you.

376
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:17,538
I'm glad you brought that up.

377
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:21,393
I may be uneducated, but
I'm no worse than you!

378
00:30:21,745 --> 00:30:25,940
- How much education did you get?
- I can't believe this.

379
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,300
Good job, mom!

380
00:30:34,722 --> 00:30:38,768
You're the only one who
can fight against her.

381
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:42,681
Did she contribute clothes
or food in my life?

382
00:30:42,823 --> 00:30:45,612
How dare a wench who abandoned
her own son show off!

383
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:46,769
Exactly!

384
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:52,026
Have you been well?

385
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,878
You should've agreed to meet me sooner.
Why are you meeting me now?

386
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:03,573
Well... it was a bit embarrassing for me to
quickly meet up with you again at our age.

387
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:09,128
What's wrong with our age? It's an age
where we can do all sorts of things.

388
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:11,252
Especially in the modern world.

389
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:14,628
Are you thinking of doing
all sorts of things?

390
00:31:14,815 --> 00:31:19,067
I don't exactly have an intention
to get remarried either.

391
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:26,979
It would be nice to have a friend to talk
with and go eat delicious foods with.

392
00:31:27,831 --> 00:31:29,807
Yes. That's true.

393
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:36,260
You have a very warm appearance.

394
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:41,924
Just looking at you makes
me feel comfortable.

395
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,430
That's flattering.

396
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:49,581
- Should we go eat rice with acorn jelly in cold broth?
- Sure. That sounds nice.

397
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:56,040
- Did you bring your car?
- No. I took the subway.

398
00:31:56,644 --> 00:31:58,331
Then I guess we can't go.

399
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,905
The restaurant that sells rice
with acorn jelly is in the

400
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:04,865
rural area, so we can't take
public transportation there.

401
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:10,112
- Don't you have a car?
- I'm sorry.

402
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:12,307
I guess you don't even have a car...

403
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:22,487
- But when is your gas station opening?
- Gas station?

404
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:25,856
According to Mr. Yeon
Bong-soo, you're going

405
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,679
to become the owner of a gas station soon.

406
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:31,042
That's not true.

407
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:36,565
I think you misheard him saying that I
work at a gas station for minimum wage.

408
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,385
I heard you're in-laws with GR Group.

409
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:47,411
- Pardon?
- So that was a lie. I thought it was a lie.

410
00:32:48,237 --> 00:32:54,526
- It's not a lie, but...
- It's not? Then you'll be getting a gas station soon.

411
00:32:55,417 --> 00:32:59,034
Why? Are you scared I'll
like you for your money?

412
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,510
Well, I don't know if this will
offend you or not, but I don't

413
00:33:03,695 --> 00:33:07,552
have enough money to be scared
of something like that...

414
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:11,362
Let's go eat rice with acorn jelly.
We can just take a taxi.

415
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,838
Well... to be honest...

416
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:18,745
I'm allergic to acorn.

417
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,159
There's such an allergy?

418
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:26,674
For some odd reason, whenever I
eat acorn jelly, I get diarrhea.

419
00:33:30,097 --> 00:33:35,552
She's a complete money-grubber! She's become
excited over the news of the gas station.

420
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:39,213
So this is why she begged
to see me again. Hmpf!

421
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:44,931
I wonder if they're having
a good time or not.

422
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:47,729
Yeah, right. They're too
old to have a good time.

423
00:33:47,862 --> 00:33:50,612
If you're 61, you're considered
to be in your youth nowadays.

424
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:55,901
My company CEO is 65, and whenever we go
hiking, he's the first one to reach the top.

425
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:57,909
He's not even breathless.

426
00:33:58,198 --> 00:34:00,135
Why is he still out at this hour?

427
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:04,409
He should call if he's going
to eat dinner outside.

428
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:11,248
Mom, that kind of comment is reserved for
wives who are talking about their husbands.

429
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,730
The neighbors keep misunderstanding you
because you keep saying stuff like this.

430
00:34:14,754 --> 00:34:17,651
Did I go out and ask people why
Jung Kang-sik isn't coming home?

431
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:23,065
- Why are you getting angry? Ouch!
- Stop eating them!

432
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:27,517
What if those two really end up together?

433
00:34:27,706 --> 00:34:30,253
That'd be great then!

434
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:33,639
- Bong-soo! Bong-soo!
- My dad must be home!

435
00:34:35,855 --> 00:34:37,526
- Bong-soo!
- Yes?

436
00:34:40,276 --> 00:34:42,784
Did you have a great time?

437
00:34:43,175 --> 00:34:47,708
Great time, my foot! Who on earth
is going to open up a gas station?

438
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,804
How dare you set me up
with a money-grubber!

439
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:57,621
Mrs. Sung had given you a
hint at the family meeting.

440
00:34:57,645 --> 00:34:59,805
- So you told her that?
- That's the only thing I

441
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:02,073
could show off about you,
so what choice did I have?

442
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,159
Then it's too bad! Why
would you tell her that?

443
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:10,760
Then who would marry someone purely
for their character at your age?

444
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:12,651
If there's no one, then that's too bad.

445
00:35:14,057 --> 00:35:16,435
How could you speak so
carelessly when my mom is going

446
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:18,620
to be swept up in rumors
if you don't get married?

447
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:22,036
Must I get married to a
money-grubber to keep Baek.

448
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,516
Mi-sook, I mean Mrs. Baek
Mi-sook, free from rumors?

449
00:35:26,894 --> 00:35:29,573
This is for the sake of the long
friendship you've had with her!

450
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,289
Why? Did her expression change when you
told her the gas station is no more?

451
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:37,268
What a nice dream for someone who
looks like a shaman to have.

452
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:40,808
Not just anyone can become the wife
of the owner of a gas station.

453
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:45,429
My goodness. Mrs. Sung should have fainted
after setting up a gas station for us.

454
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,932
- Honey!
- Huh?

455
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:50,096
- What's wrong with you?
- What did I do?

456
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:54,681
- Why are you being such a money-grubber?
- I became this way after living with you.

457
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:59,831
- So you look poor and became a money-grubber all because of me?
- Of course!

458
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:06,463
- Why are you becoming so strange as you age? You're such low class.
- What?

459
00:36:07,605 --> 00:36:11,647
You might have the luxury to
talk about class since you

460
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:17,323
survive on my money and live off your
family's house, but I'm different.

461
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:18,690
How are you different?

462
00:36:18,995 --> 00:36:22,510
- Who knows how long I'll be able to work at my company for?
- Excuse me?

463
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:26,789
Geez. It would have been
nice for me to work

464
00:36:26,813 --> 00:36:30,598
at your father's gas
station and go fishing.

465
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:32,851
Oh my gosh. I really hate this.

466
00:36:34,573 --> 00:36:36,190
Can't a man even dream?

467
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:40,573
This is the tearful dream of a salary
man who is pestered by his work life.

468
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,432
You must have picked up
that word from somewhere.

469
00:36:43,612 --> 00:36:45,800
Do you think that's a dream?
It's a beggar's spirit.

470
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:49,925
- A-A beggar's spirit?
- Yes. A dirt-poor beggar's spirit.

471
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:54,799
Then what's the difference between a beggar's
spirit and a dirt-poor beggar's spirit?

472
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:57,418
If you pick up food from the
ground and eat it while

473
00:36:57,442 --> 00:36:59,886
minding others, you have a
dirt-poor beggar's spirit.

474
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:05,276
So I guess it's in a much lower
class than just a beggar's spirit.

475
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:09,190
- Of course.
- Ha! How ridiculous!

476
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:14,088
You don't even know when she'll come back,
so you shouldn't clean it thoroughly.

477
00:37:17,784 --> 00:37:21,112
What do you mean we don't know when
she'll come back? How could you say that?

478
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:25,440
Do you know how old she is this year?
She's 83 years old.

479
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:29,456
Even though she wakes up, she's at an age
when it will be hard for her to come home.

480
00:37:30,597 --> 00:37:32,690
She'll just suffer at the hospital and die.

481
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:38,229
Should I just clean up this room?

482
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:52,135
- What are you doing?
- Not bad.

483
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,253
I hadn't even consider this.

484
00:37:57,448 --> 00:38:01,862
It will be fun calling the inferior
ones here and ordering them around.

485
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:06,190
What do you think? Do I look like
the owner of this master bedroom?

486
00:38:06,214 --> 00:38:09,409
Get up. Grandmother hasn't passed away yet.

487
00:38:13,612 --> 00:38:17,213
What do you think you're doing right now?
If grandmother saw this, she'd be repulsed.

488
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:19,979
Sit in front of me, you two.

489
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:24,893
You do know you have to kneel when you sit
in front of your mother-in-law, don't you?

490
00:38:27,245 --> 00:38:29,745
I said sit down. Don't you hear me?

491
00:38:30,698 --> 00:38:33,862
Why? You don't want to
kneel in front of me?

492
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:36,167
What a freak.

493
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:45,385
Ko Na-kyung, stop right there.

494
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:53,753
What? I'm a freak?

495
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:57,503
Say it again. Say it again!

496
00:38:59,972 --> 00:39:03,058
Why did you hit her? You could just use
your words. Why would you hit her?

497
00:39:03,082 --> 00:39:06,221
Do you want to be hit, too?
How dare you two!

498
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:08,909
Listen to me carefully.

499
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:14,417
The one you should serve as your elder
now is me! It's me, your mother-in-law!

500
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,088
Don't you dare talk ruthlessly
in front of me again.

501
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:21,690
From now on, I'm the lady of the house!

502
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:27,799
Are you okay, Na-kyung?

503
00:39:29,698 --> 00:39:34,518
If grandmother had witnessed this, she
wouldn't have let her get away with it!

504
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:38,878
How dare she! How dare she slap my cheek!

505
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:43,528
Grandmother! Grandmother!

506
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:10,947
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

507
00:40:11,511 --> 00:40:13,978
Are you crying? Did something happen?

508
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,452
- I'm so upset.
- Why? What happened?

509
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,089
Are you curious why Na-kyung
lied about Im Cheol-woo

510
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:27,660
being a lawyer and invited
him to our house?

511
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,472
Na-kyung said she had been deceived, too.

512
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:32,604
Do you think she would be
deceived by such a thing?

513
00:40:33,237 --> 00:40:35,620
Then are you saying she
did this on purpose?

514
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:41,354
- She had set a bait to make me fall into a trap!
- Set a bait?

515
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:44,034
She had even arranged for the
three of us to eat together.

516
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:47,659
She was desperate to set me up with him!

517
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:53,190
Thank goodness I hadn't fallen for him.

518
00:40:54,956 --> 00:40:56,674
If I had, what would have happened?

519
00:41:02,706 --> 00:41:06,823
How could she have thought of playing such
a trick on me if she thought highly of me?

520
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:10,729
I told you that you had to
be careful with Na-kyung.

521
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:14,203
I should've realized she
was up to something

522
00:41:14,227 --> 00:41:16,229
when she suddenly started
calling me "mother."

523
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:21,534
How could I live in the same house
with a terrifying girl like her?

524
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:26,467
Last time, she told me
to send Kyung-soo to a

525
00:41:26,491 --> 00:41:29,207
college of theology and
make him into a priest!

526
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:31,323
What?

527
00:41:34,331 --> 00:41:36,003
Where is she right now?

528
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:41,792
What one earth were you thinking
pulling such a stunt on her?

529
00:41:42,659 --> 00:41:45,518
How dare you play such a
trick on your mother-in-law?

530
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:49,659
Do you think she's easy?

531
00:41:51,331 --> 00:41:53,049
Do you think I'm easy?

532
00:41:54,753 --> 00:41:56,678
How much longer will you
use that foolish brain

533
00:41:56,702 --> 00:41:58,425
of yours to create problems in this family?

534
00:42:03,737 --> 00:42:04,737
Father...

535
00:42:06,245 --> 00:42:11,510
something happened between
mother and Im Cheol-woo.

536
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:16,424
What? Something happened between them?
What do you mean by that?

537
00:42:18,284 --> 00:42:19,284
She's lying.

538
00:42:19,612 --> 00:42:24,440
Do you think your lies will work right now?

539
00:42:24,784 --> 00:42:26,424
Of course, I don't have any evidence.

540
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:30,487
Grandmother must have put that
evidence somewhere nice and safe.

541
00:42:31,073 --> 00:42:35,602
However, even if there's no evidence,
it's a fact that she had an affair.

542
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:43,003
Did you see me with your own eyes?

543
00:42:45,198 --> 00:42:46,198
How could I?

544
00:42:47,056 --> 00:42:50,767
What man and woman in the world would sleep
together when someone is watching them?

545
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,551
Ko Na-kyung.

546
00:42:53,575 --> 00:42:55,690
Whether I saw it for myself
with my own eyes or not,

547
00:42:56,104 --> 00:42:58,417
something did happen
between you and Cheol-woo.

548
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:02,542
What does it matter what I saw
when you had an affair with him?

549
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,729
Watch your mouth.

550
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:11,745
You could believe me or not.

551
00:43:12,308 --> 00:43:18,018
However, she had an affair behind
your back. That's the fact here.

552
00:43:25,097 --> 00:43:28,432
No. It's not true. It's not!

553
00:43:32,605 --> 00:43:36,510
On my way home, I saw them embracing
each other at the front gate.

554
00:43:39,808 --> 00:43:40,808
You're lying.

555
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:48,451
- We met at the front gate that night.
- When? When did that happen?

556
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:52,917
He's lying! He's blatantly lying!

557
00:43:54,354 --> 00:43:59,277
Isn't that why you told him to take me
when he went exercising with Kyung-soo?

558
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:00,301
That's ridiculous!

559
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:07,292
Na-kyung kept calling me mother and acting
cute in front of me, so I threw her a bone!

560
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:13,635
What a show!

561
00:44:14,987 --> 00:44:18,731
So this is how you're knocking me
down just because your grandmother

562
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:21,792
is no longer here and you're
all driven into the corner.

563
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:30,213
You can't be fooled! You can't believe
them! If you do, you'll be the fool here.

564
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:32,920
I have no intention of
begging you to believe me.

565
00:44:33,558 --> 00:44:35,128
It's up for you to decide the truth.

566
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:41,251
Because in my eyes, you're nothing but an
idiot who embraces a woman who plays the

567
00:44:41,275 --> 00:44:46,794
coquette in front of you but cheats on
you with a young man behind your back.

568
00:44:50,628 --> 00:44:54,878
How dare they! Then bring me the evidence!
Bring it to me!

569
00:45:02,487 --> 00:45:03,940
Why are you looking at me like that?

570
00:45:05,308 --> 00:45:08,268
They could make up anything
if they team up to get me!

571
00:45:09,698 --> 00:45:11,948
I asked you! Why are you
looking at me like that?

572
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:17,956
My goodness! Your mother needs to wake up
as soon as possible for this to be solved!

573
00:45:18,464 --> 00:45:21,456
This is so unfair and unbelievable!

574
00:45:39,566 --> 00:45:42,768
You don't actually believe them, do you?

575
00:45:44,394 --> 00:45:47,588
They all planned this together! This
is their last attempt of rebellion!

576
00:45:50,691 --> 00:45:53,995
Are you sure nothing happened with him?

577
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:56,151
What would happen?

578
00:45:56,456 --> 00:46:00,120
Around that time, you couldn't sleep well
at night and you came home late, too.

579
00:46:00,144 --> 00:46:02,588
Do you think I'll fool you
and meet another man?

580
00:46:03,908 --> 00:46:07,549
I told you I met with a
friend and went to a funeral!

581
00:46:08,698 --> 00:46:10,098
I can't believe this.

582
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:11,815
This is a witch hunt.

583
00:46:12,878 --> 00:46:14,508
So this is what a witch hunt is like.

584
00:46:16,644 --> 00:46:21,823
Fine! What should I be afraid of? I'll
just back off. I'll just get a divorce.

585
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,563
Let's get a divorce.

586
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:27,667
A divorce?

587
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,549
How can they do this to me?

588
00:46:36,534 --> 00:46:38,534
Even though I did abandon my own child,

589
00:46:40,096 --> 00:46:42,581
but how could I do such an awful
thing when I have a husband?

590
00:46:44,394 --> 00:46:47,034
I can't live like this! This is too unfair!

591
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:50,667
It's too unfair for me to live like this!

592
00:46:51,605 --> 00:46:54,893
Let's get a divorce. I'd
rather get a divorce!

593
00:46:55,253 --> 00:46:57,582
How could I live with you when
they accused me like this?

594
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,870
I really can't live like this!
I really can't! I can't!

595
00:47:18,198 --> 00:47:20,307
You should be grateful
that you were able to

596
00:47:20,943 --> 00:47:23,401
escape danger, thanks to
grandmother collapsing.

597
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:28,799
How dare you talk flippantly
to knock me down?

598
00:47:30,003 --> 00:47:32,866
- What?
- It's your special talent to knock down people like me?

599
00:47:34,843 --> 00:47:37,874
I've spent years under Mrs. Sung Kyung-ja.

600
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:41,285
Do you think I'll be knocked
down by the likes of you?

601
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:46,312
Go ahead and try to knock me down. Go on.

602
00:47:47,023 --> 00:47:50,523
You've lost your mind since Mrs.
Sung has become that way.

603
00:47:50,547 --> 00:47:55,046
Yes. I've lost my mind. I've
got nothing to lose now.

604
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:57,483
You're just begging to
be chased out of here.

605
00:47:57,764 --> 00:48:00,194
Fine. Try and chase me out.

606
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:03,562
Do you think we're living
in the Joseon Era?

607
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:06,039
How could a father-in-law chase
his daughter-in-law out?

608
00:48:06,063 --> 00:48:09,421
Go ahead and chase me out a dozen times.
My husband won't divorce me.

609
00:48:10,835 --> 00:48:13,327
Everything else can be
caught with evidence.

610
00:48:14,304 --> 00:48:17,181
However, there's a different
way to catch cheating wenches.

611
00:48:18,015 --> 00:48:21,296
- "Cheating wench?" - Why
is your voice trembling?

612
00:48:22,547 --> 00:48:24,319
I'm just saying that's common.

613
00:48:24,898 --> 00:48:28,744
What I mean is that there is
commonly a different way to

614
00:48:28,768 --> 00:48:32,343
catch wenches who cheat
behind their husbands' backs.

615
00:48:50,922 --> 00:48:54,327
If you saw your mother,
you should greet her.

616
00:48:55,797 --> 00:48:56,797
You.

617
00:49:04,046 --> 00:49:06,733
Until when are you going to
live without greeting her?

618
00:49:07,976 --> 00:49:08,976
Until I die.

619
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:12,470
Is that what you call a man's pride?

620
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:16,752
Then is it a man's pride
to continue living with

621
00:49:16,776 --> 00:49:19,414
a woman who cheated on
you with another man?

622
00:49:20,437 --> 00:49:23,093
- What?
- On top of that, you even went to play golf with him.

623
00:49:23,617 --> 00:49:25,687
In other words, she's
making you into a fool.

624
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:29,554
If I were you, I'd be so embarrassed
that I'd bite my own tongue and die.

625
00:49:30,265 --> 00:49:33,058
Now your grandmother isn't
around to coddle you anymore.

626
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:38,944
- What I mean is that you should become wise in order to survive.
- Wise?

627
00:49:39,279 --> 00:49:43,264
I mean that you don't deserve to
hold your head highly and act

628
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:47,273
so prideful when there's no one
around to protect you anymore.

629
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:53,499
If you try to struggle to live
in a house without a roof,

630
00:49:54,484 --> 00:49:57,624
you'll realize what kind
of man you truly are.

631
00:50:00,117 --> 00:50:01,554
Bring me a cup of coffee.

632
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:16,819
This is your last chance.

633
00:50:18,421 --> 00:50:21,843
Your last chance to create a new
order when your mother isn't around.

634
00:50:22,797 --> 00:50:25,890
If you get pushed back now,
you'll become a pushover forever.

635
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:30,414
Up till now, they were
able to act disrespectful

636
00:50:30,664 --> 00:50:32,773
towards you because of your
mother's stubbornness.

637
00:50:33,271 --> 00:50:39,209
If you lose to them now, I may never be
able to get acknowledged as your wife.

638
00:50:40,468 --> 00:50:43,476
Disrespecting me means
they're disrespecting you.

639
00:50:44,453 --> 00:50:46,515
It means they think you're easy.

640
00:50:52,304 --> 00:50:56,322
Hyun-joon, starting from today, your
credit card won't work anymore.

641
00:50:58,452 --> 00:51:02,343
From now on, you earn the
money you're going to use.

642
00:51:04,289 --> 00:51:07,163
The entertainment agency is
having financial difficulty.

643
00:51:08,007 --> 00:51:10,460
Then apologize to your mother.

644
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:13,548
Apologize for what?

645
00:51:13,898 --> 00:51:16,319
Say, "I'm sorry, mother."

646
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:19,803
So what exactly am I sorry for?

647
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,210
Say that you'll respect her from now on!

648
00:51:22,476 --> 00:51:26,984
- I'd rather starve to death.
- Then starve to death or earn your own money.

649
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:35,238
Are you really going to be petty like this?

650
00:51:36,945 --> 00:51:40,312
- Why are you getting upset?
- It's dishonorable for you to disconnect his card!

651
00:51:41,273 --> 00:51:42,765
Listen to me carefully.

652
00:51:43,373 --> 00:51:50,734
If you disrespect your mom, it means you're
disrespecting me, so I won't let it slide.

653
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,952
If you think it's petty, leave this house.
I don't feel sad at all.

654
00:52:07,468 --> 00:52:09,135
I'll excuse myself first.

655
00:52:19,781 --> 00:52:22,047
We have the wedding gifts that
your grandmother gave me.

656
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:24,085
So you want to sell them?

657
00:52:24,187 --> 00:52:27,726
She probably gave them to us so that
we can use them at a time like this.

658
00:52:28,734 --> 00:52:30,622
I can't believe I'm
showing you this side of

659
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:32,406
- me as soon as we get married.
- It's fine.

660
00:52:32,586 --> 00:52:36,692
I envy Hyun-sung. He has a role
in the company, so the man

661
00:52:36,716 --> 00:52:40,611
who calls himself my father
can't chase him out of here.

662
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:44,929
I regret the fact that I didn't
go into the company sooner.

663
00:52:45,218 --> 00:52:48,206
If you get an opportunity in the
future, you can do your best then.

664
00:52:49,281 --> 00:52:51,976
- I'm sorry, Hae-dang.
- Why would you say that?

665
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,507
Are you going to work right now?

666
00:53:17,312 --> 00:53:19,898
Tell Mr. Park to let Hyun-joon
use his card again.

667
00:53:20,976 --> 00:53:22,413
Why would you worry about that?

668
00:53:22,437 --> 00:53:27,694
Mrs. Choi even gave me money when
I was blind before she died.

669
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:30,366
I'm not her.

670
00:53:31,226 --> 00:53:34,319
- Are you really going to be like this?
- I need to teach him a lesson.

671
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:36,757
He's not calling me "mother."

672
00:53:36,968 --> 00:53:39,650
Even I don't call you that. You
can't even be called "mother"

673
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,922
by your own son, so must you
hear him call you that?

674
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:44,429
How could you think of
disconnecting his card?

675
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:48,093
I'm so embarrassed that I can't
face Hyun-joon and Hae-dang.

676
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:51,241
- Why would you be?
- I'm embarrassed that I'm your son.

677
00:53:51,672 --> 00:53:56,804
Bear with it for a while. You'll
be grateful to me later on.

678
00:53:57,656 --> 00:54:01,319
- Are you really going to do this?
- This is why mothers must raise their children.

679
00:54:02,297 --> 00:54:05,312
You're grateful to Mrs. Choi?
If she had treated you like her

680
00:54:05,336 --> 00:54:08,390
real son, would she have raised
you to be ungrateful about money?

681
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:09,829
What?

682
00:54:09,853 --> 00:54:12,343
You don't know anything about having money.

683
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:15,526
Who else in the world is ungrateful
about money like you are?

684
00:54:15,705 --> 00:54:17,866
Don't you dare speak ill of Mrs.
Choi in front of me.

685
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:22,660
Just like Ko Na-kyung had said, Mrs. Choi had
raised you to become the perfect priest.

686
00:54:23,515 --> 00:54:26,171
Would she have done that if you
were her own son? Would she?

687
00:54:33,992 --> 00:54:34,992
Welcome!

688
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:41,648
Why do you look so down?

689
00:54:41,968 --> 00:54:45,234
- I just came because I thought of you.
- I'm glad you came.

690
00:54:46,796 --> 00:54:50,663
- Oh, how is your grandmother?
- So-so.

691
00:54:53,203 --> 00:54:56,536
- Is Hae-dang doing well?
- She's suffering a lot.

692
00:54:58,476 --> 00:55:00,819
Well, as long as she's healthy...

693
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,515
My father disconnected my credit card.

694
00:55:08,703 --> 00:55:12,164
My agency isn't doing so
well, so to be honest,

695
00:55:12,882 --> 00:55:15,000
I can barely pay my employees and rent.

696
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:20,679
There are ups and downs.
That's what business is like.

697
00:55:22,414 --> 00:55:24,546
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.

698
00:55:26,273 --> 00:55:27,740
So what? We're family.

699
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,851
We're not strangers.
We're family, so how can

700
00:55:31,814 --> 00:55:33,741
we only show our good sides to each other?

701
00:55:35,195 --> 00:55:38,819
Hae-dang must be very concerned about her
family, but I can't even help you out.

702
00:55:39,093 --> 00:55:41,757
Why would she worry about such a
thing when she's married now?

703
00:55:42,187 --> 00:55:45,046
Hae-sung delivers parcels,
and I work as well.

704
00:55:45,444 --> 00:55:47,960
You won't have much left after
paying off the bank interest.

705
00:55:48,117 --> 00:55:50,991
It's only Hae-sung and me,
so how much would we eat?

706
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:55,804
It's not like we have to send someone off
to school. We have enough. Don't worry.

707
00:55:57,022 --> 00:55:59,951
A son-in-law from a conglomerate
family is only good in label, right?

708
00:56:01,484 --> 00:56:02,484
It's fine.

709
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:06,741
- I like you very much.
- I like you, too.

710
00:56:07,585 --> 00:56:10,210
Who else could I talk about this with?

711
00:56:12,773 --> 00:56:15,296
I'm so shameless and guilty to Hae-dang.

712
00:56:15,953 --> 00:56:18,101
I talked big, but what's this?

713
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:21,851
She's probably worrying about you right
now. That's the kind of person she is.

714
00:56:22,468 --> 00:56:24,007
My goodness! It's totally fine!

715
00:56:24,234 --> 00:56:28,507
I make such a tiny salary, but I lost
all of them to buying stocks, and

716
00:56:28,694 --> 00:56:33,047
I'm living off my in-laws now, but
I'm still shamelessly enjoying life!

717
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:36,710
- That's right. That's right.
- No one is going to make you walk on eggshells here.

718
00:56:38,031 --> 00:56:39,617
That's the good thing about our family.

719
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:42,429
The worse off you are, the
bigger talker you are!

720
00:56:42,906 --> 00:56:45,405
- Right, father?
- Of course. Of course.

721
00:56:46,179 --> 00:56:48,372
It's bad enough that
you're worse off, so how

722
00:56:48,624 --> 00:56:50,398
could you live without being a big talker?

723
00:56:51,961 --> 00:56:54,999
I think I married pretty well.

724
00:56:55,023 --> 00:56:58,884
You're right. Our
father-in-law is the best...

725
00:57:00,452 --> 00:57:02,375
as long as he doesn't
have any foolish desires.

726
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:05,093
Who has foolish desires?

727
00:57:06,406 --> 00:57:07,460
My goodness!

728
00:57:11,648 --> 00:57:14,705
My grandmother collapsed so you won't
be getting the gas station now...

729
00:57:14,729 --> 00:57:19,922
It's absolutely fine! No one in
our family even wishes for that!

730
00:57:19,946 --> 00:57:22,007
He's lying.

731
00:57:23,734 --> 00:57:24,734
Honey.

732
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,913
He said it's his dream to quit his
job and work at the gas station.

733
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:32,507
Oh, come on!

734
00:57:33,672 --> 00:57:37,093
I know. Now that you put it
that way, I feel really guilty.

735
00:57:37,117 --> 00:57:42,624
Hyun-joon, you must feel guilty. Do you know
how excited he was about the gas station?

736
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,577
Honey, are you sure you're my wife?

737
00:57:51,898 --> 00:57:53,210
I'm just speechless!

738
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,280
This is how I'm living!

739
00:57:57,484 --> 00:58:01,249
Hyun-joon, don't be disheartened.
It's okay if you don't make money.

740
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:02,812
Why? Because you're handsome.

741
00:58:04,093 --> 00:58:06,024
Then what? It's not okay
if I don't make money?

742
00:58:06,048 --> 00:58:10,171
Of course. It'd be troublesome
if you couldn't even make money.

743
00:58:11,514 --> 00:58:14,671
- Would you like something else?
- No, I'm all right.

744
00:58:14,976 --> 00:58:16,226
You little...

745
00:58:22,835 --> 00:58:26,415
I want to be kicked out of my house
and live off of my in-laws, too.

746
00:58:26,734 --> 00:58:29,648
Do that then. That room is empty anyways.

747
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:32,593
It'd be great if all of us lived together!
Let's all live together!

748
00:58:32,984 --> 00:58:37,429
- Should we do that then?-
Yes, come and live here then!

749
00:58:38,046 --> 00:58:40,944
Are you coming home now? I
need to see you for a moment.

750
00:58:43,445 --> 00:58:46,577
Use these for now. Give one to Hae-dang.

751
00:58:51,272 --> 00:58:55,562
Did I ever apologize to you?

752
00:58:55,984 --> 00:58:57,280
Why should you apologize?

753
00:58:57,578 --> 00:59:00,523
Why else would mom have
left a letter to you only?

754
00:59:02,054 --> 00:59:09,421
Isn't it because she thought I
would give the letter to father?

755
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,734
Mom loved you very much.

756
00:59:13,406 --> 00:59:19,007
I know. She loved me, but
she didn't trust me.

757
00:59:19,468 --> 00:59:21,702
That's not something you have
to apologize to me about.

758
00:59:21,843 --> 00:59:24,999
Hyun-joon, didn't you ever hate me?

759
00:59:25,601 --> 00:59:29,077
I might have pitied you,
but I never hated you.

760
00:59:31,218 --> 00:59:35,437
You married a woman you didn't
love so that you could survive.

761
00:59:37,976 --> 00:59:43,952
Unlike me, you have a lot of patience,
so you're living well with Na-kyung now.

762
00:59:45,491 --> 00:59:48,672
- You're a kind man.
- I'm a weak, shameful fool.

763
00:59:49,148 --> 00:59:53,499
It's not your fault.
You're good and sincere.

764
00:59:53,953 --> 00:59:57,679
- My existence must have burdened you.
- Why?

765
00:59:58,156 --> 01:00:01,538
You fought against father
even though it was useless,

766
01:00:02,568 --> 01:00:07,616
but instead of helping you, I played his
faithful dog in order to survive by myself.

767
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:09,538
Now I rely on you a lot.

768
01:00:10,116 --> 01:00:13,701
I know you don't express it, but there
are many times I know you care about me.

769
01:00:14,718 --> 01:00:16,875
What if grandmother passes away like this?

770
01:00:18,337 --> 01:00:20,782
This was the last card we could
use to get rid of Yoo Ji-Na,

771
01:00:21,173 --> 01:00:24,688
but because of my greed,
things turned into a mess.

772
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:27,698
Grandmother will certainly wake up.

773
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,779
I'm sorry, Hyun-joon.

774
01:00:31,282 --> 01:00:35,266
I may disappoint you again in the future,

775
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:40,953
but at this moment, I sincerely
feel guilty towards you.

776
01:00:42,462 --> 01:00:45,266
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

777
01:00:46,884 --> 01:00:48,243
I said it's not your fault.

778
01:00:49,204 --> 01:00:50,289
Little punk.

779
01:00:58,074 --> 01:00:59,074
Father.

780
01:01:03,356 --> 01:01:06,199
- You're going through a lot of trouble.
- It's not trouble at all.

781
01:01:07,465 --> 01:01:10,761
We'll be here, so get some fresh air.

782
01:01:13,309 --> 01:01:14,309
All right.

783
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,463
Mother, I'm here.

784
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:32,761
Please just get up and yell at me.

785
01:01:34,051 --> 01:01:36,505
How could you just silently
lay here like this?

786
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,049
Mr. Park, the doctor would like to see you.

787
01:01:55,473 --> 01:01:57,019
I'll be back.

788
01:02:35,441 --> 01:02:36,441
Mother.

789
01:02:37,402 --> 01:02:39,199
Call my son.

790
01:02:43,183 --> 01:02:46,746
Are you... awake?

791
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:51,957
Call my son. I have something to tell him.

792
01:02:53,934 --> 01:02:55,605
Call my son.

793
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:31,816
("You Are Too Much")

794
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,815
Why aren't you going home? I'm
telling you to go home, so go home!

795
01:03:34,996 --> 01:03:36,876
How dare you to try to
pull a reckless stunt?

796
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,464
Grandmother woke up just now!

797
01:03:39,488 --> 01:03:41,583
You're really done for now.

798
01:03:41,607 --> 01:03:43,364
Don't you have something to say to my face?

799
01:03:43,388 --> 01:03:45,863
Please give me one chance!
I've committed a grave sin!

800
01:03:45,965 --> 01:03:48,506
We requested a video from Im Cheol-woo.

801
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:51,273
What will your husband's face
look like when he sees that?
