00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:07,906
(Episode 34)

2
00:00:13,242 --> 00:00:17,320
Now do you realize why I
disrespect your mother?

3
00:00:20,898 --> 00:00:26,648
Once I expose these photos to the
world, it's over for your mother.

4
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:30,488
Before I call the reporters
and expose this to them,

5
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:33,257
hand over the letter and leave this house.

6
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,244
Disappear from Mr. Park Sung-hwan's side.

7
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:41,007
Give me that letter right
now and leave this house!

8
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:49,156
Then Park Hyun-joon,
it's over for you, too.

9
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,695
Am I the only one in that photo? What
kind of human being will you become?

10
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:55,667
You're going to become a man who did such a

11
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:57,709
horrid thing to the woman
your father liked!

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,290
Do you think you can
live without any shame?

13
00:01:00,314 --> 00:01:04,257
Don't worry. I'm already
prepared for my life to be over.

14
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,851
The moment I was born as Mr.
Park Sung-hwan's son,

15
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:10,695
I was cursed to live an
inhumane life anyways.

16
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:14,757
It's my wish to end all of
this as soon as possible!

17
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:18,828
Don't say that! Why
should your life be over?

18
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:21,412
He's the one whose life should be over!

19
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:25,424
Are you determined to ruin our family?

20
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:30,671
You dare put the woman who was taken in
these photos in our family registry?

21
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:34,648
Do you live alone in this world?
Do you fear nothing?

22
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:41,386
Kyung-soo, go to the annex.

23
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,699
Where do you think you're going?

24
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:56,922
Give me the letter. Give it to me!

25
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:59,093
I must find out how my mom died.

26
00:01:59,257 --> 00:02:01,931
Give me the letter! Give it to me!

27
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:05,164
- I told you I lost it.
- Do you want to die in my hands?

28
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,992
Do you really want to die in my hands?

29
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,440
What do you think you're doing?

30
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:15,914
Let go of him!

31
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:19,679
I dare you to lay a finger on him.

32
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:26,546
At that moment, I'm going to give
all of my company shares to him.

33
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:32,507
- What?
- So let go of him!

34
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:34,598
Fine! Go ahead! Give him everything!

35
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,945
Give him everything if you want to!

36
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:40,602
I'm going to beat this punk to
death right here right now!

37
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:42,250
Hyun-joon, calm down.

38
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:44,234
Please calm down!

39
00:02:44,813 --> 00:02:46,233
You've kept it in well this far.

40
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:52,953
Our late mom will never forgive Mr.
Park Sung-hwan. So hold back!

41
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,476
Let go of me! He said he was going
to give him all his company shares!

42
00:02:57,257 --> 00:03:00,429
He said he was going to give all his
company shares to this punk right here!

43
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:03,515
How could he say that
in front of you and me?

44
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:06,336
Go upstairs.

45
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:08,719
- Let go!
- Go up!

46
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:12,171
I'm going to put an end to the both of
them! Damn it! I've got nothing to lose!

47
00:03:12,273 --> 00:03:13,601
I'm going to end it all!

48
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:41,406
This is the first time I've
seen someone as vulgar as you!

49
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:47,390
I pity your son for being
born from a mom like you.

50
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:18,244
Get out. Don't turn the lights on.

51
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:26,343
- Why not?
- I don't even want to see your face. You're disgusting.

52
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:28,757
It's not what you think it is.

53
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:33,781
I told you it was a trap.
He made me fall for a trap.

54
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,992
A trap? Thank god it was,
but what if it wasn't?

55
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:51,281
What were you thinking
going to a hotel with him?

56
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:54,188
Fine.

57
00:04:55,945 --> 00:05:00,351
At that moment, I liked Park Hyun-joon.

58
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,398
Isn't who I like up to me?

59
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:08,203
- You were dating Mr. Park.
- No, I wasn't!

60
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,679
It was a one-sided love on his part.

61
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:14,814
I told him my moving dates
didn't match up, so he said

62
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:17,008
he would help me as a friend
and told me to stay here.

63
00:05:18,313 --> 00:05:21,660
Of course, after that,
I wanted to stay here

64
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:24,956
a bit longer because I
liked Park Hyun-joon.

65
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:31,671
- Yet, you got engaged to Mr. Park?
- I told you! He used you to blackmail me!

66
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:33,953
He had forced me to
announce our engagement!

67
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:41,144
Until that time, I was still a
singer, so I couldn't ignore

68
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:44,945
his threat that he would expose
your existence to the world.

69
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,570
That's why I had made the
engagement announcement.

70
00:05:49,102 --> 00:05:53,153
Other people would think I
liked a man and then married

71
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:56,648
his father, but that's not
the situation at all!

72
00:05:57,092 --> 00:06:00,089
If you liked Park Hyun-joon,
you shouldn't have gotten

73
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:03,326
engaged to Mr. Park, no matter
what the circumstances were!

74
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:05,646
Fine.

75
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:13,849
At that moment, I hadn't confessed the
fact that I had abandoned my son.

76
00:06:15,912 --> 00:06:17,443
If that's a crime, then it's my crime.

77
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:20,318
You're the only woman in this
world who could like a man's

78
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,865
son when you know very well
that the man likes you.

79
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,263
Nothing had happened with Mr. Park!

80
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:32,341
You're the only woman in
this world who could marry a

81
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:38,591
man after liking his son,
even though it was a threat.

82
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:45,167
You're also the only woman in this
world who could claim you love

83
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:49,521
that man after you married
him and be so greedy.

84
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:52,162
I have no choice.

85
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:58,216
My life as a singer is already over. All
I have left by my side is Mr. Park.

86
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:01,833
I feel filthy from being
born from someone like you.

87
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:04,795
What?

88
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:09,130
As your son, I'll have to
live with all these memories.

89
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:15,310
I don't know if I'll be able to live
without going insane. I'm terrified.

90
00:07:19,326 --> 00:07:21,286
- Kyung-soo.
- Don't even call my name!

91
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:26,954
It'd be better if I went back to being blind
and wasn't able to see anything again.

92
00:07:29,178 --> 00:07:30,544
I hate you so much.

93
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:34,094
I despise the fact that you're my mother.

94
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:47,834
Kyung-soo...

95
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,341
You and your temper.

96
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:04,110
Why did you try to hit Kyung-soo? If you
had, they would've found a fault with you.

97
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:08,235
Give me the photos and film.

98
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:11,680
Why would I give them to you?

99
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,618
- That's not how you should handle this.
- Does it look like I care?

100
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:20,149
- What would others think of our family?
- That's not the problem right now.

101
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,047
Just like Ji-na had said,
this will ruin you, too.

102
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:26,158
You had released an article
in the magazine, too.

103
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:29,144
I said the engagement had
broken off because she

104
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:32,189
had tried to seduce you. I
didn't let it harm you.

105
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:33,766
I don't care anyways.

106
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:37,188
It looks like I'll have to end
those two with my own hands.

107
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:43,298
You can't get hurt though. You're
the next owner of this house.

108
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:45,345
Do you think it will
turn out as you please?

109
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,923
I don't need the company
or anything at all!

110
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:51,470
I'm going to call the
reporters and shame those two

111
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,345
so they can never walk
around with confidence.

112
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,048
I can't wait for morning to come.

113
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:58,204
Goodness gracious.

114
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:01,563
He's going to give his
shares to Lee Kyung-soo?

115
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:05,016
He said that in front of Hyun-joon
and me without any guilt at all.

116
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:07,993
What does he take Hyun-joon and me for?

117
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,590
At those times, I really hate your father.

118
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:14,705
I wouldn't say anything if he
had made the company himself.

119
00:09:14,729 --> 00:09:16,927
I wouldn't even be able
to forgive him if he

120
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:19,001
gave the company he built to someone else.

121
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:20,962
Is this company even his?

122
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:26,715
He still has no intention to atone for
the sins he committed towards my mom.

123
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:31,649
Next time when a fight breaks out,
I'm going to get Kyung-soo myself.

124
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:35,462
- Honey.
- I'm not going to let him get away with this!

125
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:37,602
Do you think that will solve anything?

126
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:41,446
How can our father say he'll make a young
punk who isn't his flesh and blood into

127
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,798
his successor in front of his two sons
who are almost turning forty years old?

128
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:50,970
He's crazy. He's insane. He's totally mad!

129
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:07,525
Mr. Im Cheol-woo?

130
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:10,587
It's me.

131
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,618
You need to speed things up a bit.

132
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:22,102
Thank you for what you did earlier.
Park Hyun-joon is a thoughtless moron.

133
00:10:23,283 --> 00:10:24,766
How dare he try to hit my son?

134
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:33,821
You're the only one who can protect my son.

135
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:37,727
Kyung-soo did nothing wrong.

136
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:42,228
I pity him for the way he grew
up, but he almost got beaten

137
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:45,509
by his older brothers just for
being loved by his father.

138
00:10:46,642 --> 00:10:48,899
He must have gotten shocked
after seeing the photos.

139
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:53,391
He must have gotten very hurt.

140
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:56,220
Comfort him.

141
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:59,352
You just have to adore him more.

142
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:04,501
If you, his father, adores him
more, what would he be afraid of?

143
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:10,852
Kyung-soo and I only have you.

144
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,891
Who texted you at this hour?

145
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:31,118
(Im Cheol-woo)

146
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:34,665
Who is it?

147
00:11:35,197 --> 00:11:39,602
Oh, someone who used to be my stylist.

148
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:44,001
- Why would she contact you so late?
- Go ahead and sleep first.

149
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:47,868
Why would you take it outside?
You can talk here.

150
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:51,548
You must be tired. Sleep first.

151
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:57,368
She told me her mom had suddenly
fallen ill. Maybe she needs money.

152
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,649
Can you talk right now?

153
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,868
- Hello?
- Why did you call me at this time?

154
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,217
I thought I would be able to
sleep if I hear your voice.

155
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:47,016
It's too late, isn't it? Did I bother you?

156
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:55,891
Thank you for the photo. I
wanted to get that photo, too.

157
00:12:57,056 --> 00:12:59,204
I'll give you the photo.
Should we meet tomorrow?

158
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:02,087
Tomorrow?

159
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:06,579
I'll ask Na-kyung.

160
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,852
No. Just come out by yourself.

161
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:12,391
Can I be honest?

162
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:16,087
I really miss you right now.

163
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:20,470
Ever since the first day we
met, I can't focus on work.

164
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:23,485
I think I'll get into trouble at this rate.

165
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:28,555
I'll wait for you at the gallery
we first met at 3:00 p.m.

166
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:32,393
I never said I would meet you yet.

167
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,751
Do whatever you want. I'm
going to be waiting.

168
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:00,778
Are you finished with your call?

169
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:02,712
You didn't sleep yet?

170
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:06,126
Hurry up and come to bed so we can sleep.

171
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,046
I'm a bit tired today.

172
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:13,446
Tomorrow, I'm going to take some time off
work to take Kyung-soo to the kendo room.

173
00:14:14,197 --> 00:14:15,197
Really?

174
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,056
Thank you.

175
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:20,705
So let's hurry up and go to sleep.

176
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:41,149
Why does my head hurt so much? I
should drink something before I sleep.

177
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,342
How frightening.

178
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:05,641
You might end up hitting me as well.

179
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,727
How dare you try to sock my son?

180
00:15:09,923 --> 00:15:11,657
Are you a gangster?

181
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:16,829
There are many chances in the future. He
looks like he'll go down with one punch.

182
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:24,024
I dare you to hurt him.

183
00:15:25,947 --> 00:15:29,266
On that day, Mr. Park's
shares will become my son's.

184
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:31,423
Didn't you hear what he said earlier?

185
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:34,852
How did it feel hearing that?

186
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:41,282
If he didn't hate his sons so badly, why
would he offer to give his shares to my son?

187
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:44,524
I'm not interested in the shares.

188
00:15:44,806 --> 00:15:47,735
Really? Can I record it?

189
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,727
You should say such things
in front of my son.

190
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,782
It seemed like he couldn't ask for the shares
because he pitied his two big brothers.

191
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:01,048
- Don't act up.
- Don't you act up!

192
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:06,235
How dare you be petty and
show those photos to my son?

193
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:09,696
Why? Do you feel even more
embarrassed in front of your son?

194
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:12,782
How will he face me now?

195
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:14,576
Shut your mouth.

196
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:19,024
At one point, his mom had given
up everything to cling onto me.

197
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:24,558
And even though she had given up on everything,
I dumped her like yesterday's trash.

198
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:28,829
On the day my son becomes the greatest
shareholder, I'll take care of you first.

199
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:31,040
That day will never come.

200
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:37,220
Why not? Currently, my son is
the most loved son of Mr. Park.

201
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:40,503
- I dare you to say that in front of my face one more time.
- Should I?

202
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:45,549
Even though my son isn't
his flesh and blood, he

203
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:48,891
has currently become Mr.
Park's favorite son!

204
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:50,884
You better shut that mouth of yours.

205
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:56,532
Your father is in the palm of my hand.

206
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:59,422
If you think it's unfair,
blame your mom who died

207
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:01,678
after pathetically begging
for your father's love.

208
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:03,275
Do you want to die in my hands?

209
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:08,227
From now on, don't you dare
speak ill about me to my son.

210
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:10,899
I'll never let you get away with it!

211
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:37,939
Kyung-soo.

212
00:18:45,872 --> 00:18:48,856
I thought I would be able
to see you if I came here.

213
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:55,364
This is the time you come
back from the cabaret.

214
00:18:57,106 --> 00:18:58,506
Did something happen?

215
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:03,903
If you hadn't seen me, I was just
going to sit here and leave.

216
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:06,692
I'm asking you. Did something happen?

217
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:11,668
Are you still curious
about what happens to me?

218
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:22,222
After seeing you here,

219
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:29,168
all the things that have happened
to us recently feels like a dream.

220
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:36,809
Even now when something
distressful happens to me,

221
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:41,059
you're the only one I can think of.

222
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:43,645
Kyung-soo.

223
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:47,590
Of course, I know I shouldn't.

224
00:19:50,802 --> 00:19:52,731
I wonder why that accident
happened that night.

225
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:56,242
If Hae-soo hadn't died...

226
00:19:59,224 --> 00:20:02,317
we wouldn't have become like this.

227
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:11,668
Would it have been less difficult
if we didn't see each other?

228
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:23,871
When I see you next to Park
Hyun-joon, I feel really hurt,

229
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,793
but I still like to see you,
even if it's in that way.

230
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:36,244
On the days you come, I start
waiting for you from the morning.

231
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:39,918
Kyung-soo.

232
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,434
That's my honest feeling right now.

233
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:53,840
I always miss you.

234
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:35,239
Kyung-soo said he'll eat later.

235
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,778
Hyun-sung, call the reporters
to the company today.

236
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:43,825
I'm going to expose those photos.

237
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:46,637
Go ahead and marry Jung Hae-dang.

238
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:55,325
That means I'm going to accept
her as my daughter-in-law.

239
00:21:57,474 --> 00:21:59,141
I said you can't do that!

240
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:04,145
Call her family and arrange
a date to meet them.

241
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:06,957
Instead, give me the film.

242
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:15,075
Please eat.

243
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,550
What about Kyung-soo? What
about Kyung-soo who has to

244
00:22:30,574 --> 00:22:33,037
live with the woman he loves
as his sister-in-law?

245
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:37,754
- He has no choice.
- I don't know about anything else, but he can't marry Hae-dang.

246
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:40,832
Then will you be okay if
he exposes those photos?

247
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:45,801
I'd rather choose that. I'm
over as a singer anyways.

248
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:48,608
Then what about me?

249
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:55,012
What about me whose wife had once
gone to the hotel with my son?

250
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:57,832
- I told you nothing happened!
- Do people believe that?

251
00:23:00,153 --> 00:23:04,145
Still, how can you allow Hae-dang to
become your eldest daughter-in-law?

252
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:06,973
I can never allow that to happen!
Even if I die!

253
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,356
Then you can just die.

254
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:17,356
- What?
- So why did you follow him to the hotel in the first place?

255
00:23:17,544 --> 00:23:20,590
Then why did you threaten a woman
like me into becoming your wife?

256
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:24,724
- What?
- This is all your fault! Don't you know that?

257
00:23:26,161 --> 00:23:29,215
You're the one who made me into a
woman who is crazy to the core!

258
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:34,059
- So how dare you raise your voice at me?
- Accept Jung Hae-dang.

259
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:38,715
- There's no way in hell I'm doing that.
- No way in hell?

260
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:40,496
That means I won't go down by myself.

261
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,082
- What?- I dare you to allow her
to become your daughter-in-law.

262
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:48,684
Watch what will happen to your life.

263
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:03,332
Your father has backed down a lot.

264
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:06,621
He even accepted Kyung-soo as his son.

265
00:24:07,044 --> 00:24:09,059
Even for Kyung-soo's sake,
he would have never

266
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:12,176
allowed Hae-dang to become
his daughter-in-law.

267
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:17,028
Does he think I can't get married
to Hae-dang without his permission?

268
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:19,598
I can just get married to her myself.

269
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:24,387
What if you married her without
permission and lost all your shares?

270
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:28,832
Use this opportunity to get married to her.

271
00:24:30,044 --> 00:24:31,989
Even that's a success in itself.

272
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:39,012
What is your father saying out of the blue?

273
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:42,310
He's going to allow Jung Hae-dang
to become his daughter-in-law?

274
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:44,496
This is so annoying.

275
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:48,036
That's because Hyun-joon wouldn't
listen to him with any other condition.

276
00:24:48,317 --> 00:24:52,293
Why did Yoo Ji-na have to
be in those darn photos?

277
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:55,207
She's such a dreadful woman.

278
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:57,653
How did such a woman come into our house?

279
00:24:59,395 --> 00:25:01,578
If Hyun-joon gets married
to Hae-dang, he'll

280
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:04,122
definitely make up his mind
and work in the company.

281
00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:07,207
Then things will really become complicated.

282
00:25:19,974 --> 00:25:20,989
What is it?

283
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:24,723
Did you mean it when you said you
could give your shares to Kyung-soo?

284
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,551
Did you come here to check that?

285
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:33,653
I came to check whether you said it out
of spite or you're really considering it.

286
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,231
If you were me, would you answer that?

287
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:42,192
I'm different from Hyun-joon. At least
I lived most of my life obeying you.

288
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,848
So I think I have the right to be curious.

289
00:25:46,356 --> 00:25:47,623
No. I won't answer.

290
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,903
Can you really answer so simply?

291
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:55,012
I hate you and your brother.

292
00:25:58,106 --> 00:25:59,543
Why do you hate us so much?

293
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:04,801
Because you guys secretly think you have
more authority over this company than I do.

294
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:07,200
- Is that the only reason?
- Yes.

295
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:13,364
If you know that, leave now. I have
to take Kyung-soo to exercise.

296
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,841
Get rid of Yoo Ji-na first.

297
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:34,614
Don't think of touching Jung Hae-dang
and get rid of Yoo Ji-na first.

298
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:38,364
If you don't, we might really
end up getting a divorce.

299
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:41,567
What do you mean you'll take care of it?

300
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:46,716
You must get rid of Yoo Ji-na first.
You must.

301
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:49,145
I got it, so please calm down.

302
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,418
I'm in a really bad condition after
the talk of the shares, too.

303
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:56,590
I understand. Bye.

304
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:10,075
Welcome.

305
00:27:21,716 --> 00:27:23,504
Are you still mad at me?

306
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:26,543
I'm not a player.

307
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:28,981
I heard the explanation from Hae-dang.

308
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:32,083
So you'll give us permission again, right?

309
00:27:32,254 --> 00:27:35,989
However, I'm worried because your
father is against this marriage.

310
00:27:36,497 --> 00:27:39,494
You promised to give me Hae-dang
with your faith in me only.

311
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:43,731
On top of that, Yoo Ji-na is going
to become her mother-in-law.

312
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:47,317
If Hae-dang can't even get
your father's permission...

313
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:50,392
how will she be able to
survive in such a marriage?

314
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:54,043
My father did give us permission.

315
00:27:56,302 --> 00:27:58,137
- When?
- This morning.

316
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,707
- Lie.
- You'll know if it's a lie or not at the family meeting.

317
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:07,887
Are you serious? How did he
suddenly give you permission?

318
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,989
My grandmother is the king of the house.

319
00:28:10,903 --> 00:28:13,473
She adores Hae-dang so much.

320
00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:17,092
- Your grandmother had persuaded him?
- Yes.

321
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:20,473
That's great. Congratulations.

322
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:56,886
- One. Head.
- Head.

323
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:01,380
- Head.
- Head.

324
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:52,024
It's because you haven't
tried it before, but it's

325
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:54,094
not like you don't have any
athletic skills at all.

326
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:59,075
Businessmen must exercise
as much as they work.

327
00:30:00,856 --> 00:30:04,536
Or else, your body won't be
able to handle all that stress.

328
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:09,161
I'm not used to moving my body.

329
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:16,848
You must challenge yourself to things
you're not used to from now on...

330
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:20,629
since you've become my son.

331
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,426
A man's life must have tension.

332
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:46,989
When you endure stressful tension
and feel a sense of accomplishment,

333
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:52,575
you start to realize this is
what it means to be living.

334
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:57,590
I wanted to teach that to my son.

335
00:31:00,614 --> 00:31:04,629
One day, I'll take you to the Himalayas.

336
00:31:05,802 --> 00:31:11,879
You should realize why people risk
their lives to reach the top.

337
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:15,145
I'm not the one you're looking for.

338
00:31:18,254 --> 00:31:20,996
You might be happy because
you're doing all the

339
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,818
things you've never done
for your two sons to me,

340
00:31:25,122 --> 00:31:28,715
but I have no intention
of living as your puppet.

341
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,816
Is that how you think?

342
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:37,700
Aren't you spending time with me
to give a warning to your sons?

343
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,426
Why do you think that?

344
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,153
Because you have an illness-like competition
towards your son Park Hyun-joon.

345
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:51,254
Is that how you see me?

346
00:31:52,825 --> 00:31:56,881
Your father-in-law was disappointed
in you, and since he didn't have

347
00:31:57,786 --> 00:32:00,902
any other sons, he would have thought
of Hyun-joon as his successor.

348
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:06,786
Mrs. Sung and you couldn't handle the
fact that he was already preparing

349
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:10,536
to choose Hyun-joon as his successor
instead of you. Aren't I right?

350
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:18,145
That's why, even though he's your
son, you felt inferior to him.

351
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:21,942
Inferior?

352
00:32:22,122 --> 00:32:27,067
If not, you wouldn't have
forced the woman who liked

353
00:32:27,091 --> 00:32:31,474
him into becoming your
wife by threatening her.

354
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:35,304
Someone sane wouldn't have done that.

355
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:39,442
"Someone sane?"

356
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:49,762
- I liked Ji-na first.
- However, she never liked you.

357
00:32:51,106 --> 00:32:57,114
Much more, you couldn't handle the
fact that she liked your son.

358
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:02,614
A normal person would've
surrendered at that point.

359
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,621
So you're saying I'm crazy.

360
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:13,520
Your madness has created
this entire tragedy.

361
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:20,332
Distorted pride can be
frightening at times.

362
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:27,801
How could you make someone who went to
a hotel with your son into your wife?

363
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,246
- Because I love her.
- That's not love.

364
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,067
That's the only love I know...

365
00:33:39,677 --> 00:33:41,286
because I never learned anything else.

366
00:33:44,036 --> 00:33:51,911
I may be crazy, but I have all
the money and power right now.

367
00:33:55,052 --> 00:33:57,879
And I can give those to you.

368
00:33:58,489 --> 00:34:00,098
I don't need such things.

369
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:05,606
I'm starting to like you more and more.

370
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:07,457
You're crazy.

371
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:12,666
Now that you know my wounds,
you might be able to

372
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:18,225
understand me, someone who
feels inferior to his own son.

373
00:34:20,484 --> 00:34:25,811
If my two sons had imagined what you
were just thinking right now...

374
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:31,194
I wouldn't have just thought
of them only as my rivals.

375
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:37,225
Such an intelligent boy had been
blind for such a long time.

376
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:41,733
Yet, you got into the
habit of thinking deeply.

377
00:34:42,218 --> 00:34:46,796
No matter how much you insist,
I can never become your son.

378
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,647
No, you will be.

379
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:56,507
I think you might end up
becoming my son and only friend.

380
00:35:04,523 --> 00:35:09,053
When Hyun-joon and Hae-dang gets
married, I'm going to leave home.

381
00:35:10,038 --> 00:35:11,039
Why?

382
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:14,757
How could I live with the woman
I love as my sister-in-law?

383
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:17,945
Endure it.

384
00:35:18,562 --> 00:35:20,647
- Mr. Park!
- You can do it.

385
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,077
No, I can't.

386
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:29,029
Still, you must endure it.
Not for me but for your mom.

387
00:35:32,187 --> 00:35:36,882
Your mom is just as twisted as I am.

388
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,897
- Do you have plans?
- No.

389
00:36:03,187 --> 00:36:06,475
Then why do you keep looking at the clock?

390
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:10,241
Just.

391
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:16,171
I have to go pick up the chicken grandmother
ordered. Would you like to come with me?

392
00:36:17,163 --> 00:36:18,600
You can go by yourself.

393
00:36:18,874 --> 00:36:23,827
- Then what will you do at home by yourself?
- I just want to rest.

394
00:36:27,382 --> 00:36:31,866
Never mind. Let's go together.
It can help me pass the time.

395
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,311
Would you like to do that?

396
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:49,092
- Why do you keep looking at the clock?
- I'm not.

397
00:36:51,804 --> 00:36:52,975
Can I be honest?

398
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:58,124
I really miss you right now.

399
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:05,889
- Na-kyung, stop the car.
- Why?

400
00:37:06,445 --> 00:37:09,624
Oh. I'm suddenly feeling a bit dizzy.

401
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:12,279
I should go home and rest.

402
00:37:13,812 --> 00:37:17,842
Then I'll just take you home.

403
00:37:19,773 --> 00:37:21,608
You said you have to pick up the chicken.

404
00:37:22,116 --> 00:37:25,436
It's not like I had made an appointment.
I'll drop you off at home first.

405
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:38,428
Na-kyung, stop the car.

406
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:43,616
Why? If you're feeling that sick,
should we go to the hospital instead?

407
00:37:44,788 --> 00:37:46,366
Let's go to the hospital then.

408
00:37:46,812 --> 00:37:48,203
Please just drop me off here.

409
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:51,139
- Where are you going?
- Just stop the car, please!

410
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,514
Why are you screaming at me?

411
00:38:15,757 --> 00:38:19,632
She's all fired up because
of the words "I miss you."

412
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:40,772
I must be crazy. I'm
totally out of my mind.

413
00:38:57,773 --> 00:38:59,014
What are you doing?

414
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:04,258
I really missed you. I want to
just look at you for ten minutes.

415
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:09,952
What if someone comes here?

416
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:15,116
Did you miss me, too?

417
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:28,499
I'll be going in now.

418
00:39:31,007 --> 00:39:32,007
Kyung-soo.

419
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:38,311
Let me hug you once.

420
00:39:54,968 --> 00:39:58,819
You feel more dependable when I hug you.

421
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:02,967
I hope we get along, my son.

422
00:40:07,226 --> 00:40:08,467
See you at dinner.

423
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:38,421
- He wanted to exercise, so I went with him.
- Until when will you stay in this house?

424
00:40:39,866 --> 00:40:41,678
That's not up to me.

425
00:40:42,093 --> 00:40:43,686
I'm going to marry Hae-dang.

426
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:46,262
- I'm aware of that.
- What do you mean you're aware?

427
00:40:47,803 --> 00:40:51,436
Are you saying you're going to keep living
here even though Hae-dang moves in here?

428
00:40:53,038 --> 00:40:55,579
If you had sincerely
loved Hae-dang, wouldn't

429
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:57,921
it make sense for you to leave this house?

430
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,671
Now that you're tailing after Mr.
Park, do you like the taste of money?

431
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:06,639
Do you have hopeless ambitions now?

432
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:10,225
I'm still the one who's more
worried about Hae-dang.

433
00:41:10,546 --> 00:41:12,374
- What?
- Good-bye.

434
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,889
- Are you serious - Hyun-joon's
father is coming out, too.

435
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:29,355
Oh, my! So Hae-dang is going to end up
getting married into that family, after all!

436
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:32,838
The whole player thing was a misunderstanding,
but you said she shouldn't get

437
00:41:32,862 --> 00:41:36,139
married into that family because of her
future mother-in-law and sister-in-law.

438
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,489
That was because I had gotten
weak-hearted and thought it

439
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:40,647
would be better to just
accept the million dollars.

440
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:45,124
As long as Hyun-joon isn't a player,
she should just overcome it.

441
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:48,159
Mom, you make it sound
as if you were the one

442
00:41:48,183 --> 00:41:50,585
who was going to receive
the million dollars.

443
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,772
I shouldn't just be sitting
here eating like this.

444
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,030
Where are you going now?

445
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:07,757
- Why are you eating alone?
- Hae-sung said she'll be late because of work.

446
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,991
Then you should come up and eat? Why
are you being miserable by yourself?

447
00:42:11,116 --> 00:42:13,663
What's it to you whether
I'm miserable or not?

448
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,241
What are you going to wear?

449
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,796
What's it to you?

450
00:42:23,851 --> 00:42:24,851
Here.

451
00:42:25,968 --> 00:42:30,592
It doesn't matter what you wear.
You look so poor.

452
00:42:30,952 --> 00:42:31,952
I do?

453
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:36,897
- Try this one.
- No, it's bothersome. I'm just going to wear whatever.

454
00:42:37,374 --> 00:42:39,827
Let's go to the mall tomorrow
and buy a new suit for you.

455
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:42,441
The ones you have are too shabby.

456
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:47,069
- I can go with the girls.
- What do they know?

457
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:50,991
You, sir, have a huge
face, so if you wear the

458
00:42:51,147 --> 00:42:54,050
wrong clothing, you'll
look like a Teletubby.

459
00:42:54,226 --> 00:42:55,632
A Teletubby?

460
00:42:55,796 --> 00:42:58,467
Dolls with huge heads
come out on that show.

461
00:42:58,577 --> 00:42:59,577
Excuse you!

462
00:43:00,437 --> 00:43:01,437
Mom!

463
00:43:04,234 --> 00:43:07,842
What the heck do you think
you're doing in his bedroom?

464
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:10,639
Why did you come down without
finishing your dinner?

465
00:43:11,866 --> 00:43:15,382
If you have something to say,
say it in the living room!

466
00:43:16,445 --> 00:43:20,108
- Come out! Hurry up! Come out!
- All right.

467
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:26,952
How can you just barge into
your in-law's bedroom?

468
00:43:27,077 --> 00:43:29,095
I was helping him choose
something to wear to the

469
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,258
family meeting just in case
he wears something weird.

470
00:43:31,282 --> 00:43:36,522
Mom, do you seriously have
feelings for my father-in-law?

471
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:42,428
- What?
- Don't come into this room anymore.

472
00:43:42,773 --> 00:43:45,600
I come in here all the time when I
clean the floor in the daytime.

473
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:46,999
You come in here all the time?

474
00:43:47,968 --> 00:43:50,264
Gosh, I really hate this!

475
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,085
Then come home from work early and
clean the floor of this bedroom.

476
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:56,881
Mom!

477
00:43:58,413 --> 00:44:02,288
I think I should get my father-in-law
married first before Hae-dang.

478
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:06,053
I'm going to get him married off to anyone.

479
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:14,241
What kind of trouble did you
have to call me out of the blue?

480
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:19,874
Oh... I wanted you to introduce
our father-in-law to someone.

481
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,491
- Introduce?
- I think I need to get him married off.

482
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,835
Huh? Why out of the blue?

483
00:44:27,062 --> 00:44:31,108
Do you know a nice widow?

484
00:44:31,484 --> 00:44:35,936
Yes! Even divorced women will do. No, no.

485
00:44:36,945 --> 00:44:39,655
Her ex-husband may appear.

486
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:44,897
A widow would be best. There's
a nice feel to it, too.

487
00:44:45,678 --> 00:44:49,241
- I have pretty high standards.
- What are you talking about?

488
00:44:51,437 --> 00:44:54,389
To be honest...

489
00:44:55,851 --> 00:45:03,257
there's a rumor going around that our
father-in-law and my mother are dating.

490
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:08,678
Seriously? Can't they just
get married to each other?

491
00:45:09,062 --> 00:45:10,062
What?

492
00:45:10,702 --> 00:45:14,030
In-laws marrying each other?
That's scandalous!

493
00:45:14,226 --> 00:45:15,827
Why is that scandalous?

494
00:45:15,988 --> 00:45:19,905
- If that happens, I'll get a divorce!
- Say what?

495
00:45:20,186 --> 00:45:23,097
I'd rather shave my head,
go into the temple,

496
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:26,100
and make my father-in-law
regret what he did!

497
00:45:30,343 --> 00:45:33,983
Bong-soo, how old did
you say you were again?

498
00:45:34,171 --> 00:45:36,303
I told you I'm two years younger than you.

499
00:45:36,773 --> 00:45:39,040
How can you speak so childishly though?

500
00:45:40,116 --> 00:45:42,882
Maybe I should protest
by shaving my head now.

501
00:45:50,773 --> 00:45:52,999
- Why are you laughing?
- It's nothing.

502
00:45:53,327 --> 00:45:55,413
I heard you drank. Go home.

503
00:45:58,029 --> 00:46:01,014
Why do you keep laughing? It's offensive.

504
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,374
Father, just tell me.

505
00:46:04,843 --> 00:46:06,530
Tell you what?

506
00:46:09,702 --> 00:46:11,694
Let's talk next time. Good night.

507
00:46:11,991 --> 00:46:15,491
What do you mean we'll talk next time?
Hurry up and spill it.

508
00:46:16,257 --> 00:46:17,257
It's nothing.

509
00:46:17,366 --> 00:46:22,124
Hey! My goodness. You're sly.

510
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:24,281
I think someone needs to
take responsibility for

511
00:46:24,462 --> 00:46:26,225
something like this and push ahead with it.

512
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,335
You can't scratch your own back.

513
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:30,266
Push ahead with what?

514
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,164
I would love to have a mother-in-law, too.

515
00:46:33,188 --> 00:46:37,514
Huh? Who told you such weird things?

516
00:46:38,179 --> 00:46:39,616
Don't be ridiculous!

517
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:41,741
There's no smoke without fire.

518
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,264
Oh, whatever!

519
00:46:44,445 --> 00:46:48,928
So just tell me your true feelings
while we're on the topic!

520
00:46:49,804 --> 00:46:51,827
Get out! Go home!

521
00:46:52,116 --> 00:46:57,812
- Your face is red.
- Are you drunk?

522
00:46:57,836 --> 00:46:59,523
Stop saying nonsense and go home!

523
00:46:59,547 --> 00:47:01,694
You should've told me this sooner!

524
00:47:02,295 --> 00:47:06,960
This isn't some forbidden love! Why did
you struggle to keep this to yourself?

525
00:47:07,179 --> 00:47:08,577
Who's struggling?

526
00:47:09,398 --> 00:47:11,444
Are you teasing your elder right now?
How dare you!

527
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:15,217
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

528
00:47:23,054 --> 00:47:28,092
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure. Go ahead.

529
00:47:30,445 --> 00:47:32,717
Why do you treat my husband
as if he doesn't exist?

530
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:38,015
I'm married. Did you forget?

531
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:43,850
Are you offended I treated
you as if you were single?

532
00:47:44,296 --> 00:47:48,679
Not really, but I was wondering if
you were doing this on purpose.

533
00:47:48,944 --> 00:47:50,124
I am.

534
00:47:50,543 --> 00:47:52,343
- Why?
- Because I want to.

535
00:48:00,171 --> 00:48:02,104
Then can I ask you one thing?

536
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,530
What is Mr. Park Sung-hwan like?

537
00:48:08,765 --> 00:48:09,898
He's a tough man.

538
00:48:10,695 --> 00:48:13,098
- That's it?
- He's a cruel man as well.

539
00:48:15,044 --> 00:48:16,044
He's cruel?

540
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,583
If he sees me squandering away at
a hotel bar with another man...

541
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:28,403
he might be able to slice you
into two pieces from head to toe.

542
00:48:28,771 --> 00:48:31,304
Wow. If I get caught by him, I'm dead.

543
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,036
You'll have to risk your life.

544
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:38,200
That makes it even more thrilling.

545
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:45,856
Am I even worth that?

546
00:48:46,544 --> 00:48:50,184
You're oddly distorted.

547
00:48:51,927 --> 00:48:56,099
That's because your man can't
realize your exquisite charms.

548
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:03,739
From a woman's point-of-view, Mr.
Park is very reliable.

549
00:49:06,966 --> 00:49:08,301
I'm satisfied with that.

550
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:13,325
Do you mean that?

551
00:49:15,357 --> 00:49:18,098
In your eyes, what kind of woman am I?

552
00:49:21,896 --> 00:49:26,489
A delicate and glamorous woman
I'm afraid to even touch.

553
00:49:28,763 --> 00:49:30,247
That's the kind of woman you are.

554
00:49:44,122 --> 00:49:48,762
She's fallen for him. She's totally fallen
for him. Does she know what time it is?

555
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:55,559
Do you need something?

556
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:57,747
Where did my wife go?

557
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,334
She called to tell me that she's going to
be late because she's meeting her friend.

558
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:06,647
- She made that kind of call to you?
- Yes.

559
00:50:08,121 --> 00:50:12,231
What kind of friend would she meet until
to late? With her phone off, too?

560
00:50:12,982 --> 00:50:15,192
- I don't know.
- Who's this friend of hers?

561
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:17,130
I wouldn't know.

562
00:50:40,591 --> 00:50:42,528
Why did you come home so late?

563
00:50:43,098 --> 00:50:46,262
- I called and told you that I would be late.
- Where are you coming from?

564
00:50:47,427 --> 00:50:50,387
I told you I met my friend for dinner.

565
00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:52,926
- Did you drink?
- No.

566
00:50:53,302 --> 00:50:55,419
But why is your face so red?

567
00:50:57,348 --> 00:51:00,575
Is it? I didn't drink though.

568
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,387
Maybe I have a fever.

569
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,997
Did you take a shower?

570
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:11,880
- What?
- You don't smell like the body soap you usually use.

571
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:15,885
I got a massage.

572
00:51:16,536 --> 00:51:17,942
In the middle of dinner?

573
00:51:18,732 --> 00:51:22,199
Before I had dinner. While
gossiping with my friend.

574
00:51:22,505 --> 00:51:27,629
Before you had dinner? But
that scent lasts until now?

575
00:51:28,621 --> 00:51:30,286
Well, I just...

576
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:34,325
You should just spray
perfume on you instead.

577
00:51:35,278 --> 00:51:39,223
- Don't you take perfume around with you?
- What are you saying?

578
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:52,028
Do I look like a dog to you? How
could I smell body soap on you?

579
00:51:53,669 --> 00:51:56,372
It's even more fun to do something
you shouldn't, isn't it?

580
00:52:10,036 --> 00:52:15,794
Good job today. Call her
out about four days later.

581
00:52:28,544 --> 00:52:29,661
What's this?

582
00:52:31,622 --> 00:52:34,555
- Did you just come home?
- Did I wake you?

583
00:52:36,036 --> 00:52:40,286
- Which friend did you meet?
- Do you know all my friends?

584
00:52:42,357 --> 00:52:44,458
Do you even have friends?

585
00:52:46,224 --> 00:52:49,145
Everyone has friends.

586
00:52:51,216 --> 00:52:52,216
Go to sleep.

587
00:53:18,747 --> 00:53:20,419
What time did you come home last night?

588
00:53:22,435 --> 00:53:23,473
I was a bit late.

589
00:53:23,654 --> 00:53:26,778
Where did you go in the middle of the
night when you're a married woman?

590
00:53:28,435 --> 00:53:31,568
Since when did you have
so much interest in me?

591
00:53:32,536 --> 00:53:34,942
- What?
- I was late because I was talking

592
00:53:35,364 --> 00:53:37,256
with a friend I haven't
seen in a long time.

593
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,497
- You should come home early.
- I'm not a kid.

594
00:53:41,075 --> 00:53:43,318
I'm saying this because
everyone knows who you are,

595
00:53:43,342 --> 00:53:45,627
which means you're capable
of humiliating our family!

596
00:53:46,271 --> 00:53:49,512
- Why are you raising your voice?
- Just eat. How dare you talk back to her?

597
00:53:50,723 --> 00:53:55,145
She's worried, so you should just say okay
and move on. Why are you talking so much?

598
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:58,536
- Why are you getting mad at me, too?
- Do you not fear anyone in this house?

599
00:54:02,004 --> 00:54:04,731
Fine. I'll come home early.

600
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:11,146
Goodness. You have no manners at all!

601
00:54:11,872 --> 00:54:15,317
I have no idea what your parents taught you
before they unleashed you into the world.

602
00:54:16,591 --> 00:54:18,942
Goodness gracious!

603
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:21,473
Goodness.

604
00:54:29,357 --> 00:54:32,716
I'm meeting Hae-dang's
family this Saturday.

605
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:35,106
Are you really going to
go against my wishes?

606
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:37,950
It's already been decided.

607
00:54:38,098 --> 00:54:40,318
- Then what about Kyung-soo?
- I told him to accept it.

608
00:54:40,342 --> 00:54:43,295
If Hae-dang comes into this house,
Kyung-soo won't be able to live here!

609
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:45,864
- We have no choice.
- What do you mean we have no choice?

610
00:54:46,278 --> 00:54:49,044
Then you mean we can't do anything
when Kyung-soo leaves this house?

611
00:54:49,888 --> 00:54:54,638
How could you want everything to go your way
when you're not good at a single thing?

612
00:54:55,193 --> 00:54:56,193
What?

613
00:54:56,856 --> 00:55:00,270
We must use this opportunity to
put an end to the photo issue.

614
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:04,450
My pride won't allow this
to be mentioned twice.

615
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:08,403
- I told you he can't marry Jung Hae-dang!
- Stop saying that already!

616
00:55:23,411 --> 00:55:24,614
Did you have fun yesterday?

617
00:55:26,193 --> 00:55:29,426
What would be so fun
about meeting a friend?

618
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:32,380
All we did was pass the time by talking.

619
00:55:32,724 --> 00:55:35,333
What is your friend like? Please tell me.

620
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:38,301
Do you really have nothing to do right now?

621
00:55:38,661 --> 00:55:42,997
What should I do if Cheol
wants to eat with us again?

622
00:55:43,872 --> 00:55:47,870
Forget it. What would we
keep meeting him for?

623
00:55:49,052 --> 00:55:51,778
Really? Okay then.

624
00:56:01,552 --> 00:56:03,426
What are you going to
do about Jung Hae-dang?

625
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:05,943
You said you would take
responsibility and stop her.

626
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:09,489
Father made up his mind
already, so how can I stop her?

627
00:56:10,012 --> 00:56:14,075
What's wrong with your tone?
Are you on her side now?

628
00:56:14,552 --> 00:56:16,692
How did you end up in those photos?

629
00:56:18,935 --> 00:56:21,653
Must I explain to you about that, too?

630
00:56:22,091 --> 00:56:25,031
- It's not easy.
- I know it's not easy, so I want

631
00:56:25,055 --> 00:56:27,935
you to put that clever brain
of yours to good use.

632
00:56:28,286 --> 00:56:32,262
So are you going to allow Kyung-soo to
enter the business administration major?

633
00:56:34,052 --> 00:56:35,685
Why are you bringing that up right now?

634
00:56:35,709 --> 00:56:40,020
It seemed like father had considered
giving up his shares to him, too.

635
00:56:40,294 --> 00:56:43,926
Is that why your tone changed?

636
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:48,981
If you become too greedy,
you could get sick.

637
00:56:50,724 --> 00:56:51,857
What do you mean?

638
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:54,473
If Hae-dang comes into this
house as his sister-in-law, do

639
00:56:55,308 --> 00:56:58,520
you think Kyung-soo can stay
here with his personality?

640
00:56:58,779 --> 00:57:01,779
That's why I'm asking
you for help right now.

641
00:57:03,364 --> 00:57:07,369
To be honest, I'm afraid he'll
run away before he enters the

642
00:57:07,393 --> 00:57:11,724
business administration major and
inherits all the company shares.

643
00:57:12,357 --> 00:57:13,357
What?

644
00:57:14,302 --> 00:57:17,466
How about you send Kyung-soo
to theological college?

645
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:22,044
What did you say? What do you mean by that?

646
00:57:22,566 --> 00:57:29,012
Don't you think Kyung-soo will become
an amazing, highly-respected priest?

647
00:57:34,474 --> 00:57:38,036
How dare you speak such
nonsense about my son?

648
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:04,083
See me first.

649
00:58:16,724 --> 00:58:21,184
You should consider Kyung-soo.
Didn't you love him?

650
00:58:23,036 --> 00:58:25,903
Why would you drag this so far?
What about Kyung-soo?

651
00:58:26,568 --> 00:58:29,544
Kyung-soo has to live with
you as his sister-in-law.

652
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:32,699
Do you really not care about how he feels?

653
00:58:32,723 --> 00:58:35,247
Kyung-soo has you.

654
00:58:35,489 --> 00:58:39,726
Your motive is me. Then you should
torment me. Why would you torment him?

655
00:58:39,882 --> 00:58:43,700
Kyung-soo can endure this.
He's used to enduring.

656
00:58:45,544 --> 00:58:47,809
The one who can't endure it is you.

657
00:58:50,246 --> 00:58:52,473
Isn't it your motive to
make me leave this house?

658
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:54,778
Will you leave then?

659
00:58:57,216 --> 00:59:01,053
If you leave, I'll back
away from Hyun-joon, too.

660
00:59:01,077 --> 00:59:05,986
- Jung Hae-dang.
- If we leave, both Kyung-soo and Hyun-joon will become peaceful.

661
00:59:06,388 --> 00:59:09,310
If I leave, why would Kyung-soo stay here?

662
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,761
That might be better for him.

663
00:59:12,104 --> 00:59:14,809
He's not interested in becoming
the son of a wealthy man anyways.

664
00:59:15,193 --> 00:59:17,176
So you want all of us to die together, huh?

665
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:19,966
Then why must I be the only
one who dies every time?

666
00:59:22,107 --> 00:59:24,919
If you take pity on
Kyung-soo for having to see

667
00:59:24,943 --> 00:59:27,518
the woman he loves become
his sister-in-law,

668
00:59:27,786 --> 00:59:31,153
then you should leave this house for his
sake. If you do that, I'll leave, too.

669
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,911
In any situation, you can
never put your son first.

670
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:44,223
So stop pretending to love your son
with that filthy mouth of yours.

671
00:59:45,325 --> 00:59:46,989
It's disgusting to see.

672
01:00:09,654 --> 01:00:11,384
You don't have to shine them so much.

673
01:00:12,339 --> 01:00:16,672
Of course I do! I must shine them
until they're bright and shiny!

674
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,776
You look handsome!

675
01:00:26,128 --> 01:00:28,073
Clothes do make the man.

676
01:00:28,738 --> 01:00:30,503
You look pretty decent!

677
01:00:31,652 --> 01:00:35,339
Although I have nothing,
I have milky white skin,

678
01:00:35,363 --> 01:00:39,123
so if I wear the proper
attire, I look pretty rich!

679
01:00:40,988 --> 01:00:42,839
Maybe that's why con-artists
were after you.

680
01:00:43,472 --> 01:00:45,964
- What?
- We'll be late. Let's go.

681
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:50,714
Don't just wolf down food because
there are many good foods to eat.

682
01:00:51,683 --> 01:00:55,721
Oh, come on. Although I love food, I would
never do that at such an important event.

683
01:00:56,956 --> 01:01:00,057
- We'll be back, mother.
- Okay. Have a good time.

684
01:01:00,315 --> 01:01:02,026
- Have a good time.
- Okay.

685
01:01:02,378 --> 01:01:05,746
- Have a good time, Mr. Jung.
- Okay. Let's go.

686
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:10,487
- Bye.
- Have a great time. You look handsome!

687
01:01:14,495 --> 01:01:16,776
It's nice to meet you.

688
01:01:17,402 --> 01:01:18,935
It's an honor for us...

689
01:01:21,425 --> 01:01:22,870
and please take good care of her.

690
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:28,589
- Don't be too nervous today.
- Yes, ma'am.

691
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:33,081
All of Hae-dang's sisters
look smart and beautiful.

692
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:37,550
- Your daughters are so pretty.
- Thank you.

693
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:41,237
Your late mother must have been beautiful.

694
01:01:42,355 --> 01:01:46,581
- Excuse me?
- I was joking. Let's eat.

695
01:01:46,956 --> 01:01:51,788
We don't have much to talk about.
We just met to see each other.

696
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:56,221
We're so grateful you're
sending your precious daughter

697
01:01:57,032 --> 01:02:00,065
to us that we decided to
prepare the wedding gifts.

698
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:04,550
We're planning to prepare to the
best of our ability as well.

699
01:02:05,112 --> 01:02:09,036
You may not like them, but
we can't send off our

700
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:12,502
sister who worked hard for us empty-handed.

701
01:02:13,308 --> 01:02:18,831
My, my. You speak so
articulately and nicely.

702
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:22,714
She lectures at a university.

703
01:02:23,034 --> 01:02:25,834
Really? So she's going
to become a professor.

704
01:02:26,081 --> 01:02:27,909
She was a teacher as well.

705
01:02:28,705 --> 01:02:31,221
Right now, she's preparing
to become a writer.

706
01:02:31,652 --> 01:02:34,792
You've raised your daughters very well.

707
01:02:35,144 --> 01:02:38,940
Yes, well, Hae-dang
practically raised them.

708
01:02:49,847 --> 01:02:53,526
Who is the quiet young man in the corner?

709
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:59,245
Who did you say you were again...?

710
01:03:00,198 --> 01:03:01,604
He's Hae-dang's brother-in-law.

711
01:03:05,089 --> 01:03:11,647
Oh, yes. Let me introduce myself again.
I'm Yeon Bong-soo. It's nice to meet you.

712
01:03:13,558 --> 01:03:16,792
You look very friendly.

713
01:03:18,722 --> 01:03:20,784
Thank you for thinking that way.

714
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,557
You two should say something, too.

715
01:03:25,363 --> 01:03:29,409
My name is Park Hyun-sung. Please
take good care of my brother.

716
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:36,870
I'm sorry about what happened last time.
Please forgive me if I offended you.

717
01:03:38,183 --> 01:03:39,323
It's okay.

718
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:45,363
- Okay. Let's eat then.
- Okay.

719
01:04:03,902 --> 01:04:04,902
You came.

720
01:04:06,034 --> 01:04:08,425
Please prepare another seating for us.

721
01:04:09,488 --> 01:04:11,021
You can sit here first.

722
01:04:11,527 --> 01:04:14,807
I don't need to sit. I'm going to
leave after I say a simple word.

723
01:04:18,058 --> 01:04:21,854
Mr. Jung, are you really
going to keep doing this?

724
01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:25,037
I don't understand...

725
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:29,346
Even though you love wealthy families, how
could you even dare think of getting your

726
01:04:29,704 --> 01:04:33,081
daughter married to Hyun-joon when Kyung-soo
is the youngest son of this family?

727
01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:39,102
On top of that, in a family where
I'm going to be her mother-in-law!

728
01:04:43,143 --> 01:04:46,362
You should calm down and go outside.

729
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:50,784
Your entire family had planned to
make Hae-dang and Kyung-soo run away.

730
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:53,468
Yet you shamlessly think of
sending her off to marry

731
01:04:53,492 --> 01:04:55,957
into a family where Kyung-soo
will become her brother-in-law?

732
01:04:56,191 --> 01:04:59,382
Does Hae-dang even deserve to get
married into this kind of family?

733
01:05:00,682 --> 01:05:02,932
She deserves it more than you do!

734
01:05:04,644 --> 01:05:09,214
- Mother.
- What right do you have to appear here?

735
01:05:09,402 --> 01:05:13,104
Why don't I have the right when I'm
about to become her mother-in-law?

736
01:05:13,238 --> 01:05:14,729
Who's the mother-in-law?

737
01:05:15,784 --> 01:05:19,229
I don't acknowledge you as my daughter-in-law,
so how can you be her mother-in-law?

738
01:05:19,995 --> 01:05:23,463
If I don't acknowledge you as
my daughter-in-law, that means

739
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:26,781
I don't acknowledge your son
as part of my family as well!

740
01:05:27,745 --> 01:05:30,721
So what's the problem?
What's the problem here?

741
01:05:33,628 --> 01:05:37,043
So you're really going to humiliate
me in front of other people?

742
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:43,070
You dare start a fight
with me in this situation?

743
01:05:43,558 --> 01:05:45,276
Do you really want to start a fight?

744
01:06:21,902 --> 01:06:24,571
("You Are Too Much")

745
01:06:24,595 --> 01:06:27,656
- Her friend is coming for dinner.
- I thought you'd be happy to see him.

746
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,574
Is there a reason you
should be uncomfortable?

747
01:06:29,598 --> 01:06:32,754
My body gets hotter when I think about
how your husband is in the living room.

748
01:06:32,778 --> 01:06:35,815
Do you think you can beat
Yoo Ji-na without me?

749
01:06:36,019 --> 01:06:38,332
For now, we must make her lead.

750
01:06:38,356 --> 01:06:43,044
I think I'm the only one sane in this family!
I'm a woman who graduated from college.

751
01:06:43,068 --> 01:06:46,187
I should be the one who takes care of
the gallery, not a cabaret singer!

752
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:49,715
- I'm too terrified to live with you.
- Why are you behaving like a child?

753
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,807
There should be a place that only
you and your mother know about.

754
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:55,937
We need to find it first
before Kyung-soo does.
