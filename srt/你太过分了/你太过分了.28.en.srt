00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:07,521
(Episode 28)

2
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:14,944
(Korea University Hospital)

3
00:00:23,664 --> 00:00:25,617
She got into an accident.
She has a hemorrhage.

4
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:28,203
- Find an operation room and check her vitals.
- Hae-soo!

5
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:30,675
Hae-soo, are you okay? Hae-soo!

6
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:34,444
You'll be okay! I'm right here! Hae-soo!

7
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:38,109
Hae-soo, you'll be okay! I'm right here!

8
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,570
Hae-soo. Hae-soo.

9
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:48,921
What if something awful happens to her?

10
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:50,906
Hae-soo...

11
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:56,484
Hae-soo... Hae-soo...

12
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:58,351
Everything will be okay.

13
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:02,593
Hae-soo will be fine.

14
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,921
Lord, please save her...

15
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:08,000
Hae-soo. Hae-soo.

16
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:16,700
Dad, we'll stay here, so please
go to the car and get some rest.

17
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,328
Don't be ridiculous.

18
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:23,828
- At this rate, you'll faint. Come with me and...
- Stop being ridiculous!

19
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:28,757
Hae-soo. Hae-soo.

20
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:36,516
Hae-dang.

21
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:56,906
Goodness! No! I shouldn't
be here like this!

22
00:01:57,102 --> 00:02:02,571
Mom, just stay home! If something
happens, they'll call us!

23
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:06,576
That Yoo Ji-na! What kind
of ill-fated relationship

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,774
do we have for things to have come to this?

25
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:13,632
Oh my god! What on earth is going on?
Goodness!

26
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:16,320
Calm down. Okay?

27
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:25,789
What's wrong with your face?

28
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:31,781
Don't talk to me.

29
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:35,914
Did you fight with someone?
Why do you look like that?

30
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:40,828
Hae-dang's little sister...

31
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,250
Hae-soo...

32
00:02:48,656 --> 00:02:52,250
What? Tell me what happened.

33
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:04,453
What happened?

34
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,007
She's in surgery right now.

35
00:03:29,227 --> 00:03:30,227
Mr. Jung.

36
00:03:34,203 --> 00:03:35,203
You're here.

37
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,570
Hae-dang.

38
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:20,308
Doctor, Hae-soo is all right, isn't she?

39
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:25,476
The surgery went well, didn't it? My
youngest daughter is fine, isn't she?

40
00:04:25,968 --> 00:04:27,476
Let's wait and see.

41
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,750
I'll call you if something happens.

42
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,664
Hae-jin, take father home.

43
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:01,063
I don't want to. I'm not going anywhere.

44
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:07,273
Mr. Jung, go home and get some rest.
You can come back in the morning.

45
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:11,656
Hae-dang and I will be here.
Bong-soo has to go to work, too.

46
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:17,789
Yes, father. You'll really
collapse at this rate.

47
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:41,156
Yoo Ji-na said we should die together
and dragged me into the streets.

48
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,851
I should've just died with her.

49
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,203
Then this wouldn't have
happened to Hae-soo.

50
00:05:57,766 --> 00:06:01,523
I should've just died with her.

51
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:07,054
What do I do? What if
something happens to Hae-soo?

52
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:11,187
Hyun-joon, what if
something happens to her?

53
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:17,093
Everything will be fine. Calm down.

54
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:22,826
If something terrible happens to her, how
will I be able to live the rest of my life?

55
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:27,718
My poor Hae-soo. What if
something happens to her?

56
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,187
Who is the guardian of Jung Hae-soo?

57
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:43,031
- You need to contact her family.
- Excuse me?

58
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:47,398
It might be difficult for her
to live through the night.

59
00:06:57,781 --> 00:07:00,507
Hae-soo... Hae-soo...

60
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:09,429
Mom, what I do about Hae-soo?
Mom, please save her.

61
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,969
Mom, what I do about Hae-soo?
Mom, please save her.

62
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:21,429
Mom, what I do about Hae-soo?
Mom, please save her.

63
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:27,304
- Please save her!
- Calm down.

64
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:33,664
Please save her! Please save her, mom!

65
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:39,891
Dad.

66
00:07:41,797 --> 00:07:45,109
Yes, sweetie. My little baby.

67
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:49,789
Hae-soo, I'm right here. I'm right here.

68
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:54,554
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

69
00:07:57,305 --> 00:08:01,152
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

70
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:08,250
I was born late as a surprise...
and wasn't smart in my studies...

71
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:16,062
I'm sorry all I did was
worry you before I go.

72
00:08:16,172 --> 00:08:17,772
Why should you be sorry?

73
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,633
Hae-soo, you can't close your eyes.
You can't.

74
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:27,594
Hae-dang.

75
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:32,383
Hae-soo.

76
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:36,000
You worked hard to support me...

77
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:39,078
but I can't even pay you back...

78
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:41,648
Hae-soo.

79
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,484
I think I have to go to mom first.

80
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:57,500
No. You can't, Hae-soo. Hae-soo,
open your eyes. No! Open your eyes!

81
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:02,292
Hae-soo, open your eyes. Hae-soo!

82
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:06,789
- Hae-soo!
- No! Hae-soo!

83
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:10,046
- Hae-soo, don't go!
- Hae-soo!

84
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,045
- Hae-soo! Wake up!
- Hae-soo! Mom!

85
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:21,076
- Hae-soo!
- Hae-soo! Wake up!

86
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:25,646
Hae-soo!

87
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:33,732
Jung Hae-soo... has passed away.

88
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:40,428
No...

89
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,217
No...

90
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:49,483
No...

91
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:00,904
Hae-soo!

92
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:09,420
Hae-soo...

93
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:19,334
Hae-soo...

94
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,795
Good-bye. Hae-soo, good-bye.

95
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,521
How can I send my poor Hae-soo away?

96
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:38,045
That poor, young thing.
How can I send her away?

97
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,147
Hae-soo! Hae-soo!

98
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:48,755
- Hae-soo!
- I'm so sorry.

99
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:54,092
It's all my fault! I'm sorry, Hae-soo!

100
00:10:55,178 --> 00:10:56,670
Hae-soo!

101
00:10:57,514 --> 00:11:00,037
I should've just died back then!

102
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,209
Hae-soo!

103
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:06,873
Hae-dang, get a hold of yourself. Please.

104
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,826
I don't know! I don't know! Mom,
what do I do about Hae-soo?

105
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:22,881
My poor Hae-soo! Mom!

106
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:30,163
Mom!

107
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:40,037
How dare you come here! How dare you!

108
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,700
Someone died because of you!
An innocent person died!

109
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:50,568
Bring Hae-soo back to life!
Bring her back to life!

110
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:55,224
- Bring our poor Hae-soo back to life!
- Mom, please calm down!

111
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:57,240
How could I?

112
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,977
When I think of poor
Hae-soo who died at such a

113
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:05,139
young age without being
able to do anything...

114
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,780
how could I calm down?

115
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,279
- Why did you come here? How dare you show your face here!
- Poor Hae-soo...

116
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:28,599
- If I don't show up, they'll pick on me for not showing up.
- Pick on you?

117
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:36,672
- Give this to them.
- What's this?

118
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,224
How could I not do anything?

119
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:59,428
What does this mean? Is this the
price of dead Hae-soo's life?

120
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,209
Do you think Hae-dang's
family will accept this?

121
00:13:04,358 --> 00:13:07,482
Anyways, now you and Hae-dang
can't be together anymore.

122
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:12,107
- There's no turning back now.
- What?

123
00:13:15,788 --> 00:13:16,788
Yes.

124
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:20,021
Hae-dang and I are over.

125
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:27,634
- Now, it's time for you to be over.
- What do you mean by that?

126
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:35,533
Two people died because of you: Hae-dang's
ex-boyfriend and her little sister.

127
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,345
Two innocent, young people died!

128
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:48,087
I'm going to end you myself.

129
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:20,486
Hi, Yoon-hee.

130
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:22,876
Why did grandmother
suddenly go to a temple?

131
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:26,056
She never went to a
temple or church before.

132
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:33,001
- She's becoming soft-hearted with age.
- She's not the type to become soft-hearted.

133
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:35,611
I know.

134
00:14:45,814 --> 00:14:49,259
- Why are you trying to come in here?
- I need to check out the room to buy furniture.

135
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:53,697
- What?
- Wasn't it decided that I would be using this room?

136
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,829
Grandmother told me to drop by and see
the room when father wasn't here.

137
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,065
- Then what about me?
- Won't you be moving to the annex?

138
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:05,283
What?

139
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:10,267
- Na-kyung, come in with me and give me some advice.
- Sure.

140
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,751
Venerated One, my name is Sung Kyung-ja.

141
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:38,040
Do you listen to the prayers of sinners?

142
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,408
Please comfort my daughter-in-law who died

143
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:48,806
an unfair, pitiful death because
of a sinful, old woman like me.

144
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:55,829
I pray that there won't be anymore quarrels
between my family members anymore.

145
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:05,681
I think I need to re-do the interior.
The dressing room is a bit small, too.

146
00:16:06,346 --> 00:16:09,603
How can barge in here so rudely
without the owner's permission?

147
00:16:09,963 --> 00:16:11,978
What's the most trendy way
to do curtains lately?

148
00:16:12,197 --> 00:16:14,525
If you call the business,
they'll bring samples for you.

149
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:18,290
Ko Na-kyung, take her out
of this room at once.

150
00:16:18,721 --> 00:16:22,720
If you re-do the interior and bring in
new furniture, the room will be pretty.

151
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:25,259
The shape of the room is pretty nice.

152
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,759
I don't think it will be
bad after a makeover.

153
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:30,272
Get out immediately!

154
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:47,095
Preparing for a wedding is not an easy task.
There are so many things to prepare for.

155
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:49,049
That's the fun of it.

156
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,236
It's the most glamorous
moment of a woman's life.

157
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:59,962
- Could you even afford glamor at your wedding?
- What is that supposed to mean?

158
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:04,893
I was curious why my mother-in-law
accepted you as her granddaughter-in-law

159
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:08,810
and asked my husband who gave me
the short version of the story.

160
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:17,960
I heard she had chosen you on purpose in
order to humiliate her ex-daughter-in-law.

161
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,413
Is that true?

162
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:27,147
What are you looking at? Go
and get some more pickles.

163
00:17:29,452 --> 00:17:30,655
Go get them yourself.

164
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:36,014
What? How dare you speak
casually to your mother-in-law?

165
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,440
Mother-in-law, my foot. You
couldn't even have a wedding.

166
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:44,656
Who couldn't have a wedding?
I told you celebrities

167
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,171
nowadays don't make a big
commotion about their weddings.

168
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:51,858
That's because they're trying to be
good examples as public figures.

169
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:56,778
Isn't the reason why you
barely registered for marriage

170
00:17:56,802 --> 00:18:00,476
because you have no choice but
to hide away from people?

171
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:03,648
I have to hide away from people?

172
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:10,358
Go outside and see how many
people know you're married.

173
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,780
Get up. Right now!

174
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:18,131
I did. Now what will you do?

175
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:23,587
Why are you acting up so fearlessly?
What will you do later on?

176
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:25,688
Later, whatever.

177
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:31,506
I think father will end
before grandmother does.

178
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:33,663
What do you mean?

179
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:38,561
You don't need to know. While you're
up, go get some more pickles.

180
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:43,194
What?

181
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:49,022
Yoon-hee, let's continue eating.

182
00:18:58,108 --> 00:19:03,569
Should we speak in English in front of her
from now on? We can make her into a fool.

183
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:06,100
I'm not that skillful in English.

184
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:08,710
Just pretend you understand
even if you don't.

185
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:14,045
That's true. She won't
even know the difference.

186
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:22,538
Conglomerate women? Yeah, right.

187
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:26,225
They're just gangsters.

188
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,491
Vile creatures.

189
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,030
Grandmother.

190
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:52,116
Have some tea.

191
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,881
Where is that vulgar thing?

192
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:57,693
She went out and hasn't come back yet.

193
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,139
Tell everyone to come to the living room.

194
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:03,428
What do you need to tell us?

195
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,850
Annul the registration for marriage.

196
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:12,147
This isn't even a joke.
What are you talking about?

197
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:17,217
If you annul the registration, I'll allow
her to live under the same roof as us.

198
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:24,530
That also means I won't bully her.

199
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,663
- I can't do that.
- Answer wisely.

200
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:32,624
Even though you ask me multiple
times, I can't do that.

201
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:37,366
All of you know by now
that your father was there

202
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,008
when your mother fell off
the cliff, don't you?

203
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:46,452
What are you trying to say?

204
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:49,358
Don't you have any
questions about the will?

205
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,683
Let me clearly remind you
that the handwriting in

206
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:54,600
the will has been confirmed
to be their mother's.

207
00:20:56,046 --> 00:21:01,272
The will clearly indicated that
she had committed suicide.

208
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,514
Let me tell you again.
Annul the registration.

209
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:12,155
Answer me. Annul it.

210
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:14,780
I can't. Why should I?

211
00:21:16,202 --> 00:21:18,491
What should I be afraid of
that makes me annul it?

212
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:21,874
Do you remember before that
day you needed inside data

213
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,491
from the safe because of an
emergency at the company?

214
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:32,821
Do you remember you couldn't
tell anyone else to do it and

215
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:36,593
said I had to open the safe and
bring you the data myself?

216
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:42,889
What do you think I saw in that safe?

217
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,803
Annul the registration of marriage.

218
00:21:58,272 --> 00:21:59,897
How can you just go in like that?

219
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,163
What is she talking about?

220
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:10,725
What was inside the safe?
What was in there?

221
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:23,210
The will that Kyung-ae had
written before her death.

222
00:22:24,741 --> 00:22:28,788
Why was that in your safe
before the incident happened?

223
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:33,108
- Mother.
- How will you explain that?

224
00:22:33,475 --> 00:22:37,139
- I didn't kill her.
- Then you should try to get out of it.

225
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:40,413
- Mother.
- Should I tell the police?

226
00:22:41,804 --> 00:22:45,639
Should we talk about this
together at the police station?

227
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:53,764
So annul the registration of
marriage with that vulgar thing.

228
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:57,256
I made it clear.

229
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:00,858
For the sake of my grandsons, I can't die

230
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:04,976
before I get rid of her
on our family register.

231
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:11,366
So will you request for a re-investigation
to turn me, your son, into a murderer?

232
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,883
I told you that even if you're
my son, if you don't seem

233
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:17,977
like a human, I'll give up
on you without any regrets.

234
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:19,905
You don't think I can?

235
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:23,569
You don't think I can do it?

236
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:35,045
Go ahead and try it if you can.

237
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:37,757
What?

238
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,006
We should reserve a hotel
before it's too late.

239
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:53,584
It's too hot, so we should
have an indoor wedding.

240
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:55,896
Push back the wedding.

241
00:23:57,718 --> 00:23:59,710
- Why?
- Let's do it after summer.

242
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:05,960
- So, why?
- It's not the time for me to be getting married right now.

243
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:08,178
Why not?

244
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,670
What do you think I saw in that safe?

245
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:19,452
Anyways, I can't have
the wedding right now.

246
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:25,801
Because of that woman?

247
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,982
- What?
- Is it because of that woman you still

248
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:31,995
get drunken over because
you can't forget her?

249
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:37,513
- Let me meet her.
- Who?

250
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:41,786
I think Yoo Ji-na knows her.
Should I ask her instead?

251
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,583
Don't get any funny ideas.

252
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,794
Are you kidding me right now?

253
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:02,279
The will that Kyung-ae had
written before her death.

254
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:06,193
Why was that in your safe
before the incident happened?

255
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:13,974
So annul the registration of
marriage with that vulgar thing.

256
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:42,154
I need to gather the reporters and
officially announce our marriage.

257
00:25:43,412 --> 00:25:46,381
Announce our marriage? Let's take it slow.

258
00:25:46,568 --> 00:25:50,835
- Why?
- What are you so worried about when we registered for marriage already?

259
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:52,771
That's not what this is about!

260
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:56,427
I need to tell the whole world
about this confidently.

261
00:25:57,287 --> 00:26:01,099
To be honest, I'm even confused
whether I'm married or not.

262
00:26:02,818 --> 00:26:03,967
Let's think about this.

263
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:08,740
"We already registered for marriage. Yoo
Ji-na is Park Sung-hwan's legal wife."

264
00:26:09,154 --> 00:26:12,036
I want to tell the world about this,
so what do we need to think about?

265
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:14,435
So let's take things slowly.

266
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:16,357
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

267
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:19,755
I can announce it to the
reporters by myself.

268
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:28,872
- My life is about to be over just because I love the woman Yoo Ji-na.
- What?

269
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:35,396
Did you decide the hotel where
the wedding will take place?

270
00:26:35,716 --> 00:26:39,552
Let me know how many people you'll invite.

271
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:43,505
- I'll let you know by this week.
- I can't have a wedding right now.

272
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:50,013
Does it look like I can get married
right now as my dead mom's son?

273
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,427
All of you are being ridiculous.

274
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:09,583
- Would you like another cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

275
00:27:11,513 --> 00:27:16,474
What if the groom runs away during the
wedding? Just like in the movies?

276
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:19,700
I need to talk to you.

277
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,388
Who? Me?

278
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:26,732
You can just talk here.

279
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:40,045
- Do you know the woman who Hyun-joon is in love with?
- Of course.

280
00:27:40,443 --> 00:27:41,544
What is she like?

281
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:45,130
- A woman who, if you see, you'll faint.
- She's that bad?

282
00:27:47,678 --> 00:27:50,599
You won't be able win against her
even if there are thirty of you.

283
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,974
She truly is a vulgar thing.

284
00:27:54,545 --> 00:27:56,678
My mother-in-law should see her.

285
00:27:58,498 --> 00:28:02,263
Then she'll stop calling me a vulgar thing.

286
00:28:02,787 --> 00:28:04,880
Give me her number. Do you have it?

287
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:07,701
Of course I do.

288
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:10,591
- Give it to me then.
- Is that a favor?

289
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:18,094
Thinking about it now, you're intelligent
and from a prestigious family.

290
00:28:18,118 --> 00:28:21,404
You have it all. The only thing
you're missing is pride.

291
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:23,607
What did you say?

292
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:25,705
If you had any pride, you
wouldn't even be waving

293
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:27,842
good-bye at a man whose
heart has already left you.

294
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:31,818
Yet, you're asking me in a gentle voice
because you want to hold him back?

295
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:34,951
How pathetic.

296
00:28:39,154 --> 00:28:40,482
You are urgent, after all.

297
00:28:43,404 --> 00:28:48,388
- Say, "I'm sorry."
- Excuse me?

298
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:54,146
Say, "I'll never act arrogant
in front of you, mother."

299
00:28:57,685 --> 00:29:00,224
You can't? You don't want to?

300
00:29:04,427 --> 00:29:07,802
Then just sit there and be
dumped by Park Hyun-joon.

301
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:14,044
Just be dumped. I can't watch
you be so pathetic anymore.

302
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:17,358
Why are you persisting to be around
a man who doesn't even like you?

303
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:20,290
I'm not being persistent.
I'm trying to make an

304
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:23,402
ending to all the years
I've spent waiting for him.

305
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:27,669
All the years you've spent waiting for him?

306
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:31,916
Then what about all those wives who didn't
spend time waiting for their husbands?

307
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:37,021
Do relationships work out if you
just spend years with them?

308
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:43,246
I would have acted differently
if I was marrying

309
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,701
a man who is eighteen
years older than I am.

310
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,880
- What?
- So you're that confident about men, are you?

311
00:29:53,217 --> 00:29:56,591
Of course you are, since you've
given birth to a child at such

312
00:29:57,116 --> 00:30:00,592
an early age, so you must be
a professional in that area.

313
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,138
Are you done?

314
00:30:04,717 --> 00:30:06,544
You only know how to do one thing.

315
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:09,151
So even if your career as
a singer is over, you get

316
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,037
to play the role of the
wife of a wealthy CEO.

317
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:19,583
As a woman, I respect you, Mrs. Yoo Ji-na.

318
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,302
What did you see inside the safe?

319
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:46,013
Don't worry about that
and just get married.

320
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,841
How can you say that?

321
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:53,740
It means I'm more worried
about your life than you are.

322
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:59,263
I never asked you to worry about me.
I want to reveal the truth.

323
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:02,286
When the time comes to reveal
the truth comes, we will.

324
00:31:02,545 --> 00:31:04,021
When the time comes?

325
00:31:04,498 --> 00:31:09,841
It means I'm going to use it to protect
the lives of you and Hyun-sung.

326
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,858
So are you saying the truth will
be revealed if there's a need for

327
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,240
it to be revealed, but otherwise,
it will just be covered up?

328
00:31:17,513 --> 00:31:19,232
- Of course.
- Excuse me?

329
00:31:19,466 --> 00:31:23,029
If we reveal the truth, will
your dead mom come back alive?

330
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:24,638
We need to prove her injustice.

331
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:27,958
You might become even more
unjustified by doing that.

332
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,138
What do you think your mom wants?

333
00:31:31,748 --> 00:31:35,654
It's for you and Hyun-sung to live well.

334
00:31:36,045 --> 00:31:41,245
- Grandmother.
- When worst comes to worst, I'll take him down for you myself.

335
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:44,661
Just taking him down now won't do any good.

336
00:31:45,545 --> 00:31:49,099
What about the company and
our family reputation?

337
00:31:49,271 --> 00:31:53,247
- I don't care about the family reputation.
- You will when you get older.

338
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,841
- Grandmother.
- This is the family of your children.

339
00:31:57,303 --> 00:32:00,794
- I don't care.
- You shouldn't say that when you haven't even gotten married yet.

340
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,122
So if you pity your dead mom,

341
00:32:07,123 --> 00:32:13,341
marry Yoon-hee, take over the
company, and live like a human being.

342
00:32:19,336 --> 00:32:21,045
(Cover Letters That Guarantee Acceptance)

343
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,615
Discard whatever needs to be discarded.

344
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:27,896
All her books have to do with employment.

345
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:38,919
What a life. That's how she
lived before she died.

346
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:45,661
If you keep crying, your father
will become even more upset.

347
00:32:46,154 --> 00:32:47,794
How would he feel right now?

348
00:32:58,576 --> 00:32:59,576
Hae-soo...

349
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:02,256
Hae-soo!

350
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:09,474
This won't do. Just pack the important
things. I'll take care of the rest.

351
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:12,395
If you grab onto each and
every thing and think

352
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,740
about her, we won't be able
to organize everything.

353
00:33:17,068 --> 00:33:21,294
Who the hell is Yoo Ji-na
to interfere in our lives?

354
00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:40,341
Don't be like this. Have a few bites.

355
00:33:45,084 --> 00:33:46,817
What are you trying to do?

356
00:33:47,428 --> 00:33:53,208
I let that young baby die on her own...

357
00:33:55,849 --> 00:33:57,466
I want to follow her.

358
00:33:58,545 --> 00:34:00,404
How can you say that?

359
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:11,626
This happened because we had lived off
of Hae-dang singing Yoo Ji-na's songs.

360
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:18,255
So this is all my fault. Who
else can we blame for this?

361
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,679
She died because of me.

362
00:34:25,912 --> 00:34:27,935
She died because of me.

363
00:34:32,545 --> 00:34:34,513
I should have gone in her place.

364
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:40,810
I'm the one with many sins. I
should have gone in her place.

365
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,200
What did that poor baby do wrong?

366
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,215
What did that poor, young thing do wrong?

367
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,334
Father.

368
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:12,052
Father.

369
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:32,146
At least you should get a hold of yourself.

370
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:39,740
No one else is as tenacious
and stupid as I am.

371
00:35:40,779 --> 00:35:41,779
What?

372
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,539
We can't even afford my
studies, but I burdened the

373
00:35:45,563 --> 00:35:47,702
family by insisting I
would become a professor.

374
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:50,161
Why would you suddenly bring that up?

375
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:56,247
One day, Hae-soo felt too
apologetic to tell Hae-dang,

376
00:35:58,154 --> 00:36:00,251
so she came to me and asked
for $500 so she could

377
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:02,286
go on a trip to southeast
Asia with her friends.

378
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:06,712
I told her I didn't even
have enough money to die.

379
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:09,193
I said I don't have such money on me.

380
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:11,928
Honey.

381
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:20,153
Everyone goes abroad for trips these days,
but she couldn't even go to one of them.

382
00:36:22,506 --> 00:36:25,068
There are no young adults who
had lived like her before.

383
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,670
I know.

384
00:36:29,873 --> 00:36:32,804
She felt so bad about being unemployed
that she did all the household

385
00:36:32,828 --> 00:36:35,297
chores and didn't even go out
to hang out with her friends.

386
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,005
When I think about her, she's so pitiful.

387
00:36:41,678 --> 00:36:45,905
After my mom passed away,
Hae-dang had gone out to work,

388
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:50,763
and Hae-sung and I were too busy studying,

389
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:57,044
All I did was feed her in the corner.

390
00:36:58,506 --> 00:37:00,021
All I did was feed her...

391
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:05,193
Hae-soo was very kind.

392
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:12,450
There won't be a kinder soul in this world.

393
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,357
Hae-soo...

394
00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:23,957
Poor Hae-soo. Poor Hae-soo.

395
00:37:31,435 --> 00:37:32,435
Hae-soo.

396
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,279
You haven't eaten for the past few days.
What will you do?

397
00:37:52,443 --> 00:37:54,880
Just take one bite. Okay?

398
00:37:59,506 --> 00:38:02,373
You should be stronger at a time like this.

399
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:04,982
What will you do if you're
just blank like this?

400
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:12,677
Back then, I should've
just died with that woman.

401
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:21,013
It's my destiny to die as her shadow...

402
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:24,646
so I should have died with her.

403
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:26,755
Are you going to keep saying that?

404
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:29,404
She died instead of me.

405
00:38:32,201 --> 00:38:36,458
- She died because of me!
- How could you say that?

406
00:38:37,771 --> 00:38:45,053
Hae-soo! Hae-soo! Hae-soo!

407
00:38:46,178 --> 00:38:47,255
Hae-soo!

408
00:38:53,653 --> 00:38:57,919
Stop crying, Hae-dang. You cried so
much that you don't even have energy.

409
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,982
If you continue to do this,
you'll get really sick.

410
00:39:01,529 --> 00:39:03,862
What do I do about my poor Hae-soo?

411
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:09,880
What do I do about my
poor, innocent Hae-soo?

412
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:16,279
Stop crying.

413
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:43,655
You should go inside. Why
are you standing here?

414
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,036
Because her family might think
of Yoo Ji-na when they see me.

415
00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:53,021
Let's go somewhere and talk.

416
00:39:58,644 --> 00:40:03,029
She cries and faints. When she
wakes up, she cries again.

417
00:40:04,013 --> 00:40:06,646
She cries over and over
again until her lips burst.

418
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:13,341
I'm sure you know very well that to
Hae-dang, her sisters are her children.

419
00:40:15,662 --> 00:40:18,958
She cries so much that I can't
watch her without crying myself.

420
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:29,286
She doesn't eat or sleep. All she does
it cry. I'm worried she'll get sick.

421
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:34,851
Can you help me see her?

422
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,966
I just need a moment with her.

423
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:00,646
Hae-dang.

424
00:41:02,185 --> 00:41:03,318
What do you want?

425
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:12,113
I'm so sorry that I can't
even open my mouth right now.

426
00:41:14,114 --> 00:41:15,714
Why should you be sorry?

427
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:21,349
- Hae-dang.
- She died because of me.

428
00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:29,224
I didn't know my place and tried to love
someone, so I ended up killing her.

429
00:41:30,545 --> 00:41:31,945
How can you say that?

430
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:37,865
I have no idea how I dared to
get married to Yoo Ji-na's son.

431
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:39,803
Hae-dang.

432
00:41:40,294 --> 00:41:43,424
I was able to make a living thanks
to the great and amazing Yoo Ji-na,

433
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,044
so if she told me not to do
something, I shouldn't have done it.

434
00:41:47,974 --> 00:41:52,083
I acted up without listening to her
and ended up killing my poor sister.

435
00:41:52,654 --> 00:41:55,177
- Hae-dang.
- It's my fault.

436
00:41:56,795 --> 00:41:59,794
It's my fault! It's my fault!

437
00:42:02,123 --> 00:42:03,123
Hae-soo!

438
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:07,959
Hae-soo!

439
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,493
Bring my poor sister back to life!

440
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:16,263
Bring my poor sister back to life!

441
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:19,818
Bring my poor sister back to life!

442
00:42:21,513 --> 00:42:25,357
Hae-soo! Bring her back to life!

443
00:42:28,185 --> 00:42:31,005
Bring my poor sister back to life!

444
00:42:42,287 --> 00:42:45,833
Hi. I have something to tell you.

445
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,293
- Me?
- Come back down after you changed.

446
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:50,959
Honey.

447
00:42:59,896 --> 00:43:01,263
What's wrong with you?

448
00:43:01,981 --> 00:43:05,450
I have a different position than
you because I'm my mom's son, too.

449
00:43:10,224 --> 00:43:11,490
What are you talking about?

450
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:15,591
The one who got mom's
letter is Yoo Ji-na's son.

451
00:43:16,826 --> 00:43:19,107
The one who got it is blind.

452
00:43:19,404 --> 00:43:21,849
- He got surgery not too long ago.
- No way.

453
00:43:22,068 --> 00:43:24,388
It's probably a lie that
he lost the letter.

454
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:27,529
A lie? How do you know
if he was lying or not?

455
00:43:27,857 --> 00:43:31,279
He snuck into our house because
he read something in that letter.

456
00:43:32,537 --> 00:43:33,958
What do you mean by that?

457
00:43:35,442 --> 00:43:38,802
- Did you tell him everything about Lee Kyung-soo?
- Of course.

458
00:43:39,131 --> 00:43:40,652
I told you to tell him later.

459
00:43:40,676 --> 00:43:43,397
Didn't you see my grandmother acting
as if she has nothing to lose?

460
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,513
Why else would she have
made such a decision?

461
00:43:46,676 --> 00:43:49,121
If she hadn't, things
would have become worse.

462
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,372
I told you it doesn't matter who
inherits the company if you don't.

463
00:43:52,935 --> 00:43:55,685
You might feel that way, but not me.

464
00:43:57,763 --> 00:44:01,396
It's either me or Hyun-joon. I can't
stand to see anyone else inheriting it.

465
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:06,287
Hyun-joon and I grew up
witnessing our mom's tears.

466
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,961
I told you that I played the
role of an obedient dog

467
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:14,649
to my father and grandmother
so that I can beat them.

468
00:44:16,849 --> 00:44:18,904
I didn't just do that to beat Hyun-joon.

469
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,583
However, my father is capable of bringing
in a total stranger to beat his two sons.

470
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:31,388
Do you think he's a fool?
Do you think he's immature?

471
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:35,270
I told he's just throwing
a bait in order to keep

472
00:44:35,294 --> 00:44:38,538
Kyung-soo's mouth shut
about your mother's death!

473
00:44:38,562 --> 00:44:40,101
It might not just be a simple bait.

474
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:44,743
If it looks like he's about to be
pointed as murderer, he'll give up

475
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:48,911
the company and use whatever means
to make it out alive by himself.

476
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:53,239
After listening to my grandmother,
I'm sure there's a critical

477
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:56,362
weakness about my father that
has to do with my mom's death.

478
00:44:58,841 --> 00:45:03,435
Then it's obvious he'll betray his
sons in order to clear his name.

479
00:45:04,138 --> 00:45:07,221
Then, in the fight between your father and

480
00:45:07,245 --> 00:45:10,397
grandmother, are you
going to take her side?

481
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:15,583
At least she's trying to repent, since
she's getting close to death's doorstep.

482
00:45:28,803 --> 00:45:32,116
Don't mind me and continue eating. I'm
just going to get a cup of coffee.

483
00:45:39,201 --> 00:45:42,341
But have we met somewhere before?

484
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:46,137
Maybe it's because you have
a good impression, but

485
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:48,122
I feel like this isn't the
first time we've met.

486
00:45:49,631 --> 00:45:51,943
Although I don't remember
where I've seen you before.

487
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:55,740
- I don't feel the same way.
- Really?

488
00:46:07,755 --> 00:46:11,880
Is it true that Kyung-soo was
blind just a few months ago?

489
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:17,534
- How do you know that?
- Why didn't you tell me?

490
00:46:20,224 --> 00:46:22,232
Why would I tell you such a thing?

491
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:47,537
Is it true my mom told
you to give me a letter?

492
00:46:50,232 --> 00:46:52,216
Are you that Lee Kyung-soo?

493
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,600
Where's the letter?

494
00:46:59,256 --> 00:47:02,717
I told you I lost it when
you called me that time.

495
00:47:02,741 --> 00:47:04,458
There's no way you would've lost it!

496
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,216
Then why did you sneak into my
house trying to find something?

497
00:47:09,912 --> 00:47:13,700
You lied about your name. You got a
surgery, so you're not blind anymore.

498
00:47:14,513 --> 00:47:17,435
Yet, why did you sneak into my
house pretending to be blind?

499
00:47:19,178 --> 00:47:24,419
I told you I lost it because I lost it.
Why would I have lied about that?

500
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:26,669
Because you're Yoo Ji-na's son.

501
00:47:28,857 --> 00:47:33,310
Because if Mr. Park was the culprit,
Ji-na's life would be over as well.

502
00:47:34,114 --> 00:47:35,943
Isn't that why you lied?

503
00:47:38,911 --> 00:47:40,154
Give me the letter.

504
00:47:42,498 --> 00:47:46,396
Think of my mom who died an unjustified death,
and hand over the letter to me at once!

505
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:07,800
You know Yoo Ji-na's son is the
one mom had sponsored, don't you?

506
00:48:09,513 --> 00:48:14,740
- I heard.
- Do you also know he's strongly suspicious about her death?

507
00:48:16,732 --> 00:48:21,005
Is that what you're so afraid of that made
you say you'll make him into your son?

508
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,779
I told him I would make him into
my son before I heard that.

509
00:48:25,045 --> 00:48:28,241
Did you beg him to keep his mouth
shut, and that in turn, you

510
00:48:28,265 --> 00:48:31,357
would forget about your two sons
and make him the successor?

511
00:48:31,717 --> 00:48:37,068
Why would I beg him to keep his mouth shut?
I heard he was suspicious.

512
00:48:38,724 --> 00:48:41,272
However, he doesn't have to keep
his mouth shut about anything.

513
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:44,630
You must have heard mom had left a
letter with him before she had died.

514
00:48:46,576 --> 00:48:48,646
A letter? What letter?

515
00:48:48,943 --> 00:48:51,532
Didn't you say you would
let him inherit everything

516
00:48:51,556 --> 00:48:53,943
because the clue to her
death is in that letter?

517
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,907
I have no idea what you're talking about.

518
00:48:57,098 --> 00:49:03,021
He read something in that letter and
snuck into our house to find the clue.

519
00:49:08,505 --> 00:49:12,990
Are you still going to argue
that mom's death was a suicide?

520
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:17,819
You killed mom, but you
used the company as a

521
00:49:17,843 --> 00:49:20,420
bait to keep his mouth
so that you can live?

522
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:25,904
I never promised to give him the company.

523
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,185
However, it's my decision who
I will give the company to.

524
00:49:29,396 --> 00:49:31,396
- Is the company yours?
- Then whose is it?

525
00:49:31,544 --> 00:49:35,357
It was grandfather's. So
it belongs to dead mom.

526
00:49:37,654 --> 00:49:40,646
I'm sorry, but currently,
the company is mine.

527
00:49:42,076 --> 00:49:44,710
It's my company that I put
in a lot of effort to grow.

528
00:49:45,904 --> 00:49:47,607
Why don't you guys accept that?

529
00:49:49,443 --> 00:49:55,091
At one time, it belonged to your
grandfather, but right now, it's mine.

530
00:49:56,959 --> 00:50:00,310
- It's mine!
- No one thinks that's true!

531
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:06,333
Because you stole it. Because you're
just holding onto it temporarily.

532
00:50:06,646 --> 00:50:10,560
Fine. I stole it. Even so, it's mine.

533
00:50:12,169 --> 00:50:15,232
- What?
- Try and take the company if you can.

534
00:50:16,053 --> 00:50:19,821
Even if I stole it, it's mine.
Whoever I give it to is up to me.

535
00:50:21,646 --> 00:50:24,396
Blood? So what if we're not blood-related?

536
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:27,306
My blood-related sons treat me this way.

537
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:33,443
So it would be better for me to get a
complete stranger and make him into my son.

538
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:57,646
You must have heard mom had left a
letter with him before she had died.

539
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:06,263
You can't give up the letter easily because
you still think of her as your mom.

540
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,552
Let's have a press conference
to announce our marriage.

541
00:51:33,506 --> 00:51:36,740
- Do you mean it?
- Let's do it as quickly as possible.

542
00:51:39,849 --> 00:51:44,130
If we announce our marriage, I'll
be able to come back as a singer.

543
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,646
Truth be told, the news of our
disengagement had been fatal to me.

544
00:51:51,615 --> 00:51:54,958
If we announce our marriage, people
will assume it was just a mistake.

545
00:51:56,521 --> 00:51:59,904
Falling on stage could
just pass for an accident.

546
00:52:03,482 --> 00:52:09,685
- Why did you suddenly make up your mind?
- I need your son.

547
00:52:11,154 --> 00:52:16,544
- What did you just say?
- I need your son.

548
00:52:20,865 --> 00:52:21,865
Honey...

549
00:52:22,678 --> 00:52:25,558
He doesn't have any intention
to tell the world he's your son

550
00:52:25,582 --> 00:52:28,506
anyways, so why should we be
afraid of announcing our marriage?

551
00:52:29,381 --> 00:52:35,794
Publish an article tomorrow announcing our
marriage and your return as a singer.

552
00:52:40,732 --> 00:52:41,866
Thank you, honey.

553
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:02,990
Grandmother, take a look at this.

554
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:04,599
What's this?

555
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:09,271
There's an article stating that
she'll hold a press conference about

556
00:53:09,295 --> 00:53:12,212
her marriage and that she'll make
a comeback as a singer also.

557
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:15,209
I told them clearly what
I wanted, but they dare

558
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,048
to hold a press conference
about their marriage?

559
00:53:18,482 --> 00:53:21,232
Does she really want a
taste of her own medicine?

560
00:53:22,506 --> 00:53:24,302
Oh my goodness.

561
00:53:24,967 --> 00:53:27,061
I told you to annul your
registration of marriage

562
00:53:27,085 --> 00:53:28,967
to her, but you dare
hold a press conference?

563
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,755
Are you joking with me?

564
00:53:32,365 --> 00:53:34,599
- Do whatever you want.
- What?

565
00:53:34,959 --> 00:53:38,077
You can go to the police station
and ask for a re-investigation

566
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:40,584
or make me into a murderer.
Do whatever you please.

567
00:53:41,209 --> 00:53:44,747
What did you say? You don't think I can?

568
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:48,193
Do you think I won't be able to
do it because you're my son?

569
00:53:48,342 --> 00:53:52,701
You'll be able to. There's nothing
you're not capable of doing.

570
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:59,591
So do it. Do whatever you want.

571
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,804
This woman is too much!

572
00:54:15,341 --> 00:54:17,997
We're still in grief over
losing our precious Hae-soo!

573
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:22,265
- But what? She'll get married?
- They must have already registered for marriage.

574
00:54:22,289 --> 00:54:26,460
No way! This is absolutely rude!

575
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:30,749
If she felt an ounce of responsibility
for causing Hae-soo's death,

576
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:37,781
she shouldn't be having a press conference
about her marriage with such a happy face.

577
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:46,749
She's too much.

578
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:50,159
I'm going to spread the truth about her all

579
00:54:50,183 --> 00:54:52,109
over the internet. I can't
hold it in anymore.

580
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:54,512
I'm going to reveal the truth
about how she abandoned

581
00:54:54,536 --> 00:54:56,626
her son and all the facts
she hid about herself.

582
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:59,999
Who will believe you? Who will believe you
for talking about her on the internet?

583
00:55:00,437 --> 00:55:03,203
If she says they're all lies
and sues you for defamation,

584
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:07,002
will you drag Lee Kyung-soo over and
make him reveal himself as her son?

585
00:55:08,241 --> 00:55:11,476
If something goes wrong, you might
end up taking all the blame.

586
00:55:11,961 --> 00:55:14,328
With her temper, she's
capable of doing anything.

587
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,359
How could she do this?

588
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:22,585
Hae-soo died. We're all
crushed about her death.

589
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:28,368
It's like she's teasing us. How could
she take a picture with a smiling face?

590
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:33,734
That's enough, Hae-sung. We weren't
humans to her from the beginning.

591
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:40,195
She never treated us as humans
because we lived off of her songs.

592
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:44,538
Hae-dang, I can't bring
myself to go into that

593
00:55:44,562 --> 00:55:47,953
room because it makes me think of Hae-soo.

594
00:55:53,031 --> 00:55:56,828
All right. Fine. I'll do it for you.

595
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:04,890
I won't let her get away with this anymore.

596

(Singer Yoo Ji-na Will Hold Press
Conference About Her Marriage.

597

(After Her Marriage Announcement,
She Will Return As A Singer.)

598
00:56:42,711 --> 00:56:43,867
What are you doing?

599
00:56:45,586 --> 00:56:47,624
Someone died because of you!

600
00:56:49,609 --> 00:56:51,507
Her sister was like a child to her.

601
00:56:53,203 --> 00:56:56,031
Hae-dang spent her youth taking
care of her like a child!

602
00:56:58,094 --> 00:57:02,562
She's depressed because she lost her
sister, but what are you doing?

603
00:57:02,945 --> 00:57:06,984
Her innocent sister died because she got
in the way without knowing her place.

604
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,196
- What did you say?
- That's why she should've broken up with you when I told her to.

605
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,249
Why did she fearlessly hold back
and let an innocent person die?

606
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:16,906
Are you done?

607
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,398
Forget the marriage announcement and
move out of that house at once.

608
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:27,659
- What?
- When you think of late Mrs. Choi Kyung-ae, how

609
00:57:27,683 --> 00:57:31,559
could you even think of pushing
aside her sons using me?

610
00:57:34,555 --> 00:57:39,902
- This is why they say it's unfair for the dead.
- What?

611
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:49,210
If you regret even the tiniest
bit of abandoning me,

612
00:57:50,945 --> 00:57:53,079
then consider it as atoning
for your sins and leave.

613
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:55,344
- That's not atonement!
- Then what is?

614
00:57:55,368 --> 00:57:58,671
Atonement is making you into
the son of a conglomerate CEO!

615
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:08,359
If I announce my marriage, I can
come back as a singer, too.

616
00:58:08,922 --> 00:58:13,515
You're going to become the wife of a
conglomerate CEO and return as a singer?

617
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,484
Yes. So what?

618
00:58:18,218 --> 00:58:22,218
Then what about Hae-dang who
lost her sister because of you?

619
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:24,484
That's all she could ever amount to.

620
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:27,964
Why are you blaming me
for her sister's death

621
00:58:27,988 --> 00:58:30,149
when it was her fault
for getting in my way?

622
00:58:31,414 --> 00:58:32,547
What did you say?

623
00:58:33,297 --> 00:58:35,492
Mr. Park says he needs you.

624
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:39,203
He needs me? Of course he does.

625
00:58:40,414 --> 00:58:43,562
- Do you even know what that means?
- Of course I do!

626
00:58:44,383 --> 00:58:49,117
It means he loves me so he's going
to love you more than his own sons!

627
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:50,679
Don't be ridiculous!

628
00:58:52,531 --> 00:58:55,460
Now, I fulfilled all of my wishes.

629
00:58:57,453 --> 00:58:59,328
You and Hae-dang are over.

630
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:02,085
I became the wife of a conglomerate CEO.

631
00:59:03,187 --> 00:59:05,054
I can come back as a singer.

632
00:59:06,062 --> 00:59:11,593
And I can make you into Mr.
Park's favorite son.

633
00:59:14,195 --> 00:59:16,843
Didn't I fulfill everything then?

634
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:23,593
You fulfilled everything?

635
00:59:25,476 --> 00:59:27,458

01:00:22,676 --> 01:00:26,288
(Press Conference About
Yoo Ji-na's Marriage)

643
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:45,609
It's been a long time. I'm
singer Yoo Ji-na. Hello.

644
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:50,593
The reason why I gathered
all of you here today...

645
01:00:54,711 --> 01:01:01,499
is to officially announce my marriage,
just as it had been stated in the article.

646
01:01:03,624 --> 01:01:04,691
Congratulations!

647
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:07,961
After your announcement of
engagement, there was the engagement

648
01:01:07,985 --> 01:01:10,983
disturbance, news of disengagement,
broadcast accident, and etc.

649
01:01:11,304 --> 01:01:13,796
How does it feel to get married in the end?

650
01:01:16,156 --> 01:01:21,374
How can I explain that process with words?

651
01:01:23,461 --> 01:01:26,234
As you had predicted, I
had a very tough time.

652
01:01:27,265 --> 01:01:30,858
Due to stress, I overdosed
on sedative pills.

653
01:01:31,656 --> 01:01:35,913
From that shock, I had
made an accident on TV.

654
01:01:39,975 --> 01:01:46,953
I was so sorry to my fans that
I had even considered dying.

655
01:01:53,547 --> 01:01:55,789
However, everything was found
to be a misunderstanding.

656
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:57,930
Thanks to that, I'm able
to announce my marriage

657
01:01:57,954 --> 01:02:00,243
today, so I consider all of
that to be just the past.

From now on, I will try my very
best to work hard and live happily.

659
01:02:09,047 --> 01:02:12,163
Then when are you planning
to have the wedding?

660
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:16,619
I agree with celebrities who invite a
few close friends and family members

661
01:02:16,643 --> 01:02:20,680
to have a non-disclosure wedding in
order to be good examples to society.

662
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:24,725
We already registered our marriage, so
we're planning to have a modest wedding.

663
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:28,156
We heard you were going to return as a
singer after your marriage. Is that true?

664
01:02:28,289 --> 01:02:33,804
Of course. I can't live
away from the stage.

665
01:02:34,969 --> 01:02:38,570
I'll repay everyone's love
for me with better songs.

666
01:02:38,594 --> 01:02:41,046
Mr. Park Sung-hwan, can
you say a word, please?

667
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:46,390
First of all, I would like
to apologize for causing

668
01:02:47,749 --> 01:02:51,266
a disturbance after our
engagement announcement.

669
01:02:52,211 --> 01:02:53,914
It's all my fault for being incompetent.

670
01:02:54,414 --> 01:03:01,124
I would like to apologize by showing
you our new happy life together.

671
01:03:15,234 --> 01:03:20,007
I would like to sincerely thank her
fans who were worried about her.

672
01:03:20,836 --> 01:03:26,351
I promise to try my best to make her
into the happiest bride in the world.

673
01:03:27,422 --> 01:03:28,422
Thank you.

674
01:03:28,734 --> 01:03:31,820
Please come to the front for photos.

675
01:03:42,843 --> 01:03:45,984
- Please look here!
- This way!

676
01:03:46,828 --> 01:03:49,428
- Please look this way!
- Look this way!

677
01:03:56,445 --> 01:03:59,078
My name is Lee Kyung-soo!

678
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:07,546
I am Yoo Ji-na's son whom she has
given birth to and abandoned!

679
01:04:14,047 --> 01:04:17,294
Yoo Ji-na gave birth to me when she
doesn't even know who the father

680
01:04:18,084 --> 01:04:20,656
is and left me in the orphanage
when I was six years old!

681
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:27,516
I lost my vision due to an accident.
She abandoned

682
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,797
me, a blind, six-year-old,
in the orphanage,

683
01:04:30,977 --> 01:04:34,554
and went down the road of a
glamorous singer all by herself!

684
01:04:39,102 --> 01:04:40,624
Let me tell you one more time!

685
01:04:41,312 --> 01:04:48,234
I'm Lee Kyung-soo, the son top singer Yoo
Ji-na had given birth to and abandoned!

686
01:05:35,909 --> 01:05:38,124
("You Are Too Much")

687
01:05:38,445 --> 01:05:42,468
I don't know him! I don't have a son!
Drag him out at once!

688
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:43,960
He is her son.

689
01:05:44,117 --> 01:05:47,078
Isn't this the piano teacher?
Did you know about this?

690
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:49,337
Her son is going to move into the house.

691
01:05:49,361 --> 01:05:53,594
This is family where you'll be used
if you don't use anyone yourself.

692
01:05:53,618 --> 01:05:55,710
You need to make a wise decision.

693
01:05:55,734 --> 01:05:58,829
How dare you sit here to
try to become my brother?

694
01:05:58,853 --> 01:06:01,257
Don't you ever treat my son rudely again.

695
01:06:01,281 --> 01:06:02,702
Oh, I'm scared.

696
01:06:02,726 --> 01:06:04,993
I'm going to go on with
my marriage as planned.

697
01:06:05,017 --> 01:06:06,515
No! No! I said no!

698
01:06:06,945 --> 01:06:08,742
She's the woman I'm going to marry.
