<i>[Episode 10]</i>

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,360
What are you doing?
You didn't even knock.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,700
You were with Mother
when she fell off the cliff.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,670
Is that really true?

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,180
Yes. I was with her.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,000
Excuse me, Chairman Park!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,120
What are you imagining right now?

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,920
- How could you do that?
- How could I do what?

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,550
In the note, it is clearly written
that she committed suicide.

11
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,820
It was your mother's handwriting.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,670
You think the police are more foolish
than you and concluded it was a suicide?

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,770
- The police?
- Get out. I have to work.

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,430
Does that make sense to you?

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,370
Who would commit suicide
when they weren't alone?

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,240
How does that make sense to you?

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,990
How dare you? As my son...

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,110
It is true that I didn't love your mother

19
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,650
but we raised children together.

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,310
What are you imagining inside your head?

21
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,660
You are capable of doing anything
if you really want to.

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,140
- What?
- Chairman Park.

23
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,100
From this moment on,
you are no longer my father.

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,970
Did you ever think of me as your father?

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,930
You!

26
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,590
Are not my father anymore!

27
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,510
You think I'm scared?

28
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,520
- I will never forgive you.
- Get out.

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,780
I'm going to make it impossible for
you to show your face in public.

30
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,310
Get out!

31
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,150
I'm going to make sure
that I see you suffer.

32
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,830
No way...

33
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,630
No way.

34
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,420
<i>What is it?</i>

35
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,460
<i>It's a letter.</i>

36
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,900
What does it say? Please read it to me.

37
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,220
<i>I'm blind.</i>

38
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,150
So I can't read anything
unless it's in Braille.

39
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,770
Then please send it by mail.

40
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,760
She said I had to hand it
to you in person.

41
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,560
When I get back from Korea,
I will call you again at this number.

42
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,390
Goodbye.

43
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,840
<i>I'm sorry for calling so late.</i>

44
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,620
<i>I am Choi Kyung Ae's son, Park Hyun Joon.</i>

45
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,530
You said you had
a letter for me from my mother.

46
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,340
Let's meet tomorrow.
Where should I meet you?

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,950
I lost the letter.

48
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,750
<i>You lost it?</i>

49
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,330
How could you lose someone else's letter?

50
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,300
You said that you didn't even know what
it said because you couldn't read it.

51
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,440
Yes. I don't know what the letter said.

52
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,970
I lost it while I was moving.

53
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,790
You called way too late. I'm sorry.

54
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,610
<i>[To: My Son]</i>

55
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,550
I think Chairman Park
is going to marry her.

56
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,870
I heard they're already living together.

57
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,020
Already?

58
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,720
Did you know Father
was there when Mother died?

59
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,140
Yeah.

60
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,770
How could you not do
anything about it then?

61
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,760
What should I have done?

62
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,480
Are you not Mother's son?

63
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,080
I've also thought about all the things
you are imagining right now.

64
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,460
And? So?

65
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,340
I didn't want to know the truth

66
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,670
- and I didn't see the need to find out.
- Are you serious?

67
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,910
It's not like knowing the truth
would bring Mom back.

68
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,320
What would people think of our family?

69
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,400
And what would happen to the company?

70
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,460
You're a scary bastard.

71
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,010
How could you think
about that in this situation?

72
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,190
If you're our mom's son...
If you're human...

73
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,790
How could I have survived without being
scary? Especially under Father's roof.

74
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,730
Is survival the only
thing that's important?

75
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,760
If I can't survive, then what
good does it do for me?

76
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,720
Mom would feel like she
died for a lost cause!

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,110
Don't use our dead mother as an excuse.

78
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,380
Just say that you're after the company!

79
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,900
Think whatever you want.

80
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,810
Even when Mom was alive, you were
always kissing up to Father.

81
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,080
You did whatever he asked you to,
hoping he would notice you.

82
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,470
You were faithful to Father like a sheep
wanting love from his shepherd.

83
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,180
You never complained
about anything in front of Father.

84
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,240
I would lose anyway!

85
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,380
What's the point of screaming?

86
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,700
What?

87
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,940
You do it your way.
I'm going to do it my way.

88
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,710
Way? What way?

89
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,890
If you think about it in that way,
does it help you sleep better at night?

90
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,170
You turned the other way from Mother
because of your greed for the company.

91
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,810
Do you feel less ashamed
when you think about it that way?

92
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,690
- Think whatever you want.
- Hey, Park Hyun Sung!

93
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,730
Lower your voice.

94
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,440
People are going to hear you.

95
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,100
Eat a lot.

96
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,290
Why are you eating like that?
Like an old person.

97
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,420
My teeth hurt.

98
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,120
I can't chew.

99
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,650
Go to the dentist.

100
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,300
I hate the dentist the most!

101
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,360
My gum gets sore when I'm tired.

102
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,810
That's because you brush
your teeth incorrectly.

103
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,920
It costs a lot to go once and a lot of
things are not covered by insurance.

104
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,560
Who brushes their teeth
up and down so carelessly?

105
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,700
Who brushes their teeth carelessly?

106
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,340
You want me to brush my
teeth all day long like you?

107
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,830
Do I look like someone who
has time to do that all day?

108
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,650
Okay, okay.

109
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,700
Brush your teeth diligently.

110
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,480
Money is one thing, but you'll
suffer when you get older.

111
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,020
Go to the dentist today!

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,610
I liked him!

113
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,430
It's not like that.

114
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,960
Who is he exactly?

115
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,400
He first introduced himself as a friend

116
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,630
but then later he said
that he was not a friend.

117
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,800
He's the president of
an entertainment business.

118
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,130
What? He's the conman?

119
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,660
- Not a conman.
- I knew it!

120
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,580
He is not that kind of guy!

121
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,340
Why didn't you sign a contract with him?

122
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,710
All you need to know
is that it's complicated.

123
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,510
Now eat your breakfast.

124
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,990
How disappointing. It would be
great if they dated each other!

125
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:15,550
You never know what's going to happen,
especially for these young people!

126
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,840
Don't you think they're a little
too old to be called young people?

127
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,760
Anyway! We don't have that kind
of relationship, so calm down.

128
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,470
He seemed like he was interested in you.

129
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,100
It's not like that!

130
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,800
Okay, okay!

131
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,050
What are you thinking about?

132
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,330
I'm thinking about taking a piano lesson.

133
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,850
That sounds good.
I'll try to find a tutor.

134
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,030
No. I already found one.

135
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,770
Oh really? Do you want
to eat lunch outside?

136
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,490
I don't have a schedule.
I want to just stay home and rest.

137
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,500
Why don't you come out instead?
I'll buy you something delicious.

138
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,930
- I'm tired.
- Okay.

139
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,120
I'll see you later tonight.

140
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,710
Do you want to eat lunch
with me outside instead?

141
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,090
Are you talking to me?

142
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,140
We can go for a drive...

143
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,270
and eat in the suburbs.

144
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,540
Okay. I'll get ready and wait here.

145
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,140
I'll see you later.

146
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,400
Don't go.

147
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,400
- Why not?
- You're going to go out with him?

148
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,080
I'm a celebrity.

149
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,500
What's wrong with eating with
the president of the company

150
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,560
that I want to sign with?

151
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,430
He's using you to get back at me.

152
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,760
Really?

153
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,470
I'm still going to go.

154
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,910
Because I want to
work with Park Hyun Joon.

155
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,550
Did you forget something?

156
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,130
What are you trying to do?

157
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,110
- She fell for it with one try.
- Why you...

158
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,490
For you to not win over
a woman like that...

159
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,600
you must be losing your touch.

160
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,150
I asked you what you are trying to do.

161
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,790
I'll think about it
once I take her out.

162
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,650
Stop your foolishness.

163
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,600
This is more fun than I expected.

164
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,650
- What did you say?
- It's fun to completely ignore someone

165
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:34,820
who is as desperate as a baby.

166
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,240
Is this why you decided to ignore
your wife and children?

167
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,610
Because you were having so much fun
doing whatever you wanted with your life?

168
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,490
I am very disappointed in you.

169
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,840
She married a mere company
worker despite her family's wishes

170
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,370
but you could never spend
a day without another woman.

171
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,500
I mean, you didn't want to.

172
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,950
And who made you a wealthy son-in-law?

173
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,870
Why are you bragging
about it so arrogantly?

174
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,640
Because I grew up watching Mom in tears.

175
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,080
What do you think a mother's tears
mean to a child, Chairman Park?

176
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,090
You have plenty of love for your parents,
so you must know what that feels like

177
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,960
since you grew up
watching your mother cry too.

178
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,750
Isn't that why you pretended
you didn't see anything

179
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,760
even when Grandmother tormented Mother?

180
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,460
No matter how reckless someone gets

181
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,350
there is a line that should
never be crossed.

182
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:40,540
You can find that bullshit line
at the cliff where Mom died!

183
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,440
I'm making hand-torn
noodle soup for lunch.

184
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,100
I'm going out to eat.

185
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,730
I'm making this just for you
because you said you wanted it.

186
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,590
Do you have a phone number
for the pianist, Yoon Sung Ha?

187
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,800
- Yes.
- Can you ask if he gives lessons?

188
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,160
You want to take lessons?

189
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,330
He's blind. You think
he will give you lessons?

190
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,110
I'm only learning a couple simple songs.

191
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,010
I'm sure he memorized
the basic music sheets.

192
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,050
I'll ask.

193
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,760
Please.

194
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,890
You're leaving now?

195
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,930
You're right on time.

196
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,400
You two are leaving together?

197
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,990
Who's the one who asked for a drive?
Why aren't you going to say anything?

198
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,390
I guess you're right...
You don't drive with your mouth.

199
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,680
You asked to eat together.
We really are just eating together.

200
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,590
Even I think I'm strange enough
that I should be a subject to study.

201
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:00,640
Even after everything you said to me,
I'm sitting here eating with you.

202
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,490
Don't you think it's amazing that we
are sitting together and eating lunch?

203
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,360
Say something.

204
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,790
How would you like me
to report back to Chairman Park?

205
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,610
Should I just say that we didn't
say anything and just ate?

206
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,160
Or...

207
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,960
Should I say that I had
the most unforgettable time?

208
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,390
Didn't you bring me out
to infuriate Chairman Park?

209
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,950
Should I infuriate him so much
that he sobs uncontrollably?

210
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,140
I'll do whatever you want. Just tell me.

211
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,930
Please open your mouth and say something.

212
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:05,430
Shut your mouth and eat. I don't like it
when people talk during a meal.

213
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,110
You asked me out
to infuriate your father.

214
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,310
Right in front of him.

215
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,010
If you're done eating, then let's go.

216
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,040
- I'm still eating.
- I'll wait in the car.

217
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,430
I like Park Hyun Joon because
I don't feel burdened by him.

218
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,240
You have no expectations from me.

219
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,040
I really like that.

220
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't need to try and impress a man

221
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,310
who tramples all over me after he
already knows everything about me.

222
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,020
You are...

223
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,420
a lot quieter than I expected.

224
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,900
Get out.

225
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,910
Do you know how many words
you said while we were out?

226
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,740
I talked the whole time.

227
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,350
Get out.

228
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,890
After spending the day together,
I understand what kind of man you are.

229
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,480
You carry a lot of weight
on your shoulders and you are deep.

230
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,920
Are you determined to see me as a man?

231
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,900
Does that offend you?

232
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,770
After spending half a day with you

233
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,150
I see that you are not completely
bland for men's taste.

234
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,840
But look for someone else
and get out of my car.

235
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,370
Where are you going
to go after I get out?

236
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,300
To meet up with Jung Hae Dang?

237
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,610
Were you thinking about
her this whole time?

238
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,520
You were thinking of another woman

239
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,330
when I was sitting right here?

240
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,020
How fun.

241
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,250
<i>[Yoo Jui Na]</i>

242
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,760
Hello?

243
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,340
How do you feel?

244
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,400
I called because I was curious.

245
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,660
Why does your voice sound so weak?

246
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,260
What do you mean? I just...

247
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:50,960
Okay. I just wanted to check
to see if you were okay. Bye.

248
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,360
You called me just to ask me that?

249
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,220
I'm actually in front of your house.

250
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,950
Why did you come out?
You don't feel well.

251
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:26,360
I just... Your voice sounded
so different than usual.

252
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,470
I wanted to see if you were okay.

253
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,780
Did something happen?

254
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,450
Have you ever felt like this?

255
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:42,560
You have to break a rock, but all
you have is an egg in your hand.

256
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,580
You're using your body
to break a rock that won't budge.

257
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,750
Do you know that feeling?

258
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,900
I had to spend half the day with someone

259
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,180
I don't even want
to make eye contact with.

260
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,160
For business?

261
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,230
If it were for business, I would
never put myself in that situation.

262
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,020
Are you... crying?

263
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,230
You have tears in your eyes.

264
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,840
It's because of the wind.

265
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:31,000
I do feel better after seeing your face.

266
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,910
Then look at it all you want.
I can help with that.

267
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,110
Remember, we're officially approved
for just "looking at each other."

268
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,160
Is that all we are going to end up doing?

269
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,220
Who's going to be disappointed?

270
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,660
I'm good now, so go inside,
or you might catch another cold.

271
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,660
Thanks for letting me see your face.

272
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,140
Don't you think that's kind of
embarrassing to say between us?

273
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,750
It's nothing compared to the bizarre
things you say on stage.

274
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,580
That's cheap of you
to use my job against me!

275
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:19,320
Why did you dress so inappropriately
for someone who's sick?

276
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,470
I'm... okay.

277
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,440
Cold air gets into your
body through the neck.

278
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,910
You'll feel better just by
keeping your neck warm.

279
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,130
I smell cologne on your scarf.

280
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,570
Do you use cologne?

281
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:09,560
<i>From now on, I will watch over you.</i>

282
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,490
And pray for you.

283
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:17,490
Please let me watch you
live a good life from a distance.

284
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:37,590
I thought you were going
for a walk. You came back fast.

285
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,930
Is Hae Dang feeling better?

286
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,090
Yeah. A lot better.

287
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,100
That's good to hear.

288
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,360
I'll tell her to stop by next time.

289
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,880
How can she not stop by once?
No sense of loyalty...

290
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,210
What did the dentist say?

291
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,580
The tooth I got done last time
rotted from the inside.

292
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,710
- So what did they say?
- Redo it I guess.

293
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,090
How much is it going to cost?

294
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,000
- One million won.
- What?

295
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,170
It's not just a simple cavity.

296
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,310
What are we going to do?

297
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,430
I'll get the root canal right away

298
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,070
and just endure the pain
whenever it flares up again.

299
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,020
You can't even chew your food properly!

300
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:12,410
How can I ask for money right now?

301
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,740
My goodness.

302
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,940
Blow. Is it hot?

303
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,380
She went to the dentist.

304
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,450
- It's going to cost one million won.
- One million won!

305
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,260
It's fine! It's fine!

306
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,980
I can still chew.

307
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,920
What should we do?

308
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,790
Your teeth could get better
if you endure it for a while.

309
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,230
Eat, eat. Eat your food.

310
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,210
Why would you bring up my teeth?

311
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,100
I said I would just deal with it.

312
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,570
It's so embarrassing that I have to ask
my younger brother's wife for money

313
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,910
because I don't have money on my own!

314
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,790
It was more than what I expected.

315
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,750
He was very different than
when he is with his family.

316
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,030
I bet he's made a lot of women cry.

317
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,070
How was he different?

318
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,910
He has a cool masculine side to him.

319
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:08,090
He is heavy-hearted and thinks deeply.

320
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,270
Women fall head over heels
for that kind of man.

321
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,880
Only women who lack prudence would
fall for that. What does he have?

322
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,920
He has no power or money.

323
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,960
You know, there are a lot
of women who lack prudence.

324
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,290
Did you just come back home after lunch?

325
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,140
Are you curious?

326
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,770
Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

327
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,860
Just give up what you're doing
and throw in the towel.

328
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,100
What?

329
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,340
What kind of parents try to win
against their children?

330
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,640
It's too late to throw in the towel now.

331
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,450
He and I...

332
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,280
can't be in the same boat
for many reasons.

333
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,690
Then, I'm going to ride in his boat.

334
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,060
He won't let you.

335
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,620
He's going to use you against me

336
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,180
and then he's going to throw
you away like a used napkin.

337
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,090
Do you understand?

338
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,870
How are you so confident?

339
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,980
Because he is the spitting image
of me from head to toe.

340
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,700
No one knows him better than I do.

341
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:38,980
That means he will fall for me,
just like someone else I know.

342
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,940
If the situation were different, perhaps.

343
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,920
But unfortunately

344
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,480
he will only use you and throw you away.

345
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,140
Then, I should get to work
before he throws me away.

346
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,430
You've completely lost your mind
after spending half the day with him.

347
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,230
But, popular singer, Yoo Ji Na

348
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:21,140
don't count your
chickens before they hatch.

349
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,180
What?

350
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,930
It might seem like he and I
both live a reckless life

351
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,660
but there are some things
we don't dare touch.

352
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,870
There is a line that
should never be crossed

353
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,240
even for those who live reckless lives.

354
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,470
A line that shouldn't be crossed...

355
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:47,310
My life is a tragedy because
I don't have such a thing.

356
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,870
I'm someone who throws away things
that shouldn't be thrown away.

357
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,500
In the most crucial moment

358
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,000
even the things that must
not be thrown away, I will...

359
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,020
throw them away.

360
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,410
Because I'm crazy to the core.

361
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,610
What do you think, Chairman Park?

362
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,230
What do you want?

363
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,970
- Return it to it's rightful owner.
- Return what?

364
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,240
What you're after right now.

365
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,650
That is outside your power.

366
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,050
It was never yours to begin with.

367
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,310
It belonged to your late wife.

368
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,100
So...

369
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,760
think of this as returning it
back to it's rightful owner

370
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,630
and give everything to Hyun Joon.

371
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,690
You care for him that much?

372
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,800
You said you love me.

373
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,980
You said you wanted to give me the world.

374
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,660
You also can't let go
of the things you want.

375
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,510
Right?

376
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,690
That's why I hate you.

377
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,990
Because you and I are too alike.

378
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,020
I feel like I'm suffocating
just from looking at you.

379
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,120
It feels like I'm looking at myself.

380
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,430
You think Park Hyun Joon is like you?

381
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,770
No way.

382
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,520
What do you like about him?

383
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,610
I can tell by just one glance.

384
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,850
I don't need time to figure it out.

385
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,670
Is this a warning? Are you
going to go all in with him

386
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,760
just like last time
with that man who died?

387
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,260
If that opportunity comes to me.

388
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:17,000
The main character died, but
I still have 10 more pages to write.

389
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,600
- Bring him back.
- How? He died.

390
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,000
Put a period and bring him back to life.

391
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,640
Do you want to die?

392
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,400
You can't eat everything!
Eat after I finish packing Dad's lunch.

393
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,690
I'm just eating the ends.

394
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,830
I don't know why, but the ends
always taste the best.

395
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,480
Give me one.

396
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,660
You're making kimbap?

397
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,370
- Yeah. It's Dad's lunch.
- You're going out?

398
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,050
I've been lying in bed all day.
I'm going for a walk.

399
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,490
While you're out, go visit the cafe.

400
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,590
My boss was curious about you.

401
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,500
- See you.
- Okay.

402
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,330
You scared me.

403
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,150
Did you come here to see me?

404
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:54,530
I thought you were going to watch me
from a distance. Is this what you meant?

405
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,370
No... I just stopped by while
I was getting some fresh air.

406
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,220
I'm glad you came.

407
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,800
You were sick for so long.

408
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,770
I'm going to leave after I finish this.

409
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,150
I really wanted some coffee.

410
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,600
Take your time since you're already here.

411
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,870
I don't care what happens to me.

412
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,420
As long as you are happy.

413
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,560
I was the one who left you
without saying anything.

414
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,260
What are you talking about?

415
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,230
You don't have to feel sorry.

416
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:54,810
If you ever want coffee,
you are always welcome here.

417
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,050
Dinner!

418
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,440
Ji Hoon, let's go!

419
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,340
Hungry!

420
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,030
Let's eat!

421
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,550
What the... What is this?

422
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,420
- Go ahead and eat.
- I mean...

423
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,070
I would eat if there was
something to eat on the table.

424
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,660
What's wrong with dinner today?
Not even a piece of fish.

425
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,550
It's a healthy dinner.

426
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,510
Your stomach's been sticking out lately.

427
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,430
It upsets me that you want me to eat this

428
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,760
after I worked so hard,
to the point of breaking my back.

429
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,630
Just eat what we give you!
Are you a child?

430
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,890
Stop complaining.

431
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,780
You didn't go grocery shopping today?

432
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,520
My back was hurting
today all of a sudden.

433
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,320
Then, what about you, Bong Seon?

434
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,230
You didn't go yesterday either, right?

435
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,730
Okay. I will make sure to go grocery
shopping no matter what tomorrow

436
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,000
so let's just eat what we have today.

437
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,570
I would eat if there was
something to eat.

438
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,270
It's all vegetables. I'm not a goat...

439
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,110
What money do we have
to go grocery shopping?

440
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:18,050
See? This is why I told you that I was
going to take care of my teeth later.

441
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,070
Ah well...

442
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:24,630
Pay day is still so far away,
but all we have left is 20,000 won...

443
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,920
She's going to throw a fit that we
spent our entire allowance all at once.

444
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,980
What are you doing?

445
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:48,340
I made citrus tea to drink at work.

446
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,770
See you later then.

447
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,290
Why do you look so depressed?

448
00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:00,110
How could I explain every detail
of my daily grievances?

449
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:05,260
Then... I will listen to your story...
after I get back from work.

450
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,500
Just sit down for five minutes.

451
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,360
I bet it's another one
of your ridiculous stories.

452
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,980
Last time, you said my perfectly good
daughter was cheating on her husband.

453
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,890
Who knows? Maybe she
did for a little while.

454
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,630
For a little while?

455
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,680
What are you talking about?
She said he's a colleague.

456
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,480
You can't cheat with a colleague?

457
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,790
Women love younger men these days.

458
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,670
If you falsely accuse her again...

459
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:34,560
I'm still suspicious of her, you know.

460
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,300
Suspicious, my ass.

461
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,360
I'm late!

462
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,180
Let's have some soda.

463
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,990
What the? Where did you get that?

464
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,480
It fell straight from heaven.

465
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,170
What?

466
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:54,670
This looks so good!
Spicy red pepper pork stir-fry!

467
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,620
But why did you make so little?
You should've made more.

468
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:03,030
It's not good to eat too much meat.

469
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:07,120
- Go ahead, Mother.
- I'm okay. You guys should eat a lot!

470
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,360
Okay! Let's eat!

471
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,910
- Is it good?
- Yes. It's really good.

472
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,970
Make more next time. A lot more!

473
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,750
More?

474
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,890
- Okay. I'll make you more.
- So good.

475
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,730
Did someone take half of this?

476
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,400
Did you eat half of this?

477
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,670
- No.
- Then who ate it?

478
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,460
We never ate it,
but half of it is missing.

479
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,270
Wake up! What kind of nonsense is that?

480
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,780
Did Dad eat it?

481
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,800
Hae Soo

482
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,630
- we're running out of shampoo.
- Shampoo?

483
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,140
- I bought some recently.
- What do you mean?

484
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,220
Check it out yourself.

485
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,910
The roll is finished already?

486
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,820
There's another one on the shelf.

487
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,320
- Where?
- I saw it this morning.

488
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,010
- Where?
- It's not there?

489
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,640
It's really not here!

490
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,800
Why do things keep disappearing?

491
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,070
Wake up! How are you already
forgetting things at your age?

492
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,030
What the heck is going on?

493
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,970
Where did it go?

494
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,310
What? When did I cook it?

495
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:53,500
- You didn't eat it?
- What are you talking about?

496
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,750
Hey, if I ate it, I would
tell you I ate it!

497
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,220
Then, if no one ate
the meat, where did it go?

498
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,800
Think carefully. Sometimes,
you think that you left it in the fridge

499
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,400
but turns out you ate it a while ago.

500
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,140
It's not one or two things
that are missing though.

501
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,140
I've never given
a lesson to someone before.

502
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,190
I'm sorry.

503
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,960
<i>If I happen to suddenly leave this world</i>

504
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,690
<i>I have a hunch other family members will
split my belongings for their own good.</i>

505
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:45,180
<i>Hyun Joon, the item
that I want you to have</i>

506
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:51,320
<i>is buried underneath the tree
that only you and I know about.</i>

507
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,360
I hope my handicap will
not be a hindrance.

508
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,800
Don't worry. I only want to learn
a few songs as a hobby.

509
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,830
I will do my best.

510
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:18,690
Actually, I'm doing this because
I want to get to know you.

511
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,450
I want to be of some help to you.

512
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,320
Thank you.

513
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:33,550
Your smile is so warm.

514
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,370
Really?

515
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,760
This is weird.

516
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,510
What is?

517
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:45,110
I just...

518
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:51,810
When I look at your eyes...
I just want to burst into tears.

519
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:55,020
Really?

520
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,850
I usually don't get emotional either.

521
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:02,000
Maybe it's because I'm old.

522
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,980
It's probably because you
know that I can't see you.

523
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,430
It makes people sad

524
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,820
when you can see someone

525
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,170
but the other person can't see you.

526
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:19,690
How do you talk so poetically?

527
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,960
Is it because you play the piano?

528
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,550
When others look at me and become sad,
or when I think they sympathize with me

529
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,120
I also become very sad.

530
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,920
Anyway, my goal for the lessons is
not to learn how to play the piano

531
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,580
so please don't feel pressured.
You can come whenever you're free.

532
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,450
Okay.

533
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,400
Why are my hands shaking
so much? For what?

534
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,260
I just have to survive until
the next paycheck, no matter what.

535
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,240
What did I just see?

536
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,400
No way.

537
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,050
What are you doing?

538
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,090
Oh my gosh...

539
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:24,960
- You scared me!
- Why are you hugging those containers?

540
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,230
This is all your fault!

541
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,300
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

542
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,860
What?

543
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,500
No.

544
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,760
What's going on?

545
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,920
Hey, so you know...

546
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,250
Never mind.

547
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:58,420
Have you finally lost your mind
from trying to find a job?

548
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,950
First you say you lost red pepper and
soy bean paste... Get yourself together!

549
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,460
You have something to tell me?

550
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,850
So...

551
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,750
So...

552
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,360
Hae Soo.

553
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,660
Nothing. There is nothing
to tell you. Nothing.

554
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,810
- What?
- Nothing.

555
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,140
What's going on with you?

556
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,500
Is everything okay? Hae Sung
is worried about you too.

557
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,710
Nope. Nothing's going on.

558
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,980
Did Mrs. Baek and Bong Seon go somewhere?

559
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,690
Out in the yard.

560
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:04,750
Hey, so... Mrs. Baek keeps
your family allowance, right?

561
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:08,190
- Yeah. Why?
- So...

562
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,350
So... What I'm trying to say is...

563
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,300
What?

564
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,690
Nothing! Just drink your coffee.

565
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:19,840
Don't drink too much at once.

566
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,540
Go ahead.

567
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,460
Mrs. Baek!

568
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,350
What are you doing here?

569
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,570
Have this for dinner.

570
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,740
Chicken?

571
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,480
I meant to buy only one,
but I forgot and ended up buying two.

572
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,600
That's great! I was wondering
what I should make for dinner.

573
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,670
Enjoy!

574
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,460
Of course we'll enjoy it!

575
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,840
Pig out!

576
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,190
Braised spicy chicken!

577
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,440
Today, eat as much as you want.

578
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,100
You make it sound like
we haven't been eating well.

579
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,710
- Eat!
- Let's eat.

580
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,460
Let's eat!

581
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,470
- Mrs. Baek!
- Hey.

582
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,300
- Please use these.
- What is all this?

583
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,090
I should've only bought one of each,
but I forgot and bought two of each.

584
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,830
That's great! We were just
running out of a bunch of stuff!

585
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:22,790
What else do you think
you might run out of soon?

586
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:25,180
- What?
- Nothing! Nothing!

587
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,170
I'll be going now.

588
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,140
Wait a minute...

589
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,600
She forgot and bought two of each?

590
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:44,150
I swear we were running out of this.

591
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:46,890
Who refilled the soy sauce?

592
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:54,320
Nothing is running out.

593
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,600
What's going on...

594
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,380
My life!

595
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,430
This is the worst humiliation!

596
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,990
You're coming here often.

597
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:15,720
I keep having a reason to come visit.

598
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,490
What other shocking news
are you here to tell me?

599
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:20,520
What?

600
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,890
Why didn't you listen to a word I said?

601
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:26,080
- Listen to what?
- Hyun Joon

602
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,710
had lunch with Yoo Ji Na.

603
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:34,190
- What?
- They got in the same car in front of me

604
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,230
and left together.

605
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:43,310
There is a reason why
your marriage is on hold.

606
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:47,600
That's why you need at least
one person who's on your side.

607
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,300
Right?

608
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:55,140
If it weren't for me,
you would've looked like a fool!

609
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,190
Don't you agree, Yoon Hee?

610
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:00,310
I mean... Sister-in-law.

611
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:07,320
I told you Yoo Ji Na would only
bring trouble if she stayed at the house.

612
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,860
Welcome.

613
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,750
Come outside.

614
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,920
After I'm done.

615
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:51,230
I said come outside.

616
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:10,740
The "not yet" girl was Yoo Ji Na?

617
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:20,090
- It's not what you think.
- Then what is it?

618
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:23,470
Then what is it?

619
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:27,500
You looked at her like she was an insect,
but now you've fallen for her?

620
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,270
I said it's not what you think.

621
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:32,300
Are you crazy?

622
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,320
Of all the women on this planet...
Are you out of your mind?

623
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,420
Why don't you believe me?

624
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,530
How many times do I have to tell
you that it's not what you think?

625
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,340
If it's not like that, then let's
have the wedding next month.

626
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,200
- What?
- I don't care about my family.

627
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,470
I'll tell Father about it and then we can
have the wedding with just your family.

628
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,250
I don't want to.

629
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,360
I don't want us to get
married like this.

630
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,430
- Hello.
- Do you think I want to say hello?

631
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:22,570
- What's wrong?
- Stop acting naive.

632
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:25,760
I don't even want to say it out
loud because it's so embarrassing.

633
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,270
- What are you...
- I know

634
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:31,670
your pride was hurt in front
of me because of Grandmother.

635
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:35,190
But do you really have to handle
your anger in such a crude way?

636
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:39,610
I'm not interested enough in you
to bother holding a grudge against you.

637
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,260
You'd better stop what you're
doing while I'm still asking nicely.

638
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:49,020
All the women in this house
are so scary...

639
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,080
They're all talk.

640
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,010
How could a tawdry woman like you
dare to try and be a part of our family?

641
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,900
Is this your family?

642
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:03,140
You have to get married first before
you can call this your family.

643
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:07,970
What? Did Hyun Joon, who's
younger and so similar to his father

644
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:10,110
seem like a better catch to you?

645
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,740
I thought you were going
to be my mother-in-law

646
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,470
but turns out you might be my rival.

647
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,400
You are vulgar.

648
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,270
Vulgar?

649
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,720
I guess I understand
where you're coming from.

650
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,780
Your pride must have been damaged.

651
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,290
A noble lady from a prestigious
university like yourself

652
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:32,990
probably never had to bow down to anyone.

653
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:34,900
But what do you know?

654
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:40,800
I think Park Hyun Joon
is sick of you already.

655
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,920
All you have left to give
him is your household name.

656
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,180
How dare you?

657
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,390
You should know your place.

658
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,560
What?

659
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,970
They met outside the house?

660
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:11,350
How absurd!

661
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:13,720
My goodness!

662
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,390
Oh my head...

663
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,930
<i>I didn't think it would be true...</i>

664
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,970
<i>I didn't think...</i>

665
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:26,010
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

666
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:28,770
This is not your fault.

667
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:32,740
The people who brought that piece
of trash into our house are at fault.

668
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,790
I'm so upset that I can't stand it.

669
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:40,030
Don't you worry. I will take
care of everything.

670
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,650
- Was it you?
- What do you mean?

671
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:51,330
The person who told that
weird story to Hong Yoon Hee.

672
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:53,510
What do you mean weird?

673
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,570
I only told her what I saw.

674
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:58,890
What is your reason for telling
unnecessary things to others?

675
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:03,910
You sound like a mother-in-law
rebuking her daughter-in-law.

676
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:07,250
I won't hold back next time
if you do something like this again.

677
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,750
Who do you think you are
to say something like that?

678
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,460
Who do you think you are
to turn our house upside down?

679
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:20,230
You'll need to learn
what it feels like to hit rock bottom

680
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:24,530
before you learn your lesson, don't you?

681
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:28,600
Please explain exactly what I did wrong.

682
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,720
What?

683
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,440
I didn't do anything
for you to rebuke me like this.

684
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,080
There is no reason for an old lady
like yourself to get so worked up.

685
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,060
Where did this
third-class trash come from?

686
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,050
And how dare you come into my house?

687
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:44,410
What? You didn't do anything
for me to rebuke you?

688
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:49,960
In my opinion, I think this
house you're living in is trash.

689
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,610
Are you done talking?

690
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,500
People are talking about
you behind your back.

691
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,900
That you're an old lady who
preys on your daughters-in-law.

692
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:07,110
What are you going to do
if you glare at me like that?

693
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:10,130
You want to hit me too?

694
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:13,640
They are not men you can mess with!

695
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:18,350
How dare you talk back?

696
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:34,850
Even after everything that happened,
you still want to keep that thing here?

697
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:38,440
They only met up together
to talk about the contract.

698
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,590
They couldn't find a place here
to talk about the contract?

699
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,960
They had to go somewhere
else in the same car?

700
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,870
Do you really not understand
what is happening?

701
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:56,220
Are you not embarrassed?

702
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,560
What will people think of our family?

703
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:06,660
I know you're my son,
but I am so disappointed in you.

704
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:10,340
Because of that one wench...

705
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,670
You're going to step down
from the company?

706
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:16,800
How can you step down so easily
when you worked so hard to get up there?

707
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:34,140
Don't ever ask her out again.

708
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,110
Who?

709
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:39,670
I'm not joking, so don't
be sarcastic with me.

710
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:44,540
You know what? I was actually planning
on taking her out again tomorrow.

711
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,470
Taking her out?

712
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:49,760
She was so happy she
didn't know what to do.

713
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,480
She was ready to offer everything to me,
and wagged her tail like a puppy.

714
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:59,800
Okay, okay. I won't ask her out.

715
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:04,130
But what should I do if she asks me?

716
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:06,110
Then it's okay if I go
out with her, right?

717
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:12,070
Get out. Get out of my life.

718
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,900
I never want to see you again.

719
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:19,180
You are no longer my son.

720
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,990
Did you ever think of me as your son?

721
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:27,250
Don't ever create
this kind of trouble again.

722
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:29,370
This is a warning.

723
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:31,400
We'll see...

724
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,050
If she calls me again or not.

Oh my gosh!

727
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,210
Yoo Ji Na's getting married?

728
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:03,280
Mom! Mom! Mom! I think
Yoo Ji Na is getting married!

729
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,500
- To a wealthy man!
- A wealthy man?

730
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,770
Oh my goodness!

731
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:12,910
How fortunate is she?

732
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:17,250
I'm so jealous...

733
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,800
She was a top star this whole time,
and now she's going to be

734
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,970
the wife of a wealthy husband.

735
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,560
There are women
who live life that way...

736
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:30,020
and here I am... Stealing from
our in-law's kitchen.

737
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,740
Wait, what?

738
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,480
Wh... What?

739
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,120
Nothing. What would I ever steal?

740
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,310
Wait! Hae Dang is home, right?

741
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,890
Hey! Hey! You know... Yoo Ji Na!
I think she's getting married.

742
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:51,830
- Married?
- Yeah.

743
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:56,370
To a wealthy man... GR Group!
You know that company, right?

744
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:59,550
- GR Group?
- Yeah!

745
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,260
It's Yoo Ji Na!

It was you, wasn't it?

748
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,030
- Have a seat.
- What were you thinking?

749
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:27,610
Are you trying to kill my career?

750
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:30,320
People saw us together at the party.

751
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,040
Do you think I only attend your parties?

752
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,390
You released this article just
because I went to your party?

753
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:39,150
This can only benefit you.
It will not harm you.

754
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:44,470
You think you can have me as your woman
just because you released an article?

755
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:49,310
At the very least, you won't be my son's.

756
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:51,470
What did you say?

757
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:54,820
If I don't want people to call
me crazy, I should listen to you?

758
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:57,100
Is that what you're saying?

759
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,940
I have a duty to protect you.

760
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,290
Says who?

761
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,870
Says me.
