<i>[Episode 22]</i>

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,290
Hi! My son!

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,760
Hi, sir! Are you going to work?

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,350
You should get a glass of juice.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,810
You should sell more to the customers.
How is business going?

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,940
It's doing okay. I can afford to eat.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,020
It should do better than that.
You are not alone anymore.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,120
I'll work harder.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,360
Okay.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,600
Do you cook at all at home?

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,390
I order food more often.

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,370
Then save your money.
Come and have dinner with us.

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,350
No. It's okay. It's a hassle for you.

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,530
It's not a hassle. We are family.

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,250
We are... family?

17
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,600
You should come visit more often so you
can get close to our family.

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,640
And then have a wedding
maybe in the fall.

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,150
This fall?

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,610
Hae Dang is turning 34 next year.

21
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,790
She needs to have a child
before she turns 35.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,330
Okay.

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,820
See you later then.

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,910
Bye, sir!

25
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,510
Family?

26
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,160
Family...

27
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,210
I guess I get to have a family now.

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,900
Don't worry about the cafe and have fun.

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,260
I'll be there soon.

30
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,530
Take your time. I get paid hourly anyway.
This is a good chance to get paid more.

31
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,570
Thank you.

32
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,370
Oh geez. Father! Why is this Go board so
heavy? It's okay. Be careful.

33
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,570
It's because it's an old one.

34
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,170
- You should have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

35
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,040
- Oh gosh.
- Sit comfortably.

36
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,040
Do you know how to play Go?

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,130
No. I don't.

38
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,510
You don't?
Let's play Omok then.

39
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,420
Ah. I never learned Omok, either.

40
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,210
Oh geez. Who doesn't know
how to play Omok?

41
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,010
I just recently had surgery.

42
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,380
So I couldn't learn
because I couldn't see before.

43
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,970
Ah. You are right.

44
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,520
Then I'm guessing you don't know
how to play Go Stop?

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,540
Oh, wow! You really are pure.

46
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,900
Then how should we pass our time?

47
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,950
Ah! Let's play Alkkagi.
Alkkagi!

48
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,300
Alkkagi?

49
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,940
I think I can play that.

50
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,240
Really? Then let's do that.

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,940
Goodness.

52
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,180
Okay!

53
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,240
Please start, Father!

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,940
We have to bet something.
What's the fun if we don't bet anything?

55
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,380
Ah... Then how about chicken?

56
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,860
No. You don't like chicken much.
How about pigs' feet?

57
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,150
Pigs' feet it is.
Pigs' feet and a shot of soju.

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,660
How about dinner then?

59
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,180
We can eat pigs' feet with soju at night.

60
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,480
Okay! Please start. Let's go!

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,360
Oh, no.

62
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,570
Out! Out! Out! Out!

63
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,270
Why are you so happy?

64
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,020
I'm not happy.

65
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,300
We are betting pigs' feet.

66
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,210
Okay. It's your turn, Bro.

67
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,330
Oh gosh. You can just
call me Kyung Soo for now.

68
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,140
Oh gosh, Bro.

69
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,530
Hurry up and do it.

70
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,770
You can do it!

71
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,350
Yay!

72
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,750
Out! Out! Out!

73
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,110
Yes!

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,590
Bong Goo, you should look at my face
when you are taking his side.

75
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,880
I'm slightly becoming sulky.

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,060
I was not taking his side.

77
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,330
I get to eat pigs' feet
no matter which side I take.

78
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,450
Father! Cheer up!

79
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,130
You should make it clear
which side you're taking.

80
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,220
Okay.

81
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,160
You told me to be make
the side I'm taking clear.

82
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,870
- Go upstairs!
- Why?

83
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,160
What is so fun?

84
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,960
Don't talk to me and go to work.
This is very serious.

85
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,860
Can I just see her out
and then come back to play?

86
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,580
Ah. Okay. I'll play it for you.

87
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,670
Thank you.

88
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,930
- Bye.
- Bye!

89
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,870
Why did you come out?
You should've just stayed home.

90
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,150
Did you eat?

91
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,170
I already ate since
I had to leave early today.

92
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,800
See you later then.

93
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,680
I feel like I'm sending my wife to work
when I'm home doing nothing.

94
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,590
You seem like a wife
who's sending her husband to work.

95
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,510
You go to work
when everyone is resting after work.

96
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,630
It's not anything new.

97
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,930
I personally want to tell you to quit.

98
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,130
That's nonsense. You should go in.

99
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,760
Enjoy working then.

100
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,530
I feel energetic
since you're seeing me off.

101
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,170
I already feel like part of your family
because they are so nice to me.

102
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,950
That's good to hear.

103
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,350
You know what a family means to me,
don't you?

104
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,380
Please go in.

105
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,540
I want to see you go.
Go.

106
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,910
- Bye!
- Bye!

107
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,780
I guess your family likes fish.

108
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,070
Since we have Grandmother in the house

109
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,700
I tend to go with seafood
rather than meat.

110
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,980
<i>If you were really thinking
about bringing me down</i>

111
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,320
then you shouldn't
have given me time to prepare.

112
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,250
You were trying to scare me but
ended up giving me time to get prepared.

113
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,830
I'm your son. Did you think
I would just sit here and do nothing?

114
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,070
Father, you should eat.

115
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,950
Ah. I'll go bring Mother.

116
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,280
Yes.

117
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,980
Please eat, Mother.

118
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,560
Would you please eat happily?

119
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,330
I don't want to be
uncomfortable around you.

120
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,890
Na Kyung seasoned the food to taste.
So it will suit your taste.

121
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,310
Please sit.

122
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,030
How does it taste?

123
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,630
Be quiet and just eat.

124
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,240
Let's eat.

125
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,800
Mother! My hands are clean.
Can I bone fish for you?

126
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,410
Didn't I tell you to be quiet?

127
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,890
You should pretend to be quiet
if an elder tells you to be quiet.

128
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,660
I know this is all acting for Sung Hwan.

129
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,040
But how could you just ignore
what I told you like that?

130
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,470
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,630
You know that you will get
the smell of food all over yourself

132
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,790
when you go into the kitchen to cook.

133
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,950
Who puts on perfume
before going into the kitchen?

134
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,800
Did your mother wear perfume before
going into the kitchen, too?

135
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,930
You just have one thing on your mind
when you are awake.

136
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,920
What would a kid learn from
such a mother? It's pretty obvious.

137
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,840
Mother!

138
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,000
- Why?
- Why are you being like this?

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,270
Get rid of me then.

140
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,980
I know you are out of your mind because
of this girl. Just get rid of me!

141
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:21,290
Have you turned into trash after
hanging out with this trash?

142
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,870
You are acting like a proud father
in front of your kids.

143
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,860
Please stop it!

144
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,720
What?

145
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,110
When I brought your father-in-law down

146
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,740
do you think I did that
with something I had?

147
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,630
How dare you threaten your mother?
How arrogant!

148
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,580
Now that the official fight has started,
everything is being disclosed.

149
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:07,370
I thought you brought my grandfather
down on your own.

150
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,240
You took over the company
by hiding behind my mother.

151
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,170
Aren't you ashamed of being so cocky?

152
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,920
What did you say?

153
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,530
Father. I'd like to tell you something.

154
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,580
Why are you here?

155
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,610
Don't mind me.

156
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,490
What do you need to tell me?

157
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,630
As your son, I can't stand
any more of this.

158
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,660
Grandmother abandoned you in her mind.
You know how stubborn she is.

159
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,010
She is more stubborn
than anyone else in the world.

160
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,850
That's why we have
Chairman Park Sung Hwan

161
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,580
because of Mrs. Sung Kyung Ja.

162
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,340
This is none of your business.

163
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,830
You will only get hurt
if this fight continues.

164
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,340
If she can't put you to shame
in front of your children

165
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,670
then she will take this to the public.
Don't you know her?

166
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,000
You can stop there.

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,820
How can you live with someone who went
on a trip with Hyun Joon?

168
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,830
Nothing happened between us.

169
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,110
He doesn't care if nothing happened.

170
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,130
Grandmother is not the only one
who is so stubborn.

171
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,890
We have nothing to lose. We just
need to take our hands off and watch.

172
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,250
Isn't it fun to watch
a bush fire from across the river?

173
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,740
Shut your mouth!

174
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,400
The spirit of our late mother
still remains in the house.

175
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,360
She cursed it and that's why we have
a woman like Yoo Ji Na in the house.

176
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,990
And that's why the old woman
in the main room

177
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,810
and Chairman Park Sung Hwan
are fighting to death.

178
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,090
Honestly, I'm not on anyone's side.
Grandmother, Hyun Joon, or even you.

179
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,800
But this is beyond doubt.

180
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,390
What are you trying to get in the end?

181
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,790
I wanted to see you before I go over.

182
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,740
You must have been hurt
when she mentioned

183
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,120
your late mother.

184
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,230
It's her sin to have a daughter like me.

185
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,080
I'd like to apologize for what she said.

186
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,250
I'm not going to stay here
forever anyway.

187
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,290
I'm going to leave soon since
the journalists have become quiet.

188
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,110
I can't imagine how mean she would be
if I weren't around.

189
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,510
I'm enduring for you.

190
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,800
- Is that so?
- I'll get going then.

191
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,540
We have to get the final winner.
Let me eat pigs' feet like crazy tonight.

192
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,410
Are you playing Alkkagi with your mouth?
Hurry up!

193
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,990
Stop rushing me.

194
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,370
Oh geez. Mom!

195
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,480
Okay. Okay. I'll finish it this time.

196
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,130
Okay. Pay for the pigs' feet first.

197
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,690
Why are you telling me to pay
when it's not even over yet?

198
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,850
I know you won't pay after you lose.

199
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,290
- Why wouldn't I pay?
- I won't let you get away.

200
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,760
- Go! Dad!
- All right.

201
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,090
If all of us are going to eat together,
then we should order a large portion.

202
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,860
No. Two medium portions.

203
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,320
Okay then. 40,000 won.

204
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,500
Precious 40,000 won.

205
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,350
Congrats! How do you feel after winning?

206
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,750
Mom! I beat Mi Sook!

207
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,690
Oh gosh. I feel so honored.

208
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,350
I used to win everything
when we competed.

209
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,320
I won Hopscotch and Marbles all the time.

210
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,280
So he is acting that way
because he has a deep resentment of me.

211
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,470
Oh, yeah! You lost the game of
Slap-match, too.

212
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,790
When did I lose the game of Slap-match?

213
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,580
Yeah, you did! You lost so you cried!

214
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,710
Oh, fine. I cried. So give me the money.

215
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:55,620
I know that you are trying to get out of
this by changing the subject.

216
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,900
Order first.

217
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,630
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get my wallet.

218
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,890
Last time you said you were going to get
your wallet and never showed up again.

219
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,370
- Bong Goo!
- Yes.

220
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,890
- You go bring it.
- Okay. I'll go bring it.

221
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh my gosh!

222
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,680
I was boiling the dishtowels
and left the stove on.

223
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,400
Oh gosh. Don't worry. I turned it off.
Mom, don't go anywhere.

224
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,500
Both of my children are blinded
by pigs' feet.

225
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,920
Oh dang it.

226
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,660
Here you go.

227
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,940
- Try a little.
- Okay.

228
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,910
How was it? Do you feel tipsy?

229
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,120
How could he feel tipsy already?

230
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,970
I don't feel anything at all.

231
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,570
Really? Try a little more then.

232
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,700
I don't feel anything.

233
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,400
Is... that right?
Then drink the full shot this time.

234
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,670
Okay.

235
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,510
How do you feel?

236
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,960
I don't feel anything.

237
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:39,120
Well... If that's the case...
then try two shots in a row.

238
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,660
Stop forcing him to drink.
He wouldn't get drunk that fast.

239
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,310
He has to drink it like crazy
and needs to really go through it.

240
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,740
That way, he will know
that alcohol is scary.

241
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:55,150
If he only gets used to sipping, then he
will get drunk somewhere else next time.

242
00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:00,220
That's why people say, "You need to
learn how to drink from someone scary."

243
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,860
That's not what it means.

244
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,500
It means you need to pay attention
and stay awake while drinking.

245
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,990
Why would you drink
if you wanted to stay awake?

246
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,950
Ah. I'm starting to feel very odd.

247
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,280
Really?

248
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,850
Do you feel very sad for no reason?

249
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,570
Yes. I think so.

250
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,830
Do you feel like everything in this
world is not meaningful?

251
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,430
Yes. I think so.

252
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,950
That's it! That's why people drink.

253
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:54,330
Thank you so much for taking a person
like me as part of your family.

254
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,400
Hm. He's getting drunk.
Your eyes seem to have lost their focus.

255
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,270
After I met Hae Dang, I realized...

256
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:08,920
Ah. I was very lonely before.

257
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,500
I didn't even realize
it was loneliness before.

258
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:31,200
For me, being alive meant...
winning time that was passing slowly.

259
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,070
It's all good.
All your lonely time is over now.

260
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:46,450
Hae Dang will never make
her own family feel lonely.

261
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:53,110
Thank you... all of you.
Thank you so much.

262
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,220
Please recover your senses, Bro.

263
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,870
Please just call me Kyung Soo.

264
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,250
It doesn't... work that way.

265
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:24,470
I feel like... I want to call you Bro.

266
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,190
Bro!

267
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,760
It doesn't matter
what we call each other

268
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,380
as long as we treat each other
as brothers.

269
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:45,520
I was a little... lonely
because I didn't have a brother.

270
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,060
Bro!

271
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,120
Why are you here?

272
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:53,970
Did you hear from Hae Dang
that I know you are my son?

273
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:03,980
I guess I never told anyone
that I met my son.

274
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,890
Why does that matter?

275
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,960
What is your relationship with Hae Dang?

276
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,360
Are you two in a relationship?

277
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,260
Why?

278
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,640
Why does it have to be Hae Dang?

279
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,050
Why?

280
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,970
Do you know... how old Hae Dang is?

281
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,200
Do you think I love her
without knowing her age?

282
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,430
Love?

283
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,720
Why does it have to be Hae Dang?

284
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,930
There are so many girls you could love.

285
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:40,780
Why? Is it because she's an impersonator
of Ms. Yoo Ji Na?

286
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,260
- You can do better than that.
- I can do better than that?

287
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm going to give you everything
I own... or what I'm going to own.

288
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,450
So what?

289
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,320
So why would you date Hae Dang,
who is eight years older than you?

290
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,000
It's none of your business.

291
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,840
Do you know how she earns money
at the night club?

292
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,190
- She earns it by singing.
- You think that's just singing?

293
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,580
She kills time for drunken men by making
vulgar comments.

294
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,910
You call that "singing"?

295
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,040
Watch your mouth.

296
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,840
Don't be deceived by her pure face.

297
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,600
She knows how to approach people
because she is so quick-witted.

298
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,030
Did she seduce you by saying

299
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,320
that she sacrificed
for her younger sisters?

300
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,070
I told you to watch your mouth.

301
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,860
She's worked at night clubs for years.

302
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,640
It's so easy for her
to seduce a fool like you.

303
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,250
Watch what you are saying!

304
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,960
- Break up with her.
- What did you say?

305
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,100
Who are you to say that?

306
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,960
I am... your mom.

307
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,080
- Break up with her now.
- Who is my mom?

308
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,180
What?

309
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,570
You abandoned me a long time ago
so that you could be alone.

310
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,930
- What do you mean I abandoned you?
- What would you call it then?

311
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:17,640
And now you come and tell me to break up
with my girlfriend as a mom.

312
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,220
Who gave you the right to say that?

313
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,380
Even if I abandoned you,
you are still my child.

314
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,450
What?

315
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,410
I feel guilty for abandoning you.
So I'm doing this now

316
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,370
to let you live
like a decent human being.

317
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,030
So break up with Hae Dang now.

318
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:40,040
Get out.
Get out of here!

319
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,400
I don't need a mom.

320
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,780
I've been living fine without you and I
will live fine without you in the future.

321
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,640
But I can't live without Hae Dang.

322
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,220
So do not speak carelessly about
Hae Dang to me.

323
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,340
What?

324
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,290
<i>You will only get hurt
if this fight continues.</i>

325
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,350
<i>If she can't put you to shame
in front of your children</i>

326
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,260
<i>then she will take this to the public.
Don't you know her?</i>

327
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,830
Let's have lunch together today.

328
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,950
Where are you going to stay
when you leave?

329
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:51,580
I'm going to stay at a hotel first and
then move when I find a place to stay.

330
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,150
Do that.

331
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:08,480
Thanks a lot for saving my reputation
before you left.

332
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,600
My manager is looking
for a place for me to stay.

333
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,340
Can you help me find a place?

334
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,510
What are you implying?

335
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,410
No. I was just saying
because you were worried

336
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,310
that I wouldn't be able to find
a good place.

337
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,400
Are you saying that you will move
to a place I get for you?

338
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,110
Does that mean I can go visit you?

339
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,540
Why? You don't want to?

340
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:58,580
Are you saying you are okay with living
as a mistress without getting married?

341
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,750
Of course.

342
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,470
Why do you suddenly love me?

343
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,860
I said I would focus on only you.

344
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,640
Do you need me now more than before?

345
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:26,210
A woman can love a man if necessary.
I thought you knew women well.

346
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:33,150
I would appreciate it if you could live
as my mistress.

347
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,430
What?

348
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:43,300
I thought you were planning to love me.

349
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,350
Instead of using your brain...

350
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,120
it might be faster to just tell me
the truth and beg.

351
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,190
I... met my son.

352
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,000
Is that right?

353
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,600
I want to live differently
than before for my son.

354
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,440
Obviously, I still love you.

355
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,780
Whether you love me or not has not
been my interest from the start...

356
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,000
because I can always make you love me.

357
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,600
And all you have to do is just pretend
to be a modest lady

358
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,210
like what you are doing right now.

359
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,380
I can try harder.

360
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:15,560
And I'm prepared to take your child
as my child if we get married.

361
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,510
Do you really mean it?

362
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:25,240
But because of my mother and Hyun Joon

363
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,980
we won't be able to have
a fancy wedding as you wanted.

364
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,530
It's pretty obvious that one of them...

365
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:39,820
or perhaps they will work together
to make the wedding a mess.

366
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,730
Then let's just register a marriage
and then live together.

367
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,760
We can do that without letting them know.

368
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,910
You really are in a rush.

369
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:04,080
I'm going to try to love you.

370
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,730
Trying to love could be more reliable
than love.

371
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:15,790
I'm going to try as hard as I can
so that you can keep loving me.

372
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:26,820
Okay.
Let's do that.

373
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,820
But I'll say yes on one condition.

374
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,190
Condition?

375
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,030
Let's talk about it after we eat.

376
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,790
Grandmother! Look at this!

377
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,670
What is that?

378
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:02,560
They got a picture taken at a restaurant
as they were leaving after having lunch.

379
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,530
- Who took that?
- A journalist.

380
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:11,130
I guess Yoo Ji Na is still a celebrity.
Everyone is interested in her every move.

381
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,000
What does the article say?

382
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,320
Are they really broken up? If they are

383
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,650
then why do they still have a date
and live in the same house?

384
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,100
Oh my goodness.

385
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,330
And... Yoo Ji Na published
a follow-up article.

386
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,520
Saying what?

387
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,180
It said that the fact
that they cancelled their wedding

388
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,850
is false information from a
misunderstanding between family members.

389
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,560
False information?

390
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,210
What is the condition?

391
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,440
I'd like to meet your child.

392
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,340
You?

393
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,880
I want to get his word

394
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,440
that he will never disclose
to the public that he is your son.

395
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,640
What does that mean?

396
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,320
It doesn't matter to me
that you have a child.

397
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,010
I'm getting married
to such a young woman...

398
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:19,030
I can accept it.
No... I already accepted it.

399
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,840
But then why?

400
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,960
But if people find out that you are
a woman who abandoned a blind child

401
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,650
then I won't be able to claim you
as my official wife in public.

402
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,940
My family and I have status among

403
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:45,030
the employees, politicians,
and other people in the world.

404
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:51,630
If he doesn't disclose
to the public that he is my son

405
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:56,810
are you going to treat him as your son?

406
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,790
Of course.

407
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,010
I'm going to do so in every way...

408
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:17,430
only if he promises that he
will not disclose that he is your son.

409
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,620
What if I can't kick her out
while idling time away?

410
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,180
Grandmother! Look at this.

411
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,100
What is that?

412
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,530
I thought everything was over because

413
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,630
Father-in-law kept everything a secret.

414
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,500
But it's finally coming out now.

415
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,290
Who is this child? She said
she doesn't have a nephew.

416
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,530
That's what I'm saying.
This was it.

417
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,140
The shocking story that caused him
to think so hard.

418
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:02,100
Are you saying that impertinent thing
had a child and hid him?

419
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,360
I don't think she hid him. I think she
abandoned him.

420
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,150
She abandoned him

421
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:10,470
I found her sister-in-law,
who disappeared during the night.

422
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,460
But she thought that Yoo Ji Na had sent
her child to an orphanage.

423
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,890
She's not a human being.

424
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:24,210
And then she became a singer
and made a fuss like that?

425
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,980
But Father had already decided
to let her off.

426
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,860
And her life as a singer is already
over. So there is nothing to disclose.

427
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,020
Find the child.

428
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,970
What are you going to do
when you find him?

429
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:44,120
He can probably let her off
for the fact that she had a child.

430
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,330
He was also married once
and he has two children.

431
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:53,920
But with his personality, it won't be
easy for him to claim her as his wife

432
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,540
if she abandoned her child and
completely deceived the public.

433
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,230
You are right.

434
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,800
You have to make this person
reveal himself in public and say

435
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,080
"I'm Yoo Ji Na's abandoned son."

436
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,370
That will throw the world
into utter confusion.

437
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,600
We have to find the child before he does.

438
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,790
I told them to report to me
anything they find out.

439
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,210
How could you abandon your own child?
A child you gave birth to! How dare you?

440
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,410
Why didn't you say something
when you came in?

441
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,360
Why are you staring at me like that?

442
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,690
Are you still mad at me?

443
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,830
I saw you two in front of your house
the other day.

444
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,040
Why did you come to my house?

445
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,480
I just went to see you.

446
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,300
When I saw you
with that guy, I felt like

447
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,640
I was watching my wife cheat on me.

448
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,090
Hyun Joon!

449
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,400
First, I'm going to have
a song ready for you.

450
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,940
What song?

451
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,220
A singer needs to have her own song.

452
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,320
You are going to have a song
that I'm going to sing?

453
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,320
How much longer are you going

454
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,730
to sing someone else's songs and
impersonate someone else?

455
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,720
Oh gosh. It's too late
to debut as a singer now.

456
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,900
We'll find out if it is
too late after we do it.

457
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,640
All impersonators fail when they debut
with their own songs.

458
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,840
The company could go bankrupt!

459
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,450
I'm a rich man. Don't you know?

460
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,980
It's not my fault
that I was born a chairman's son.

461
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,510
Your father betrayed me overnight.

462
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:09,680
Oh gosh. You shouldn't try hard for
something so reckless.

463
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:16,990
I told you I would help you
find your own life.

464
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,590
Being loved by a man
doesn't necessarily find your own life.

465
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,310
I'm going to do this one thing for you...

466
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,170
although I'm not sure how much longer
I can be next to you.

467
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,670
Hyun Joon...

468
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,860
I'm going to support you so that you can
become successful as a singer.

469
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,720
So free yourself
from being an impersonator

470
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,590
and live happily with that man.

471
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,320
I feel like I'm indebted to you
so I feel uncomfortable.

472
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,830
I would feel very insignificant if you
didn't even let me do this for you.

473
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,250
You are a woman I loved...
frankly I still love you.

474
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,710
You are a woman who will become
another man's wife.

475
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,820
No. Actually, you are my woman who will
soon become another man's wife.

476
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,500
Should I just let her go
without doing anything?

477
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,160
Why do you talk like that?
I feel so bad now.

478
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:24,430
If my family was close to being normal
then I wouldn't have given up so easily.

479
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,390
But I agree with your father that you
I will cause you a lot of distress.

480
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,290
So I'm letting you go... for you.

481
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,270
Hyun Joon...

482
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:44,590
So please just accept what I'm trying
to do for you for the last time.

483
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,360
Come in.

484
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,550
Why do you look so serious?

485
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:23,360
CEO Park will have a song ready for me.

486
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,020
- Really?
- Should I tell him not to?

487
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,730
Why?

488
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,220
Doesn't that... bother you?

489
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,000
Why would that bother me?
I actually feel grateful.

490
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,690
Your lifelong wish
was to sing a song with your name.

491
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,400
But anyone can tell that
the management company is not doing this

492
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,100
because the singer has a high potential.

493
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,110
Oh dang. So that man really likes you,
doesn't he?

494
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,050
That is not why I told you.

495
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,240
You can make your debut successful
to make the agency profitable

496
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,610
so that you can pay back
your gratitude for him.

497
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,300
Do you really think that way?

498
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,010
I was worried that you would be bothered.

499
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:12,890
He's the CEO of your management company.

500
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,710
If I minded every single matter
like that

501
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,310
then it would always feel like
the three of us were dating.

502
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:22,140
I also can't afford to change
my management company.

503
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,560
I know.

504
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:28,140
You know how I feel, right?

505
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,090
Of course.

506
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,550
<i>[Yoon Hee]</i>

507
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,370
<i>The person you are trying
to reach is busy.</i>

508
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,220
<i>Please leave your message
after the tone.</i>

509
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,110
We have to find the child.
What is his name?

510
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,810
Her sister-in-law would know
his name at least.

511
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,660
What did you just say?

512
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:22,440
His name is... Lee Kyung Soo?

513
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,880
Okay. Thank you.

514
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,780
I don't even need to investigate further.

515
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,440
<i>I knew there was something between them.</i>

516
00:40:54,390 --> 00:41:00,420
<i>How can I trust that old woman
and tell her this crucial fact?</i>

517
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:06,080
<i>Let me see. I should act calmly
in a situation like this.</i>

518
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:15,030
Didn't they find out
anything more about the child?

519
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:18,980
I was actually on the way to tell you.

520
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,860
They found something out?

521
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:26,330
They said they wouldn't be able
to find out anything else.

522
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,190
What? Why?

523
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:34,050
Her sister-in-law died in a car accident.

524
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,190
What? All of a sudden?

525
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:41,380
And her older brother is keeping his
mouth shut since it's about his sister.

526
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,980
And the few people in her hometown
who knew about the incident

527
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,570
are keeping their mouths shut because
Father has already bribed them.

528
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:53,150
Give them more money then.
We can give them more money.

529
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:57,960
Well... We should wait and see for now.
There might be another way.

530
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,850
Why did she get into a car accident
out of the blue?

531
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,690
I know.

532
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:07,670
Oh goodness.

533
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,750
I'm going to make cold bean
noodle soup. Does Mother like that?

534
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,390
- Ji Na.
- What?

535
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,570
What do you think of me?

536
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,140
Why are you asking me that
all of the sudden?

537
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,610
You're much too stubborn.

538
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,920
What are you talking about?

539
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,320
After you get married to Father,
are you going to have a child?

540
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,840
What? Who's getting married?

541
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,810
I'm going to leave this house soon.

542
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:53,480
But if you don't leave the house,
and you marry Father...

543
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,250
will you have another child?

544
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:01,920
"Another" child? Did you just ask me if I
would have "another" child?

545
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,160
No. I meant... would you have a child?

546
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,570
I'm too old to give a birth to a child.

547
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,160
Then, do you think we can be friends?

548
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,960
What do you mean by that? Stop beating
around the bush and get to the point.

549
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,880
What are you talking about?
We know each other pretty well.

550
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,800
I guess it would be hard for you to be

551
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,720
on the same side as
your brother-in-law, right?

552
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:35,260
Also, you wouldn't feel very comfortable
with Hong Yoon Hee either.

553
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,300
It's not that I'm very pleased with you.

554
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,820
But I don't hate you as much
as Hong Yoon Hee.

555
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,280
But where is this coming from?

556
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,730
Then, are you going
to support my husband?

557
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,310
What?

558
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:56,540
Well, there are only two men who can
take over the company.

559
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,770
So either Hyun Joon or Hyun Sung
has to succeed to the chairman.

560
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:03,640
If the person you push gained supremacy

561
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,790
then you would have more power
as the Queen without a son.

562
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:11,720
You like historical dramas, don't you?

563
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,580
You said you won't
have a child with Father.

564
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,520
If you can't be on my side

565
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,080
then it is not because you are not smart,
but because you talk without thinking.

566
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,650
Is that so?

567
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,340
You should be more earnest.

568
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,570
Have I ever said
I would stay with this family?

569
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:31,470
But you will soon.

570
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,430
Do you think I have a big mouth?

571
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:40,110
I'm trying really hard
to keep something amazing to myself.

572
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,270
Something amazing?

573
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,540
I don't say things that I don't need to.

574
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,020
You got a lot better. Good job.

575
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,460
You should have lunch before you leave.

576
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,250
We made cold bean noodle soup
because of the hot weather.

577
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,790
Sure. Thank you.

578
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,420
Why don't you tell Grandmother
to come out?

579
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,410
Hi!

580
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,430
I'll go get Grandmother.

581
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,840
What are you doing here?

582
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,910
Just sit down.
They might hear us.

583
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,180
You are so young but you seem
to like cold bean noodle soup.

584
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,820
It's really good.

585
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,230
Why are you sitting
at the table with a guest?

586
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:16,350
Get up and take a bowl of soup
and go to the other house.

587
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,020
You should eat.
You should eat more if you like it.

588
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,750
I will.

589
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,200
Why are you here
if you're being treated like that?

590
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,430
Don't worry about it.

591
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:49,530
Do you want to be a chairman's wife
that badly? Don't you have your pride?

592
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:55,080
No. I abandoned my pride because of you.

593
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,600
What?

594
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,920
Why are you here?
I didn't call you.

595
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,320
I saw him coming in here.
So I brought some snacks for you.

596
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,380
Don't mind me.
Continue your conversation.

597
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,080
I'm going to leave now.

598
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,240
Hey, Mr. Jung!

599
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,670
Is it time for a new shift?

600
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:45,120
Your son-in-law is at the cart bar again.

601
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,900
Again?

602
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,390
Hi, Dad!

603
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:55,660
Hi! Can you go upstairs and ask Hae Jin
to come down if she's not sleeping yet?

604
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,550
- Now?
- Hurry up.

605
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,280
What are you doing here so late?

606
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,500
- Is Bong Soo home?
- He should be.

607
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,810
Maybe he got home
while I was putting Hoon to sleep.

608
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,640
Hold on.

609
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:16,420
Oh gosh. He's not home.

610
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,670
You didn't even know
that your husband wasn't home?

611
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,030
What?

612
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,330
I think there is something going on
with Bong Soo.

613
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,180
That's not possible.

614
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:30,670
Stop saying that it's not possible and
go see it yourself.

615
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,570
Does he really want to get killed?

616
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:39,140
He is having feelings for another woman
because you are being hard on him.

617
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,710
So are you saying that he's having
feelings for another woman?

618
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,720
No. I'm saying he could have feelings.

619
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,410
What... does she do?

620
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:50,690
She owns a cart bar
in the vacant lot over there.

621
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,730
A cart bar?

622
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:58,000
Oh... That's... ridiculous.

623
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,400
Don't lose your mind.

624
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,940
I'm going to go see if she's someone
I should lose my mind over.

625
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,480
Talk it out first.

626
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,310
Oh my.

627
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:16,360
I feel like I have a brick
on each of my shoulders.

628
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,910
Oh, is that right?

629
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:23,740
I've been bearing the pain I was having
and I feel numb now.

630
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:28,230
Oh geez. I'll massage for you.

631
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,520
No. It's okay.

632
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,620
- Oh, who cares?
- Oh my.

633
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,460
Be careful.

634
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,530
- Here you go.
- It's okay.

635
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,120
- Do you like it?
- Yes. I do.

636
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,260
Hi!

637
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,030
Hi! Please have a seat.

638
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:02,860
Hae Jin!

639
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,730
I'd better get going.

640
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,260
I'll make you clam soup
so have one more drink.

641
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,650
I don't think clam soup
is what's important right now.

642
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,240
Honey! It's...

643
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,520
Follow me.

644
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:33,440
Oh, goodness.

645
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,770
Why are you just going home?

646
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:49,160
What do you mean?

647
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,320
Please stay with me.

648
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,170
What is your relationship
with that woman?

649
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:58,670
What relationship? We are just friends.

650
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,960
Friends? You really need to get your
fingers burned.

651
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,680
I only followed her because I was scared
she would break everything.

652
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,570
I didn't go because of you.

653
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:10,120
- Hae Sung!
- Let me go.

654
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,060
Hae Sung!

655
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,250
How could you be with that kind of woman?

656
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:40,630
Wasn't there a better woman
you could cheat with?

657
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:44,520
I was so embarrassed
in front of Hae Sung.

658
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:48,310
Is that why you are so angry?

659
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,070
You hurt my pride.

660
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:54,120
Why couldn't you at least cheat
with a better-looking woman?

661
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,280
How could you even think
about that bear

662
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,440
when you have a woman like me at home?

663
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,190
She totally suited your class though.

664
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,500
What? She suited my class?

665
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,790
Do you think people are born
with a pretty face

666
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,090
if they are nice
when they are inside their mother?

667
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,230
What?

668
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,160
Who cares about how she looks?

669
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,680
She's friendly and nice. Basically,
I want to fall asleep in her embrace.

670
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,620
Go fall asleep then.

671
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:25,050
Go fall asleep then. Go fall asleep
right now! Go fall asleep right now!

672
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:29,280
- Ow. Hold on.
- Go fall asleep with her now!

673
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,710
- Hey!
- Hold on.

674
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:34,870
What's the matter? Who is falling asleep?

675
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:39,730
He said he wants to fall asleep in
another woman's embrace.

676
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,700
- What?
- That's not it.

677
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:48,030
- Get out! Get out! Get out!
- Hold on. Hold on.

678
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:58,090
Don't open the door for him. If you do,
then I'm going to leave this house.

679
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,480
What... is going on?

680
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,900
Fall asleep in another woman's embrace?

681
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,620
Hey! Are you really cheating on her?

682
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,420
No.

683
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,440
No way. She said she would leave
the house if we open the door for you.

684
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,960
Why did you come out then?

685
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,660
Huh?
Ah.

686
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,380
Go sleep in the car.

687
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,390
I'm going to go sleep with Father.

688
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,680
You are not in a good place
to go sleep with him.

689
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,010
It's already pretty late.
Just go sleep in the car.

690
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:39,790
How can I sleep in a car though?

691
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,640
The weather got warm
so it will be fine. Go!

692
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,590
- Wait. Wait.
- Go. Hurry.

693
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,100
Bong Seon!

694
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,740
Try to sleep as pathetically
as possible so that

695
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,370
she will feel sorry for you
tomorrow morning.

696
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,870
Here is the car key. Bye now.

697
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,110
Bong Seon! Bong Seon!

698
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,390
Oh dang.

699
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:14,970
Dang it. Should I just
go back to the cart bar?

700
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:21,800
No. No. No. No.

701
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:44,890
I think he was just a patron.

702
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:47,560
So he probably became friends
with her and they chatted.

703
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,450
They weren't just chatting.
He was massaging her shoulders!

704
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:59,300
He was massaging her shoulders?
That disgusting...

705
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,670
He never massages
his own mother's shoulders.

706
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,050
Why would he do that to her
and get in so much trouble?

707
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:08,220
Did you see her?

708
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,660
I did.

709
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,850
What would other people say?

710
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:18,250
What will people think about me when
he's having fun with that kind of woman?

711
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:21,890
- Is that why... you are so mad?
- Yes!

712
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,830
Sweetheart.

713
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,210
How can I even face my own family?

714
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:30,730
They will want to know
what she looks like.

715
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,800
There is a level of woman
that would be acceptable

716
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,050
for him to have an affair with.

717
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:38,620
This is exactly why he's having an affair
with that kind of woman.

718
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,840
What?

719
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,990
What kind of woman cares about the level

720
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:46,140
of the woman when her husband
is about to cheat on her?

721
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:51,540
Do you think she could beat me
in any way?

722
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,640
Of course not. But if the woman says

723
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,790
"Please try this and this..."

724
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,280
Then even if he comes home, you won't be
able to act as conceited as you are now.

725
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,380
What?

726
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,030
Why can't you be more charming?

727
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,870
Do you know how much men
like charming women?

728
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:13,500
The only thing left in the end after
seeing everything is charm.

729
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,730
Do you think a pretty face
stays pretty for your entire life?

730
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:21,530
I have another man
to whom I want to act charming.

731
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,000
What?

732
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,670
How could I be able to act charming
with Yeon Bong Soo?

733
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,680
How could you...

734
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,230
So low! He's low class.

735
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,870
Low class?

736
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:42,150
Good for you! You are really high class!

737
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:51,540
Oh gosh. He doesn't say anything.
He should say

738
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:55,510
he is dating someone and wants
to introduce the person to us.

739
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:56,850
Is that right?

740
00:56:56,850 --> 00:57:00,190
A relationship between a man
and a woman can broken up easily.

741
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:04,210
So try to be patient and wait.

742
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:07,190
He said he wouldn't come back to me
even if I wait for him.

743
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:10,740
He can say anything when he's crazy
about another woman.

744
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:15,740
He is very warm-hearted.

745
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,360
He spent so many years with you.

746
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,960
Why would he look for someone else
all of a sudden?

747
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:27,400
I can tell people's fortunes.

748
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,720
Have you ever seen my fortunes be wrong?

749
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,960
You should have dinner.

750
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,600
I never thought
I would hear that from you.

751
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,660
I just said it without thinking.
I didn't mean anything.

752
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:47,110
Did you make up your mind with Father
since you have no chance with Hyun Joon?

753
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:53,220
Why am I getting this insult from you
after asking you to have dinner?

754
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:02,030
<i>She's already acting so arrogant.
I wonder</i>

755
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:05,440
<i>how she will treat me
after I get married.</i>

756
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:12,920
What are you doing here?

757
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,130
I was waiting for you.

758
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:19,340
Why are you still coming to this house?
What do you want to hear from me?

759
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,160
Are you sure your relationship
with her is going well?

760
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,110
So you think I will go back to you if
it doesn't work out with her?

761
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:28,200
Are you telling me to go back to you if
it doesn't work out with her?

762
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,290
Hong Yoon Hee really
doesn't have her pride.

763
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,170
- Hyun Joon.
- I don't even want to hear your voice.

764
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,000
What?

765
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,760
I'm tired of hearing your voice.
Get out of here!

766
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:54,900
Grandmother! Grandmother!

767
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:01,230
Oh gosh. You startled me.
Why didn't you knock?

768
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:07,700
Yoon Hee took pills.
She committed suicide.

769
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,250
What?

770
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,550
I'm looking for a patient
named Hong Yoon Hee

771
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:18,380
who overdosed on sleeping pills.

772
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,300
Ah. She was just transferred to a room.

773
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,280
What have you done?

774
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:40,630
I tried really hard to forget you.

775
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:49,800
But then I didn't know
how to forget you.

776
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:56,630
Who do you want me to meet?

777
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:00,270
Chairman Park Sung Hwan
wants to meet you.

778
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,410
Why?

779
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:04,580
What do you mean why?
Because you are my son.

780
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,750
I don't want to.

781
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:09,310
He said he will take you as his son.

782
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:10,410
What?

783
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:12,520
Then you'd become a chairman's son, too.

784
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,580
You'll become part of a wealthy family.

785
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,470
Do you even know what you're saying?
Are you insane?

786
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,660
Why would I be his son?

787
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:26,690
What do you mean why? Of course you will
become his son if I become his wife.

788
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,430
I'm not interested in any of that.

789
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:33,060
I'm trying to neutralize my sins
by making you a chairman's son.

790
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:34,630
What?

791
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:39,100
I'm trying to do that by getting married
to a man I don't even love.

792
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,850
Is that neutralizing a sin?

793
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,700
Then what is neutralizing a sin?

794
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,920
Because you've had
an extremely painful life

795
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,040
you can now live the life of the wealthy
which people envy.

796
01:00:55,740 --> 01:01:00,200
I'm going to do it... for you.

797
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:08,300
You can even become the son who is most
loved by him if you do well.

798
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,860
What did you say?

799
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:14,790
Sung Hwan and his sons are always
at each other's throats.

800
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:17,900
It will be a great chance for you.

801
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:24,270
He will take your life to a place
you couldn't even imagine.

802
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:27,660
There is one condition though.

803
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:35,130
You just can't reveal to the public
that you are my son.

804
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:41,290
What did you say?

805
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:44,170
It's not a hard thing to do.

806
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:49,540
We can just say that you were born

807
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:54,910
to a woman he knew long ago.

808
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:03,240
Get out.

809
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,220
Get out of here right now.

810
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:09,310
I never want to see you again.

811
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,920
Maybe it would have been better
if I hadn't met you.

812
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,130
What?

813
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:20,730
Because you are the kind of person

814
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:25,330
who could abandon
a blind child so easily.

815
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:32,770
Because you are so shameless
and only think of yourself!
