(Episode 41)

3
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:21,109
It's this tree.

4
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:54,414
- It's not here. - It's not?

5
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:58,523
There's nothing. There's absolutely nothing.

6
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,289
Someone dug it up first.

7
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:07,758
Mom, I'm sorry.

8
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:13,265
It's all over now. It's over.

9
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:26,484
Do you like this tree that much?

10
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,656
When I die, I want to become a tree.

11
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,301
Why would you say such a thing?

12
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:38,160
You'll become healthy again.

13
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:48,664
I need to protect you until the end.

14
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,297
How could you endure under your frightening father?

15
00:01:55,922 --> 00:01:56,922
Mom.

16
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:03,007
When you become upset because of your father, think of this tree as me.

17
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:09,912
Think of it as me who can't leave you even if I die.

18
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:12,469
Mom...

19
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:19,899
Hyun-joon, I'm sorry...

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,094
and I love you.

21
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,195
In the end, I couldn't protect my mom.

22
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:52,531
All I did was drink, gamble, and grieve over my

23
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:58,491
pain in America because of my hatred for my father.

24
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:04,164
She must've been waiting for me. She must've missed me a lot.

25
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:09,464
When I think about such things, I can't forgive myself.

26
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:11,289
Hyun-joon...

27
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:16,640
When I think about my father laughing with Yoo Ji-na while my mom was dying...

28
00:03:19,594 --> 00:03:25,578
Who on earth has the evidence to put an end to him?

29
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,460
Good morning, Hae-dang.

30
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:43,343
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

31
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:48,429
By the way, about the tree next to the staircase in the yard...

32
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:53,773
The roots seem to be going into the walls. Shouldn't we do something about it?

33
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:57,695
Oh, that tree? We can't touch that tree.

34
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:01,812
- Why not? - It's our late mother-in-law's favorite tree.

35
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:04,953
Hyun-joon probably won't allow us to take it out.

36
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:10,304
So she knew about that tree.

37
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,430
Why?

38
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,254
Well, it's just that it rained a lot, so I was examining the

39
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,880
trees to see if they were all right, and that tree worried me.

40
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:29,640
Na-kyung already knew about that tree.

41
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:33,507
Really? How did she know?

42
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:37,804
Try to remember if you ever unintentionally said something about it.

43
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:48,778
I should hire a gardener and prepare for winter.

44
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,523
I heard it will be especially cold this winter.

45
00:04:51,914 --> 00:04:52,914
Go ahead.

46
00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:56,910
About that tree next to the staircase you mentioned before...

47
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,250
I think we'll have to cut that.

48
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:03,445
When my mom comes back from the vacation house and

49
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,329
sees that the tree is gone, she'll be disappointed.

50
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:09,115
Don't touch that tree.

51
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:18,594
She already knows about that tree, so she would've

52
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,609
dug up the evidence as soon as she read the letter.

53
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:23,531
How did Na-kyung see the letter?

54
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:25,523
There's no safe in the annex.

55
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:30,109
Yoo Ji-na found the letter, so why can't Na-kyung?

56
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,524
Your father and Kyung-soo went to exercise often,

57
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:35,938
so there were many times when the annex was empty.

58
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:39,015
She could've just read the letter and left it there.

59
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:41,218
Then she should've ended this once and for all.

60
00:05:41,398 --> 00:05:45,062
Why would she go through all that trouble to put Ji-na into a trap?

61
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:47,710
She probably saw the letter recently.

62
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:51,562
If Na-kyung read the letter,

63
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:55,953
she would've taken it before Yoo Ji-na read the letter.

64
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:02,281
Even if Na-kyung has the evidence, it's dangerous all the same.

65
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:16,164
What's so important about a tree?

66
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:19,742
If it penetrates the walls, something dangerous might happen.

67
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:26,414
Are you wishing for mom at the vacation home to get sicker and never return?

68
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:30,867
- What? - You can never get rid of that tree.

69
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:33,765
It's a tree filled with memories of mom and me.

70
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:39,984
Men shouldn't be so petty. Why are you so emotional about a tree?

71
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:42,335
Don't lay a hand on it.

72
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:49,631
So your father knew about that tree as well.

73
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:54,327
Then he would've dug it up after reading the letter.

74
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:57,202
My mom was at the vacation home that winter,

75
00:06:57,788 --> 00:07:00,156
so she didn't know that tree was a problem.

76
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:05,709
She hid the evidence there just knowing it was a tree that only she and I knew about.

77
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:10,420
And in the following March, she passed away.

78
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,672
If my father really has the evidence, then everything is truly over.

79
00:07:34,092 --> 00:07:37,522
You conspired with chief financial officer Lee Sung-joo,

80
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:41,313
mobilized the funds of the subsidiary company GR Savings Bank,

81
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:44,917
and illegally swindled the company shares my father used as

82
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:48,401
a guarantee in order to seize the control of the company.

83
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:52,027
Don't be ridiculous.

84
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,083
- My father died from the shock of that. - That's not true.

85
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,885
After you got took over the company, Lee Sung-joo

86
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,422
became more greedy, so you tried to get rid of him.

87
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:03,972
I told you that's not true.

88
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:07,529
He told me himself that you committed fraud,

89
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:11,191
embezzlement, and all kinds of illegal activities.

90
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:17,089
He said he would give me all the evidence.

91
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:19,573
What?

92
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,277
I'm going to make sure I stay alive until I see the end of you.

93
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:30,808
I loved you so much. How could you do this to me?

94
00:08:31,246 --> 00:08:33,159
If you truly loved me,

95
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,260
you should've made your father love me as well.

96
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,323
I did everything for the company.

97
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:43,948
Even if I die, I'm going to work for GR Group.

98
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:48,597
Whether dead or alive, I'm the one who will sacrifice every minute and every

99
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:53,055
second of his life for GR Group. So why doesn't your father accept me?

100
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:55,175
Because you didn't work for the company.

101
00:08:56,504 --> 00:09:00,090
Because you worked by sacrificing your life for your murderous ambitions.

102
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:06,628
If you had a daughter, would you be able to love a son-in-law like yourself?

103
00:09:10,472 --> 00:09:13,628
After we got married, you couldn't live a day without another woman.

104
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:21,363
Only God knows I've tried so hard to forgive you.

105
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:26,868
Give the company shares to Hyun-joon and Hyun-sung

106
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:29,160
and come down from that position yourself.

107
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:32,417
Or else, I will no longer forgive you.

108
00:09:32,902 --> 00:09:35,511
All you ever talk about is our kids.

109
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:39,370
Are they all that matter to you?

110
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,355
Because you made me that way.

111
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:45,027
I can forgive the fact that you don't love me.

112
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,683
However, I can never forgive the fact that you don't

113
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,747
value our children just because you don't love me.

114
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:00,251
Even now, I'm slowly dying at the vacation house,

115
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:05,579
but all you do is think about chasing after that singer Yoo Ji-na.

116
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:09,977
I won't hold back anymore.

117
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:18,868
Then are you going to give the evidence you got from Lee Sung-joo to the prosecutor?

118
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:25,430
I'm sorry, but I don't think I will have the time to forgive you before I die.

119
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:43,235
He told me himself that you committed fraud,

120
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,861
embezzlement, and all kinds of illegal activities.

121
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:51,626
He said he would give me all the evidence.

122
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:58,587
I'm going to make sure I stay alive until I see the end of you.

123
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,219
Why didn't I think of that?

124
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:34,938
I must really be lacking two percent.

125
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:41,844
It's the tree. Lee Kyung-soo was digging under a tree from the beginning.

126
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:46,524
It's that tree that Hyun-joon and his mother liked.

127
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:05,540
It's not here. There's nothing here.

128
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:09,813
- What are you doing here? - Oh my god!

129
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:13,275
You scared me!

130
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:20,337
Why are you out in the yard and not sleeping at this time?

131
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:23,415
When I can't sleep at night, I usually walk around in the yard.

132
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:25,156
You should take pills.

133
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:33,703
I need to be healthy until I become the mother of the future

134
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,986
owner of the company, so I'm going to stop taking pills.

135
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:41,509
What do you mean there's nothing there? What's not there?

136
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:47,719
Did you come here to dig for the evidence?

137
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:50,430
What does that have to do with you?

138
00:12:58,376 --> 00:12:59,407
So it's this tree.

139
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:20,571
Then does this mean someone else already dug it up?

140
00:13:23,962 --> 00:13:26,079
Please check out the vacation season products.

141
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:30,430
Please check out the vacation season products.

142
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:35,193
Ma'am! Sir! Please check out the vacation season products.

143
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:36,818
(Cool Man's Ice T-shirt)

144
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:41,610
Please come inside.

145
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:45,368
Did you look for a gas station?

146
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:50,274
Fortunately, the owner of the gas station where my father-in-law

147
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:54,720
works at is looking for someone to buy it, so I decided to do that.

148
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:57,163
That's great.

149
00:13:57,944 --> 00:14:03,763
I can imagine how that naive, pure man will be smiling with joy.

150
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:12,366
Father, bow first. Let's give a round of applause to Mr. Jung Kang-sik's bow!

151
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:22,686
Congratulations, father!

152
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:27,398
Goodness. He was kind all his life, so thanks to his daughter getting

153
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:30,834
married into a good family, he has become the owner of a gas station!

154
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:40,874
Please let this gas station go unscathed and

155
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,390
watch over my family so they will be healthy.

156
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,350
Hyun-joon, you can go.

157
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:04,827
Please let my father-in-law live a long and healthy life.

158
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,155
Now it's our turn. Honey, come here.

159
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:17,851
Here.

160
00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:21,256
Hurry up.

161
00:15:25,913 --> 00:15:27,421
Please let the gas station succeed.

162
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:30,773
Also, please let my father-in-law meet a shrewd partner

163
00:15:31,402 --> 00:15:36,280
to take care of the money he makes at the gas station, Mr. Pig Head!

164
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:39,811
What the heck? What do you mean Mr. Pig Head? Are you bowing to a pig head right now?

165
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,707
We're doing this so that the pig head will eat the money deliciously. You're so dumb.

166
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:47,999
I know that. I was just joking. Gosh, you're such a show-off.

167
00:15:48,024 --> 00:15:50,264
- We're going to bow, too! - Come out.

168
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:57,772
Please let the gas station succeed and let our kind Hae-dang

169
00:15:57,797 --> 00:16:00,820
give birth to three strapping boys and two cute girls.

170
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:03,413
Please let them have five children in total!

171
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:08,725
Also, we wish for Mrs. Sung Kyung-ja to live a long life!

172
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,069
We wish!

173
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:16,061
- Congratulations! Congratulations! - Welcome! Welcome!

174
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:19,702
- Mr. Jung, congratulations! - Thank you.

175
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:22,124
What brings you here?

176
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:24,936
Of course I should come to such a celebration!

177
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:26,882
Of course?

178
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:31,397
You must be busy getting back the money people lent from you, so why...?

179
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:34,772
I came because Mr. Yeon Bong-soo invited me.

180
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:39,640
Of course you should come. You need to be officially introduced to everyone.

181
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:42,491
Officially? What do you mean officially?

182
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:45,999
This is my father-in-law's fiance-

183
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:57,209
She's not his fiance yet. She's his girlfriend.

184
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:00,866
What? You were dating someone?

185
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:03,139
No, I'm not!

186
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:07,303
- Please spread the rumors around. - Oh, come on! Why would they do that?

187
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,590
Ms. Oh, please go and bow.

188
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:18,137
It's the thought that counts!

189
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:23,035
Three dollars?

190
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,512
She's definitely a moneylender with an unhealthy taste for money.

191
00:17:31,286 --> 00:17:34,473
All righty then! We should each have a cup of rice wine now!

192
00:17:39,144 --> 00:17:40,395
My grandmother is here!

193
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:47,622
Welcome!

194
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:55,568
- Hello. - Hello.

195
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:58,942
Welcome, Mrs. Sung. We meet again.

196
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:01,067
- Have you been well? - Yes.

197
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:04,434
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

198
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,333
Thanks to you, I was able to honorably have an opening ceremony.

199
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:12,215
Thank you once again.

200
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:16,504
Now, you won't suffer on the streets in the cold and hot weather.

201
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:20,504
Yes, well, even though I'm the owner, I'm going to keep putting gas in cars.

202
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:24,497
With this gas station, I will work for community development.

203
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:27,191
So, how do I put this?

204
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:33,028
- For the community and... - Oh, forget it! Community, my foot.

205
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,879
As I came by, I realized the location is pretty good.

206
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:41,849
All the people in this neighborhood pass by here to and from work.

207
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,629
My father-in-law will make tons of money now!

208
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:50,465
I hope you do good things with the tons of money you make and live a blessed life.

209
00:18:52,106 --> 00:18:54,450
- Thank you, grandmother. - You're welcome.

210
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,497
Earlier when I bowed, I even prayed for your longevity.

211
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:03,629
Thank you. Thanks to you, I'll live until I'm exactly a hundred years old.

212
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:07,864
I would like to introduce myself to you as well.

213
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,232
Who are you?

214
00:19:10,257 --> 00:19:14,168
Oh! She's the one who my father-in-law went on a blind date with.

215
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:18,661
- I see. You went on a blind date? - No, it's not like that.

216
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,661
You have a very unique appearance.

217
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:27,043
You must have a very good personality.

218
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:32,614
My name is Oh Soon-jung.

219
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,504
At least you have a pretty name!

220
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:38,325
Only my name...?

221
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,723
No, well...I mean you have a pretty name as well.

222
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:47,692
Oh, my! Mrs. Oh, please come inside and have some tea with us.

223
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,317
- This way. - Yes, please do that.

224
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:51,301
This way.

225
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,973
Oh Soon-jung! Please remember it, ma'am!

226
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:02,723
The blind date is a joke. She's just a cleaning lady for the gas station.

227
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,129
I knew it! She looked like she would be a good worker!

228
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,356
Would you like a cup of rice wine?

229
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,247
Or would you like a cup of coffee or soda?

230
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:18,270
I'll have a cup of that. It's a good day, so I'll drink it!

231
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,630
Okay.

232
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:25,637
- My grandmother doesn't just drink anything outside. - I'll pour you a cup.

233
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:35,239
Why are you shaking? Are you still scared of me?

234
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:39,840
Well...you're very charismatic...

235
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:44,270
- That's true. I am charismatic. - Yes.

236
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:56,122
It's great!

237
00:20:57,544 --> 00:20:59,442
May the gas station be a success!

238
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:04,895
What are they doing over there?

239
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,583
You know the balloon dolls in front of gas stations? They must be copying that.

240
00:21:17,614 --> 00:21:18,614
Oh, my.

241
00:21:29,544 --> 00:21:31,247
What did you need to talk to me about?

242
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,017
By any chance...

243
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,848
did you dig up the evidence?

244
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,502
After hearing about the tree from me last time, you must have naturally

245
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:47,315
realized it was the tree that only Hyun-joon and his mother knew about.

246
00:21:49,026 --> 00:21:51,260
Did you dig, too?

247
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:54,658
I'm asking you because I didn't find anything.

248
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:59,768
When we dug through it, there was nothing there.

249
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:02,143
That means...

250
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,658
our father-in-law dug it up, right?

251
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:10,447
As of now, yes.

252
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:14,979
Then it's over! It's all over!

253
00:22:16,221 --> 00:22:17,979
It's all over! What else is left?

254
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:22,768
I know.

255
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:32,791
- So it's not Na-kyung. - I know.

256
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:35,221
It's my father. I'm sure of it.

257
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,611
Kyung-soo, is it comfortable staying in that room?

258
00:22:46,142 --> 00:22:49,986
- It was a guest room, so it's pretty small, isn't it? - It's fine.

259
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:57,229
In one month, either Hyun-joon or Hyun-sung move out.

260
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,518
Or both of you can move out.

261
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,486
You can use a bigger room then.

262
00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:06,127
Then what about me? Should I move out as well?

263
00:23:06,698 --> 00:23:09,541
Why do you want all the kids to move out? Who will make my meals?

264
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:14,354
Do you want me to eat food that the vulgar thing from the annex makes?

265
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:17,893
I'm going to move out as well. Give the master bedroom to Kyung-soo.

266
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:22,041
You two can live facing each other! How dare you utter nonsense!

267
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,572
Kyung-soo, let's have a cup of tea after you eat.

268
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:31,525
- You come and see me first! - Go wait in the bar.

269
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:33,479
Okay.

270
00:23:34,322 --> 00:23:36,798
Don't you think about how uncomfortable Hae-dang

271
00:23:37,197 --> 00:23:39,095
feels when Kyung-soo lives in the main house?

272
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,439
Then Hyun-joon will move out.

273
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:44,174
You're so stubborn!

274
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:49,502
If you're uncomfortable, I can find another place for you to live as well.

275
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:54,721
- What? - Parents and children need to live apart in order to miss each other.

276
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:57,088
I'm going to die before you miss me!

277
00:23:57,113 --> 00:24:00,658
So please do as I say!

278
00:24:00,745 --> 00:24:04,792
Look here, Mr. Park Sung-hwan. Get a hold of yourself.

279
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:06,916
Who is Kyung-soo the child of?

280
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,580
He's the flesh and blood of the wench who did horrid things to you!

281
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:16,283
You dare chase your own kids out to make Kyung-soo live comfortably?

282
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:21,049
Have you gone slightly crazy to the extent that other people don't notice?

283
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:26,548
Crazy? That's offensive.

284
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:29,510
I'm asking you if you overworked your brain

285
00:24:30,422 --> 00:24:33,393
in order to make such an effort to survive.

286
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:40,158
Do you want me to be locked up in a mental institution?

287
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:44,697
Before Ji-na did such a horrible thing, I could pass this

288
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,987
off as you being head over heels over a younger woman.

289
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:52,471
However, what are you thinking putting Kyung-soo

290
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:55,565
first in front of your children in this situation?

291
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:19,064
Did you dig it up?

292
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,823
What do you mean?

293
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:23,861
There was nothing underneath the tree.

294
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:28,322
You knew about that tree?

295
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:35,314
I dug under it right after your mom gave me the letter, but nothing was there.

296
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,916
- It's you, isn't it? - What is?

297
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:42,963
It's a CCTV footage, isn't it?

298
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,525
- I don't know. - There's no way you wouldn't know.

299
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:50,932
How could I know what tree it is after reading the letter?

300
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:53,666
I don't know about it.

301
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,268
Do you think I'll believe that?

302
00:25:58,588 --> 00:25:59,986
If you have it, give it to me.

303
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,697
I should be the one to have that. Do you not understand what I'm saying?

304
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,370
I don't.

305
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:11,174
Then at least tell me what was on the CCTV footage.

306
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:14,377
If you can't hand me the evidence,

307
00:26:15,432 --> 00:26:18,924
then at least tell me what was on there.

308
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,182
I don't know anything.

309
00:26:22,737 --> 00:26:29,408
- Did you seriously not dig it up? - Yes, I didn't.

310
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:37,083
We'll talk again later.

311
00:26:58,151 --> 00:26:59,916
I don't think it's our father-in-law either.

312
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:04,615
- What did Kyung-soo say? - He insisted he didn't do it.

313
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:08,525
However, who else is there besides him?

314
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:12,518
How does Kyung-soo know which tree it is?

315
00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:16,494
Did he secretly dig under all the trees in the yard at night?

316
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:21,112
To be honest, he had plenty of time to do that.

317
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:41,768
Long time ago, you discussed the letter with Jung Hae-dang, didn't you?

318
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:48,666
If Hae-dang and Hyun-joon find the evidence, then my life is really over.

319
00:27:54,995 --> 00:27:58,643
- What are you thinking about? - The trees in the yard grew a lot.

320
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:06,335
I was too busy to look at them, but now that I look at them, it's true.

321
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:14,822
Has my mom ever told you about the tree in the yard before?

322
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:19,080
My mom liked trees.

323
00:28:22,815 --> 00:28:28,580
Was there a tree she particularly liked?

324
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:37,408
That one. It's that tree. It's our favorite tree.

325
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:43,236
Even now, when I look at that tree, I think of my mom.

326
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:13,729
Hi.

327
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,385
Kyung-soo, I need a word with you.

328
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:26,783
- Did you find the evidence under the tree? - What do you mean?

329
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:29,963
You've asked me about that tree before.

330
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:39,249
Eventually, you got that evidence in your hands before Yoo Ji-na found the letter.

331
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:43,830
There was a CCTV footage under the tree, wasn't there?

332
00:29:44,745 --> 00:29:47,861
Something was captured in it, wasn't it?

333
00:29:50,025 --> 00:29:53,971
- Wasn't there a footage of Mr. Park doing something? - I don't know.

334
00:29:54,346 --> 00:29:57,279
If it's not my sister-in-law or my father...

335
00:29:58,479 --> 00:29:59,947
it can only be you.

336
00:30:00,994 --> 00:30:06,162
Even though I do have the evidence, it wouldn't benefit

337
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:10,615
you if Mr. Park or Ms. Yoo Ji-na knows about it.

338
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,838
Many things happened because the family found out I have the letter.

339
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:24,885
If they find out I have the evidence, we can't even imagine what will happen next.

340
00:30:26,362 --> 00:30:27,573
Don't you understand?

341
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:33,689
Then do I have to be silent about my mother's death forever?

342
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:35,822
Instead, you chose Hae-dang.

343
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:41,525
If you try to find out about your mother's death,

344
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:44,549
this family will never become peaceful.

345
00:30:44,924 --> 00:30:47,614
I'm sorry, but as long as you leave, there will be peace.

346
00:30:48,018 --> 00:30:50,838
I have something planned for my future as well.

347
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:55,104
I'll never become an obstacle in your life.

348
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,573
What do you mean?

349
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,158
It means I won't do that for Hae-dang's sake.

350
00:31:03,017 --> 00:31:06,217
- What are you planning? - I can't tell you yet.

351
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:19,080
- Kyung-soo knows about that tree as well. - Really?

352
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:26,066
Right after you told me about the CCTV, he asked me if there was a tree my mom liked.

353
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:32,161
In the end, he found the evidence before us.

354
00:31:43,982 --> 00:31:47,857
- What are you doing there? - The annex was too stuffy.

355
00:31:48,295 --> 00:31:51,943
- Then get fresh air in the yard. - It's too hot.

356
00:31:53,707 --> 00:31:55,646
You're asking for too many things.

357
00:31:56,396 --> 00:31:59,185
Why aren't you moving your possessions from that room?

358
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,052
They say lovers' quarrels are soon mended. Didn't you hear about it before?

359
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,599
Do you think it's used in situations like this?

360
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:10,917
There should be a reason why he's keeping me here.

361
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:15,435
Do you think he's keeping me here because Kyung-soo is at

362
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:17,270
an age when he needs a mother?

363
00:32:17,295 --> 00:32:21,630
Are you trying to get back together with my son?

364
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:25,700
How would other people know about what happens in a married couple?

365
00:32:27,006 --> 00:32:29,888
If there's no love, then there's no rage either.

366
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:31,498
What?

367
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,346
If we're pretending to be a happy couple, would there be a

368
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:38,760
reason to get tiredly angry about what the other does with who?

369
00:32:39,006 --> 00:32:43,271
Don't be ridiculous and move your things from that room to the annex at once.

370
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:50,154
Why? Are you afraid Mr. Park will think of me if he sees my belongings?

371
00:32:50,412 --> 00:32:53,544
Look here, Ms. Yoo Ji-na.

372
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:58,769
I don't know about anything else, but you should know enough about men by now.

373
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:01,755
Do you think you two can become a married

374
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:04,372
couple again after he saw such a horrid video?

375
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:07,575
Maybe if he got amnesia, it would be possible.

376
00:33:08,506 --> 00:33:10,568
And keep this one thing in mind.

377
00:33:11,146 --> 00:33:17,552
If something worse happens, your son won't be able to live with a sane mind.

378
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:23,693
- What did you say? - He saw, heard, and remembered all those things.

379
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:27,146
Do you think he'll be able to live with a sane mind?

380
00:33:27,646 --> 00:33:30,857
Don't talk carelessly about my son.

381
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:38,685
If you sincerely think about your son, you better stop using him for your own greed.

382
00:33:39,896 --> 00:33:44,661
- Mr. Park needs my son. - That's his situation.

383
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:52,075
No matter how needed he is, if he doesn't have a sane mind, then it's all vanity.

384
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,388
Don't speak ill of him. How dare you say my son doesn't have a sane mind?

385
00:33:56,623 --> 00:34:01,333
Do you think he's sane just because he doesn't run to the mental hospital?

386
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:10,699
- Humans have something called a limit, you fool. - "You fool?"

387
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:18,183
How can you, his own mother, try to use that poor thing for your own greed?

388
00:34:20,207 --> 00:34:23,011
It's not something you have to worry about.

389
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:26,847
They say life is short, right?

390
00:34:28,644 --> 00:34:32,683
It's actually not that short.

391
00:34:33,457 --> 00:34:35,831
Your son is twenty-five years old.

392
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:40,440
He'll live to be in his thirties and forties.

393
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,589
He has years to live after you die.

394
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:51,370
Try not to hurt the good kid's heart anymore.

395
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,776
However, that's our fate.

396
00:35:11,534 --> 00:35:16,183
Every human being has their own burden.

397
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,368
If I'm destined to not stop here...

398
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,839
then you're destined to be my son.

399
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:29,417
Cheers!

400
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:41,894
She looked different from the photo. I was so shocked. She had a striking face.

401
00:35:43,503 --> 00:35:45,972
If you talk ill of a person's appearance, you'll be punished.

402
00:35:45,997 --> 00:35:48,729
I don't mean anything else. I just mean she's striking.

403
00:35:48,988 --> 00:35:52,550
Being striking is the competitive look these days.

404
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:55,636
The modern society is all about story and character.

405
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:58,214
She does have a story. Hae-sung, do it.

406
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,761
Story? So it goes like this...

407
00:36:02,105 --> 00:36:04,892
She used to be a bully in her school days, and

408
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:07,347
then she was a gold digger for a while...

409
00:36:08,347 --> 00:36:11,667
Did she actually do that with that kind of striking face?

410
00:36:12,355 --> 00:36:16,003
She did. She totally did. She probably did.

411
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:20,159
Didn't you see her appear at the ceremony because he became the owner?

412
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,114
Women who haven't done that before can't be so tenacious and do such a thing.

413
00:36:24,191 --> 00:36:27,718
Anyways, whatever she did, she prepared some capital

414
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:31,269
and tried accumulate some money through money lending,

415
00:36:31,295 --> 00:36:34,284
however, she lost her house in a failed investment recently...

416
00:36:34,746 --> 00:36:39,346
Out of anger, she'll become possessed by spirits and become a shaman.

417
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:47,479
- Out of anger? - She paid three dollars at the ritual last time.

418
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:50,698
Have you ever seen a woman who pays three dollars at a ritual before?

419
00:36:52,464 --> 00:36:55,345
If a woman who is thrifty about a dollar lost her

420
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:58,191
house, she'll be angry enough to become a shaman.

421
00:36:58,371 --> 00:37:01,604
Her mind must have gone back and forth. That's when she'll become possessed.

422
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:03,886
Have you ever seen someone sane become possessed?

423
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:06,487
Anyways, she has a face with a lot of character.

424
00:37:06,957 --> 00:37:11,948
Of course! Once you see her, you'll remember her! That's extremely important!

425
00:37:12,246 --> 00:37:16,433
Anyways, now that I've seen her personally, she doesn't seem as scary as her photo.

426
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:22,683
There seems to be something cute about her...?

427
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:28,909
- She's cute? - I told you so. Unexpectedly, she's ladylike also.

428
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:33,027
When she twists and turns her body while speaking

429
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:36,472
sweetly, you don't even know she's scary at all.

430
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,878
She twists and turns her body?

431
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,753
Now that I keep seeing her, she seems to have a face you can warm up to.

432
00:37:47,385 --> 00:37:48,933
Why are you looking at me like that?

433
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,886
Do you like anyone who twists and turns their body?

434
00:37:51,996 --> 00:37:56,688
There's nothing that's harder to handle than a brusque women in a man's point-of-view.

435
00:37:58,035 --> 00:38:01,659
Since you're mentioning a man's point-of-view, you must think of her as a woman.

436
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:03,987
Then would I think of her as a man?

437
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:06,961
If you keep looking at that style of woman, you

438
00:38:06,986 --> 00:38:09,167
can warm up to her and not get tired of her.

439
00:38:10,558 --> 00:38:11,597
I can't believe this.

440
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:14,003
Did you see that? Did you hear it?

441
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:17,269
This is why only the pretty ones aren't gold diggers!

442
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,695
You need to know how to twist and turn your

443
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,503
body well in order to be in the competition.

444
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:26,391
When you sit with her, she twists and turns her body and

445
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:30,228
then suddenly stares at you with terror like she's a shaman.

446
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:32,558
Anyways, she's not boring.

447
00:38:34,824 --> 00:38:38,784
I told you so! That's her charm!

448
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:43,803
I guess men have a different way of viewing women.

449
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:50,886
- So are you going to let her move in? - I was thinking I should...

450
00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:53,292
Are you really thinking of letting her move in?

451
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:55,933
- I'm thinking about it? - Thinking?

452
00:38:57,964 --> 00:38:58,964
Oh, dear.

453
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:10,565
- Cheers! - Cheers!

454
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,214
What about Hyun-joon and Hae-dang?

455
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,222
She wasn't able to go home after getting married, so I sent them there.

456
00:39:21,018 --> 00:39:25,822
I didn't notice, but now that they're not here, the table is very empty.

457
00:39:26,371 --> 00:39:27,511
I know.

458
00:39:52,714 --> 00:39:53,776
It's been a while.

459
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:56,448
Aren't you supposed to eat before the family does?

460
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:00,339
I was doing something earlier, so I couldn't eat then.

461
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:05,058
Move your things from my room to the annex.

462
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:10,300
It must be uncomfortable for you to go in there when I'm not here.

463
00:40:11,027 --> 00:40:16,706
Now do you even hate me coming into that room?

464
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:35,026
What do you want at this hour?

465
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:36,651
Thank you for the food.

466
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,909
I'll excuse myself first.

467
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:52,847
Clean this quickly and set up my dinner.

468
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:56,190
You need to eat at the designated time.

469
00:40:56,738 --> 00:40:59,441
If you demand me to set up a meal for you whenever you feel like

470
00:40:59,466 --> 00:41:02,168
it, it gets difficult to prepare the other family members' meals.

471
00:41:02,355 --> 00:41:07,472
- I was doing something. - Aren't you just trying to see my father-in-law's face?

472
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:10,347
- Hurry up and clean the table. - Who are you talking to?

473
00:41:11,472 --> 00:41:13,644
- Excuse me? - Is Na-kyung your daughter-in-law?

474
00:41:14,394 --> 00:41:16,190
How dare you order her around!

475
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,237
You are no longer Park Sung-hwan's wife.

476
00:41:19,496 --> 00:41:21,487
The divorce papers haven't been completed yet.

477
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:23,948
You can't even see me eat anymore?

478
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:28,120
- I told you to eat at the designated time. - This isn't a dorm.

479
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:34,644
- If she doesn't eat at the designated time, don't give her food. - Yes, grandmother.

480
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,097
What are you looking at?

481
00:41:38,737 --> 00:41:43,417
I'm worried you won't live long enough to see Kyung-soo become the successor.

482
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:50,808
Please live a long time so you can witness Kyung-soo inheriting the company.

483
00:41:53,582 --> 00:41:59,972
After this crisis, I'm still next to him, so what would he chase me out for now?

484
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:03,558
Do you still not know what he feels?

485
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:07,847
- Na-kyung, go up and rest. - What about me?

486
00:42:08,253 --> 00:42:13,066
Clean up the table and set up dinner with your own hands. Do the dishes as well.

487
00:42:14,066 --> 00:42:16,292
If you don't, I'll make sure you can't come anywhere

488
00:42:16,316 --> 00:42:18,121
near the main house starting from tomorrow.

489
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:25,769
Please wash the dishes.

490
00:42:33,105 --> 00:42:36,589
How can you just leave? She told you to do the dishes.

491
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:45,034
Mrs. Sung Kyung-ja won't live long, but can you be so impudent to me?

492
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:47,854
Don't put the big dishes into the dish washer.

493
00:42:48,457 --> 00:42:50,940
Make sure you scrub the pots and pans very well.

494
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:54,152
That way, it will be easier for me to make breakfast tomorrow.

495
00:43:05,948 --> 00:43:08,927
I think father is doing this on purpose because Mrs.

496
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:11,818
Baek is angry and he wants her to make up her mind.

497
00:43:13,277 --> 00:43:16,534
Then we should let that woman move in here.

498
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:21,925
My mom has a lot of pride, so she keeps playing innocent.

499
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,444
Bong-sun, stop humoring them.

500
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:32,026
I think I will be a bit disappointed if Mr. Jung marries another woman.

501
00:43:33,035 --> 00:43:34,729
Why would you be disappointed?

502
00:43:34,885 --> 00:43:38,394
- I must think of him as a father. - What?

503
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:43,261
Just think of him as an in-law. Father? Yeah, right.

504
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:48,808
After Ms. Oh appeared, I value Mrs. Baek more.

505
00:43:49,152 --> 00:43:53,752
Right? At least my mother-in-law is refined and has a sense of humor.

506
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:56,573
She kind of has manners as well.

507
00:43:56,753 --> 00:44:00,353
What do you mean "kind of?" Manner is her middle name.

508
00:44:01,277 --> 00:44:06,239
She's a bit burdensome as a mother-in-law, but she's very neat and tidy.

509
00:44:06,371 --> 00:44:09,839
Then should we daringly agree her to move in?

510
00:44:10,285 --> 00:44:12,073
In order to make Mrs. Baek jealous?

511
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:14,401
Okay, fine! Go right ahead!

512
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:19,534
Before my mother becomes jealous, your father might fall for Ms. Oh!

513
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:21,026
Yeah, right!

514
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:26,479
Oh my gosh. She gives you an eye-smile with those slanted eyes of her and says,

515
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:32,386
"Manager! Chief! Mr. Yeon! Please repay your debt!"

516
00:44:33,144 --> 00:44:36,042
Then you can't help but repay her.

517
00:44:36,394 --> 00:44:39,667
She's actually overflowing with cuteness!

518
00:44:39,988 --> 00:44:42,128
Do you think they're repaying her because she's cute?

519
00:44:42,153 --> 00:44:44,956
 They're repaying her because she might hit them if they don't.

520
00:44:48,558 --> 00:44:51,261
Let's hurry up and go. Your grandmother will be waiting for us.

521
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:54,284
It's been a while since you've come here. You should sleep over.

522
00:44:54,464 --> 00:44:55,667
We were here for a long time.

523
00:44:56,566 --> 00:44:58,300
I already called my grandmother.

524
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:01,847
She said to sleep here since you haven't been here for a while.

525
00:45:02,191 --> 00:45:03,191
Really?

526
00:45:04,347 --> 00:45:08,746
- What about tomorrow's breakfast? - Na-kyung can do it. What's the worry?

527
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:11,559
That's great.

528
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:14,003
Yay!

529
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,456
We'll have to sleep on my bed together.

530
00:45:22,878 --> 00:45:24,611
You removed Hae-soo's bed.

531
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,894
I couldn't remove it for a long time, but I did it a few days ago.

532
00:45:37,355 --> 00:45:40,284
This room makes me think of Hae-soo.

533
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,519
Our family thinks about Hae-soo...

534
00:45:45,082 --> 00:45:47,753
although we don't mention her because it will make everyone sad.

535
00:45:49,925 --> 00:45:50,925
Let's sleep.

536
00:46:01,847 --> 00:46:04,886
It's been a while since we slept together. I'm so happy!

537
00:46:07,082 --> 00:46:10,675
I'm so happy that I get to sleep with you as well!

538
00:46:13,597 --> 00:46:16,081
Now that dad opened up a gas station, stop

539
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:19,152
delivering parcels and just focus on your writing.

540
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:22,175
Now that I see you like this, your face got thinner.

541
00:46:23,066 --> 00:46:24,854
Housework must be tiring after all.

542
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,823
It's not. They're all good to me.

543
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:33,940
Why don't you call us? Do you not have time?

544
00:46:35,136 --> 00:46:38,308
It's because I'll miss you if I hear your voice.

545
00:46:39,652 --> 00:46:41,331
It's not like I can come here easily.

546
00:46:43,246 --> 00:46:46,979
We're all doing fine, so don't worry.

547
00:46:48,183 --> 00:46:50,698
- All right. - Let's sleep.

548
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:56,292
Goodness. This might be uncomfortable.

549
00:47:00,316 --> 00:47:01,940
Why are you coming in here?

550
00:47:02,183 --> 00:47:04,894
Huh? I'm going to sleep with you guys.

551
00:47:05,496 --> 00:47:09,479
You love your wealthy son-in-law so much that I'm afraid you'll forget about me.

552
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:12,644
I won't forget you, so go back up.

553
00:47:12,925 --> 00:47:19,831
Oh, come on. Let's chatter away and sweetly fall asleep together.

554
00:47:19,933 --> 00:47:24,487
We already talked sweetly so how could we fall asleep sweetly, too?

555
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,769
Oh, father!

556
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:29,362
Oh, my. Oh, my!

557
00:47:31,566 --> 00:47:35,003
- This is great! - What if Hyun-joon sleeps fitfully?

558
00:47:35,409 --> 00:47:37,331
Let's just sleep together. It will be fun.

559
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:38,511
Oh my goodness.

560
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:43,065
Try sleeping with him and see if it's any fun at all.

561
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:45,784
- Okay. - Oh my goodness!

562
00:47:46,582 --> 00:47:47,582
This is nice!

563
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:11,894
You woke up?

564
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:16,847
Father, I can't sleep in this room.

565
00:48:18,691 --> 00:48:20,120
You said it would be fun.

566
00:48:20,347 --> 00:48:26,487
How can he sleep so comfortably when other people can't sleep because of him?

567
00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:33,558
Father, I'll see you in the morning.

568
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,644
Are you going to sleep in the living room?

569
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:38,026
It's summer, so it should be fine.

570
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,933
Even if it's the middle of winter, I can't sleep in this room.

571
00:48:43,401 --> 00:48:45,550
- Good night. - Okay. Good night.

572
00:48:49,371 --> 00:48:54,824
Oh my goodness. That's enough snoring!

573
00:49:02,871 --> 00:49:04,331
Come eat lunch.

574
00:49:06,082 --> 00:49:11,089
Don't make the housekeeper clean the annex. You clean it yourself.

575
00:49:13,832 --> 00:49:19,089
She assumes I've been kicked out. The way she looks at me offends me.

576
00:49:19,605 --> 00:49:21,138
Clean it yourself then.

577
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,300
What?

578
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,175
Just do it. When did you become so high and mighty?

579
00:49:29,652 --> 00:49:32,925
I'm not keeping you here because there's no way to chase you out.

580
00:49:33,314 --> 00:49:36,120
Who? Me?

581
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:40,245
I'm thinking for Kyung-soo's sake.

582
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:48,168
Who are you to go easy on me? There's no need for you to do that.

583
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:50,979
Chase me out if you can.

584
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:59,065
If you don't, one day, you'll be chased out of here by me.

585
00:50:00,722 --> 00:50:05,003
Who do you think has the crucial evidence to bring Mr. Park under my control?

586
00:50:05,457 --> 00:50:07,589
So how dare you act up?

587
00:50:24,112 --> 00:50:27,761
Kyung-soo, I need a word with you.

588
00:50:35,847 --> 00:50:40,019
- Is this about the CCTV footage as well? - No.

589
00:50:41,619 --> 00:50:45,596
Did you come to the hospital on the day my grandmother-in-law woke up?

590
00:50:46,097 --> 00:50:48,456
No. Why would I go there?

591
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:54,690
Then didn't you lose your phone for a while on that day?

592
00:50:54,987 --> 00:50:57,925
Well, there's no one who really contacts me, so I just

593
00:50:58,363 --> 00:51:01,714
leave it on the living room table and forget about it.

594
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:11,862
 Did Ms. Yoo Ji-na send you a text message with my phone to call you out?

595
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,363
No.

596
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:26,651
I need to talk to you after you eat.

597
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:29,331
About what?

598
00:51:31,299 --> 00:51:34,261
Did you text Hae-dang that day with my phone to call her out?

599
00:51:36,324 --> 00:51:38,591
Then did you erase those messages?

600
00:51:39,746 --> 00:51:42,472
If you were me, would you just leave those messages?

601
00:51:42,792 --> 00:51:44,601
So, in the end, since I wouldn't listen to

602
00:51:44,626 --> 00:51:46,519
you, you stole my phone and did such a thing?

603
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:48,792
What do you mean I stole it?

604
00:51:50,113 --> 00:51:53,690
A mom just borrowed her son's phone because she needed it. You call that stealing?

605
00:51:56,261 --> 00:51:57,628
Your words are too harsh.

606
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,073
So in the end, you did attempt to do that.

607
00:52:02,066 --> 00:52:05,394
Mrs. Sung discharged from the hospital, so it's fine.

608
00:52:05,636 --> 00:52:08,753
You might do the same thing if something desperate like that happens again.

609
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:14,331
You dug out the evidence under the tree, didn't you?

610
00:52:15,957 --> 00:52:19,761
Last time, you asked me how to use a private safe at the bank.

611
00:52:20,058 --> 00:52:22,815
- How could I dig it up when I don't know which tree it was? - Then

612
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:26,026
what reason do you have to use a private safe at the bank?

613
00:52:26,152 --> 00:52:28,331
I didn't do it! I didn't!

614
00:53:01,628 --> 00:53:04,143
She sent the messages and put the cell-phone back

615
00:53:04,168 --> 00:53:06,480
right away, so Kyung-soo didn't know about it.

616
00:53:07,113 --> 00:53:08,581
She's a really frightening woman.

617
00:53:10,308 --> 00:53:14,354
To be honest, I'm worried about Kyung-soo.

618
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:19,343
If it's revealed that his mom had tried to do such a thing,

619
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,253
how difficult would it be to endure as a human?

620
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:27,597
Then for now, let's keep this between us.

621
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,698
I don't have much luggage anyways, so I didn't call for a moving service.

622
00:53:39,995 --> 00:53:41,917
You could just share things with us.

623
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:46,565
What did you bring the huge pot for?

624
00:53:47,128 --> 00:53:52,284
- I'm going to make beef bone soup. - For yourself?

625
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:55,144
Do you think I would eat it by myself?

626
00:53:55,988 --> 00:53:59,253
I could improve Mr. Jung's health.

627
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:04,854
You're going to share the kitchen anyways. They have a pot for beef bone soup.

628
00:54:05,347 --> 00:54:10,394
I need to make it in this pot in order for me to be energized.

629
00:54:18,285 --> 00:54:19,419
Goodness.

630
00:54:21,318 --> 00:54:25,037
Seeing this big pot, it makes me realize she has no kitchen skills.

631
00:54:25,998 --> 00:54:29,779
The big pot in my kitchen is all nice and shiny because I clean it up so much.

632
00:54:30,193 --> 00:54:34,005
See one and you've seen them all. It's so obvious.

633
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:35,951
Oh, it's heavy!

634
00:54:38,764 --> 00:54:42,568
Let's not just stand here. Let's help her carry her things, too.

635
00:54:42,685 --> 00:54:46,888
You will get to eat her beef bone soup from time to time. You must be happy.

636
00:54:47,131 --> 00:54:48,818
I love beef bone soup!

637
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:51,599
Must you drag that woman into this house?

638
00:54:52,334 --> 00:54:54,560
It was the kids' decision!

639
00:54:56,631 --> 00:54:59,021
- Just you wait and see. - Wait and see what?

640
00:55:05,685 --> 00:55:11,443
Stop being angry and surrender soon, Mrs. Baek Mi-sook.

641
00:55:17,771 --> 00:55:19,162
Reheat the soup.

642
00:55:19,426 --> 00:55:24,451
Hurry up and eat. I need time to clean up and prepare the family's meal.

643
00:55:24,685 --> 00:55:26,388
If I tell you to reheat it, reheat it.

644
00:55:32,755 --> 00:55:36,896
What do you think you're doing? You should bring the tray and put it on there.

645
00:55:37,107 --> 00:55:39,396
You're making me do all sorts of ridiculous things.

646
00:55:41,748 --> 00:55:43,005
Are you my mother-in-law?

647
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:48,482
If you want to eat it hot, you should reheat it yourself.

648
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:50,997
Eat it within ten minutes and go to the annex.

649
00:55:51,443 --> 00:55:53,318
 I need time to prepare the family's meal.

650
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:56,177
Aren't you going to get me a new bowl of soup?

651
00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:02,888
When your son becomes the owner, I'll gladly bring you soup then.

652
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,443
Happy?

653
00:56:06,248 --> 00:56:09,943
I'll rip out my own organs if my son doesn't become the owner.

654
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:14,451
You will? Are you that confident?

655
00:56:14,928 --> 00:56:20,544
Because Mr. Park will give up his two sons' lives in order to survive.

656
00:56:21,037 --> 00:56:24,326
You seem to know quite well about my father-in-law now.

657
00:56:26,404 --> 00:56:30,716
- Of course. - Then you should be careful more than ever.

658
00:56:31,717 --> 00:56:35,466
- Be careful? - You might be in danger.

659
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:40,443
- What? - My father-in-law isn't only frightening to his sons.

660
00:56:41,287 --> 00:56:44,615
Do you not know how my mother-in-law passed away?

661
00:56:46,467 --> 00:56:49,521
You've already lost his love.

662
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:55,005
On top of that, if you endanger his existence...

663
00:56:57,068 --> 00:56:59,335
you'll start to be in danger then.

664
00:57:00,693 --> 00:57:05,060
My father-in-law is more terrifying than you think he is.

665
00:57:06,263 --> 00:57:10,302
He already killed one person. There's no guarantee that he can't kill two.

666
00:57:11,568 --> 00:57:18,154
So it would be wise to refrain yourself and be cautious, Ms. Yoo Ji-na.

667
00:57:35,365 --> 00:57:36,958
What is it? I didn't even call for you.

668
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,576
Is Yoo Ji-na's real name Kim Hae-jung?

669
00:57:41,623 --> 00:57:42,623
Why?

670
00:57:42,648 --> 00:57:45,580
I sued Mr. Yoon because I suspected him of overstating the

671
00:57:45,605 --> 00:57:48,686
price with the subcontractor and embezzling the company money.

672
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:52,694
During the investigation, it was confirmed that a large amount of money

673
00:57:53,117 --> 00:57:55,849
had been deposited into his account by someone named Kim Hae-jung.

674
00:57:58,443 --> 00:57:59,443
Are you serious?

675
00:58:09,632 --> 00:58:11,365
Why are you home so early?

676
00:58:13,834 --> 00:58:16,022
Grandmother, I'm home. I'm coming into your room.

677
00:58:21,022 --> 00:58:22,412
Is that true?

678
00:58:22,756 --> 00:58:25,340
That large amount of money couldn't have been given to him just

679
00:58:25,365 --> 00:58:27,827
to keep his mouth shut about what had happened at the studio.

680
00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:32,076
Of course not! She must have ordered him to do something about me!

681
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:34,248
That disgusting thing.

682
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:40,233
I had my doubts, but she dared try to kill me that way, did she?

683
00:58:41,655 --> 00:58:43,506
That vile wench!

684
00:58:44,061 --> 00:58:46,006
Will Mr. Yoon confess?

685
00:58:52,632 --> 00:58:53,832
Tell me the truth.

686
00:58:56,162 --> 00:58:58,944
My mother is safe and I don't want to embarrass my family

687
00:58:59,483 --> 00:59:01,444
further, so I don't want things to get noisier.

688
00:59:02,757 --> 00:59:06,631
If you tell me the truth, I can just let this go.

689
00:59:11,038 --> 00:59:15,170
Or else, I will have no choice but to report this to the police.

690
00:59:16,663 --> 00:59:20,850
So tell me the truth!

691
00:59:24,491 --> 00:59:25,920
Please forgive me, sir!

692
00:59:36,038 --> 00:59:37,287
Hello, father.

693
00:59:38,592 --> 00:59:41,608
Go the annex and tell her to come here at once.

694
00:59:51,757 --> 00:59:55,537
Why did that large sum of money go to Mr. Yoon?

695
00:59:58,819 --> 01:00:01,225
Why are you bringing that up again?

696
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:06,483
He knew everything that happened at the studio.

697
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:10,717
I was trying to keep him silent about that.

698
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,014
You gave him that much money just to keep him silent?

699
01:00:19,085 --> 01:00:23,186
Mr. Yoon confessed everything. Are you thinking of continuing to play innocent?

700
01:00:28,483 --> 01:00:32,701
Were you a woman who was capable of doing such a thing?

701
01:00:34,342 --> 01:00:36,248
No matter what kind of situation you were in,

702
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:38,842
 how could you think of doing such a horrible thing?

703
01:00:40,295 --> 01:00:41,803
How far are you thinking of going?

704
01:00:43,397 --> 01:00:45,358
I asked you! How far did you think of going?

705
01:00:49,225 --> 01:00:51,184
I-I'm sorry...

706
01:00:56,350 --> 01:01:00,529
How could I keep a woman like you in this house?

707
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:07,708
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

708
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:11,350
I'm sick and tired of your apologies now!

709
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:19,092
However, your mother woke up safely.

710
01:01:20,288 --> 01:01:22,014
Do you think that makes any sense?

711
01:01:22,686 --> 01:01:26,826
I can't live in the same house as her! I'm too scared to live with her!

712
01:01:27,569 --> 01:01:30,225
Who knows what she'll do to me next so how could I live with her?

713
01:01:32,577 --> 01:01:35,631
Sung-hwan, you make yourself clear now.

714
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:39,740
If you need to keep her in this house because of Kyung-soo, tell me now!

715
01:01:40,108 --> 01:01:41,108
 I'll move out!

716
01:01:41,663 --> 01:01:43,178
These aren't just empty words!

717
01:01:43,538 --> 01:01:48,005
How could I live in the same house as someone who tried to kill me that way?

718
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:57,865
I won't do such a thing again. Back then, I did it because I was so desperate.

719
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:04,514
Please shut your mouth. Do you think all desperate humans think like you?

720
01:02:06,288 --> 01:02:10,045
Please forgive me just this once.

721
01:02:10,999 --> 01:02:12,412
I've already forgiven you enough.

722
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:19,540
Then are you telling me to move out of this house?

723
01:02:19,928 --> 01:02:25,217
Then were you thinking of living in the same house with my mother?

724
01:02:31,163 --> 01:02:32,230
I can't do that.

725
01:02:34,905 --> 01:02:37,975
I can never leave this house without my son.

726
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,147
How could I leave without my son?

727
01:02:43,866 --> 01:02:47,420
Now that you're cornered again, your voice changed.

728
01:02:48,647 --> 01:02:52,358
It hasn't even been ten minutes since you've asked for my forgiveness.

729
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:57,154
Let me make myself clear once more. I won't leave this house without my son.

730
01:02:57,335 --> 01:03:00,670
Are you saying you won't leave unless you're dragged out?

731
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,694
Are you going to drag me out?

732
01:03:05,904 --> 01:03:08,293
The crucial evidence pertaining to Choi Kyung-ae's

733
01:03:09,195 --> 01:03:11,561
death is in my son's private safe at his bank!

734
01:03:21,092 --> 01:03:22,092
So?

735
01:03:22,522 --> 01:03:24,115
It means I won't die alone.

736
01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:27,749
So?

737
01:03:28,342 --> 01:03:31,240
Why are you asking me? The decision is up to you.

738
01:03:31,482 --> 01:03:33,670
So are you saying you'll hand me over to the

739
01:03:34,407 --> 01:03:36,959
police as a murderer if I don't do as you say?

740
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:47,678
How could a woman like you exist in this world?

741
01:03:48,132 --> 01:03:51,959
You're not holding back my son because you love me anyways.

742
01:03:53,225 --> 01:03:55,932
- What? - What I mean is that you should serve me well

743
01:03:56,836 --> 01:03:59,740
if you're holding back my son for your own needs.

744
01:04:00,608 --> 01:04:01,912
You're done talking, aren't you?

745
01:04:03,858 --> 01:04:09,053
Kyung-soo, answer me. Do you really have the CCTV footage?

746
01:04:10,819 --> 01:04:13,740
I don't have such a thing.

747
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:18,647
- It's in your private safe at the bank! - I don't have such a thing.

748
01:04:19,475 --> 01:04:21,701
Lie. It's a lie!

749
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,225
Will you really be okay if I get kicked out of this house?

750
01:04:28,803 --> 01:04:29,803
Kyung-soo!

751
01:04:34,655 --> 01:04:36,788
How much time should I give you?

752
01:04:38,647 --> 01:04:43,279
How much time will it take for you to pack your things and get out of this house?

753
01:04:48,788 --> 01:04:49,988
I can never leave.

754
01:04:52,827 --> 01:04:53,827
You can't?

755
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:57,420
I'd rather die. I won't leave!

756
01:05:06,717 --> 01:05:07,717
Come inside.

757
01:05:16,452 --> 01:05:17,452
Drag her out.

758
01:05:19,108 --> 01:05:23,037
- Honey. - Drag her out to the front gate right this instant.

759
01:05:24,342 --> 01:05:29,022
Drag her out of here right now so she can never come near this house again!

760
01:05:33,217 --> 01:05:37,381
Honey! Honey! Let go! Let go of me! What are you doing?

761
01:05:37,858 --> 01:05:40,178
Kyung-soo! Kyung-soo, why aren't you saying anything?

762
01:05:40,553 --> 01:05:46,654
Kyung-soo, why are you just watching? Kyung-soo!

763
01:06:08,717 --> 01:06:11,154
("You Are Too Much")

764
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:15,532
My father-in-law has gone mad. You better not even breathe.

765
01:06:15,602 --> 01:06:17,311
I will definitely return.

766
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:21,162
Do you feel better if you say something before you go? Throw some salt.

767
01:06:21,187 --> 01:06:24,135
She went out on a program and humiliated our family!

768
01:06:24,264 --> 01:06:28,725
When I went and lived in that house, unimaginable things were happening.

769
01:06:28,975 --> 01:06:32,756
I want to break your brain and look what's in there.

770
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:35,834
- I told you I won't die alone, didn't I? - I'll leave this house as well.

771
01:06:36,022 --> 01:06:39,319
The moment you do, your mom will be in danger.

772
01:06:39,344 --> 01:06:42,404
You must have some affection towards my late mom.

773
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:45,256
Should I take you to the cliff you like so much?

774
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,980
