<i>[Episode 25]</i>

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,380
What brings you here?

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,570
I want to accept you as my son.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,750
Why are you being stubborn?

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,120
To be clear...

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,530
I have no intention of living as
a son to the woman who gave birth to me.

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,080
So, there's no reason
for me to be your son.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,090
Is this revenge?

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,240
No.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,530
Does that mean you don't plan on
forgiving her for abandoning you?

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,220
I don't.

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,860
So, do you plan on telling the world...

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:55,680
that you're Yoo Ji Na's son someday?

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,550
No.

16
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,980
If it's a no, then just live as my son.

17
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,980
You may not believe me, but I
will treat you like my flesh and blood.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,080
I want you to feel at ease...

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,220
so I came personally to tell you.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,260
Thank you for the offer, but
I don't think I can do that.

21
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,950
You must not like me.

22
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,680
It's not because of that.

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,040
Then why?

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,500
- That's not the reason.
- Then what is it?

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,890
I...

26
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,300
grew up with Madam Kyung Ae
caring for me and looking after me.

27
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:55,420
<i>Yoo Ji Na's son will definitely
make trouble for you.</i>

28
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,060
<i>It's about my later mother-in-law.</i>

29
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,460
Why is that a reason
to not become my son?

30
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:17,120
Because I think there was something
suspicious about Madam Kyung Ae's death.

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,320
Are you confident accepting
me as your son knowing that?

32
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,420
What do you mean by that?

33
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,770
I asked if you are confident.

34
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,250
You can accept me as your
son if you are confident.

35
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,380
I'll ask you again.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,820
Can you accept me as your son

37
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,220
confidently and unconditionally

38
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:50,190
knowing that I am suspicious
of Madam Choi Kyung Ae's death?

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,030
So you are suspicious
of my late wife's death.

40
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,150
I don't understand
what you're are saying.

41
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,630
Is that so?

42
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,860
In any case, what I'm curious about

43
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,780
is whether or not you will tell
the world you are Yoo Ji  Na's son.

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,660
I will ask you one last time.

45
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:24,610
Do you plan on telling people
you are Yoo Ji Na's son someday?

46
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,660
No.

47
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,410
I understand.

48
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,820
I'll take that as my
answer and get going now.

49
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,980
Something came up suddenly and I don't
think I can give you lessons any longer.

50
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,160
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,810
Why suddenly?

52
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,010
Oh well. Okay.

53
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,560
<i>Father has started
taking action for sure.</i>

54
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,180
Did you meet him?

55
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,310
Yes.

56
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,740
How was he?

57
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,430
He's much brighter than I expected.

58
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,200
Do you like him?

59
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,060
I'm also very thankful
that he grew up so well.

60
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,850
More than anything, I'm
so glad that you like him.

61
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,620
But he has no intention
of living as your son.

62
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,070
I don't think I need to worry if
I should accept him as our son.

63
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:31,110
Are you saying you won't accept him
as your son if he doesn't want it?

64
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,280
Do you think a young person's
heart will forgive so easily?

65
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,540
He says he won't tell
people that he is your son.

66
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,090
Is that right?

67
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,310
Then... let's get married legally.

68
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,750
You said we could get married
legally if he promised that.

69
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,450
Do you truly love me?

70
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,930
Why are you asking that now?

71
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,310
Did you have a change of heart
since he made that promise?

72
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,100
Do you truly love me?

73
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,820
What woman would go to such lengths
to marry a man she doesn't love?

74
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,470
Do me a favor.

75
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,190
If you just need me,
and you don't love me...

76
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:31,030
You... really need to leave now.

77
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,810
What?

78
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,670
Were you playing with
me this whole time?

79
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,140
Why would I play with you?

80
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,530
What is that supposed to mean?

81
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,740
What can I do for you to believe me?

82
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,280
What can I do to make you
believe that I love you?

83
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,240
What? What can I do?

84
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,580
Should I bite my tongue
and die on this spot?

85
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,510
What on earth is that supposed to mean?

86
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,640
<i>I'll ask you again.</i>

87
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,570
<i>Can you accept me as your son </i>

88
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,690
<i>confidently and
unconditionally</i>

89
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:35,420
<i>knowing that I am suspicious of
Madam Choi Kyung Ae's death?</i>

90
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:08,280
Fine, let's stop. Stop everything!

91
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,430
You cowardly man.

92
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,190
In the end, that's all you amounted to.

93
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,600
I was too much woman for you
too handle in the first place.

94
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,870
- Too much?
- Of course.

95
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:33,080
Why? People quiver with fear whenever
they hear about people like you.

96
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,680
Being arrogant and throwing money
in their faces portrays you perfectly!

97
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,650
That's enough.

98
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:45,230
I cooked for you and held my tongue
while your mother scolded me.

99
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,950
I went through all that trouble for you.

100
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,920
Did you feel it was that
unfair trying to get my love?

101
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,800
No! No!

102
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,340
What's really unfair...

103
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,250
is that I ended it with Park Hyun Joon
before I could lay a finger on him.

104
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,960
Sorry, but Park Hyun Joon is
100 times better than you.

105
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,790
I said that's enough.

106
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:15,310
Did you know that before you
took your son as your rival?

107
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,590
Fine... you're not
the only rich man in the world.

108
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,600
What?

109
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,330
If I have to seduce a wealthy man
who is 10 years younger than you

110
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,290
I, Yoo Ji Na, will become
the wife of a wealthy heir.

111
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,020
I'm going to spread
rumors at every gathering.

112
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,560
I said that's enough.

113
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,390
Park Sung Hwan appears to be
manly and act like he's very cool

114
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,140
but in reality,
he's a scaredy cat and mama's boy.

115
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,970
He's not man enough
to get a proper woman.

116
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,920
Are you confident enough to see
me show up as another man's woman?

117
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,290
You think I can't do it?

118
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,590
I, Yoo Ji Na, am not dead yet!

119
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,030
Leave tomorrow during the day.

120
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,560
I don't want to stay in this darn
house for another 10 minutes.

121
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,130
There's no reason for me to stay.

122
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,090
Where are you going to
go if you leave right now?

123
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,500
The reporters have gone quiet so it
doesn't matter if I go to a hotel.

124
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,360
Think carefully. The only person
who can handle you is Chairman Park.

125
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,910
He dumped me.

126
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,240
I cooked, cleaned, and
did all sorts of things.

127
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,920
How can I stay when I got dumped?

128
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,580
Where are you going at this hour?

129
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,720
Please relay this to
Madam Sung Kyung Ja.

130
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,230
I came to say a final farewell.

131
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,100
Grandmother, please come out.

132
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,960
What are you doing?

133
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,780
What's going on?

134
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,160
Thank you for all your trouble.

135
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,360
I'm not sure if I paid you all
back for it, but I'm leaving now.

136
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,990
Goodbye.

137
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,960
You too, Na Kyung.
Thank you for your trouble.

138
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,200
My manager will take care
of the rest of my baggage.

139
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,970
Just know that.

140
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,060
What's going on?
Is she really leaving?

141
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,860
Did you hear something?

142
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,730
No. I didn't hear anything.

143
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,320
Are you really going to leave like this?

144
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:31,090
Thank you for caring for
her all this time. Take care.

145
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,390
I never imagined this.
I wonder what happened.

146
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,030
I'm completely baffled.

147
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,250
She really left once
she made up her mind.

148
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,920
In any case, she left.

149
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,560
She left.

150
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,380
Just what did you tell
your father-in-law?

151
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:28,580
What did you tell him that he
would make such a drastic decision?

152
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:32,890
In any case, your wish came true.

153
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,870
Thank you for making my wish come true.

154
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,770
But just what did you find out?

155
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,330
It's much more serious
than I think, isn't it?

156
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,850
She really left?

157
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,040
This isn't how it's supposed to go.

158
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,550
What do you mean by that?

159
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,260
If this happens, Father will simply stew.

160
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,420
Nothing came out of this for me.

161
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,640
There's nothing to negotiate with Father

162
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,090
if he gave up so easily on that woman.

163
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,180
I got caught red-handed.

164
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,800
Be careful.

165
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,140
If you know too much,
it could be dangerous...

166
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,410
Father won't stand for it.

167
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:30,540
I never imagined that
you would be Yoo Ji Na's son.

168
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,390
It has nothing to do with us.

169
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,400
I have no intention of living
as mother and son, anyway.

170
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,650
That doesn't mean it will go your way.

171
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,860
You two are mother and son.

172
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,010
I'll make sure you
aren't bothered by it.

173
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,460
What's with the face?

174
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,320
What are you worried about?

175
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,230
I know you two don't
have a good relationship.

176
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,210
but that doesn't mean you
have to be anxious about it.

177
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,100
Wha...

178
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,770
Does that woman have a death wish?

179
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,510
How dare she insult our
sweet Hae Dang that way?

180
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,960
My dad has been down for several days

181
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,180
so I had to beg one of
his co-workers to tell me.

182
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,700
That woman...
where can I go to see her?

183
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,480
Should I go to the broadcast station?

184
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,540
Come on, she doesn't work these days.
She has no reason to go to the station.

185
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,980
I hope I run into her someday.

186
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,840
What's going on?

187
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,050
I can't believe you asked to see me.

188
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,280
I need you to say something
in front of Hae Dang.

189
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,600
Say what?

190
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,990
She's nervous that I'm your son.

191
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,280
And?

192
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:25,380
What do you want me to say to her?

193
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,950
"I have no right to interfere in
your wedding and I don't plan to."

194
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,530
"Don't worry about me."

195
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,930
- You need to say that to her.
- You're crazy.

196
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,150
That's right, I'm crazy.

197
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,200
- Crazy about Jung Hae Dang.
- Don't be ridiculous.

198
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,220
She's on here way now.
I asked her to come.

199
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,550
What?

200
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,660
What are you doing?

201
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,770
Come inside.

202
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,670
Sit here.

203
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,710
Please tell her what
we talked about earlier.

204
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,690
What did I say I would tell her?

205
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,350
"I have no right to interfere in
your wedding and I don't plan to."

206
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,910
Hurry up and tell her.

207
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,000
Jung Hae Dang.

208
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,170
Do you really need a my permission
for you to get your act together?

209
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,420
What the heck do you want
to hear from me right now?

210
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,600
Hurry up and tell her!

211
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,400
No! I won't!
I'd rather die than tell her!

212
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,760
If you can't tell her, then be
quiet and listen to me carefully.

213
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,250
I am going to marry this woman.

214
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,420
And I'm going to put everything
on the line and love her.

215
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,440
If there comes a time when
I have to die for her, I will.

216
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,950
Because that's how much I love her.

217
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,210
If you want to be involved in my life...

218
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:06,600
Tell her you will be
good to her from now on.

219
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,300
Now.

220
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,760
Jung Hae Dang.

221
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,550
Do you really have nothing to say?

222
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,870
Do you truly believe you
can become my son's woman

223
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,800
if you sit there and be silent?

224
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,530
Did you not understand
what I said to you?

225
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,460
No, I did not! Why?

226
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,570
She lived with a strange man for 10 years

227
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,990
as if they were a married couple!

228
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,360
What do you see in her?
Why do you treat her like a queen?

229
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,800
I don't care if she has 12 kids!

230
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,430
What?

231
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,210
Fine. Let's see how far this will go.

232
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,790
You should've told me ahead of time.
What was that?

233
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,950
I was afraid you would
avoid it if I told you.

234
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,370
I'm sure she knows how I feel now

235
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,910
since I told her clearly in front of you.

236
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,350
I told you to back off.
Why haven't you?

237
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,020
Do you think me just backing
off will solve the problem?

238
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,910
You and I lived with the same man.

239
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,850
But you want live as in-laws now?

240
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,690
You think you can? Do you want to?

241
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,550
I will back off when you live
as Kyung Soo's mother someday.

242
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,600
What?

243
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,190
You said it before

244
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,220
that you don't plan on living as
mother and son in this lifetime.

245
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,560
Isn't that why you tried to pretend you
didn't know him even when you found him?

246
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,750
I will leave when you tell
the whole world Kyung Soo is your son.

247
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,050
- What?
- But you won't be able to.

248
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,560
Why?

249
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,820
Because your life is more
important to you than your son is.

250
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,350
No. I'm going to live
the rest of my life for my son.

251
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,350
Don't say anything you
want when you know nothing.

252
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,630
Then why can't you proudly
tell people that he is your son?

253
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,700
Do you really not know how
insulting that is to Kyung Soo?

254
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,630
Your singing career has
ended and you're getting old.

255
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,500
You need your child, don't you?

256
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,780
You want to be called "Mom" don't you?

257
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,670
You need your child, but the name
Yoo Ji Na is more important, isn't it?

258
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,540
Even dogs whimper all night
if they can't see their pups.

259
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,990
You abandoned him when he
was blind and just a child.

260
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,720
You don't even amount to an ant.

261
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,100
You felt guilty making
a living off of me

262
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,630
so you gave up your man without a fight.

263
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:05,860
You sure have a lot to say
now that you have my son.

264
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,510
That's right, since you drove
my ex-boyfriend to his death.

265
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,100
Please give me your son even
if he is too good for me.

266
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,990
What?

267
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,600
You have the wrong idea.
I did not seduce him.

268
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,010
You will only look more pathetic
if you get more upset here.

269
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,610
- Jung Hae Dang?
- What? Do you feel it's unfair?

270
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,340
Since you drove my man to
his death, we'll call it even.

271
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,100
Don't say a word and watch, Yoo Ji Na.

272
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,590
What? Have you heard these words before?

273
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,380
You said all this to me before.

274
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,990
How does it feel to hear
the words "I didn't seduce him"?

275
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,160
Do you realize it now?

276
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,260
That it's not important who seduced whom?

277
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,560
I was already done for
as a woman back then.

278
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:11,280
So I was honored when your
son said he would die for me.

279
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,020
And right in front of your eyes at that!

280
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,720
What are you doing?

281
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,280
- Why did you slap her?
- Because she deserved it!

282
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,790
What? You really have lost your mind!

283
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,650
- Why you...
- Ms. Mi Sook!

284
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,800
Do you want to be humiliated
through the internet?

285
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,800
This family will be the first to be
effected if I am humiliated.

286
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,640
Who will want to see
Yoo Ji Na's impersonator

287
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,360
when they hate the real Yoo Ji Na?

288
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,820
Yes, thank you for being
our bread and butter!

289
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,460
Is it a crime making a living
by singing her butt off?

290
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,520
Even the cart bar lady says
we have a right.

291
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,320
So what if we lived off of your songs.

292
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,780
How dare you slap her in the face?

293
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,510
- You!
- Let's go!

294
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,450
- Let's go.
- I'd better not catch you again!

295
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:07,710
Isn't it enough that you stole her man?

296
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,660
She's trying to make a living.
Is that a crime?

297
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,980
Now you want to slap her? Huh?

298
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,260
Ah!

299
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,590
My goodness!

300
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,890
You!

301
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,990
Welcome home.

302
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,550
We need to talk.

303
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,470
Me?

304
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,360
Tell me the rest of what
we talked about last time.

305
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,930
Tell me everything you know
about Yoo Ji Na's son.

306
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,110
You have no intention of telling me?

307
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,900
This is your last chance.

308
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,380
I thought you understood
and knew your place.

309
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,940
Tell Hyun Sung to come down.

310
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,230
Hyun Sung?

311
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,390
What do you need to say?

312
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,800
Hyun Sung, listen
carefully to what I say.

313
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,780
Come and work at
the future strategic office.

314
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,980
There's no need to look at me. I have
no interest in the company anyway.

315
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,060
What are you talking about?

316
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,510
What do you think?

317
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,530
I asked what you are talking about?

318
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,220
What do you think?

319
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,310
What are you doing? Tell him you'll
work hard if he entrusts it to you.

320
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:55,020
I will do my best and not disappoint
you if you entrust it to me.

321
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,310
I have one condition.

322
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,070
- One condition?
- Divorce Na Kyung.

323
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:14,930
Are you going to take over
the company or divorce her?

324
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,840
The choice is one or the other.

325
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,670
Why didn't you listen to your elders?

326
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,760
This is killing two birds with one stone.

327
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:37,510
That monster left and now it seems
like you are about to get kicked out.

328
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:43,090
Goodness. You were reckless
to think you had the upper hand.

329
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,520
What are you going to do?

330
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,900
There is no way you
can win against Father.

331
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,750
So... what are you going to do?

332
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,100
You're really asking
that question right now?

333
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,850
Honey.

334
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,850
I have to take over the company.

335
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,590
I have to take over
the company as soon as possible.

336
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,180
For my sake, for my late
mother, and for this family.

337
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:27,030
Then... are you saying
you're going to give me up?

338
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,500
What would you do if you were me?

339
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,930
What would you do if you were me?

340
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,970
Lee Ji Na's son, Yi Kyung Soo...

341
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,280
is suspicious about
your late mother's death.

342
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,450
He even duped us and went
by the name Yoon Sung Ha.

343
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,510
He was able to see after surgery
but pretended he was still blind.

344
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,850
He hid his true identity.

345
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,220
He even dug around in our front
yard trying to find something.

346
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,020
And before your mother passed away

347
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,860
she gave a letter to a blind
man to relay to Hyun Joon.

348
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,810
A letter?

349
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,070
Without a doubt, that blind man
was probably Lee Kyung Soo.

350
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,860
What did the letter say?

351
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,970
But Hyun Joon says he lost the letter.

352
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,340
- He lost it?
- I think...

353
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:32,570
Lee Kyung Soo lied, since Father
and Yoo Ji Na are engaged.

354
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,840
How do you know it's a lie?

355
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,020
He read something in that letter

356
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,550
so don't you think he hid
it because he found a clue?

357
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,130
How much did you tell Father?

358
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:48,960
I just told him that Yoo Ji Na's son
will definitely make trouble for him.

359
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,890
And that it has to do with
my late mother-in-law.

360
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:57,460
It might mean that Father is the culprit.

361
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,200
Lee Kyung Soo said he can no longer
come and give private lessons.

362
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,300
Father heard us talking
and went to meet him.

363
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,920
Would he go see him
if he weren't guilty of anything?

364
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,180
I thought there was no way.

365
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,200
How could Father do that?

366
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,470
How?

367
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,180
What?

368
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,970
That woman slapped our Hae Dang?

369
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,440
That's why I was about
to rip her hair out

370
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,300
but Hae Dang stopped me from doing it.

371
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,170
Goodness.

372
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,560
How could that have happened?

373
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,250
How could she do that
to my precious daughter?

374
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,820
I told you not to tell him.

375
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,010
Why did you tell him that?

376
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,640
I ran into him.
How could I not say anything?

377
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,400
I understand that you made
a living off of singing her songs.

378
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,790
Even so, how could she
slap you in the face?

379
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:24,460
She came to my workplace and
humiliated us in front of my co-workers.

380
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,690
Was that not enough?

381
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:30,110
I'm sorry. This is all because of me.

382
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:35,090
The way I see it, she's just
taking her anger out on you.

383
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:43,450
I'd rather starve than
be treated like that.

384
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,790
Why did you ask to see me?

385
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:08,140
Ah, you have Yoo Ji Na's
phone number, right?

386
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,470
Yoo Ji Na?

387
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,010
- What for?
- I just need to see her.

388
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,990
What happened? What for?

389
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,840
I do have her number
but she's quite rude.

390
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,360
I'm worried that you
might be offended by her.

391
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,200
- Let's see her together.
- No, I have to go alone.

392
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,960
You're going to sell the house?

393
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,420
I need the money.

394
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,240
Then... what about the family...

395
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,910
We'll just have to rent a place
and live with what we have.

396
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,280
Go ahead and do whatever
you want if you need to.

397
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,620
Okay, thanks.

398
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,920
Mom, Mom, Mom! Hey, hey. Mom! Mom!

399
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,680
Mr. Jung listed the house for sale.

400
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,810
Huh? What? What are you talking about?

401
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,190
I heard it from
the neighborhood real estate woman.

402
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,660
What?

403
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:33,970
I tried to pick a comfortable place
to talk and this is the place I picked.

404
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,970
It doesn't matter.

405
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,250
What do you have to say?

406
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:43,430
I listed our house for sale.

407
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:51,670
I did it because I felt like
we owed you too much.

408
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,320
You're selling your house?

409
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,420
It's not much...

410
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,980
but it's everything we have.

411
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,960
You're going to sell the house
and give the money to me?

412
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:08,940
My child is nothing but a punching
bag to you whenever you get mad.

413
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,770
Isn't it because we
make a living off of you?

414
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,990
It is not because of that.

415
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,030
Then what are you blaming her for?

416
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,240
She should be thankful and listen me.

417
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,560
What has she been so disobedient about?

418
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,890
Tell her to break up with Lee Kyung Soo.

419
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,610
Why is that any of your business?

420
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,520
Don't ask for the reason.
Just tell her to break up with him.

421
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,610
You have no right to tell my daughter
to get married or not. What's it to you?

422
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:43,020
Just do as I say. Why do
you people talk so much?

423
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,230
That reason is ridiculous.

424
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,780
What kind of nonsense is this?

425
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,750
Granted, your songs
were our bread and butter

426
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,090
but is my daughter your slave?

427
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,670
Write down your account number here

428
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,370
and I will deposit the money
as soon as the house is sold.

429
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,910
And don't interfere in
my daughter's life again.

430
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,520
Lee Kyung Soo...

431
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,980
is my son.

432
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,190
What did you just say?

433
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,670
I know you're not rash person,
so I'm sure you won't tell anyone.

434
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,990
Did you just say that
Kyung Soo is your son?

435
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:45,750
As you know, I lived in the same
house as the man Hae Dang dated.

436
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,870
She knows that and she's
determined to marry my son.

437
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:57,930
From your perspective, what do you think?

438
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:05,910
Of course, my son does not know what
happened between me and Hae Dang.

439
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,260
She may be your daughter, but don't
you think that's brazen of her?

440
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,240
How could this have happened?

441
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,720
Did you go somewhere, Father?

442
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,560
Oh... yes.

443
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,030
But, what is wrong with your face?

444
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,560
Oh... I'm just a bit tired.

445
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,810
Come inside and have
a glass of juice before you go.

446
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:51,050
Ah, no.
I have some things to think about.

447
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,930
Ah, I see.

448
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,900
Is it true that
your house is listed for sale?

449
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,330
Yes.

450
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,230
Why all of a sudden?

451
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,470
Goodness.

452
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,800
Why are you suddenly selling the house?

453
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:28,000
No, I don't think that's
the way to take care of it.

454
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,890
Hae Dang, let's talk for a moment.

455
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,550
Right now?

456
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,470
Oh...

457
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:42,010
No, let's talk later.
I need to think first.

458
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,050
Congratulations on
taking over the company.

459
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,230
In any case, it's not like you
married Na Kyung out of love.

460
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,720
Aren't you going to divorce
her and take over the company?

461
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,130
I think Father did something
when Mom passed away.

462
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,630
I thought it was possible when
they said Father was with her.

463
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,270
But I had my doubts.

464
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,700
But?

465
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,900
I think Father did something.

466
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,430
I told you. It's without a doubt.

467
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,670
How could a human being do that?

468
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,120
Hyun Sung, have you thought about it?

469
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,810
I'm not going to divorce her.

470
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,440
Are you saying you're giving
up on the company then?

471
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,740
Are you playing with us?

472
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,790
"Should I give you the company?"
"Do you want it?"

473
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,210
Are you trying to provoke your children?

474
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,610
What do you mean?

475
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,390
How can you do that to
your children as a father?

476
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,020
Am I not human?

477
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:54,320
You and Grandmother forced me
to marry someone I didn't love.

478
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,960
Now you want me to break up with
her because you don't like her?

479
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,590
Did you think I would just
obey and say, "Yes, sir?"

480
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,060
What are your children to you?

481
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,320
Are you saying you don't want to?
Forget it then.

482
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,330
All you have to do is say no.
How dare you raise your voice?

483
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,770
What did you do to Mom?

484
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,220
What?

485
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:25,550
Were you trying to act like
a father to us after what happened?

486
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,410
You wife said something
to you, didn't she?

487
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,980
She told me everything what
she was supposed to tell you.

488
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,410
Why?

489
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,040
What did she say?

490
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,760
Tell me this instant.

491
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,620
Why are you so curious
if you're innocent?

492
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,640
I am Mom's son, too.

493
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,320
I'm not blinded
by greed for the company.

494
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,340
I won't dance to your tune,
Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

495
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,470
Chairman Park Sung Hwan?

496
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,170
It seems your youngest son won't
be calling you Father anymore.

497
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,060
Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

498
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,230
Say what?

499
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:13,160
Just go to the police
and turn yourself in.

500
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,880
I should I go to the police?

501
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,290
Do you want to be humiliated
in front of your sons?

502
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,170
That won't happen.

503
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,950
I told you nothing happened
between your mother and me.

504
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,320
Then why did Mom die?

505
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,740
I told you it was suicide! Suicide!

506
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:33,170
Is that really true?
Chairman Park Sung Hwan?

507
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,370
So, will you be going to work
at the future strategic office?

508
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,210
I told him I won't be doing that.

509
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:09,100
Why? Do you not want
to take over the company?

510
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,420
Why would I not want that?

511
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,460
I need to fix
Chairman Park Sung Hwan's bad habit

512
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:21,400
of playing with his children's lives.

513
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:28,000
Wait... did I hear something wrong?

514
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,100
Who is going to fix whose habit?

515
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,350
A child is going to fix a parent's habit?

516
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,510
What kind of nonsense is this?

517
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:41,690
Anything is possible with
Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

518
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,800
Why are you so surprised?

519
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:50,860
How dare you leave unexcused?

520
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:58,650
What? Now that the monster is gone,
are you on Father's side again?

521
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:01,070
Go ahead and do whatever you want.

522
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:05,670
You won't be able to bend your
grandsons to your will anymore.

523
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,200
Did you see that? Huh?

524
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,970
This all happened because
of that wench, Yoo Ji Na!

525
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:22,550
They don't respect you!
Look at you! Look at you!

526
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:25,630
Goodness.

527
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,320
Goodness.

528
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,960
Oh my goodness.

529
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:40,540
<i>I need to fix
Chairman Park Sung Hwan's bad habit</i>

530
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:45,650
<i>of playing with his children's lives.</i>

531
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,670
<i>It seems your youngest son
won't be calling you Father anymore.</i>

532
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,680
<i>Chairman Park Sung Hwan.</i>

533
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,730
You said you were suspicious of
my late wife's death, did you not?

534
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,270
Yes, I did.

535
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:43,170
You asked if I was confident accepting
you as my son knowing that fact.

536
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:46,320
Yes, that's right.

537
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,960
Then, please become my son.

538
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,290
Am I confident?

539
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,200
You can help me with that.

540
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,770
Excuse me?

541
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:06,640
You can help me to become confident.

542
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,010
What are you talking about?

543
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:16,960
No... I guess I should
make you want to help me.

544
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:26,830
I will make you
an offer you can't refuse.

545
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:29,000
I asked what you mean.

546
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,790
You will eventually...

547
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,060
- become my son.
- Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

548
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,640
I...

549
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,460
will make it happen.

550
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,700
Yes, Grandmother it's me.

551
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,490
I was wondering if I can
see you right now?

552
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,370
I told Hyun Joon to come home early.

553
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,400
The elders think the engagement
has been too long

554
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,380
and were wondering if we
can get married next month.

555
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,170
Sure.

556
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:32,470
Who gets married in
the summer these days?

557
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:36,440
It's not a hardship.
Let's go ahead and do it.

558
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,420
What do you think, Hyun Joon?

559
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,810
Why aren't you answering?

560
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:49,270
The other house is empty now
so do it while we have free time.

561
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:53,590
Who knows what crazy thing
might happen in the future.

562
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,010
Do whatever you want.

563
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,560
Why are you going up by yourself?

564
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:25,710
Are you frustrated thinking
that you're going to get married?

565
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,100
You look like a person
who has given up on life.

566
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,090
You should respect
my pride at the very least.

567
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:36,350
What was that look on your face?
And in front of your family at that.

568
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:38,460
I said I would marry you.

569
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,630
Since I said I would, I will!

570
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:43,800
So please leave me alone.

571
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,950
How did you find out?

572
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:00,380
You still want to marry
him after all that?

573
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,970
Kyung Soo and Yoo Ji Na will
never live as mother and son.

574
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,000
You call that a good reason?

575
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,760
Even so, do you think a parent
and child can be strangers?

576
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,000
I can't back away first.

577
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:15,580
He will dump you instantly
if he ever finds out

578
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,180
about what happened
between you and Yoo Ji Na.

579
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,460
Why haven't you thought about that?

580
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:27,310
Even if I might get dumped,
I can't be the one to leave him.

581
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:31,580
Are you saying you're going
to wait until you get dumped?

582
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,780
What kind of decision is that?

583
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,620
It doesn't matter when it happens.

584
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:46,050
Whether it's tomorrow,
one year later, five years later...

585
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:51,190
I want to love him until then.

586
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,040
Hae Dang.

587
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,980
I fooled myself into believing that
someone else's song belonged to me.

588
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,540
I fooled myself into believing

589
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,510
that someone else's popularity
was my popularity.

590
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,910
I lived off someone else's success.

591
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:09,210
And it felt like I was losing myself.

592
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:16,180
Even after my man was stolen from me,
I just turned away like a coward.

593
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:23,250
I probably liked him
more because he was blind.

594
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,120
Because I thought he
would never abandon me.

595
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:33,190
I thought he wouldn't have to see
how shabby and tacky I looked.

596
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,690
That's probably why I liked him more.

597
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:43,060
But even after he was able to see...

598
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:47,310
Even after he saw my shabby
and tacky appearance...

599
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,350
He loved me.

600
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:55,820
Who cares if he dumps me?
It's okay if he does.

601
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,940
Even if I get royally dumped,
it's all okay.

602
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,140
The memories of him just loving me...

603
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,530
I'm okay with it.

604
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,930
Goodness.

605
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:06,010
I guessed your size.
It fits you perfectly.

606
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:42,760
Hae Dang.

607
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,000
I was just about to go over for dinner.

608
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,960
Let's just eat by ourselves today.

609
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,780
- Let's make something yummy.
- Shall we?

610
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,180
Kyung Soo.

611
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:02,290
You know that I love you, right?

612
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,250
Of course.

613
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:11,210
If you find out later that I did
something very shameless...

614
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,070
Will you resent me then?

615
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,840
What kind of shameless thing?

616
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:22,160
To the point where you'll
think I'm a very weird woman.

617
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,640
I'm going to be shameless with you.

618
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:29,270
That way, I can take
all your insults for you.

619
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:40,210
What should we make? Should we
go and buy some groceries?

620
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:42,510
Let's just use what you
have in the refrigerator.

621
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,410
Is there anything in the refrigerator?

622
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,090
- What do you want to eat?
- Me?

623
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,370
I like everything you like.

624
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:04,870
<i>I can't shake the feeling
that our time together is short.</i>

625
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:23,070
<i>That's why every minute, every second
with him is precious and sweet.</i>

626
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,070
<i>Saying goodbye without
any time to prepare is sad.</i>

627
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:48,360
<i>But, slowly coming to terms with
having to part ways is much sadder.</i>

628
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,970
<i>I'm realizing it for the first time.</i>

629
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:19,420
<i>What will I remember about him
and what will he remember about me?</i>

630
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:27,880
<i>It's still painful and awkward
when it comes to breaking up.</i>

631
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,160
Father.

632
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,670
Hey. What's going on?

633
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,660
Did your meeting go well with Yoo Ji Na?

634
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,750
Yes.

635
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,320
I wondered if she said
anything to offend you again.

636
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,880
I came because I was worried.

637
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,910
Our Hae Dang... I feel so sorry for her.

638
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:11,170
Why?

639
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:16,710
Our Hae Dang... I don't think
she'll be able to marry Kyung Soo.

640
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,250
Excuse me?

641
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:30,580
Are you sure you
can keep this between us?

642
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,390
What is it about?

643
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,390
I don't know what it is
but I'll keep it to myself.

644
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,010
Kyung Soo...

645
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:43,660
is Yoo Ji Na's son.

646
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,520
There's no way. That's ridiculous.

647
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,690
I heard it from Yoo Ji Na herself.

648
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,990
Father.

649
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,830
Wait... how could that be?

650
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,400
By any chance...

651
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:05,950
do you know that Hae Dang's
ex-boyfriend died in a car accident?

652
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,910
Yes, I know.

653
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:13,180
I also know that Yoo Ji Na
stole her boyfriend.

654
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:18,160
So how can Hae Dang and Kyung Soo
live as man and wife?

655
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:27,110
Lee Kyung Soo doesn't
know that fact, right?

656
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:37,860
Even if Kyung Soo finds out
the truth and dumps her for it...

657
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:44,040
Hae Dang asked me to let her
love him until it happens.

658
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,030
That sentimental thing wouldn't have
said that unless she really loved him.

659
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:54,370
She likes him so much.

660
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,000
Goodness.

661
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,370
Why did this have to happen to her?

662
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:07,330
Goodness.

663
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,050
<i>The elders said our
engagement has been too long</i>

664
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:27,060
<i>and were wondering if we should
just get married next month?</i>

665
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,250
Is she still not here yet?

666
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,600
She should already be here.

667
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,620
<i>[Gwang Ja]</i>

668
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,990
<i>The number you have dialed
has been disconnected.</i>

669
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:04,180
<i>The number you have dialed
has been disconnected.</i>

670
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,400
You just let him leave?

671
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,030
It was a blow to my pride
and I didn't want to stop him.

672
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:19,960
Still, you should have stopped him.

673
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:24,430
Holding on to your pride is foolish
when your husband is cheating on you.

674
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:27,030
I don't know.
I just couldn't do it anymore.

675
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:29,780
Goodness. I swear I'm going to...

676
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,530
Why you...

677
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:36,140
You! Where have you been?

678
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:39,900
What does it matter? I'm here now.

679
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,970
Isn't it important that I came back?

680
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,420
Did you go to that cart bar wench?

681
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:46,740
I came back.

682
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,600
Isn't it important that I returned?

683
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,680
What...

684
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:56,530
What in the world is he saying?

685
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:58,510
Good night.

686
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,360
Hae Jin.

687
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:11,610
Do you feel like you can live now
since went and saw her face?

688
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:14,500
Did you go there because
you just had to see her?

689
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,660
What are you going to do if
you end up getting a divorce?

690
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:22,550
If you do, should I go and
grill fish next to that wench?

691
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:24,920
Just what are you going to do?

692
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,810
I'm not sure if Hae Jin will divorce me

693
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:33,590
but I don't think you'll be grilling
fish at the cart bar anytime soon.

694
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,240
Bong Soo.

695
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,760
What is this?

696
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,680
What is this?

697
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,160
Did you overdraw the account?
This came from the bank.

698
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,250
Oh this?

699
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,260
Did you make this withdrawal?

700
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,760
- Yes.
- What did you do with it?

701
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,780
I withdrew money.

702
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,720
I know that!

703
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,350
What did you use it for?
You spent 10 million won.

704
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:05,320
10 million won?

705
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,650
What did you use it for?

706
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,780
I spent it on...

707
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,130
Can I tell you tomorrow morning?

708
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:18,860
What? What is this man saying?

709
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,600
Bye. I'll see you tomorrow.

710
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:29,110
Mother, what did this man just say?

711
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,430
Where did you spend it?

712
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:38,650
I said I'll tell you tomorrow.

713
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:40,010
What?

714
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,190
<i>[Park Sung Hwan]</i>

715
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,300
<i>[Park Sung Hwan]</i>

716
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:01,870
Hello?

717
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,290
What do you want?

718
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,980
You must be troubled
about something else.

719
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:21,870
Since you came all the way here
to look out at the river.

720
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:26,880
Do you still want
to get married legally?

721
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,990
Will you do it if I want to?

722
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:37,970
Let's do it then.

723
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,300
Do you mean it?

724
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:49,840
It's no big deal. Let's do it.

725
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,000
Let's get married.

726
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:58,360
I knew it... you love me.

727
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:05,090
And from now on...
I plan on loving your son, too.

728
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:12,640
I now believe that you love me.

729
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,510
It wasn't a lie when you said

730
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,760
you wouldn't abandon me
no matter what the situation.

731
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,260
I love you.

732
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:36,590
I'm going to be really good to you now.

733
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:41,200
I'm going to love only you now.

734
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:45,800
I eventually made you love me...

735
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:51,650
and I'm going to make
your son love me as well.

736
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:54,890
Thank you.

737
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:58,830
I'm going to make it happen.

738
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:01,500
I know I can do it.

739
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,050
I can do it.

740
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,140
<i>I'll ask you again.</i>

741
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,810
Can you accept me as your son

742
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:30,910
confidently and unconditionally

743
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:38,440
knowing that I am suspicious
of Madam Choi Kyung Ae's death?

744
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:48,080
What did you think about
at the other house?

745
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:53,830
Didn't you tell all of us to gather
because you have something to say?

746
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:55,720
What do you have to say?

747
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:01,120
Yoo Ji Na and I got legally married.

748
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:07,570
What? You did what?

749
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:14,190
Since we got legally married, we have
to hold a wedding as soon as possible.

750
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,090
Just know that.

751
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:32,140
Did Grandmother pass out
for real this time?

752
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,010
- Grandmother.
- Grandmother.

753
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:37,130
Grandmother.

754
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,320
Mother.

755
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,620
Wake up. Mother. Mother.

756
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:48,760
Hey. Call the hospital. Call 911. 911.

757
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:55,420
Hurry. Mother. Mother, wake up.
Mother. Mother.

758
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,170
Mother.

759
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:59,570
Mother.
