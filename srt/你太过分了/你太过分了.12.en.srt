<i>[Episode 12]</i>

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,370
How is he still out
drinking at this hour?

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,300
It's already so late.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,430
Are you sleeping?

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,990
If you're not sleeping, I'm coming in.

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,680
What is it, Mother?

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,940
Your husband is still not home yet.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,800
He's probably running late.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,340
Give him a call.

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,700
He won't pick up at this hour
because he's probably drunk.

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,450
Are you not worried
that he's not home yet?

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,630
I hope he doesn't get
his wallet stolen again.

14
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,250
You're worrying about
his wallet right now?

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,280
It's a pain if you lose
your credit cards.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,000
Fine. Go to sleep.

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,370
She doesn't show a hint of concern.

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,200
Did something really happen to him?

19
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,410
Mother!

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,400
Who drinks so late?

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,940
Mother! My dear mother!

22
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,220
The smell of alcohol!

23
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,150
You can't stay here.
Go inside and go to sleep!

24
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,700
Where is my wife?

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,100
Where is my lovely Jung Hae Jin?

26
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,280
Honey! I'm home!

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,350
Your one and only
Yeon Bong Soo is here! Honey!

28
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,200
- Honey, where are you? Where are you?
- My goodness!

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,140
Honey! Honey, where are you...

30
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,840
My dear son! Daddy's home!

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,480
He's going to wake up. Get out.

32
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,180
Son, I said Daddy's home.

33
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,290
You think you can just continue to act
however you please? Get out.

34
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,500
- Why?
- Just come outside!

35
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,590
Seriously! You reek of alcohol!

36
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,360
What's with all the ruckus
in the middle of the night?

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,940
Seriously... Why?

38
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,130
- Mother.
- Whatever. Just go inside and sleep.

39
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,790
Mother. My dear mother...

40
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,370
Hello! My name is Yeon Bong Soo.

41
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,360
At your service.

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,740
"At your service?"

43
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,390
Our mother has aged so much.

44
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,860
You should be worried about yourself.

45
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,730
I'm doing just fine
so go inside and sleep.

46
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,720
When did our mother get so old?

47
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,060
When you came to my school,
I thought you were the prettiest person.

48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,590
When did I ever come visit your school?
What are you talking about?

49
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,480
After you fought with Father

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,940
you stopped by my school to see my face
because you were going to leave.

51
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,680
The day before, you two were
ready to fight until the end.

52
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,560
Then you came by my school the next day
and stared at me from outside the window.

53
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,450
I thought to myself, "Wow.
I think my mom is really leaving."

54
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,240
I was so scared.

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,980
Go inside and sleep.

56
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,260
You said this to me later.

57
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:45,760
"No matter what happens,
I need to stay with my kids."

58
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,730
And that's why you decided to come back.

59
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,480
I should have just left that day so
that I wouldn't have had to see all this.

60
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,270
Even when we had a father like him

61
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,880
thank you for not running away

62
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,700
and staying with us to take care of us.

63
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,700
I told myself so many times

64
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,550
that I was going to make
lots of money to give to you

65
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,260
when I became an adult!

66
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,390
Mother.

67
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,980
My poor mom... I'm sorry!

68
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,180
I'm sorry!

69
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,350
You were so happy when you
got the allowance envelope

70
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,920
but you had to give that up too...

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,310
Goodness.

72
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,380
Mother, I'm sorry! Mother...

73
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,850
And who is this?

74
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,630
It's my lovely wife! Jung Hae Jin!

75
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,580
Hello! Nice to meet you.

76
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,150
I'm Yeon Bong Soo. At your service.

77
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,190
I'm sorry that my face isn't that great

78
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,070
on top of the fact that I don't
make that much money.

79
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:20,120
You should've just left
me to fall off the roof!

80
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,100
Check if your phone and
wallet are in your pocket.

81
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,640
What?

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,570
That's all you have to say to me?

83
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,150
Yeah.

84
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,790
Father-in-law!

85
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,260
Father-in-law! I'm going
to my father-in-law.

86
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,570
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Where are you going?

87
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,290
- Do you know what time it is?
- I'm going!

88
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,930
I'm going to my father-in-law's house!

89
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,120
Bring a jacket for him or something.
He can't just go outside like that.

90
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,350
What's that noise?

91
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,770
<i>Father-in-law!</i>

92
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,370
That's Bong Soo's voice.

93
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,110
Open the door.

94
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,280
Let go!

95
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,180
Father-in-law!

96
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,550
My dear father-in-law!

97
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,310
Hello! I'm Yeon Bong Soo!

98
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,940
At your service.

99
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,410
If you're drunk, you should be in bed!

100
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,850
What are you doing in the middle
of the night? Go upstairs and sleep!

101
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,620
No!

102
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,540
I'm going to sleep next
to you from now on.

103
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,560
I'm scared. I'm so scared
that I can't sleep upstairs.

104
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,260
He's...

105
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,750
I told you to think about the middleman
and not to push him too far!

106
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,420
Why are you yelling
in the middle of the night?

107
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,250
My goodness.

108
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,230
It must have been so tough.

109
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,460
How can you study right now?

110
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,240
I thought I would plan for my
lecture since I'm already awake.

111
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,050
Not just anyone can be
ranked first in school.

112
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,150
"You can be a complete drunk
and I will go my own way."

113
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,410
How did those two date?

114
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,260
Will they be able
to survive until the end?

115
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,060
They say the sixth and seventh years
of marriage are the toughest.

116
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,050
You've seen everything that there is
to see and you wonder if this is it.

117
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,260
And you went and added fuel to that fire.

118
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,700
I wanted my son to give me the allowance
I couldn't have from my husband

119
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,250
and I wonder if I caused permanent
damage to their marriage because of that.

120
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,380
Why does such a young man snore so much?

121
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,900
How did Hae Jin sleep in the same
room with him this whole time?

122
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,310
How did it go?

123
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,270
Really? Okay!

124
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,250
Okay. Good work!

125
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:16,710
<i>I cried every night. Drunkenly holding
on to it, asking how I can live.</i>

126
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:23,200
<i>But what use is it to ask? There’s
only the typical answer, “Cheer up!”</i>

127
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,880
Come here! Come here!

128
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,160
- Your chance is finally here!
- What chance?

129
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,970
A broadcasting producer wants to see you!

130
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,590
A broadcasting producer?

131
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:46,890
He heard your CD and thought your
voice sounded exactly like Yoo Ji Na

132
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,970
so now he wants to see you
and hear you sing!

133
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,110
Impossible. Impossible! Impossible!

134
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,210
It was so hard to get this opportunity!

135
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,130
I think I'm just going
to live and die like this.

136
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,060
I'm supposed to impersonate Yoo Ji Na
on national TV for everyone to see?

137
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,810
You're acting like someone sobbing
at a funeral and then asking who died.

138
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,510
- What's gotten into you?
- I'm too nervous to do it.

139
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,720
It's not in front of drunk men,
but in front of sober people

140
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,930
who are looking straight at me.
How am I supposed to perform?

141
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,520
You can do it. No, you must!

142
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,670
I just want to make enough to eat.

143
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,170
I'm not starving myself right now anyway.

144
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,270
Look at me! Jung Hae Dang!

145
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,470
To be able to impersonate
another singer is a skill!

146
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,950
In Japan, there are plenty
of impersonator singers

147
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,930
who are more popular than the originals!

148
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,550
To be able to imitate someone is a skill,
not something to be embarrassed about.

149
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,820
If you become more
popular than Yoo Ji Na

150
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,940
you can live your life without
being so conscious of Yoo Ji Na!

151
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:01,700
All you have to do
is be loved as Yoo Jui Na!

152
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,620
That's not something I can do.

153
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,610
No, it is something you can do.

154
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,900
Then, I'll cause trouble for her.

155
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,620
She has already caused you
more than enough trouble.

156
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,060
Think about the words she said to you.

157
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,680
It's not her fault.

158
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,200
No. It is her fault.

159
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,460
She didn't seduce him!

160
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:28,250
Was it necessary for her
to say that to you?

161
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,880
Your pride as a woman
was destroyed that day.

162
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,740
You won't be able to love another man
as the person you are right now.

163
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,200
If a man approaches you,
you're going to step back.

164
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,690
If he steps back, you're going to
miss him and then it will be over.

165
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,430
It's not enough for her
to say she's sorry.

166
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,550
She has made you believe
that you can't live without her

167
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,550
so you don't even have
the right to be angry.

168
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,180
Did she not make you believe that

169
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,450
when she said, "Think of it
as a way of paying your debt?"

170
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,600
Yoo Jui Na can be Yoo Ji Na's shadow

171
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,810
but Jung Hae Dang can't live her
life under Yoo Ji Na's shadow!

172
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,850
Hyun Joon.

173
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,700
So, hang in there.

174
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,550
Muster all the strength that you can!

175
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,370
<i>You're going to pretend that
you're worried about me.</i>

176
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,550
<i>Are you going to fool yourself too?</i>

177
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,590
Your eyes shook from
the first time you saw me.

178
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:52,450
I saw everything. No?

179
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,840
What? Are you scared?

180
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,130
<i>You don't even know where to run.</i>

181
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,430
I am genuinely

182
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,550
worried about you.

183
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,240
It's related to my painful memory...

184
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,350
so even if you don't believe what
I'm saying, just believe me.

185
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,790
I wondered how your mother

186
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:05,830
must have felt to leave you here alone.

187
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,070
And I became fond of you because of that.

188
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,730
All the women in this world
can worry about me

189
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,160
except for you.

190
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,990
- Why not me?
- Because...

191
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,660
Chairman Park loves you
with all his heart.

192
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,450
The kind of love
that my mother desperately wanted

193
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,870
but was never able to have.

194
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,430
You're actually receiving
that kind of love

195
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,310
but you're playing hard to get.

196
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,620
How do you think I would feel if
a woman like you worries about me?

197
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,200
It would be

198
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,700
like a beggar receiving charity.

199
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,820
Even at your age, how do you
think only about yourself?

200
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,950
But you will...

201
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,980
come to me.

202
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,030
The reason why you're mad at me

203
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,270
isn't it because you're also afraid?

204
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,240
- What?
- "It's never going to happen."

205
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,390
"You can't get involved
with this person."

206
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,100
Aren't you the one

207
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,340
fooling yourself?

208
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,170
You are impossible.

209
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,930
<i>You won't be able to love another man
as the person you are right now.</i>

210
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,340
<i>If a man approaches you,
you're going to step back.</i>

211
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,020
<i>If he steps back, you're going
to miss him and then it will be over.</i>

212
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,450
<i>Other than the fact that I can see now,
nothing has changed. So, what's wrong?</i>

213
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,310
It's going to change. Starting now.

214
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,590
You're a scaredy cat.

215
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,650
Because you can see me now.

216
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,270
<i>It was such a relaxing experience.</i>

217
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,690
<i>I was able to share only
the things I wanted to share</i>

218
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:14,220
<i>and I could watch you
but you couldn't see me.</i>

219
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:26,540
My company worked hard to set up
this opportunity for me, but I'm scared

220
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,700
to show myself to the world.

221
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:35,660
Like how you were afraid
to show yourself to me?

222
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,850
It's probably because I've lived under
someone's shadow for so long.

223
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,570
You told me once

224
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:03,690
that this fellow will always be here
no matter when I come to visit.

225
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,560
That it will never leave.

226
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,850
You told me that when you
brought me here and I couldn't see.

227
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,620
I was full of the scent of the trees.

228
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,190
Up until that point

229
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:29,790
life for me was all about
enduring the quiet days

230
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:35,160
when time was slowly passing by
and nothing was happening.

231
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,610
Then, when I felt your love for me

232
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:46,460
I realized that I would
be willing to die for you.

233
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,520
There was never a day when
you didn't think about me?

234
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,760
I will be like a tree for you.

235
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,350
If you're ever sad or weary,
just come to me.

236
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:09,070
Just like how you loved me when
I couldn't see and couldn't do anything

237
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:15,650
I will love you even if
the world throws you away.

238
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,860
Kyung Soo.

239
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,750
So, you have nothing to be afraid of.

240
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,510
Someone who is the recipient of true love

241
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,900
has nothing to fear.

242
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,210
<i>Yoo Jui Na can be Yoo Ji Na's shadow</i>

243
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:03,000
<i>but Jung Hae Dang can't live her
life under Yoo Ji Na's shadow!</i>

244
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:14,080
<i>Tears again even when I’m in love.
Goodbye to those nothing memories.</i>

245
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,050
<i>I’ll forget them all.</i>

246
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:24,180
<i>It was such a useless connection.
I have never been happy before.</i>

247
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:32,540
<i>I cried every night. Drunkenly holding
on to it, asking how I can live.</i>

248
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:39,280
<i>But what use is it to ask? There’s
only the typical answer, “Cheer up!”</i>

249
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,360
<i>So, hang in there.</i>

250
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,420
<i>Muster all the strength that you can!</i>

251
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:16,070
<i>Tears again even when I’m in love.
Goodbye to those nothing memories.</i>

252
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,280
I pulled an all-nighter again.

253
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,850
We're eating bean sprout
soup again for breakfast?

254
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,710
Our house has so much bad air

255
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,300
that we need to have some
traditional bean sprout soup.

256
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:46,130
I brought this water from a spring
early this morning with the utmost care.

257
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,660
Let's see... Where should I put this?

258
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,060
Everyone stand up. Everyone stand up!

259
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,960
Bow with the utmost sincerity.

260
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,210
Is this because of Hae Dang's
broadcasting audition?

261
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,400
Didn't you hear me say to bow?

262
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
I didn't even wash my face.

263
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,180
Then, get out. It'll bring bad luck.

264
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,780
Bow.

265
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,160
I beg you. I beg you.

266
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,460
Mythical one, please open doors for her.

267
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,020
Dad, where do you find
mythical gods these days?

268
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,900
In my heart, of course.

269
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,250
An earnest request will be answered.

270
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,940
Please.

271
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,530
Hey! You're seriously begging
because he said to?

272
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,030
Be quiet! It's bad luck!

273
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,660
I...

274
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,090
Take these.

275
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,320
I wonder if you'll like them or not.

276
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,400
Do you like this color?

277
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,750
What color is it?

278
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,400
I don't wear unusual colors.

279
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,130
I don't like standing out from
the crowd for no reason.

280
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,520
I... I just

281
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,900
bought it thinking it
would look good on you.

282
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,800
Have I ended up hurting
your feelings instead?

283
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,970
No. Thank you.

284
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,370
From now on, I'll have to work on
thinking from your perspective.

285
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,160
The fabric feels nice.

286
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,280
They would be nice to wear
during this time of year.

287
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,990
Is there a place I can change?

288
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,700
You don't have to.
You can wear them next time.

289
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,770
I want to wear them now so you can see.

290
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,580
Is that okay?

291
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,170
To be honest, I do want
to see you wearing them.

292
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,790
- How do I look?
- You look so nice!

293
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,920
They fit you so well.

294
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,470
They fit you so well that I feel bad
that I'm the only one seeing them.

295
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:27,600
Were you thinking about me
when you were buying these?

296
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,860
Of course.

297
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:35,890
Is this color or that color going to look
good on him? Is he going to like it?

298
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,950
Is he going to feel burdened by my gift?

299
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,350
I was excited and nervous.

300
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,900
Where are you going dressed so nicely?

301
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,760
I have a girlfriend.

302
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,940
Really?

303
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,740
That's great!

304
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,890
Wear these when you see your girlfriend.
I think the response will be good.

305
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,580
Okay.

306
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,510
Why are you being so good to me?

307
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,640
Whenever people start treating me kindly

308
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,850
I have a habit of asking them
why they are treating me so kindly.

309
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,500
Is it because they feel sorry for me?

310
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,780
Why is that person being so good to me?

311
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,850
What kind of person is your girlfriend?

312
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,280
She's a very kind person.

313
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,500
Tell me about your girlfriend.

314
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,130
Let's sit over there.

315
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,610
I don't really like it
when people grab me.

316
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,010
If I need help, I will hold on to you.

317
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,580
Okay.

318
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,620
Is your girlfriend pretty?

319
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,790
How would I know?

320
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,860
I imagine that she is pretty.

321
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,010
What's important is
how kind her heart is.

322
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,390
Her heart is very kind.

323
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,570
How kind is her heart?

324
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:25,760
She sacrifices her life
every day for her sisters.

325
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,750
She really is a kind person.

326
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,200
It's hard to find people
like her these days.

327
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,110
- You're right.
- There are some people

328
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:42,240
who abandon their child
to live their own lives.

329
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,510
- You didn't have to come out.
- See you.

330
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,360
I'll see you again next time.

331
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
Bye.

332
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,520
Excuse me.

333
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:36,660
If I want to buy something else for you

334
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,510
can I buy it?

335
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,540
Go downstairs and tell them to eat lunch.

336
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,190
He said they're not eating and
told us to go ahead and eat.

337
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,660
Why?

338
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,410
- He's fasting and praying.
- Fasting and praying?

339
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,070
Hae Dang has an audition tomorrow.

340
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,120
He shouldn't be the one
fasting and praying.

341
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,340
What are you doing?

342
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,780
I am praying.

343
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,360
We made hand-torn noodle soup.
Do it after you eat.

344
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,390
I will skip all daily meals,
resist all bodily pleasures

345
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,550
and purify my soul.

346
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,470
I'm having a conversation with God.

347
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,460
You're fasting and praying
in front a bowl of water?

348
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,000
You do it with what you have as
long as you do it wholeheartedly.

349
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,720
If you faint, that might just
worry and confuse Hae Dang.

350
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,000
I believe that only God has the answers.

351
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,580
I'm laying down my life
and begging God.

352
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,870
I don't think your life is at risk
because you skipped a couple of meals

353
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,320
but I heard that you were praying
to the mythical gods the other day.

354
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,620
Something about that didn't
feel global, so I changed it.

355
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,470
- Global?
- Why are you talking to me? I'm praying!

356
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,670
You scared me!

357
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,440
The hand-torn noodles will bloat
and won't taste good.

358
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,830
Hurry up and go eat!

359
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,400
When I think about how much
Hae Dang suffered this whole time

360
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,900
you don't think I can skip a few meals?

361
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,170
I wouldn't have any regrets
even if I starved to death.

362
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,700
I'm trying to show my utmost sincerity.

363
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,720
Then, should I pray with
you before I go?

364
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,000
As someone who also
lives off of her work?

365
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,920
- That would be nice.
- Okay.

366
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,430
If one more person prays,
I'm sure it'll be for the better.

367
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,300
I beg you, I beg you,
oh gods of heaven and earth.

368
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:05,710
I pray for my kind lady, Jung Hae Dang!

369
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:10,390
Please bring her good luck...

370
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,270
Bring her good luck and...

371
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,850
- Gosh.
- Bring...

372
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,150
Bring her luck?

373
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:22,590
Wow! You need some creativity to pray.

374
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,950
It's hard to do when you're trying
to do it spontaneously.

375
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,980
That's because it's not
coming from the heart.

376
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,580
Again.

377
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,490
I beg you, I beg you,
oh gods of heaven and earth.

378
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,060
It's not the gods of heaven and earth!

379
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,160
Why do I keep saying that?

380
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,340
Just go upstairs!
You're going to bring bad luck.

381
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,850
No one understands me.

382
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:52,000
I pray... for our dear Hae Dang.

383
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,820
- Amen. Oh Lord...
- My goodness.

384
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,970
You're going to start
speaking in tongues!

385
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,130
Parents all feel the same.

386
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,800
I'm sure when we're sincere it
reaches the heavens somewhere.

387
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,540
Whether it is the gods or God,
someone will hear it.

388
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,410
I really hope things go well.

389
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,240
Yeah.

390
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,920
This is really refreshing.

391
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,820
Did you prepare all
your outfits and stuff?

392
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,930
Why aren't you talking?

393
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,010
Are you nervous?

394
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,410
Thanks for giving me this opportunity.

395
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,690
Regardless of what the result is,
I don't think I'll have any regrets.

396
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,020
Okay. That's all I need to hear.

397
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,570
Hae Dang, what are you doing
here at a broadcasting station?

398
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,860
She came here for work.

399
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,080
You think she came here for fun?

400
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,490
Let's go.

401
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,650
The mood here feels familiar.

402
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,880
Let's go. No need to be nervous.

403
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:32,320
<i>I’m left alone on this road again.
I am sitting here staring blankly.</i>

404
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:39,910
<i>For what reason exactly
am I selling myself for laughter?</i>

405
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:47,640
<i>I can’t see the end of the road
that escapes the darkness.</i>

406
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:56,640
<i>I thought I would be
okay if this were love.</i>

407
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:03,120
<i>Tears again even when I’m in love.
Goodbye to those nothing memories.</i>

408
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,680
<i>I’ll forget them all.
It was such a useless connection.</i>

409
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,930
<i>I have never been happy before.</i>

410
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,550
Go.

411
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,080
<i>There’s only the typical
answer, “Cheer up!”</i>

412
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,430
It's like I was watching
a younger Yoo Ji Na.

413
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:54,180
I can feel the power and sexiness
of when she was at her prime.

414
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,590
You don't even hear Yoo Ji Na's
voice these days.

415
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,820
Thank you.

416
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,110
Good job. I'll give you a call later.

417
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,740
Okay.

418
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:17,910
My head is all over the place.
I have no idea how I managed to do it.

419
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:22,480
I could see your hands
shaking from the very beginning.

420
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,460
I was shaking too.

421
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,880
I guess this is what it
means to be a manager.

422
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,300
I was so nervous that it
was even hard to stand.

423
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,600
I was doing everything I could
to keep going until I was finished.

424
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,670
Good job. Good job.

425
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,610
You think... they'll call?

426
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,620
Of course! Didn't you see their reaction?

427
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,950
You did really well today.

428
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,450
Let's go.

429
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,310
By the look on your face,
I'm guessing you did well.

430
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,050
- You're going to be on TV?
- No.

431
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,710
Why not? You said you did well.

432
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,660
I don't know the results yet

433
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,930
but what it's important
is that I didn't give up

434
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,100
even though I was scared to death.

435
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,680
Didn't I do a good job
for that reason alone?

436
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,990
You're right. You did do a good job.

437
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,060
The important thing is that you finished

438
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,960
so don't worry about the results.

439
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,180
I'm starving.

440
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,250
Then, let's go out.

441
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,690
- A date.
- A date?

442
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,530
I'll buy you something
delicious as a treat.

443
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:12,390
We always meet at the cafe
because I run the place.

444
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,320
You're right.

445
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,360
But where can we go?

446
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,040
Let's go to a place that
a lot of young people go to.

447
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,670
I've never been before.

448
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,640
Let's just go to a small
neighborhood Chinese restaurant

449
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,630
and have spicy seafood noodle soup.

450
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,920
Why do you like spicy seafood
noodle soup so much?

451
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,930
I think we're the oldest people here.

452
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:45,420
- Not me.
- Not cool.

453
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,270
You think people are staring at me?

454
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,980
Why would they stare at you?

455
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,590
I feel awkward thinking
that people are watching me.

456
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:59,530
When I couldn't see, I always thought
that people were staring at me.

457
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,490
And you said I was a scaredy cat.

458
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,920
Since we're already here,
let's not get discouraged.

459
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,620
Let's walk over to there.

460
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,370
Okay.

461
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,130
What if they think I'm your sister?

462
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,450
Don't worry about it.

463
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,170
As long as we have fun with each other.

464
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,430
- You're right.
- Let's go!

465
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,630
So cool!

466
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,500
Is it good?

467
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,210
It's good.

468
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,170
You've got something here.

469
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,950
It's a mirror.

470
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,130
Hae Dang!

471
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,700
What are you doing here, Hae Dang?

472
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,990
- You two are identical!
- Kyung Soo.

473
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,570
My turn.

474
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,740
- You did it!
- Yay!

475
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,910
- I won!
- Give us the prettiest one!

476
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,580
<i>[Fortune teller]</i>

477
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,190
Cheers!

478
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,550
So refreshing!

479
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,110
Walking around and
having fun is a lot of work.

480
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,900
It's really your first time too?

481
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,800
I never came here with
the other person I was dating.

482
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,330
- Why not?
- We were too busy with our schedule

483
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:47,090
but we also thought coming here
would make our youth seem pitiful.

484
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,410
How was it today?

485
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,680
I don't know if it's
because it was my first time

486
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,530
but even the not so cool things
were fun and interesting.

487
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,250
- Me too.
- Are we acting too old-fashioned?

488
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,950
Are... Are we?

489
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
- Cheers!
- One shot!

490
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,970
You've been cast in a show
where impersonator singers

491
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,580
and the original singer appear together.

492
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,140
- Really?
- It's a very popular program these days.

493
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,130
I believe most well-known singers
have participated in it.

494
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,280
Is that why Jung Hae Dang
was here for an audition?

495
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,460
It'll be good for you to join as a way
to help and mentor Jung Hae Dang too.

496
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:33,750
- Tell them I'm not doing it.
- I already told them you would.

497
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,750
- What?
- I thought you would say yes for sure.

498
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:41,910
You were trying to sign a contract
with Jung Hae Dang to help her.

499
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,710
If you don't participate, her TV
appearance will be cancelled.

500
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,810
Tell them I'm not participating.

501
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:54,320
If I go back and forth on my word with
the producers, it makes my job harder.

502
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,570
Yes.

503
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,130
They were going crazy saying
that the young Yoo Ji Na was back.

504
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,570
The young Yoo Ji Na?

505
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,430
So I'm old?

506
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,850
They said they felt
the power and sexiness

507
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,260
that you had when you were younger.

508
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,510
And?

509
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,620
I think it would be best
if you don't hear the rest.

510
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,750
What else?

511
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,500
They said your voice
isn't as strong these days.

512
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,940
That's why I told you to drink less.

513
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,310
Her father used to run a tofu store
until it went bankrupt.

514
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,430
He died from alcohol poisoning

515
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,160
and left his family with all
that debt. They couldn't pay it off

516
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,050
so the rest of the family fled
in the middle of the night.

517
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,540
In the middle of the night?

518
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,320
They did not tell anyone
where they were going

519
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,970
so none of the neighbors
know what happened to them.

520
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,130
I guess that's true.

521
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:20,970
She must have other family members
other than her father.

522
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,320
She had a mother and an older brother

523
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,940
and her older brother had a child.

524
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,680
- I see.
- It's not clear if this is true

525
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,290
but someone informed me that he heard

526
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,640
that her mother passed away
soon after they fled.

527
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,850
Why? Was she sick?

528
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,850
It is not clear.

529
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,210
And about a year ago...

530
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,360
this photo was posted online.

531
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,770
<i>[Who is the boy pictured in
pop singer Yoo Ji Na's locket?]</i>

532
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,300
Who is this child?

533
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,560
I asked neighbors from her hometown

534
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,730
and they said it looked like
her older brother's child.

535
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,660
Then, he must be her nephew.

536
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,000
It happened 22 years ago

537
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,340
so there are not many people left
who remember what had happened.

538
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,580
But according an elder from her hometown

539
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,420
Ji Na's sister-in-law
struggled with infertility

540
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,060
and they never saw her with a belly.

541
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,190
Then did she adopt?

542
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:34,250
Since they are from the countryside,
they could have felt uncomfortable

543
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,290
sharing adoption information.

544
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,560
So, she must be keeping a photo

545
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:45,670
of her brother's adopted
child in her necklace.

546
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,360
She could have grown
fond of him over time.

547
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,180
That's true too.

548
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,150
I will look into it further.

549
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,500
- Good work.
- Yes.

550
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,360
I told my family you had
a fever and no appetite

551
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,790
and they sent over some pickled pears.

552
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,580
I know you like them
mixed with sesame oil.

553
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:33,860
They're just slices of pears.

554
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,100
What good will eating salty food do me?

555
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,150
My goodness.

556
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:43,080
Myungjin Group's CEO's wife was bragging

557
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,520
about how much she has been enjoying
her time with her great grandchildren.

558
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:52,040
A house feels like a real house
when you hear children running around.

559
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,720
You have no news for us still?

560
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,390
Is everything going
to work if you just wait?

561
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:01,860
Don't you think you
should try to find a solution?

562
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,420
What do you mean?

563
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:09,510
Everyone here, do whatever it takes
to give me a great grandchild.

564
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,720
That's the only way I can die in peace.

565
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,430
<i>Whatever it takes?</i>

566
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:19,980
<i>Who at this table
wants you to die comfortably?</i>

567
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,560
This is so salty! Hey, get rid of this.

568
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:30,410
If you join another family, the first
thing you should do is bear a son.

569
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:34,180
You're not even from
a middle-class family.

570
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,020
Mother, we can have
this conversation later...

571
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,570
What are you so worried about?
If it doesn't work out, you can adopt.

572
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,760
Do what?

573
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,000
After everything we did
to build this company

574
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,390
you want to give it to someone
who's not even a blood relative?

575
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,580
Our family bloodline is not
an honorable one worth saving anyway.

576
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,610
You should think about adoption.

577
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,620
Absolutely not.

578
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,490
Oh really?

579
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:05,060
My sister-in-law also struggled
to have a child, but she never adopted.

580
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,980
Then, do you not have a nephew?

581
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,220
No. I don't have a nephew.

582
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,120
<i>[Who is the boy pictured in
pop singer Yoo Ji Na's locket?]</i>

583
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,810
You said that I would run away from you

584
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,680
as soon as I found out
everything about you.

585
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,990
Are you slightly worried that there is
a story you might want to run away from?

586
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:54,890
Did you say that I couldn't handle you?

587
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,010
You already have one foot out
the door because you're scared.

588
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:07,690
What was it like to be rejected
by Hyun Joon when you visited his office?

589
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:11,290
Infuriating.

590
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,380
It infuriated you?

591
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,940
What are you going to do now?

592
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,860
I don't know... What should I do?

593
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,990
I'm more careless than I look.

594
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:29,420
I don't live my life by planning
and worrying about what I should do.

595
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,090
That's not me.

596
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,510
Because you're crazy to the core.

597
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,470
Hyun Joon

598
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:47,940
is sick and tired of me, so he
despises morally flawed women.

599
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,800
That sounds peculiar.

600
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,080
Are you trying to say that
because I'm morally flawed

601
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,440
it's useless to go anywhere near him?

602
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,280
That's not what I meant.

603
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,520
How did I suddenly become

604
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,280
a morally flawed woman
in Chairman Park's eyes?

605
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:13,130
I just said that's not what I meant.

606
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,460
Your face right now

607
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,420
looks like the face of a conflicted
man who can't leave his wife

608
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,700
who cheated on him,
but can't embrace her either.

609
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,860
Is that so?

610
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:33,360
You can't leave the wife who cheated
on you because you still love her

611
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,190
but it doesn't feel
right to love her again.

612
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,840
Your face looks like you chewed on a bug.

613
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,240
In any case...

614
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,880
Is it because Park Hyun Joon
is always the first person I look for?

615
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,850
It's because I trust him.

616
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:54,570
It's a pride issue.

617
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:59,740
The chance of anything happening
between you two is zero percent.

618
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,620
I'm up against zero percent.

619
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,890
Trust is the mother of deceit.

620
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,070
I have something to say.

621
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:37,180
I'm grateful that you are worried
about us having children

622
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:40,660
but please discuss it with me privately.

623
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,230
I feel very uncomfortable
talking about that in front my husband.

624
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,990
- Uncomfortable?
- Yes.

625
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:51,310
Why? Are you worried he
might have other ideas?

626
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:55,680
I mean... It's not
that I don't trust him.

627
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,700
- Then what?
- It's the one thing we don't have.

628
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,400
It offends you, so I shouldn't do it?

629
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,640
You're telling me that you want me
to consider your feelings before I speak?

630
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,580
I want to remain a good
granddaughter-in-law to you.

631
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,010
And?

632
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:19,000
May I say something to you?
You helped me join this family.

633
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,490
The company will be passed
down to Hyun Sung in the end.

634
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:26,020
What are your plans
for the future that you

635
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,350
continue to treat me
like a kitchen worker?

636
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:32,870
You think quickly... but it's shallow.

637
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:36,410
What makes you so confident
and makes you trust people so easily?

638
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:39,050
With no sense of shame...

639
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:42,320
You trusted your father
and then he turned his back on you.

640
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,220
Now you're trusting your husband?

641
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,460
You still have a long way to go.

642
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:54,310
I may still look like I have
a long way to go in your eyes

643
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,510
but...

644
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:00,780
do you still see me as a newlywed wife?

645
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:06,740
I can do pretty much all
the things that you can do.

646
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:11,030
I am not just a kitchen maid.
I am implying many other things.

647
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,980
What would you like to eat for dinner?

648
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,130
Please let me know once you
know what you would like to eat.

649
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:24,670
We're going to have a guest.
Prepare simple Korean dishes.

650
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:26,890
You didn't say anything about a guest.

651
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,350
Why all of a sudden...

652
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:32,910
I was trying to decide
if I should invite the guest or not.

653
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:35,080
Based on your actions,
I'm going to invite her.

654
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,140
I think you have to see it
for you to understand.

655
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:41,680
Father is eating dinner out
today as well.

656
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,910
Who is coming all of a sudden?

657
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,760
<i>Grandmother, we're here.</i>

658
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,700
Hello.

659
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,190
Welcome.

660
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,180
Welcome, Yoo Jin.

661
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:13,170
I just called and told Hyun Sung
to come home early.

662
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,000
Hyun Sung doesn't know that I'm here?

663
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,540
I wanted it to be a surprise,
so I didn't tell him.

664
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:23,990
Think about how happy
he will be to see you!

665
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,960
You two didn't get to talk
that much at the party

666
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,370
because there were so many people there.

667
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:32,840
Chairman Park also
said he was running late.

668
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,800
Let's have a good meal
and a good conversation.

669
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,880
Make sure you prepare the meal right away

670
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,430
so that we can eat as soon
as Hyun Sung gets here.

671
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:44,870
Yes.

672
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:49,120
If you understand, then why aren't you
headed to the kitchen right now?

673
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,160
Yoon Hee... I mean sister-in-law.
Let me see you for a minute.

674
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,750
- How could you do this?
- What?

675
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:07,810
How could you bring her into this house?

676
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,490
How could I bring her?
Grandmother brought her.

677
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:14,050
Sister-in-law! Didn't you
decide to be on my side?

678
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,920
Of course I'm on your side.

679
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,850
Then, you should've done something
to stop this from happening!

680
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:25,270
l'm not as quick on my feet as you are.

681
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:29,270
- Are you really going to be like this?
- How could I refuse Grandmother's order?

682
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,090
I'm still scared of Grandmother.

683
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:38,810
You're the one confronting her head-on.

684
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,150
You should've at least told
me that she was coming.

685
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:44,790
I don't even have decent makeup on,
and I put my hair up carelessly.

686
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:47,580
It's fine. You're pretty.

687
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,700
So this is how you're going to act?

688
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,520
What?

689
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,850
You just got home? We have a guest.

690
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:07,420
Who is it that Grandmother wanted me
to come home as soon as possible?

691
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,580
How have you been, Hyun Sung?

692
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,110
Why are you just
standing there staring at her?

693
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:19,220
Hurry up. Go upstairs and change.

694
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,300
I didn't have a lot of time
to prepare the meal.

695
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,440
Thank you.

696
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,170
Why are you sitting down?

697
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,910
Prepare the desserts, so we can
eat them right after the meal.

698
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,740
Yes.

699
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,660
Let's eat!

700
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,950
Okay.

701
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:58,360
How come you haven't been seeing anyone?

702
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,800
I haven't met the right person yet.

703
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,650
It's true that two people's fate
is really determined by the heavens.

704
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:09,480
No matter how many times you
try to separate two lovers

705
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,850
those who are fated to be with
each other will end up together.

706
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:14,850
Look at Princess Diana.

707
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:19,030
After all that ruckus, she
eventually died in a car crash.

708
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,530
And who is her husband married to now?

709
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,980
That's how life works.

710
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,900
- Why aren't you talking?
- I'm eating.

711
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,950
You two haven't seen each other in
a while, so catch up about old times.

712
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:37,410
Hey, for dessert,
bring out a wine for them

713
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:40,640
so that they can comfortably
talk about the good old times.

714
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,770
Why aren't you answering?

715
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,130
Will do.

716
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:51,120
Go ahead and eat.

717
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:04,100
Come here. Come here.

718
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:08,930
I got a call from the broadcasting
station to get ready because you're in!

719
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,900
- Really?
- You're finally going to be on TV!

720
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,330
Oh my gosh!

721
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:22,900
You finally did it.

722
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:28,970
Hurray! Hae Dang did it!

723
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:31,350
Hurrah! Hurrah!

724
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,160
Hurray for Korean Independence!

725
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,790
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

726
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:37,510
Why are you mentioning
Korean Independence?

727
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:40,000
Hurrah! Hurrah!

728
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:43,640
Hooray for Hae Dang!

729
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,160
I knew she would be
able to do it! I knew it!

730
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:52,570
This is all thanks to your prayers!
Your face is so skinny!

731
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:55,940
I can't believe our Hae Dang
is going to be on TV!

732
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,800
God, thank you! Mythical gods, thank you!

733
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,310
The gods of heaven and earth too!

734
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,790
Thank you gods of heaven and earth!

735
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:08,920
I will live the rest of my life doing
only good deeds! I'll live a kind life!

736
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,970
How can you live a more
kind life than you already are?

737
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:16,760
I feel like this heavy weight
was just lifted off my chest!

738
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,370
- Everyone, hooray!
- Hurrah!

739
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,140
- Hooray! Hooray! Hooray
- Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

740
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,590
Hurrah!

741
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:40,220
Kyung Soo, I'm going to be on TV!

742
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,410
Congratulations!

743
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:56,020
During the audition,
I kept telling myself

744
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:59,740
it's okay if I don't make it.
I can run back to Kyung Soo.

745
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:03,580
It's okay if I make a fool of myself.
I can run back to Kyung Soo.

746
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:09,170
I kept thinking about that and didn't
give up even though I was very nervous.

747
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:13,160
Good job. I knew you would do a good job.

748
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,000
Kyung Soo.

749
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:27,920
<i>Tears again even when I’m in love.
Goodbye to those nothing memories.</i>

750
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,560
<i>I'll forget them all.
It was such a useless connection.</i>

751
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,510
<i>I have never been...</i>

752
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:35,220
Hae Dang.

753
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:39,580
For that part, can't you do it like this?

754
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:44,760
Twist your body like this...
like this. Very sexy.

755
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,460
Very sexy.

756
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:51,370
This looks weird.
This probably won't work, right?

757
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,190
- We have a problem.
- What?

758
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,530
Jung Hae Dang's appearance
has been canceled.

759
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,620
What? Why?

760
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,890
Was Yoo Ji Na's section canceled?

761
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:03,620
- No. It's not that.
- Then what?

762
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:08,230
The people at the audition
loved her and went crazy.

763
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,640
If Yoo Ji Na's section in
the show wasn't canceled

764
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,700
why was Hae Dang's appearance canceled?

765
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:17,080
- Right...
- You didn't even ask them why?

766
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,400
And you want to work for
a management company?

767
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,830
I looked into it. I talked
to the program crew

768
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:28,130
and it turns out Yoo Ji Na asked

769
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:31,240
that Jung Hae Dang
be removed from the program.

770
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:36,340
- Why?
- The producers don't know either.

771
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:39,580
She said that she would not
participate if Hae Dang was in.

772
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:45,420
I believe the producers had no
choice but to listen to her request.

773
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,310
I'm going to go change.

774
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,580
Yoo Ji Na, that woman...

775
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:14,010
She's not a stranger,
so I told her to wait inside.

776
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,410
- Welcome.
- I will wait in the room next door.

777
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:24,010
Change your clothes and let's talk.

778
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:43,140
- Have a seat.
- Why...

779
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:45,030
don't you want to participate with me?

780
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:49,110
Are you already famous enough
to ask me such a question so boldly?

781
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,940
After just signing a contract
with a company?

782
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:56,460
I asked you why you don't
want to be participate with me.

783
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,660
To be honest,
I find it very uncomfortable

784
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,850
to be around you these days.

785
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:04,060
Uncomfortable like a piece of
meat stuck between my teeth.

786
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,920
You once said this to me.

787
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,550
"Let's do our best
not to cross paths again."

788
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,340
If you don't want to cross paths with me

789
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:18,730
then you step back this time.

790
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:24,630
I told you that I won't hold back
if you interfere in my life again!

791
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:26,370
Are you done talking?

792
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:31,230
Your TV appearance opportunity can
disappear at my request anytime.

793
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,730
Do you know why?

794
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:37,780
Because you impersonate me.

795
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,320
Who's telling whom to step back?

796
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,210
Weren't you the one who wanted to help me

797
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:48,810
and tried to sign a contract with
the same company in the first place?

798
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:51,360
All you have to do

799
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,080
is take the help that I give you.

800
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,640
Only the help I give you.

801
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:04,090
I have another appointment
to go to, so...

802
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:05,890
Did you...

803
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,680
fall in love with someone again?

804
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:20,600
Did you find something
that you want again?

805
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,100
I guess that means that you will
do whatever it takes to get it.

806
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:29,300
What are you trying to say?

807
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:33,770
I'm trying to say that you
are someone who is willing

808
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:41,620
to abandon your own child
to get the things you want.

809
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,370
Yoo Ji Na.
