00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:07,503
(Episode 36)

2
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:11,953
Since I won't be able to marry
Hyun-joon anyways, should I

3
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:15,430
tell Kyung-soo to give up the
letter and run away with me?

4
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:19,586
- Don't kid yourself.
- Let's ask him if I'm kidding or not.

5
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:22,476
Fine. Let's do it then.

6
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:31,632
We should ask my son who
he'll choose between us.

7
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:37,820
The look in your eyes is shaking right now.

8
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:55,802
What are you two doing?

9
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:02,615
Kyung-soo, I won't be able
to marry Hyun-joon anymore.

10
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:07,437
What is it this time?

11
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:12,406
Give that letter to Hyun-joon
and leave this house with me.

12
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:22,929
If you give that letter to her, my life is
over. Will you be okay if I end my life?

13
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:27,861
- Are you really going to end it?
- Of course.

14
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,570
Okay then.

15
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:32,210
What do you mean by that?

16
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:37,281
- That means that's your choice.
- What?

17
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:41,562
Where are you going?

18
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:45,273
To get the letter.

19
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:01,468
Will you be happy if I die?

20
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:05,171
Do you think I'd be happy?

21
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:07,375
However, if you must die
because you can't live

22
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,087
as the wife of a CEO, then that's too bad.

23
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:10,148
You're really...

24
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:13,603
Do you think the rest of the women
in this world who aren't wives

25
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:16,586
of CEOs live tiring lives because
they're no better than you?

26
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:20,156
What kind of ridiculous complaints
are you making right now?

27
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:23,382
- Kyung-soo.
- Hae-dang's younger sister died, too.

28
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:28,265
She did nothing wrong, and she
had more days to live than you.

29
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,531
What is so great about your life that
you keep saying you're going to die?

30
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:34,044
Kyung-soo, you...!

31
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:37,750
Hae-dang, if that's what you
decided, let's do that then.

32
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,914
Are you really my child?

33
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:43,876
How nice would it be if I wasn't?

34
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:48,731
If you know I can't give up the letter
because you say you can't live without

35
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:52,555
being the wife of a CEO, why can't you
accept Hae-dang as your daughter-in-law?

36
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:57,041
Even someone like you became Mr.
Park's wife, so why

37
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:00,219
can't you stand Hae-dang
becoming Hyun-joon's wife?

38
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,697
"Someone like you?"

39
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,973
How can you compare me with her?

40
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,609
Of course I can't.

41
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,929
How could I compare a woman
who had abandoned her own son

42
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:13,563
to Hae-dang who had sacrificed
herself for her sisters?

43
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:18,124
I'm Yoo Ji-na! The Yoo Ji-na who
was once loved by everyone!

44
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:23,800
How dare you compare me to Yoo G-na who
had made a living from imitating me!

45
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:25,939
How dare you compare me to her?

46
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:31,047
Why do you think the people
stopped loving you overnight?

47
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,917
It's because you abandoned
me when I was blind.

48
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:38,002
Try living a day with your eyes closed.

49
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:43,031
How dare you talk about your successes as
a singer when I suffered all those years!

50
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:49,892
The one who wanted to get revenge
against you is me, not Hae-dang!

51
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:55,378
So, thanks to you, my life as a
singer ended. Because of you!

52
00:03:55,992 --> 00:04:01,609
So now I should end your life as a
CEO's wife... with my own hands.

53
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:05,742
No! No!

54
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,328
I told you I would endure it.

55
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:13,082
I told you I would endure it if that would
solve everything! I am enduring it!

56
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,531
So how dare you talk high and mighty!

57
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,343
Why can't you accept Hae-dang
as your daughter-in-law?

58
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:22,442
Let me ask you just one time.

59
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:26,601
Are you really unable to accept
her as your daughter-in-law?

60
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:31,744
Are you unable to see her
becoming Hyun-joon's wife?

61
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:37,828
Mr. Park rejected her. He said he can't
have a daughter-in-law like her.

62
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:47,585
Number one: You convince Mr. Park to allow
Hae-dang and Hyun-joon to get married.

63
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:54,512
Number two: I give the letter to
Hyun-joon and run away with Hae-dang.

64
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,101
Oh. Or maybe it's number three.

65
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:03,849
You won't be able to live as
a CEO's wife once the letter

66
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:07,149
gets into his hand, so you'll
end your own petty life.

67
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,380
Hurry up and choose!

68
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:15,984
You're not even my child. I can't believe
I had considered you as my child.

69
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:21,898
The reason why I'm willing to play Mr.
Park's puppet is to save you and Hae-dang.

70
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:25,375
However, if I have to choose either
of you, my choice is always her.

71
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:28,171
Do you even call that a question?

72
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:32,408
So go back in right now
and persuade Mr. Park.

73
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:35,789
Go back inside and persuade him!

74
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:00,203
Is there anything else
you're curious about?

75
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:07,156
Don't be ridiculous. I can never accept
you as my daughter-in-law, even if I die.

76
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:12,031
Do whatever you want. The
choice is yours anyways.

77
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,656
Kyung-soo, I'm sorry...

78
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,335
and thank you.

79
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:03,250
That idiot.

80
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:13,937
Fine. Let's take this to the end and see
if you'll really see me end my own life.

81
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:24,007
At least we got rid of Hae-dang.

82
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:28,546
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.

83
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:33,304
If he becomes ruined because of this, how
heartbreaking will it be to see him?

84
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:37,552
No one puts up with this because they
enjoy seeing their siblings suffer.

85
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,023
However, the fight for inheritance
is between siblings, not strangers.

86
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:51,218
Since Hae-dang is cleanly taken care of,
we just have to take care of Ji-na now.

87
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:56,062
Did you tell your family?

88
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:02,851
- Not yet.
- Don't tell them. I'm going to marry you no matter what.

89
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:08,421
This isn't a situation where only Ji-na
is against us. Your father is against us.

90
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:14,257
- It doesn't matter.
- You might end up losing everything.

91
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,585
I'm just going to marry Hae-dang.

92
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:25,538
Didn't you hear him say he's
going to transfer his shares?

93
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:27,896
I don't have much interest in shares.

94
00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:30,000
Do you think that's all that matters?

95
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:34,851
Are you going to allow a stranger
to become the greatest shareholder?

96
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:38,490
How can we break off our
wedding at this point?

97
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,183
Now you realize how petty Mr.
Park Sung-hwan is, don't you?

98
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:49,015
- He always brings up those darn shares.
- I know.

99
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:55,090
I knew he was shameless, but I
didn't know he was petty, too.

100
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:57,343
I know he's my son, but he's gone too far.

101
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:00,459
What are you looking at?

102
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:04,226
Are you asking me why I
raised my son that way?

103
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:07,000
You go ahead and raise your
own kid well in the future.

104
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:11,765
Still, I'm glad that I have you on my side.

105
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,617
I'm repenting because my
death is approaching.

106
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:20,113
Your father said he has many days left to
live so he doesn't want to repent yet.

107
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,570
He said that?

108
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:25,214
At least he's honest.

109
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:28,489
- There's only one way.
- And what is that?

110
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:34,976
Bear with life until your father
grows old and wants to repent.

111
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:37,171
He might live longer than I do.

112
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,468
How can you say that in front of me?

113
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:43,210
- You're living longer than mom did.
- You little brat.

114
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:46,312
- My kind mom.
- I know.

115
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,030
I want to invite all the
women who are abusing

116
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:52,477
their daughters-in-law and lecture them.

117
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:55,030
I would tell them to bully
their daughters-in-law

118
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:56,617
if they want to ruin their sons' lives.

119
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:04,993
How can you already ask
for summer vacation?

120
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:07,735
If I ask for one later, do you think
we'll be able to go anywhere?

121
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,352
It's hot, and I'm annoyed.
I don't feel like working.

122
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:13,898
I thought I would feel better if I took a
break. That's why I took time off early.

123
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:17,742
Okay. By the way, that lady called.

124
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:21,179
- Seriously?
- My dad is thinking if he should see her or not.

125
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,664
Why would he think?

126
00:10:25,914 --> 00:10:27,453
I don't care whether he goes or not.

127
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:30,403
You were going berserk
accusing her of being a shaman

128
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:32,537
and saying she's going
to dance on blades soon.

129
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:36,738
- When did I go berserk?
- Try being honest.

130
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:38,718
How could I get more honest than this?

131
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,539
If you change your mind after
everything has progressed,

132
00:10:42,563 --> 00:10:44,913
you're just going to give
everyone a headache.

133
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,164
I'm not going to chance my mind!

134
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,180
- You're not going to see her?
- Why would I see her two or three times?

135
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,369
Then why did you give her your number?

136
00:10:56,773 --> 00:10:58,820
She asked for it to my face,
so how could I refuse?

137
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:03,015
- Then why did you go out on the blind date?
- Because you forced me to!

138
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:06,257
- You should take responsibility!
- What should I take responsibility for?

139
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,514
I didn't do anything to take
responsibility for! Goodness!

140
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:14,710
Then how will I be able to
face that lady at work now?

141
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:16,398
That's your problem.

142
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:20,710
I might really shave my
head and enter the temple!

143
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:25,078
You can't become a monk because
you love food too much.

144
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:29,586
Are you saying I'm crazy about food?

145
00:11:29,797 --> 00:11:33,446
You're the one who had an affair while
getting free snacks at the tented vendor.

146
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:36,138
Do you really think I got into
an affair because of snacks?

147
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:41,845
Did you even have an affair? You
ate a few fish and lost $10,000!

148
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,137
So you should live a pure life and
not go after the wrong woman!

149
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:49,855
Who am I going after?

150
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:53,431
She called to ask you out, so why
aren't you going to see her?

151
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:54,770
That's up to me.

152
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,759
You said she was so-so.

153
00:11:56,994 --> 00:12:00,335
I thought she was, but
people kept saying she has

154
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:03,698
an unpleasant appearance,
so that seems true, too.

155
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:07,575
Are you being picky about appearances now?

156
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:09,582
Then what else would I be picky about?
Appearance

157
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:11,142
is the most important thing at my age.

158
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:13,848
Should I be picky about whether
she has long or short limbs?

159
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:19,634
- Limbs?
- Now that I think about it, her neck is too thick and short.

160
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:21,579
Father!

161
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:28,228
A woman is considered beautiful if
she has a long and slender neck.

162
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:32,165
Like who? Like my mom?

163
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,813
Why are you putting words into my mouth?

164
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:40,173
If you're being picky about necks, how
will you be able to get remarried?

165
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,446
Why are you so desperate
to get me remarried?

166
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:47,469
He doesn't many any sense!
He's being ridiculous!

167
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:49,384
Hey. So what is Mr. Jung going to do?

168
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:51,149
He's not going.

169
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,065
He's not?

170
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:56,431
He said he doesn't like her
because she has a thick neck!

171
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,485
My goodness. He's being picky.

172
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,188
- Geez!
- Aren't you going to eat?

173
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:06,001
- I'm not going to eat.
- Huh? Did I hear you wrong?

174
00:13:06,298 --> 00:13:10,096
I'm going to go on a hunger
strike until he goes to meet her!

175
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,503
You need to think carefully
before you speak.

176
00:13:12,853 --> 00:13:14,869
Do you think anyone can
go on a hunger strike?

177
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:18,440
I'll just keep my mouth shut and starve!
It's not hard! I'm not going to eat!

178
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:25,747
Don't mind him. He can't go
half a day without food.

179
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,423
- Kyung-soo, make some time on Friday.
- For what?

180
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:41,158
It's Uwang Group's foundation party. It's
about time you meet the board members.

181
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,251
- Do you mean that?
- Prepare a suit for him.

182
00:13:47,923 --> 00:13:53,024
Of course I will. I'll make sure to dress
him well so that he brightens the party.

183
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:57,289
Will granddaughters of conglomerate
families be there, too?

184
00:13:57,313 --> 00:14:01,378
Yes. I'm sure they'll come. It is a party.

185
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:06,063
Anyone's granddaughter will take one
look at Kyung-soo and fall for him.

186
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:10,587
You're going to take him there? Are
you trying to embarrass our family?

187
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:12,353
Why would he embarrass the family?

188
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:16,009
The entire world knows you
abandoned your blind son.

189
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:20,255
Are you trying to make him into a
spectacle to show people that's him?

190
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:24,056
What's so important about the past?
It's enough that he grew up well now.

191
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:28,946
Kyung-soo, don't go there.
When people see you, they'll

192
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,470
think of your mother.
You'll become a spectacle.

193
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,524
I've already made my decision.

194
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:41,829
Are you going to go or not?
Why aren't you answering me?

195
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:48,122
I'm going to follow Mr. Park's decision.

196
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:51,173
You're going to follow whose decision?

197
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,798
I told you that you shouldn't
do what I tell you not to do!

198
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:58,274
- Why are you yelling at him?
- I'll excuse myself first.

199
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:09,962
He's my son now. Of course
I must take him with me.

200
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,841
Kyung-soo has a favorable impression,
so people will like him.

201
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,947
He'll become your proud son.

202
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:27,368
Of course he will be. I'm
going to make him that way.

203
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,681
Thank you, honey.

204
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:38,829
How dare you get up without a word?

205
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:42,916
So disrespectful.

206
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:54,220
What do you think you're doing?

207
00:15:54,642 --> 00:16:00,017
Don't you ever speak a word to
me at the table from now on.

208
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,665
Did you see that? Did you see
what he did to me just now?

209
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:08,603
Starting from tomorrow,
don't join us at the table.

210
00:16:10,298 --> 00:16:15,063
- You're going to take Kyung-soo where?
- What's it to you who I take where?

211
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,392
- I can never let that happen.
- You have no right to decide that.

212
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,030
Why doesn't he have the right?
He's the eldest son

213
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:27,212
of this family, so why
doesn't he have the right?

214
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:33,676
Of course he doesn't because I'm the
one who can give him that right.

215
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:55,712
Of course you must be angry.
That's the only thing you can do.

216
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:02,017
- Go ahead and keep losing that awful temper of yours.
- Stop him when I'm being nice.

217
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:04,792
Are you crazy? Why would I stop him?

218
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,696
Who should I stop him for? You?

219
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,235
- Why should I stop him when I fear nothing?
- Shut your damn mouth.

220
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,423
He won't even let you near the company,

221
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,689
but he's going to introduce
my son to the board members.

222
00:17:20,713 --> 00:17:22,110
Don't you know what that means?

223
00:17:23,212 --> 00:17:26,149
- Do you really not know?
- I told you to shut your mouth!

224
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,626
- Then call me mother.
- What?

225
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:35,274
Say, "I'm sorry for being
arrogant all this time."

226
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:41,165
Say, "I'll serve you as my mother from
now on." Beg me on your hands and knees!

227
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:47,360
Who do you think you're glaring at?

228
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,219
I dare you to glare at him again!
I dare you!

229
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:54,337
What? "Beg me on your hands and knees?"

230
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:59,688
How dare you talk to him that way!
Do you want to die in my hands?

231
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:06,517
- Did you just hit me?
- Yes, I did. What are you going to do about it?

232
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,419
Unless you don't want to
rot in a small room with

233
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:11,731
your weak grandsons for
the rest of your life,

234
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:16,688
you should get the hint of
who you have to please.

235
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:22,360
Please you? Are you telling me to
flatter a vulgar creature like you?

236
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:29,125
Yes. Is there a law that says only people
younger than you must do all the flattering?

237
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,375
The weaker one must do it.

238
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:36,204
Sung-hwan! Sung-hwan, come out here!

239
00:18:37,673 --> 00:18:39,837
Sung-hwan! Sung-hwan!

240
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:46,017
Sung-hwan, she told me to flatter her.

241
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:48,315
She told me to flatter her unless I want to

242
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:50,228
rot in a small room for
the rest of my life!

243
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,954
What do you think about that?
What do you think about that?

244
00:18:53,986 --> 00:19:00,110
She hit me twice! She
hit me on both cheeks!

245
00:19:01,822 --> 00:19:02,889
Are you serious?

246
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:09,954
Take it easy! Who in the world slaps the
cheeks of their daughters-in-law nowadays?

247
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,812
What? Are you done talking?

248
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,563
She's my wife! She's the
lady of this household!

249
00:19:17,962 --> 00:19:20,532
How could you slap her cheeks
in front of the children?

250
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:26,321
So are you telling me to flatter her?
Is that what you're saying?

251
00:19:27,204 --> 00:19:29,478
If you really can't stand
the sight of her, give up

252
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:32,103
the master bedroom to us
and move into the annex.

253
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:35,751
Kyung-soo can use the bedroom
we're using now then.

254
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,774
Did all of you see that?

255
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:54,579
Finally, the hierarchy of this
house is being set straight.

256
00:19:56,368 --> 00:19:59,470
Park Hyun-joon. Park Hyun-sung.
Listen to me carefully.

257
00:20:00,345 --> 00:20:04,470
Call me mother from now on and
don't act arrogant in front of me.

258
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,474
I'll tell Mr. Park if you do.

259
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:18,321
Hold it in. Hold it in a little bit longer.

260
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:27,370
Call Im Cheol-woo right
now and tell him to bring

261
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,478
all the evidence he collected
right this instant!

262
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:34,118
- Wait. The game isn't over yet.
- What are we waiting for?

263
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:40,571
That card is the only weapon you and
I have. We don't have anymore cards.

264
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:43,595
- Why does that matter?
- Do you really not know?

265
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:48,204
That card must only be used for you and me!

266
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:53,985
Call him right now and tell him to bring
me the evidence to destroy Yoo Ji-na!

267
00:20:54,095 --> 00:20:58,203
I have no intention of letting that woman
get away with this either! Don't worry.

268
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,899
I've had enough of her. How dare she?

269
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:13,484
That expression on Mrs. Sung Kyung-ja's
face when her son told her in front of her

270
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:17,196
grandsons to give up the master bedroom
and move into the annex was priceless.

271
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,298
My head feels refreshed.

272
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:28,986
Park Hyun-joon.

273
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:35,743
Fine. Go ahead and mess with me now.

274
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,524
This is why they say power can shift.

275
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:46,095
The power is slowly shifting over to me.

276
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:51,868
But how did you get on Mr.
Park's good side?

277
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:57,798
This is why women need a smart son.

278
00:21:59,876 --> 00:22:01,415
This is all thanks to you, Kyung-soo.

279
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:04,735
- This is all thanks to Mrs. Choi Kyung-ae.
- What?

280
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:09,938
If you had raised me, I
would've turned out like you.

281
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:17,298
Then I guess abandoning you has
been somewhat helpful to your life.

282
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,251
How can you say that in front of me?

283
00:22:23,697 --> 00:22:26,667
- Once again, you're assuming you have everything?
- Of course.

284
00:22:26,987 --> 00:22:31,204
Because, not only are you the CEO's wife,
but also your son may become the successor?

285
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:35,142
Because you defeated Mrs. Sung
Kyung-ja and Go Na-kyung?

286
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:39,290
Because you're about to have Hyun-joon
and Hyun-sung under your feet?

287
00:22:39,486 --> 00:22:42,686
On top of that, I even got
rid of Jung Hae-dang.

288
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,587
Isn't this perfect?

289
00:22:45,853 --> 00:22:51,079
Didn't you experience what happens
once you think you reached perfection?

290
00:22:51,931 --> 00:22:52,932
What?

291
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:58,298
Your so-called perfection will end overnight
once I hand the letter to Hyun-joon.

292
00:22:59,892 --> 00:23:04,283
Go right now and persuade Mr. Park to
give permission for Hae-dang's marriage.

293
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:11,884
If you don't, your perfect day could
end up being the last day for you.

294
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:17,829
- Would you really do such an awful thing to me when you're my son?
- Son?

295
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:22,896
Why would you expect so many things from
me when you've done nothing for me?

296
00:23:24,048 --> 00:23:26,845
- I'm putting my faith in flesh and blood.
- Didn't you

297
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:29,713
learn from Mr. Park how
insignificant flesh and blood is?

298
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:45,885
- Why are you bringing your suitcase?
- If you don't settle

299
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:48,269
this with Mr. Park, I'm going
to leave with Hae-dang.

300
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,899
I'm going to give up this letter and leave.

301
00:23:55,712 --> 00:23:59,298
Is that the letter? Let me see it.

302
00:24:01,322 --> 00:24:02,322
What?

303
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:08,305
What? You want me to give
permission for a marriage

304
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:11,035
that I already said no to
just a couple days ago?

305
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:14,702
Welll... not exactly...

306
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,655
Why do you keep changing your
mind and making me into a fool?

307
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:26,312
We can get them married first and then
kick her out when your mom passes away.

308
00:24:27,523 --> 00:24:29,101
Do you think that makes any sense?

309
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:36,167
Did Kyung-soo say he
would give the letter to

310
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:39,815
Hyun-joon if I didn't allow their marriage?

311
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:46,163
- Of course not!
- If not, then there would be no reason for you to change your mind.

312
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:51,055
I supported him amidst
all the cursing I got,

313
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:54,476
and yet, he's going to
stab me in the back, huh?

314
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:55,772
I said no!

315
00:24:57,164 --> 00:25:00,819
Kyung-soo is only going
to live as your son now.

316
00:25:01,514 --> 00:25:03,890
Would he betray you because of a girl?

317
00:25:05,148 --> 00:25:09,093
In any moment, he wouldn't
dare go against you now.

318
00:25:09,648 --> 00:25:12,211
Then why do you suddenly want
to accept Jung Hae-dang as

319
00:25:12,235 --> 00:25:14,796
Hyun-joon's wife when you were
against her all this time?

320
00:25:16,507 --> 00:25:20,062
- I was just thinking out loud.
- You were just thinking out loud?

321
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:23,101
Whatever! I must be getting old now, too.

322
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,116
I'm scared of my life becoming complicated.

323
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:31,624
My head hurts thinking about how Hyun-joon
and your mother are going to torment me.

324
00:25:33,257 --> 00:25:34,257
My head hurts.

325
00:25:54,664 --> 00:25:56,241
That damned wench!

326
00:25:58,648 --> 00:26:05,343
Grandmother, what are you going to do
when you have the letter in your hands?

327
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:09,913
What else? I must make my son surrender.

328
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,726
If he's about to become a murderer, he
would definitely give up. Would he not?

329
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,203
We just have to tell him to hand over
his shares to Hyun-joon and Hyun-sung.

330
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:24,124
- What's the ratio?
- What?

331
00:26:24,593 --> 00:26:27,366
What's the ratio of the shares
you're going to divide between them?

332
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:31,515
- Is that important right now?
- So what's the ratio?

333
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:34,202
I asked you! Is that important right now?

334
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:37,640
You brat!

335
00:26:38,476 --> 00:26:42,499
I'll give everything to you, so just
think of a way to get me that letter!

336
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,397
- Grandmother!
- I said I'll give you everything.

337
00:26:45,843 --> 00:26:48,601
How can you joke in this situation?

338
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:51,249
How can you talk about
ratios in this situation?

339
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:56,899
This is why we'll never be
able to be on the same boat.

340
00:27:00,437 --> 00:27:05,351
- Are you really not going to eat?
- Forget it. I have no appetite.

341
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,390
Just pretend to lose and get up.
Don't lose the timing and regret it.

342
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:13,609
Don't talk to me and get out!
I'm not hungry!

343
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:17,360
- Are you seriously not going to eat?
- I'm not going to eat!

344
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:22,953
Don't eat then!

345
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,140
He's not going to eat?

346
00:27:30,085 --> 00:27:32,655
I'm worried something will
really happen to him.

347
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:37,797
How could he be so immature? Is a hunger
strike really necessary for this?

348
00:27:37,977 --> 00:27:41,546
Goodness. But he's holding out
better than I thought he would.

349
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:45,343
- That's because he always ate well.
- Mother.

350
00:27:45,975 --> 00:27:49,671
He'll eat when it's time. There are plenty
of people who starve on purpose, too.

351
00:27:51,218 --> 00:27:52,937
A few days of starvation won't kill him.

352
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:55,765
You're spiteful at times like this.

353
00:27:58,351 --> 00:27:59,351
Eat up.

354
00:28:00,484 --> 00:28:03,163
What? He skipped dinner tonight again?

355
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:06,619
Wow. So he's capable of doing things
once he sets his mind to it, too.

356
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:08,710
What if he ruins his health?

357
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:12,148
My mother-in-law said to just let him be
because people starve on purpose, too.

358
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:14,405
Goodness. What a joke.

359
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:21,757
Why aren't you eating?

360
00:28:22,156 --> 00:28:26,665
Father, if I die...

361
00:28:28,046 --> 00:28:29,819
bury me in a sunny place.

362
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,444
We don't have any land, so how
could I bury you in a sunny place?

363
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,201
Stop being ridiculous and go eat.

364
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:41,772
If I leave the world out of hunger...

365
00:28:43,695 --> 00:28:46,890
you're going to regret the fact that you
looked for a woman with a long neck.

366
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,335
Who dies because they can't get
their father-in-law married?

367
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:55,218
While I lay here just thinking for
two days while eating nothing,

368
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:00,812
my life flashes before
my eyes like a panorama.

369
00:29:01,632 --> 00:29:07,796
- Panorama?
- I had lived a vain life.

370
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:19,629
"The life running in a vast, wide field..."

371
00:29:19,953 --> 00:29:26,765
what have you come looking for?

372
00:29:27,343 --> 00:29:32,460
Life is the same whether you
live that way or this way.

373
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:41,098
"Money, honor, love. I hate them all."

374
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,726
Did you even have money or honor before?

375
00:29:43,937 --> 00:29:47,030
You should sing about whether you hate
them or not after you've had them.

376
00:29:47,476 --> 00:29:48,679
Oh, I'm dizzy!

377
00:29:51,507 --> 00:29:52,882
The end must be near.

378
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,155
Are you really not going to eat?

379
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:05,788
Just let him be. He'll come
out when he's really hungry.

380
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,929
There are people who purposely diet, too.

381
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,694
Diet isn't the problem. He could fall
over while trying to use the bathroom.

382
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,397
Gosh. Maybe I should have
dinner with that woman.

383
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:22,533
- Are you secretly happy?
- What?

384
00:30:22,743 --> 00:30:26,970
Your daughter are trying to stop you, so
you would be embarrassed to go see her.

385
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:29,782
Oh my gosh. Who's the one
who told my daughters

386
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:32,500
that she looks like a
shaman in the first place?

387
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:34,678
I called her a shaman
because she looks like one!

388
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:36,746
Why would I have called
her that if she didn't?

389
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,695
She doesn't even look
like that in real life.

390
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:43,538
Oh my goodness! Then go see her! Why are
you resisting and making my son starve?

391
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:45,163
Oh my gosh.

392
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:48,265
You two are the same. Sheesh!

393
00:30:52,007 --> 00:30:55,569
What? "She doesn't even look like that
in real life?" Then why isn't he going?

394
00:30:57,906 --> 00:30:59,788
You're really not going to eat, right?

395
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:06,054
If I really die, bury me in a sunny place.

396
00:31:06,343 --> 00:31:07,948
Are those your only final words?

397
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,077
What?

398
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:13,546
Did you buy any insurances?

399
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:24,522
Hey. Is that something you should say to
your husband who is on a hunger strike?

400
00:31:24,664 --> 00:31:27,727
If you're mad, come eat
and live longer than me.

401
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:33,194
If I do, do you have any insurances?

402
00:31:33,406 --> 00:31:35,751
You have a lot of interest
for someone who's dying.

403
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:41,624
What?

404
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:49,405
Did I buy any insurances?
I didn't. I didn't!

405
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,507
- Welcome back.
- Hi.

406
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:59,299
Hi. Did you have a good time? Did
someone start a conversation with you?

407
00:32:01,695 --> 00:32:03,093
Say hello to your grandmother.

408
00:32:10,117 --> 00:32:12,116
Grandmother, I'm back.

409
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:19,421
He looked even more handsome in
a place with a lot of people.

410
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,862
There were about three or four people
who asked if he had a girlfriend.

411
00:32:24,164 --> 00:32:27,577
Really? That's great!

412
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:29,976
I'll be going now.

413
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,375
Bye.

414
00:32:39,312 --> 00:32:44,703
He must have been nervous and shaking
inside, but he was so brave and soft.

415
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:48,988
He has a peculiar charm. I'm
sure he'll become someone

416
00:32:49,012 --> 00:32:51,882
great with some teaching. I
have big expectations for him.

417
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:09,226
Mother, did you hear that? He
said he has big expectations.

418
00:33:10,914 --> 00:33:14,007
Park Hyun-joon, did you clearly hear that?

419
00:33:15,835 --> 00:33:19,233
Why? You should get up
and yell at me again.

420
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:27,476
Where did your fiery temper go? Why are you
just sitting there miserably like a loser?

421
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:41,062
Tell me more.

422
00:33:41,796 --> 00:33:45,228
What families were those people who asked
about Kyung-soo's relationship status from?

423
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:49,168
First, I must educate him with
the necessary subjects first.

424
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:53,020
He's diligent, so he'll do well.

425
00:33:54,505 --> 00:33:56,153
You should stop. Your arms must hurt.

426
00:33:56,505 --> 00:33:59,715
No. I can't even pay back my
debt to you even with death.

427
00:34:00,723 --> 00:34:04,332
I got it, so stop. I should wash and sleep.

428
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:35,356
Of course, I had made plenty of
money during my days as a singer.

429
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:42,012
- However, power and money were two different things.
- Really?

430
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:50,379
The fact that you can control someone's
life means you can make them bow to you.

431
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:54,629
The woman of a powerful man.

432
00:34:56,388 --> 00:35:00,426
Back then, I had no idea
that was so appealing.

433
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:07,450
Since you're the woman of such a powerful
man, I find you even more attractive.

434
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,950
Is that so?

435
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:13,770
Hurry up and eat. We don't
have time to waste.

436
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:16,309
I have to go home early today.

437
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,754
You always play hard-to-get.
Do you think I'll let you go?

438
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:29,520
- Good night, grandmother.
- Is everyone home?

439
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:31,614
Mother isn't home yet.

440
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:34,067
It's late though. Where did she go?

441
00:35:34,372 --> 00:35:38,356
- She went out to have lunch with a friend.
- But she didn't come home yet?

442
00:35:39,442 --> 00:35:42,450
Goodness. She fears no
one in this family now.

443
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,043
I told you I had to go home by ten.
Why did you keep holding me back?

444
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:52,551
- I want to spend more time with you.
- Drive faster.

445
00:35:54,161 --> 00:35:57,676
If you keep rushing me, I'm just
going to drive to the east ocean!

446
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
What?

447
00:36:20,223 --> 00:36:22,090
Why are you coming home now?

448
00:36:23,177 --> 00:36:25,348
- You weren't sleeping?
- Where were you?

449
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:28,473
- Just somewhere.
- So where?

450
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:34,028
My friend's mom suddenly passed
away, so I went to the funeral.

451
00:36:34,395 --> 00:36:36,419
Didn't you have lunch with a friend?

452
00:36:37,223 --> 00:36:38,481
Just go to sleep.

453
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:45,207
Did you go to a funeral dressed like that?

454
00:36:47,614 --> 00:36:49,385
I got the notice suddenly when I was out.

455
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:54,121
I was eating with my friend
when I suddenly got the call.

456
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,496
Even if you were at a funeral, a married
woman like you should come home early.

457
00:37:23,294 --> 00:37:24,627
How was the funeral?

458
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:29,270
Your friend must have been flustered
to lose her father so suddenly.

459
00:37:30,203 --> 00:37:31,203
I know.

460
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:33,676
It was your friend's father
who had passed away?

461
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,520
He collapsed suddenly because
of high blood pressure.

462
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,200
Last night, you told me your
friend's mother had passed away.

463
00:37:41,013 --> 00:37:44,213
Was it her father or mother
who had passed away?

464
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,535
Why is that so important that you
have to scold her right now?

465
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:08,109
In my head, I always imagine
going far, but when

466
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:10,881
I actually hit it, the
distance is always short.

467
00:38:11,153 --> 00:38:15,575
A steady rhythm is important in
putting as well as swinging.

468
00:38:16,692 --> 00:38:17,692
I see.

469
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,848
If you hold onto the putter grip like
that, you'll use your wrists too much.

470
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,403
Then what do I do?

471
00:38:38,372 --> 00:38:40,379
You're going to relax and let it pass.

472
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:45,504
Squat a little bit.

473
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:48,708
Okay.

474
00:38:54,778 --> 00:38:57,051
It's time for the cart to leave. Let's go.

475
00:38:57,364 --> 00:38:59,739
Oh, really? Let's go.

476
00:39:01,388 --> 00:39:02,388
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

477
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:15,996
Not only is your drive far, but your
iron trajectory is amazing as well.

478
00:39:17,466 --> 00:39:19,535
I don't think you're just an amateur.

479
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:23,410
It was amazing to see him making the
balls stand on top of the green.

480
00:39:23,434 --> 00:39:25,348
Oh, come on. In the summer,
the green is soft,

481
00:39:25,372 --> 00:39:27,122
so it's easy to make the balls stand there.

482
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:31,989
Oh, right. Since you're a lawyer,
let me ask you one thing.

483
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,262
When you transfer your inheritance...

484
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,527
Father, if you talk about
complicated things

485
00:39:41,551 --> 00:39:43,364
during golf, you won't
be able to play well.

486
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,550
Oh. I guess that's true.

487
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:51,692
- Ask the company's legal team later.
- Okay. I guess I can do that.

488
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:55,934
But how are you able to
hit the ball so far?

489
00:39:57,372 --> 00:40:00,301
It's because of the swing speed.

490
00:40:01,926 --> 00:40:05,223
So you mean I should hit the ball
quickly instead of hard, right?

491
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:10,598
I know that, and yet, when I see golf
balls, I just end up hitting them.

492
00:40:18,153 --> 00:40:19,864
This will make him surrender, won't it?

493
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:22,535
Let's see if he can still keep it up now.

494
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,864
What's this smell?

495
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,692
- Wow! What's this? Why are you grilling spareribs?
- Come and sit here.

496
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:50,676
- Thanks to him, it looks like we'll have a feast.
- Have some soju.

497
00:40:51,372 --> 00:40:52,731
Okay, okay.

498
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,888
- Is it good?
- The meat is tender!

499
00:41:02,496 --> 00:41:04,137
He'll feel tortured.

500
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,926
- Ten minutes before he comes running out.
- Five minutes before he comes running out.

501
00:41:12,661 --> 00:41:13,661
It's delicious!

502
00:41:21,755 --> 00:41:25,621
No. If I give in now, all this
will have been for nothing!

503
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:29,293
I must resist. I must resist.

504
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:36,395
I, Yeon Bong-soo, can't sell my
manly pride for some spareribs.

505
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:41,598
No! No! No!

506
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:50,387
Embarrassment only lasts a second.

507
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:54,778
Did I ever care about my pride
in front of the family?

508
00:41:55,707 --> 00:41:57,964
Who cares about my pride anyways?

509
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,511
Yes. Yes. Yes.

510
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:12,144
The one who can overcome the
moment will win forever.

511
00:42:29,222 --> 00:42:30,964
Oh, spareribs!

512
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:41,025
If I could just one bite,
I would sell my soul.

513
00:42:42,417 --> 00:42:46,311
- Oh, spareribs!
- He should be coming out by now.

514
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:48,386
Gosh. He's resisting pretty well.

515
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:50,659
When did he become so determined?

516
00:42:51,074 --> 00:42:53,698
He's showing a new side of him.

517
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:56,808
What if he fainted while
resisting what he wanted to eat?

518
00:42:56,964 --> 00:43:02,503
- W-What? B-Bong-soo? Bong-soo!
- Oh my gosh. No way.

519
00:43:03,558 --> 00:43:04,558
Bong-soo!

520
00:43:05,902 --> 00:43:06,902
Oh, my.

521
00:43:09,565 --> 00:43:11,878
What are you doing?

522
00:43:12,574 --> 00:43:13,925
"Burning Livelihood."

523
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:18,730
To be living is precious in itself.

524
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:27,448
You must prize every living creature...
even pigs.

525
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:33,698
- So are you never going to eat meat for the rest of your life?
- Oh, divine one.

526
00:43:33,885 --> 00:43:36,433
Goodness. You're doing all sorts
of ridiculous things now.

527
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:41,745
- Just come out and eat!
- Oh, divine one.

528
00:44:10,183 --> 00:44:11,464
Where did my spareribs go?

529
00:44:13,121 --> 00:44:14,347
What the heck is this?

530
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:20,933
Was it a dream? Oh, my spareribs...

531
00:44:31,847 --> 00:44:36,636
Once I think I want to eat something,
I can't take the hunger anymore.

532
00:44:37,816 --> 00:44:42,894
I can't take it. I can't. At
this rate, I might lose my mind!

533
00:45:25,285 --> 00:45:28,784
What's this? There's nothing left.

534
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:34,354
I should've just ate the spareribs earlier.

535
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,332
Darn it!

536
00:45:49,988 --> 00:45:53,792
How could they have eaten everything?

537
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,433
Is there rice leftover in
the kitchen downstairs?

538
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:05,956
They didn't change the
front door PIN, did they?

539
00:46:22,198 --> 00:46:25,347
It's rice! It's rice!

540
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,597
Who turned the light on in the kitchen?

541
00:46:59,269 --> 00:47:03,479
What's this? Why does it smell like kimchi?

542
00:47:07,378 --> 00:47:09,753
Come out. Come out. Come out and eat.

543
00:47:13,691 --> 00:47:16,659
- Sit and eat comfortably.
- Okay.

544
00:47:22,363 --> 00:47:26,237
Goodness. Serves you right.

545
00:47:27,652 --> 00:47:31,526
- You'll keep this a secret, won't you?
- Depends on how you act.

546
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,612
Oh, come on, father!

547
00:47:33,963 --> 00:47:38,097
Did you sneak into my kitchen
and eat food every night?

548
00:47:38,408 --> 00:47:41,979
N-No! Tonight is the first time!

549
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,300
If you disobey me now, I'll tell everyone!

550
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,206
Do you want me to heat
up some soup for you?

551
00:47:49,941 --> 00:47:54,628
I don't deserve to eat soup.
I'll just drink water.

552
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,135
But what kind of soup is it?

553
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:02,347
You said you're not going to
eat it, so why would you ask?

554
00:48:02,566 --> 00:48:06,144
If you're going to throw
it away anyways, you can

555
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:10,485
heat up a bowl for me, and
I'll gratefully enjoy it.

556
00:48:10,761 --> 00:48:12,495
My goodness.

557
00:48:15,691 --> 00:48:18,491
- Are there any leftover spareribs?- What?

558
00:48:20,277 --> 00:48:22,253
Never mind. I'll just eat this.

559
00:48:27,386 --> 00:48:31,120
- Mr. Park wanted to go golfing again next weekend.
- Again?

560
00:48:34,308 --> 00:48:36,112
- So what did you say?
- I said yes.

561
00:48:36,316 --> 00:48:39,612
I told you to say no! Do
you want to see me die?

562
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,331
Why are you getting angry?
Did I contact him first?

563
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:45,972
It'd be even weirder if I said no.

564
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:48,207
Stop the car.

565
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:51,448
- Are you angry?
- Stop the car!

566
00:49:04,253 --> 00:49:06,487
I told you to come up with
an excuse and decline him!

567
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:09,065
Why do you keep hanging out with my family?
Is it fun for you?

568
00:49:09,222 --> 00:49:11,284
So you're just going to leave right now?

569
00:49:15,863 --> 00:49:18,620
If you just leave like this, you'll
never be able to see me again.

570
00:49:19,402 --> 00:49:20,940
Will you really be okay with that?

571
00:49:22,073 --> 00:49:27,970
I made myself clear. If you leave
now, you'll never see me again.

572
00:49:45,768 --> 00:49:50,235
My mom had installed cameras because
of her fear of being murdered.

573
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:54,159
The will she had written
just in case became lost.

574
00:49:55,073 --> 00:50:01,167
The lost will had been in my
father's safe before the incident.

575
00:50:02,253 --> 00:50:05,612
My father had been at the cliff with
her where the incident had happened.

576
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:09,050
Of course, cameras couldn't
have been installed

577
00:50:10,029 --> 00:50:12,965
at the cliff where she had fallen off of.

578
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:17,421
However, I'm not sure how
effective the testimony of having

579
00:50:17,445 --> 00:50:20,315
seen the will in his safe
before the incident will be.

580
00:50:21,957 --> 00:50:28,558
If my father insists that my grandmother
is lying, then there's no solution.

581
00:50:30,449 --> 00:50:33,550
This is the moment when you'll
need the critical clue.

582
00:50:33,894 --> 00:50:37,917
On top of that, all my father
talks about in front of

583
00:50:38,737 --> 00:50:42,128
Yoo Ji-na is how he's going
to transfer his shares.

584
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:47,292
Lee Kyung-soo is dutifully
acting like his son.

585
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:54,956
- Hyun-joon.
- Last time, Ji-na told me to beg on my hands and knees.

586
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:58,150
Who is the true owner
of the company anyways?

587
00:51:00,105 --> 00:51:02,940
There's one way to get that letter.

588
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:05,511
Really?

589
00:51:06,113 --> 00:51:07,831
It's for me to leave with Kyung-soo.

590
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:12,706
- What?
- Then Kyung-soo will give that letter to you.

591
00:51:13,175 --> 00:51:16,745
- Are you kidding me?
- More than anything else, you need that letter.

592
00:51:18,362 --> 00:51:21,386
Before, you were about to make
me and Kyung-soo run away.

593
00:51:21,613 --> 00:51:23,480
Do you think we're in
the same situation now?

594
00:51:23,504 --> 00:51:26,409
If you can't think of where
your mother had hid the clue,

595
00:51:27,274 --> 00:51:30,503
then the only way is to get
the letter from Kyung-soo.

596
00:51:30,691 --> 00:51:35,746
Don't be ridiculous. I can't
trade you for anything else.

597
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:40,144
- I'm not worth that.
- I'm the one who gets to decide that worth.

598
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:47,940
To me, you're a woman who is worthy to
bet my entire life on making you mine.

599
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:52,151
You don't think I'm saying this because I
want to run away with Kyung-soo, do you?

600
00:51:52,753 --> 00:51:53,753
Of course not.

601
00:51:53,948 --> 00:51:59,534
This may be the only way I'll ever be able
to repay you back for loving me 100%.

602
00:52:01,597 --> 00:52:09,073
I told you I'm going to use you, but
regardless, you sincerely loved me.

603
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:15,362
To repay you for that love,
I'll get that letter for you.

604
00:52:15,894 --> 00:52:19,690
You promised me you wouldn't leave
me first under any circumstances.

605
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:41,112
If you can run away with Hae-dang,
are you going to give me the letter?

606
00:52:41,574 --> 00:52:46,323
I heard Mr. Park isn't going to allow
you two to get married anyways.

607
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:50,136
No matter what happens, I'm
going to marry Hae-dang.

608
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:53,667
- Then to Mr. Park, you're over.
- I don't care.

609
00:52:54,027 --> 00:52:56,269
Then with what power will
you protect Hae-dang?

610
00:52:57,659 --> 00:53:01,566
Do you even have the power to protect her?

611
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:08,347
You once told me that I had to choose
between my mother and Hae-dang.

612
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:15,245
I've made my choice. Now
it's your turn to choose.

613
00:53:15,941 --> 00:53:19,341
Pick someone between your
late mother and Hae-dang.

614
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:26,370
If you're going to get revenge for
your mother, give up on Hae-dang now.

615
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:32,526
- Lee Kyung-soo.
- You and I both have twisted fates anyways.

616
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:35,120
You can only gain one thing.

617
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,956
If you need the letter,
give up on Hae-dang.

618
00:53:40,964 --> 00:53:46,386
I'm ready to abandon my mother.

619
00:53:55,714 --> 00:54:01,269
If you're going to get revenge for
your mother, give up on Hae-dang now.

620
00:54:02,332 --> 00:54:06,940
You and I both have twisted fates anyways.

621
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:25,737
Are you waiting for a call?

622
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:28,535
Of course not.

623
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,667
Cheol canceled the golf trip.

624
00:54:33,472 --> 00:54:36,769
- He did.
- Was he offended by something?

625
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:43,628
Once Cheol resolves not to see
you, he'll never see you again.

626
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:46,574
Really?

627
00:54:52,351 --> 00:54:54,714
(Web Message/Advertisement)

628
00:54:57,714 --> 00:55:02,300
- It seems like you're waiting for something.
- Please mind your own business.

629
00:55:02,582 --> 00:55:06,399
You look like someone who fought with her

630
00:55:06,423 --> 00:55:10,511
boyfriend and is waiting
for him to call you first.

631
00:55:11,024 --> 00:55:12,024
What?

632
00:55:25,157 --> 00:55:30,961
I made myself clear. If you leave
now, you'll never see me again.

633

(Im Cheol-woo)

634
00:55:58,477 --> 00:56:00,654
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

635
00:56:00,678 --> 00:56:04,243
Please leave a message after the tone.

636
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:10,508
Okay. I'll tell him that.

637
00:56:12,204 --> 00:56:16,188
My husband would like it better
if you called him yourself.

638
00:56:17,329 --> 00:56:18,329
Bye.

639
00:56:21,774 --> 00:56:23,727
Did you call him?

640
00:56:26,915 --> 00:56:29,836
Hyun-sung was wondering why he had
suddenly canceled the golf trip.

641
00:56:30,751 --> 00:56:32,993
- Did he answer?
- Of course.

642
00:56:35,352 --> 00:56:38,282
What? So he's just not answering my calls?

00:57:01,532 --> 00:57:03,172
- I need to see you.
- Why?

649
00:57:08,157 --> 00:57:09,782
- Mother.
- What is it?

650
00:57:10,406 --> 00:57:13,664
Cheol is at the front gate right now.

651
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:20,258
- What?
- He said he can't leave until he sees you.

652
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:27,047
- What?
- I think Cheol had a crush on you.

653
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:34,024
- A crush?
- That old bachelor fell in love late.

654
00:57:37,024 --> 00:57:38,806
He's not this kind of person.

655
00:57:39,537 --> 00:57:43,344
Girls followed him in our school
days, but he never cared about them.

656
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:49,032
Go out for a bit.

657
00:57:50,094 --> 00:57:52,289
Are you crazy? How could I go out now?

658
00:57:52,548 --> 00:57:55,258
Then what do we do? He said he'll
stay out there all night long.

659
00:57:55,821 --> 00:57:57,875
What if the other family members see me?

660
00:57:58,282 --> 00:58:03,453
- I'll be keeping watch in the living room.
- Don't be ridiculous.

661
00:58:47,571 --> 00:58:50,743
What are you doing right now? Get
a hold of yourself, Yoo Ji-na.

662
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:55,758
No. This is the last time.

663
00:58:57,306 --> 00:59:01,086
I just need to tell him to
never come to my house again.

664
00:59:26,821 --> 00:59:28,133
Are you going out now?

665
00:59:30,212 --> 00:59:31,212
Are you crazy?

666
00:59:33,243 --> 00:59:36,633
- What are you doing over there?
- Why did you come out at this hour?

667
00:59:39,048 --> 00:59:40,750
I-I came to drink water.

668
00:59:42,087 --> 00:59:43,314
With your clothes changed?

669
00:59:44,977 --> 00:59:49,016
My head hurts, so I'm going to
get some fresh air in the yard.

670
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,383
You put on light make-up as well.

671
00:59:53,009 --> 00:59:57,063
I was tired, so I slept
without washing my face.

672
00:59:58,735 --> 01:00:00,069
Cheol is still here.

673
01:00:02,173 --> 01:00:07,625
I was sitting here because I was
afraid he might ring the doorbell.

674
01:00:09,946 --> 01:00:14,902
- Just go out for a bit.
- Forget it.

675
01:00:15,298 --> 01:00:18,398
If father wakes up and asks where
you are, I'll say you went out

676
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:21,235
to the yard to get some fresh
air since you couldn't sleep.

677
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:23,844
Don't be ridiculous and go to sleep.

678
01:00:25,704 --> 01:00:26,852
You didn't drink water yet.

679
01:00:44,345 --> 01:00:45,820
Why did you follow me in here?

680
01:00:46,283 --> 01:00:48,414
I have to say good night to you.

681
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:53,461
- Good night.
- Good night.

682
01:01:17,056 --> 01:01:18,056
Mother!

683
01:01:22,734 --> 01:01:24,571
- What now?
- Are you going out?

684
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:26,774
Why would I go out at this hour?

685
01:02:19,704 --> 01:02:22,047
She's totally out of her mind.

686
01:02:23,391 --> 01:02:28,219
Then again, it's forbidden love,
so how thrilling would it be?

687
01:02:39,657 --> 01:02:42,727
Do you really have the
confidence to live without me?

688
01:03:25,807 --> 01:03:28,330
("You Are Too Much")

689
01:03:28,354 --> 01:03:31,032
- You'll explain it well?
- About what happened at the front gate?

690
01:03:31,056 --> 01:03:34,326
- The hug was one-sided.
- You didn't go out to be purposely hugged?

691
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,614
Isn't there something that
could entice Hyun-sung?

692
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,410
There's no safe in the annex.

693
01:03:39,434 --> 01:03:41,749
Are you telling me to steal the letter?

694
01:03:41,966 --> 01:03:43,904
I'm getting married this Saturday.

695
01:03:43,928 --> 01:03:48,934
At last, you're no longer Yoo
Ji-na's impersonator anymore.

696
01:03:49,177 --> 01:03:51,841
Fine. So you're going to become
my daughter-in-law, are you?

697
01:03:51,865 --> 01:03:56,318
- Watch what happens when you get married.
- I think Ji-na is having an affair.

698
01:03:56,342 --> 01:04:00,328
- I think I know who it is.
- This is our last chance to chase her out of here.
