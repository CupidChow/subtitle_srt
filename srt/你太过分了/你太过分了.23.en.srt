(Episode 23)

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:10,903
There's only one condition.

4
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:17,304
All you have to do is not tell
the world that you're my son.

5
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:23,304
What did you say?

6
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:25,109
It's not hard at all.

7
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:29,312
You can just be the son...

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,812
he had with another woman.

9
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:43,625
Get out. Get out right now.

10
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:47,015
Don't ever appear in front of me again.

11
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:50,671
It would've been better if we hadn't met.

12
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:52,742
What?

13
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,796
The reason you were able
to abandon a blind child

14
00:00:56,383 --> 00:01:01,015
like me was because you
were this kind of person.

15
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:08,023
It's because you're a
shameless, selfish person!

16
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:15,312
Then what do you want from me?

17
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,875
- What?
- What can I do for you?

18
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,656
I don't know what you want from me,

19
00:01:23,195 --> 00:01:29,062
but I never had any motherly
love to begin with.

20
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,601
There are women like me in this world.

21
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:35,278
I got it, so go.

22
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:36,882
Motherly love?

23
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,460
I heard that's a great thing, too.

24
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,185
Even before I graduated
high school, I sang songs

25
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,462
at bars because I wanted
to become a singer.

26
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:54,984
I'm sorry, but I don't even
know who your father is.

27
00:01:58,523 --> 00:01:59,523
What?

28
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:02,054
Do you understand what I'm saying?

29
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:08,984
Then why am I Lee Kyung-soo?

30
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:14,867
To be honest, I don't know
if you're a Lee or a Park.

31
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,773
- What?
- Your grandmother put you under her younger

32
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:22,109
brother's family registry. That's
why your last name is Lee.

33
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,427
Do you understand?

34
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:35,023
I'm sorry, but from the
moment you were born, you

35
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:39,195
were just someone I had
to hide and get rid of!

36
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,860
Stop, please.

37
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:44,797
At first, I didn't even know I had you.

38
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:48,078
At that young age,
I didn't know what to do.

39
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:52,383
I thought about it, hid you,
and wondered what I had to do.

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,773
Then it became too late.

41
00:02:57,383 --> 00:03:02,156
Of course I thought about dying with you.
I did it more than a dozen times!

42
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,492
However, I didn't want to end it that way.

43
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:16,203
Can you expect noble motherly
love from someone like me?

44
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:21,906
I got it, so don't worry
and go live your life.

45
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:24,109
If you're so upset about
being born like that...

46
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:26,679
If you're so upset about
being abandoned like that...

47
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:30,015
you should live well now
as a wealthy man's son!

48
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:36,828
Were you tormented for a
long time because of me?

49
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:42,914
I was tormented because of you, too!

50
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:47,672
That's the relationship...

51
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:54,719
between you and me.

52
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:56,897
Just live as if you've never met me.

53
00:03:56,922 --> 00:03:59,482
We met like this, so how can I do that?

54
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:01,248
Then what do you want from me?

55
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:03,662
Accept who you are,

56
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:06,717
don't act like a baby,

57
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:11,498
- and gratefully accept the things I give you!
- Just please leave me alone!

58
00:06:05,717 --> 00:06:07,811
What are you doing without
turning the lights on?

59
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:14,990
Why didn't you come eat dinner?

60
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:21,779
My existence feels shabby.

61
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:26,287
I feel like I'm worth less than dust.

62
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:29,092
Why?

63
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:34,303
I feel ashamed for being born...

64
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,115
and I'm embarrassed that I'm alive.

65
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:48,607
I just want to disappear somewhere.

66
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:53,217
Did something happen?

67
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:03,842
Why was I born into this world?

68
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:05,594
How can you say that?

69
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,670
If you weren't here, what would
have happened to my life?

70
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:19,084
The fact that you're in this world gives
me so much happiness and strength.

71
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Hae-dang...

72
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,506
I won't ask you why you're
crying, so cry if you want.

73
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,310
Cry as much as you want.

74
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:24,303
Did you talk with your son?

75
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:29,818
He doesn't want to meet you yet.

76
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:31,608
I see.

77
00:08:32,952 --> 00:08:35,110
Usually, if you were unable
to convince him in one

78
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:37,165
try, then it's going to
be hard to persuade him.

79
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,170
- What do you mean?
- He has a lot of grudge towards you.

80
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,256
Then that's dangerous.

81
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,725
He's young. His grudge
won't go away easily.

82
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,480
Let's just register our marriage first.

83
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:58,213
I told you I can't do that.

84
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:02,951
Do whatever you can to ease his anger.

85
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:07,264
Make him be able to forgive you.

86
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:10,594
Or else, one day, there will be a problem.

87
00:09:11,022 --> 00:09:15,936
Do you mean we can't get married and register
our marriage if he never forgives me?

88
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:20,811
If he forgives you now, that
means he'll live as your child.

89
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,186
If he won't forgive you,
that means he's just a

90
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,326
time bomb in your life
that's waiting to explode.

91
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:46,404
That means he's just a time bomb in
your life that's waiting to explode.

92
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,943
Bong-soo, are you not going
to come here anymore?

93
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:08,115
Every time someone comes
in here, I hope it's

94
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,522
you and then I get
disappointed when it's not.

95
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,170
Where are you going?

96
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:46,920
Y-You woke up? I'm going to the bathroom.

97
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:57,193
You change before going to the bathroom?

98
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,397
Don't mind me and go back to sleep.

99
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,428
Are you going to this woman right now?

100
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,209
I'm just going to go and
say one word to her.

101
00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:20,334
- What word?
- I'm just going to see her for a moment.

102
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:24,811
Go straight back to bed
and stop saying nonsense.

103
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:54,506
She has some guts.

104
00:11:56,217 --> 00:12:00,233
Answer it. Tell her to stop saying
nonsense and focus on her business.

105
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:02,732
You're not going to answer?

106
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:05,576
Should I answer it for you and
give her a piece of my mind?

107
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:14,107
Hello? Hi, Gwang-ja, it's me.
Yes. Have you been well?

108
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:23,003
Stop saying nonsense and
focus on your business.

109
00:12:57,991 --> 00:13:02,412
- Why are you just going?
Aren't you going to eat?
- I don't want to.

110
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,131
Why are you pretending to be blind?

111
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:11,278
- You don't need to know, ma'am.
- Ma'am?

112
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:12,873
Then what should I call you?

113
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:20,131
You said I was a burden to you ever since
I was born. I'm sorry I'm your son.

114
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:26,092
Were you shocked after hearing
I don't know who your father is?

115
00:13:26,795 --> 00:13:32,037
Ever since I was born as Yoo Ji-na...
no... as Kim Hae-jung's son,

116
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,303
I knew that was my fate I had to accept.

117
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:39,717
Do you remember the name Kim Hae-jung?

118
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:45,005
I repeated the name a thousand times to
myself so that I wouldn't forget it.

119
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:52,928
I thought I would find you one day
as long as I remembered that name.

120
00:13:55,038 --> 00:14:00,217
That's why, even when I was little,
I knew I shouldn't forget it.

121
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:10,037
How did you come to learn the piano?

122
00:14:11,756 --> 00:14:14,295
It was a lie that your mother
had suggested it to you.

123
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:23,053
My benefactor told me I would be able to
live this world if I enjoy doing something.

124
00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:25,623
That's why she let me learn it.

125
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:33,084
So there are people like her in this world.

126
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:35,428
Even when my own mom abandoned me,

127
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:41,951
she warmly took care of me
before she passed away.

128
00:14:43,412 --> 00:14:45,623
Seeing that you grew up
good and straight, I

129
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:50,444
think I know what kind of a person she was.

130
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:53,334
Do you want to pay her back?

131
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:57,311
Do you think I'm not human?

132
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,740
Remember what you just said.
You might have a way to pay her back.

133
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:09,506
What do you mean? You said she died.

134
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:33,609
Did he refuse, too?

135
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:37,811
I didn't know it would be this difficult
to get a song from a famous songwriter.

136
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,865
Are you up to your tricks again?

137
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,295
Did you tell the songwriters
not to give Hae-dang a song?

138
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,045
Are you going to make a
song for Jung Hae-dang?

139
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:03,498
Why? I can't?

140
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:07,889
You should just throw money
into the Han River instead.

141
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:10,881
Who asked you to worry
if I go bankrupt or not?

142
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:13,615
Do you think songwriters will
give you a song because you

143
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,006
just give them money when they
don't even know the singer?

144
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:18,014
It's not like Hae-dang can't sing.

145
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:23,678
There are plenty of amateurs who can't sing.
However, do they all succeed as singers?

146
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,000
Who would give the songs they worked hard
on to an impossible, unknown singer?

147
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:34,889
Try giving them loads of money and
spending nights in front of their doors.

148
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:39,232
They won't give a song to someone like
Hae-dang. Especially famous songwriters.

149
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:42,029
I'll do whatever I can to get her a song.

150
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:45,161
That might be possible if
I stepped in and helped.

151
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:51,631
I told you that this industry
doesn't work with just money.

152
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:58,014
- Why can't you let her go?
- That's not any of your concern.

153
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:01,654
- Why do you like her so much?
- I told you; it's none of your concern!

154
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,187
This devious wench.

155
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:13,892
How dare she two-time them?

156
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:45,295
Did you tell Jung Hae-dang
that I'm your mom?

157
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,100
- No.
- Don't do it.

158
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:56,326
The only people who can know about
that fact is you, me, and Mr. Park.

159
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:58,232
I wasn't going to tell her anyways.

160
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,709
I have no intention of living
as Yoo Ji-na's son anyways.

161
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:06,300
What good will come out of her knowing
about it? It will just burden her forever.

162
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:08,000
Burden her forever?

163
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:13,942
- I'm going to marry her in the fall.
- What? I said you can't!

164
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,240
Mind your own business.

165
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:18,209
Do you know how devious she is?

166
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:21,795
She's not in a normal
relationship with her agency CEO.

167
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:27,061
While she's acting pitiful
to him and making a living,

168
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:30,897
she's telling you she loves
you behind his back.

169
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,052
I know he's helping her.

170
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:34,798
Why are you letting it happen then?

171
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,506
Why should I stop him from
making her into a singer?

172
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:38,943
It's not like that.

173
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,600
Do you know how much it
costs to make a singer?

174
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:45,697
If the industry people
heard about this, they'd

175
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,366
go crazy. Do you think it's all for free?

176
00:18:47,913 --> 00:18:49,928
- What?
- Naive fool.

177
00:18:50,202 --> 00:18:54,269
If you're going to say such things, leave.
Get out right now!

178
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,779
What brings you here?

179
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:26,842
- You're so shameless.
- Excuse me?

180
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:30,873
You pretend to be refined,
but how dare you think about

181
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:34,662
marrying a man who is eight
years younger than you?

182
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:54,178
- Why aren't you ending things
with Park Hyun-joon?
- Pardon?

183
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:59,420
What will you do to pay him
back for his kindness?

184
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:02,352
- Stop it.
-you won't be able to insist he's

185
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:07,043
helping you because you're full of potential
when I know your situation all too well.

186
00:20:08,678 --> 00:20:10,170
Do you take just because he gives?

187
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:15,855
- Yoo Ji-na.
- Do you take everything men give you
when you can't even repay them?

188
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:23,475
Stop trying to get a song.

189
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:26,295
No matter how much you put
on an innocent pretense,

190
00:20:26,973 --> 00:20:29,654
the industry thinks you're
Park Hyun-joon's mistress.

191
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,881
- Watch your mouth!
- Who knows what
they're doing behind your back?

192
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:33,906
You're really-!

193
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,811
Yet, you dare put on a thick
face and two-time them?

194
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:39,551
Who's two-timing them?

195
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:46,217
So one is money and the other is youth?

196
00:20:47,272 --> 00:20:50,139
Do you think the world revolves around you?

197
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,607
Get in your car right now. Say
one word, and I won't hold back.

198
00:20:56,725 --> 00:21:01,115
The thing you're most afraid of might
happen right in front of your eyes.

199
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,357
Don't ever appear in
front of Hae-dang again.

200
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:09,523
Let's go, Hae-dang.

201
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:23,929
What the hell is wrong with her?

202
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:33,240
What is your relationship with her?

203
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,037
- You don't need to know.
- "You don't need to know?"

204
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,279
Let me ask you again.

205
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:45,295
How does she know you?

206
00:21:46,116 --> 00:21:51,162
Don't take her words to heart.
She has nothing to do with us.

207
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:54,717
- Then why is she being like this?
- Don't mind her.

208
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:56,233
Who is she?

209
00:21:56,499 --> 00:22:01,811
You can trust me when I say she
has nothing to do with us. So...

210
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:06,811
don't ask me who she is.

211
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:29,147
- She discharged safely.
- Something terrible could have happened to her.

212
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:33,397
If something had really gone
wrong with her, your father and

213
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:37,139
I wouldn't have been able to
walk around with our heads up.

214
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:44,850
Don't you know people are gossiping
that I drove your mom to death?

215
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,975
I was ashamed once more because of that
vulgar thing that lives in the annex.

216
00:22:51,866 --> 00:22:54,826
Just because you're wealthy doesn't
mean you're a prestigious family.

217
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:56,475
A prestigious family?

218
00:22:56,803 --> 00:23:03,475
It's at times like this we need to be
in-laws with such a dignified family.

219
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:05,996
- Grandmother.
- What?

220
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:09,111
Everyone already knows
our family is a mess.

221
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,881
So what? We can just persist
that's not true from now on.

222
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:17,162
- Do you think that will work?
- Don't you know what coercion means?

223
00:23:18,694 --> 00:23:20,904
It means no one can win
against someone who persists.

224
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:27,217
- Your life can be explained
in one word: coercion.
- What?

225
00:23:27,694 --> 00:23:29,660
You made your son, who was
nothing but a regular employee,

226
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:31,249
into the son-in-law of a CEO.

227
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:33,967
You pushed your in-law and
daughter-in-law away.

228
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:39,365
You're persisting that you've been the
owner of this house the entire time.

229
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:45,389
Yes. Coercion is my life. So what?
Disgraceful fool.

230
00:23:49,764 --> 00:23:53,451
- Eat dinner at my house.
- Are you taking me back?

231
00:23:55,616 --> 00:23:59,443
- Because of your grandmother?
- Am I someone who listens to her?

232
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,537
- Then for what?
- Must you really hear the reason?

233
00:24:04,037 --> 00:24:06,936
- It's nervous if I don't know.
- Just bear with it.

234
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:12,397
- So for what?
- This is exactly why I was
having a hard time with you.

235
00:24:13,256 --> 00:24:16,639
- Is this out of sympathy?
- It's out of responsibility.

236
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:19,482
I'm not nervous. That's
a trustworthy thing.

237
00:24:20,413 --> 00:24:21,850
However, I do feel pathetic.

238
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,460
Let's go.

239
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:28,998
Exactly how much did you end
things with that woman?

240
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,842
If you keep doing this, I really
won't be able to put up with you!

241
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,904
What does that look in your eyes mean?

242
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:37,936
"You clung onto me with
your life, and now you

243
00:24:37,961 --> 00:24:39,897
expect love from me?"
Is that what you mean?

244
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:42,342
Yes.

245
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:50,420
I'm holding it in because you
love me enough to kill yourself.

246
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:56,348
However, do you really not know
why I was running away from you?

247
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:02,576
That's why that woman is an idiot.

248
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:07,115
She's not an idiot. She
was just raised that way.

249
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:16,014
When women like her love someone, it
just means they want to be loved.

250
00:25:18,107 --> 00:25:22,350
That's how women like her end up
suffocating others with their love.

251
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,701
That's why Park Hyun-joon must be exhausted
from being suffocated with love.

252
00:25:28,631 --> 00:25:33,787
If she gets married into this family,
Hyun-joon won't be the only one tormented.

253
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:39,990
Both our lives will become
worn out without any benefits.

254
00:25:41,514 --> 00:25:42,514
"Both?"

255
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:46,452
We're in the kitchen together all day.
We might become

256
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:49,220
fond of each other while
talking the whole day.

257
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:55,534
Aren't you going to go to Hong Yoon-hee
later on and make fun of me behind my back?

258
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,644
- Welcome. Are you feeling better?
- Have you been well?

259
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:11,292
Grandmother, Yoon-hee is here.

260
00:26:11,543 --> 00:26:14,878
Oh, welcome!

261
00:26:15,316 --> 00:26:19,745
Why did you do such a terrible thing?
Are you okay now?

262
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:22,667
I still can't eat normally.

263
00:26:22,692 --> 00:26:25,019
Oh, no, you poor thing.

264
00:26:26,183 --> 00:26:31,245
After I heard what happened to you,
I almost died because I was so shocked.

265
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:33,542
I'm sorry for worrying you.

266
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:37,816
What are you doing? Take her upstairs and
make her rest. Come down for dinner.

267
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:42,573
- Can I do that?
- Of course! You're not in a stranger's home.

268
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:51,300
Take it easy. Walk carefully.

269
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:58,191
I knew she'd be like this. It's not
like she has some serious illness.

270
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,355
- What did you prepare for dinner?-
All of us can't just eat porridge.

271
00:27:04,668 --> 00:27:06,933
There's a thorn in your words.
Do you have a grudge?

272
00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:11,300
No. I'll prepare porridge for her.

273
00:27:13,824 --> 00:27:15,191
Why are you going in there?

274
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:21,495
- You should go upstairs and ask her
what kind of porridge she wants.
- Okay.

275
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:37,913
This is why I can't trust that old
hag and give her the crucial secret.

276
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:41,362
She forgot how she used
me when she needed me.

277
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:45,534
Your family were very
worried, weren't they?

278
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:52,712
- Tell them we'll give them
a formal apology through a meal.
- Okay.

279
00:27:53,219 --> 00:27:55,511
Tell them to set up the
wedding date for fall.

280
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,558
- Go ahead and do that.
- Okay.

281
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:07,441
I'll eat later. There
are enough people here.

282
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:09,925
Join us.

283
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,050
Sit here and eat. I'll eat later.

284
00:28:14,386 --> 00:28:15,816
Why are you getting up?

285
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,144
There's someone who will be joining our
family, so the family needs to eat together.

286
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:25,300
Enjoy, mother.

287
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:35,644
- Yoon-hee, eat slowly and a lot.
- I will.

288
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:49,519
I'm sorry, grandmother.
I'm not able to eat yet.

289
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:51,972
Really? Then go upstairs and rest.

290
00:28:52,675 --> 00:28:54,742
You're not fully recovered yet.

291
00:28:55,543 --> 00:28:56,870
Oh, you poor thing.

292
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:01,894
Why are you coming out already?

293
00:29:03,988 --> 00:29:05,255
Didn't you hear me?

294
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:08,816
Can we talk?

295
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,050
- What's on your mind?
- What do you mean?

296
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,459
I know Hyun-joon isn't
interested in you, but the

297
00:29:17,484 --> 00:29:20,386
entire family knows about
your feelings for him.

298
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:23,020
Do you think you can
live under the same roof

299
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:24,996
as me as mother-in-law and daughter-in-law?

300
00:29:26,082 --> 00:29:30,495
So? Are you going to chase me out?

301
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:33,245
I asked you. Can you live
under the same roof as me?

302
00:29:34,754 --> 00:29:36,941
I can. Happy?

303
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:40,237
You heard how I took pills to
take my own life, didn't you?

304
00:29:40,457 --> 00:29:42,120
I have ears, so I did.

305
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:45,925
I even thought about
dying, so what can't I do?

306
00:29:46,191 --> 00:29:51,058
It must be trend for the women in this
house to use their foolish brains.

307
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:54,222
Do you really not have feelings
for Hyun-joon anymore?

308
00:29:55,449 --> 00:29:57,495
Yes. I don't.

309
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:02,245
Why? Are you afraid I do?

310
00:30:03,472 --> 00:30:07,237
You should watch what you say.
I'm Ko Na-kyung.

311
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,237
Of course you aren't. Ko
Na-kyung isn't that dumb.

312
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:15,300
What I'm saying is that my
father-in-law believes me.

313
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:21,019
I don't know why you're
trying to stay by his side,

314
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,735
but should I tell him
you're looking at me with

315
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,150
jealousy in your eyes like
I'm your rival in love?

316
00:30:28,636 --> 00:30:32,526
- What?
- That's why you should watch what you say.

317
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:37,972
Even though you're showing utmost
sincerity by making meals,

318
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,612
my father-in-law seems
to be in deep thought.

319
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:45,948
If I tell him something at this point,
he'll be tremendously persuaded.

320
00:30:47,699 --> 00:30:50,081
If you want something,
you should know when to bow.

321
00:30:50,526 --> 00:30:52,198
How dare you rub salt in my wounds?

322
00:30:54,324 --> 00:30:55,324
"How dare you?"

323
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,769
I'm going to become your mother-in-law.

324
00:30:59,777 --> 00:31:02,855
Even though you're from a family of
professors, you have no manners.

325
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:07,112
I'll speak formally to you once
you become my mother-in-law.

326
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:13,128
You can't even eat at the same table as us.
Mother-in-law, my foot.

327
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:22,417
Compared to her, Ko Na-kyung is docile.

328
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:27,589
Fine. Become my daughter-in-law.

329
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:32,730
I'll do exactly what I learned
from Mrs. Sung Kyung-ja.

330
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:35,667
Arrogant wench.

331
00:31:48,925 --> 00:31:53,175
If I get married, you two will become
mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.

332
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:56,800
I hope you two get along with each other.

333
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:58,199
Yes, father.

334
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,081
- I hope we get along.
- I hope so, too.

335
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:09,073
Did you enjoy your dinner?

336
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:13,972
Yes, I did, but why are you still here?

337
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:20,548
The reporters are long gone. You've
already repaid for all the trouble.

338
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:24,267
- Shouldn't you leave already?
- I'll leave when it's time.

339
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:25,713
Is that up to you?

340
00:32:27,268 --> 00:32:28,535
Is this your house?

341
00:32:29,244 --> 00:32:31,752
You can leave when you want
and stay when you want?

342
00:32:32,954 --> 00:32:35,759
How dare you blatantly lie to me?

343
00:32:36,518 --> 00:32:42,556
Your life is full of lies. Every time
you open your mouth, it's a lie.

344
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:45,369
That's enough. Yoon-hee is watching.

345
00:32:45,526 --> 00:32:46,736
So what?

346
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:51,103
Yoon-hee, don't tell your family
you saw this vulgar thing at my house.

347
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,369
The adults of your family will get
shocked and call off this marriage.

348
00:32:56,346 --> 00:33:00,768
Oh my goodness! I'm so embarrassed!

349
00:33:12,315 --> 00:33:15,728
Please at least leave Ji-na
alone in front of Yoon-hee!

350
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:19,400
- Why?
- What would I look like in front of
my future daughter-in-law?

351
00:33:19,768 --> 00:33:24,986
What else? You still don't know?

352
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:29,752
Just because you try to keep your
composure doesn't mean it'll work.

353
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:34,461
It's been a long time since
you've become the laughing

354
00:33:34,486 --> 00:33:38,331
stick in front of the world
because of Yoo Ji-na.

355
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:40,611
Laughing stock?

356
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:46,463
Even in this situation, do you still
want to rub salt in my wounds?

357
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,924
Your fans would become vexed if they
found out star singer Yoo Ji-na is being

358
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:55,442
treated like this because she's trying
to become the wife of a wealthy man.

359
00:33:55,736 --> 00:34:01,301
- Stop it.
- Gosh. I haven't eaten anything,
so my insides feel empty.

360
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:04,939
- Cut some fruits for me.
- What?

361
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:12,033
I don't know what will happen in the future,
but right now, you're just a housekeeper.

362
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:28,588
It's different from the way
I upset you, isn't it?

363
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:31,705
That's how it is.

364
00:34:32,736 --> 00:34:34,697
A woman's family can be a weapon for her.

365
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,908
It's so annoying to see her act so impudent
because she has her family's support.

366
00:34:39,158 --> 00:34:42,173
I'm going to remember everything
and pay her back later.

367
00:34:42,971 --> 00:34:45,322
You said you were going
to leave this house.

368
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:49,752
Ko Na-kyung, whose side are you on?

369
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:52,166
I need information to pick a side.

370
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:55,649
Do you think I would put up with all
of this if I was going to leave?

371
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:58,947
- See? You were lying.
- What?

372
00:34:59,518 --> 00:35:02,291
You're excited right now.

373
00:35:03,307 --> 00:35:06,052
If you want to become a women
in this household, you

374
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:08,614
can't get excited, no
matter what happens to you.

375
00:35:10,345 --> 00:35:14,486
And, no matter how urgent
you are, lies don't last long.

376
00:35:15,135 --> 00:35:17,627
I told you I'm not going to leave.

377
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:20,595
Besides that, is there anything
else you're lying about?

378
00:35:22,682 --> 00:35:26,481
- What?
- You insist it's not true until you can't, and then

379
00:35:26,786 --> 00:35:30,252
when you get caught, you beg for
forgiveness. Isn't that low?

380
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:34,173
- Isn't that your specialty?
- E-Excuse me?

381
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:40,705
She still hasn't learned her lesson.

382
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:57,842
You haven't been answering
my calls for the past

383
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,502
few days, so this is my
last text message to you.

384
00:36:01,182 --> 00:36:07,767
Even if we never meet again, forget
about someone like me and be happy.

385
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:23,284
What are you doing?

386
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:29,173
"Don't bother me and
focus on your business.

387
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:32,666
You should act your age. What
do you think you're doing?"

388
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:42,955
What are you doing? What are
you going to say to her?

389
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:54,314
Where are you going right now?

390
00:36:54,408 --> 00:36:57,494
- Let me say one thing to her.
- What are you going to say?

391
00:36:57,635 --> 00:37:01,486
I just need a moment. I'm going
to see her and say one thing.

392
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:05,144
- What are you going to say?
- Honey, please let me go.

393
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,666
I can't sleep like this! I'm begging you!

394
00:37:07,854 --> 00:37:11,798
I just have to say one thing to her.
You saw her text earlier.

395
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:15,033
I haven't answered her phone
for the past few days.

396
00:37:15,377 --> 00:37:17,275
- Go back to bed.
- Honey.

397
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:23,533
Please let me go. It's my last request.
Please? Honey.

398
00:37:24,126 --> 00:37:28,915
- Please. Honey.
- Mother! Mother! Mother!

399
00:37:33,822 --> 00:37:37,775
What's that noise? Did someone call for me?

400
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:39,986
What's going on?

401
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:43,173
Mother! Mother!

402
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:51,384
He said he's going to that woman!

403
00:37:51,861 --> 00:37:53,173
At this hour?

404
00:37:55,502 --> 00:37:57,439
- Where are you going?
- Out for a bit.

405
00:37:57,815 --> 00:38:00,595
You're crazy! You're crazy! You're crazy!

406
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:06,955
Mom, I need to go. I need to go
and tell her one last thing.

407
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,306
Tell her one last thing?

408
00:38:09,447 --> 00:38:10,955
Stop being stupid and go back inside.

409
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,142
Mom, please let me go!

410
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:20,041
Mother, did you see that?
He's totally out of his mind!

411
00:38:20,252 --> 00:38:23,556
Go back inside. Go back
to your room right now!

412
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:28,080
Hold on. What is that one last thing
you need to say to her? Let's hear it.

413
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:35,713
Tell us! If it's something that she
should hear, I'll go tell her.

414
00:38:36,174 --> 00:38:42,559
I want to tell her,
"You were born to be loved."

415
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:48,541
- What?
- He's totally lost it.

416
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:52,213
"You were born to be loved?"

417
00:38:53,502 --> 00:39:01,213
- Do you want to die in my hands?
- Hey! Calm down!

418
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:08,556
She's been so hurt in life that
she doesn't know her own value.

419
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,697
She can be loved if she just
meets the right person!

420
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:22,252
I just want to tell her to have
courage, so what's wrong with that?

421
00:39:22,424 --> 00:39:24,424
How dare you raise your voice!

422
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:32,306
That person is the one who taught me
that even someone like me can be loved.

423
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,658
"That person?"

424
00:39:34,064 --> 00:39:37,002
What heartbroken people like us ...

425
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:42,752
desperately want is sincerely deep love.

426
00:39:44,361 --> 00:39:46,189
What else is love?

427
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,533
That rascal!

428
00:39:52,471 --> 00:39:58,431
I-I think he needs psychological treatment.
I should take him to my doctor friend.

429
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:04,423
- W-what?
- I think he needs treatment, too.

430
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:10,486
His brain became overloaded after
being beaten up by you and me.

431
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:15,970
Or else, how could he say
such things to me fearless?

432
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:20,486
- He doesn't need a doctor!-
He's not in his right mind!

433
00:40:20,511 --> 00:40:22,822
Do you think taking him to a
doctor will fix everything?

434
00:40:23,424 --> 00:40:25,267
What do you think the doctor will say?

435
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:28,094
He'll want to check your brain first for

436
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,947
bringing your husband in
for having an affair!

437
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,860
I feel like I'm going to die because
my pride has been so wounded.

438
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:41,892
I can't... I can't breathe.
Mother, please help me!

439
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:48,244
Sweetie! Oh, no! Get a hold of yourself!

440
00:40:49,423 --> 00:40:51,314
What do we do?

441
00:40:53,135 --> 00:40:55,056
Sweetie, calm down.

442
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,010
Goodness.

443
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:02,970
I guess Bong-soo is a man, too, to
be stirring up this kind of trouble.

444
00:41:04,515 --> 00:41:08,595
But he's having an affair
that's just like him.

445
00:41:08,822 --> 00:41:13,314
It's so clumsy. Why the heck is he
looking for sincere, deep love?

446
00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:20,041
Goodness. If he was smart, do you think
he would have fallen for such a woman?

447
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:24,251
I bet he got into an affair while
eating free food at the tented vendor.

448
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:28,564
- You know he loves food.
- I think so, too.

449
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:30,533
I'm right.

450
00:41:33,736 --> 00:41:35,220
Are you really not going to sleep?

451
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:40,072
What's wrong with you?

452
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:46,728
I'm sorry. I can't control
my feelings either.

453
00:41:48,877 --> 00:41:53,266
- Do you want to get a divorce? Do you?
- Do whatever you want.

454
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:09,008
- Now I realize what is
missing in our marriage life.
- What?

455
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:12,392
I thought I loved you.

456
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:20,986
Of course, to me, you're a
proud and respectable wife.

457
00:42:21,422 --> 00:42:23,672
Then that's enough. What more do you want?

458
00:42:24,032 --> 00:42:28,289
However, to be honest,

459
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:32,907
you've never thought
you couldn't live without me.

460
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:39,618
- What?
- All this time, I wasn't even a man.

461
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,336
All I thought was how to not get
scolded and criticized by you.

462
00:42:49,188 --> 00:42:52,946
That's not what a man's love is.

463
00:42:59,524 --> 00:43:04,305
Fine! Let's divorce!
We can just get a divorce!

464
00:43:17,235 --> 00:43:19,399
- I'll be going.
- Without eating breakfast?

465
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,899
We need to get a divorce.

466
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:32,868
What?

467
00:43:33,624 --> 00:43:36,476
Then should I pettily cling
onto him in this situation?

468
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:40,594
Sweetie, why are you
taking this so seriously?

469
00:43:41,188 --> 00:43:45,914
Even though he likes that woman,
do you think he would divorce you?

470
00:43:46,344 --> 00:43:50,742
You don't know half the truth. He said
that woman can't live without him.

471
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:54,502
What? Where did he get that from?

472
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:58,072
He said he finally realized
what a man's love is.

473
00:43:58,097 --> 00:44:01,901
- He really does need psychological treatment.
- No, he doesn't!

474
00:44:05,323 --> 00:44:06,656
That darn woman!

475
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,018
Hi, Mr. Jung.

476
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:29,611
Hi. It's been a while. It's good to
see you, but what brings you here?

477
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,752
I just came because I thought of you.

478
00:44:32,025 --> 00:44:34,276
Really? I'm glad you came.

479
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:37,221
- I can come see you sometimes, can't I?
- Of course.

480
00:44:38,464 --> 00:44:40,869
Honestly, I missed you, too.

481
00:44:41,206 --> 00:44:44,760
Even though I can't be with Hae-dang,
should I just become your adopted son?

482
00:44:45,034 --> 00:44:47,604
I'd love to have a son like you.

483
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:53,565
But you have your father, so you
shouldn't even joke like that.

484
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:04,065
To be honest, I'm not close to my father.

485
00:45:04,713 --> 00:45:08,919
It's not easy for older men
to be close to their fathers.

486
00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:11,463
It's the same for everyone.

487
00:45:11,799 --> 00:45:15,377
My father is very different from you.

488
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,924
No, he's not. He just expresses
himself differently.

489
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:25,424
My mother died because of him.

490
00:45:26,385 --> 00:45:30,916
My wife died early because
of my incompetence, too.

491
00:45:31,893 --> 00:45:33,158
That's not what I mean.

492
00:45:33,674 --> 00:45:36,611
There are many difficult
relationships in the world.

493
00:45:37,018 --> 00:45:39,299
Mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law
are difficult, too.

494
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:45,416
However, fathers and sons become very
awkward once something goes wrong.

495
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:49,260
All mothers-in-law and
daughters-in-law can do is argue.

496
00:45:50,057 --> 00:45:55,197
But for fathers and sons, they won't
even be able to talk to each other.

497
00:45:56,714 --> 00:46:00,283
I feel peaceful after seeing you.

498
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:04,893
Come by often. Keep this
a secret from others.

499
00:46:05,415 --> 00:46:08,885
- Let's just see each other secretly.
- I'd like that.

500
00:46:09,315 --> 00:46:10,315
Good.

501
00:46:11,128 --> 00:46:14,197
Do you get along with Kyung-soo?

502
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:17,838
- He's like my youngest son.
- You're making me jealous.

503
00:46:18,034 --> 00:46:20,510
He's a good and pure boy.

504
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,283
Oh, what brings you here?

505
00:46:29,518 --> 00:46:33,158
I brought some juice with ice for you.
It's cold, so you should drink it.

506
00:46:33,534 --> 00:46:35,752
Okay. Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

507
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,361
- Hello.
- Hello.

508
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:45,111
I passed by to get some gas
and came in to say hi to him.

509
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:52,401
- I'll be going then.
- All right. Good-bye.

510
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,768
Bye.

511
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:04,135
- Hello? Yes.
- Excuse me.

512
00:47:07,565 --> 00:47:10,291
Would you like to have
some tea before you go?

513
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:23,494
I'll be going now. I'll see
you later at your house.

514
00:47:23,745 --> 00:47:27,486
- Okay. See you later. Thanks for the juice.
- You're welcome.

515
00:47:40,728 --> 00:47:44,588
I didn't talk about much with Mr. Jung.
You're not concerned, are you?

516
00:47:46,284 --> 00:47:49,986
I heard you're making a song for Hae-dang.

517
00:47:51,424 --> 00:47:52,891
I wanted to thank you.

518
00:47:55,924 --> 00:47:57,424
To be honest, it's not going well.

519
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,783
Is Yoo Ji-na getting in the way again?

520
00:48:03,674 --> 00:48:06,385
I don't think so, but who knows?

521
00:48:07,213 --> 00:48:09,822
They've been enemies for a long time.

522
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:13,690
Did something happen between them?

523
00:48:17,245 --> 00:48:20,791
It seems like Hae-dang didn't tell you.
It's not my place to tell you then.

524
00:48:22,893 --> 00:48:26,979
Does it make you uncomfortable that
Hae-dang is working at my agency?

525
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:31,980
Of course, I can't insist
that I'm investing

526
00:48:32,004 --> 00:48:34,745
into her solely because she has potential.

527
00:48:36,229 --> 00:48:41,760
However, I'm able to differentiate
between work and private life.

528
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:44,089
All right.

529
00:48:45,753 --> 00:48:49,135
I think I said what you wanted
to hear, so I can go now, right?

530
00:48:49,862 --> 00:48:51,565
Yes, I'm sorry. You must be busy.

531
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:16,502
Baekhan Group's youngest
daughter got a divorce.

532
00:49:17,815 --> 00:49:22,221
She has no kids and is a university
professor. What more do you want?

533
00:49:23,635 --> 00:49:25,229
I said we should eat together sometime.

534
00:49:26,026 --> 00:49:27,729
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

535
00:49:28,362 --> 00:49:35,471
I may not be able to marry Ji-na, but if
that happens, I won't marry anyone else.

536
00:49:36,205 --> 00:49:38,405
- What?
- Just keep that in mind.

537
00:49:39,714 --> 00:49:43,643
Do you really want me to drag
her out with my own hands?

538
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:46,182
Should I hire people and
have her dragged out?

539
00:49:46,424 --> 00:49:51,018
If you do that, we'll just
register our marriage.

540
00:49:51,995 --> 00:49:58,190
- What?- You can stop us by wreaking
havoc at our engagement and wedding.

541
00:49:58,987 --> 00:50:03,010
However, if we secretly register for
marriage, how will you stop us?

542
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,049
Are you trying to scare me?

543
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:12,361
If you're not trying to scare me,
you can just go ahead and secretly do it.

544
00:50:13,049 --> 00:50:16,151
Why would you give me a hint?

545
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:22,596
You're troubled, aren't you?
You must be troubled.

546
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:24,721
Why would I be troubled?

547
00:50:25,174 --> 00:50:27,781
Do you think I'm keeping
quiet because I don't know?

548
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:30,885
I'm holding back because
I don't have proof.

549
00:50:32,003 --> 00:50:34,697
That way, I can teach you
a proper lesson later.

550
00:50:36,815 --> 00:50:38,705
How did you find a vulgar thing like that?

551
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:42,354
Just because you wear a human mask
doesn't mean that you're human.

552
00:50:42,379 --> 00:50:44,002
What on earth are you talking about?

553
00:50:44,448 --> 00:50:48,791
Make sure you hide it well
so that I can never find it.

554
00:50:54,479 --> 00:51:01,084
- Really?
- She's not saying it outright,
but she definitely knows something.

555
00:51:03,784 --> 00:51:07,401
I tried to keep her from finding
out, but in the end, she did.

556
00:51:08,487 --> 00:51:12,167
Then what do we do? What if your
mother does another interview?

557
00:51:13,018 --> 00:51:15,096
Your career as a singer is over anyways.

558
00:51:15,635 --> 00:51:19,174
You don't have to worry about
losing popularity over the rumors.

559
00:51:22,776 --> 00:51:24,986
Your son just has to keep his mouth shut.

560
00:51:26,893 --> 00:51:29,291
As long as he keeps quiet, who
can do anything about it?

561
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:31,924
We can just play innocent.

562
00:51:34,495 --> 00:51:36,549
We don't have as much time
as we thought we did.

563
00:51:37,229 --> 00:51:40,600
If my mother knows about
this, that means it's only a

564
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:43,807
matter of time before
something is about to happen.

565
00:51:56,628 --> 00:51:57,695
We need to talk.

566
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,981
- F-For what?- Why are you shaking?

567
00:52:01,823 --> 00:52:02,823
I'm not.

568
00:52:05,284 --> 00:52:10,420
Ever since the incident with
the will, for no special reason,

569
00:52:10,445 --> 00:52:15,105
I get scared when
you want to talk to me.

570
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:19,979
Do you still want to be forgiven by me?

571
00:52:21,135 --> 00:52:22,135
Of course.

572
00:52:22,854 --> 00:52:24,635
What is my mother up to?

573
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:30,635
To be more exact, what did my
mother put you up to nowadays?

574
00:52:32,135 --> 00:52:38,747
To be more specific, how
much did you tell her?

575
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:42,486
What does grandmother know about?

576
00:52:43,182 --> 00:52:46,010
You really don't know anything?

577
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:51,486
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

578
00:52:53,565 --> 00:52:56,565
Did my mother not use her
to find out something?

579
00:53:13,112 --> 00:53:15,416
I don't think I have much time on my hands.

580
00:53:20,854 --> 00:53:23,557
Did you find out anything
more about that child yet?

581
00:53:24,299 --> 00:53:26,966
- May I ask you something?
- What is it?

582
00:53:27,753 --> 00:53:31,553
Number one. You accept Yoo Ji-na
as your daughter-in-law.

583
00:53:32,596 --> 00:53:39,589
Number two. You give the company
to Hyun-sung instead of Hyun-joon.

584
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:44,244
Number one or number two?
Which one will you choose?

585
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:49,822
- What?
- Number one or number two?
Which one will you choose?

586
00:53:50,221 --> 00:53:53,510
- I'll choose number three.
- There's no number three.

587
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,041
- Of course there is.
- What is it?

588
00:53:56,424 --> 00:54:01,518
Get rid of you first and then get rid of
that vulgar thing in the annex later.

589
00:54:03,128 --> 00:54:06,518
- Excuse me?
- You found out something
about that child, didn't you?

590
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:12,143
- No, I didn't.
- Yet, you dare try to make a bargain with me?

591
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:13,870
I would never.

592
00:54:14,737 --> 00:54:16,752
You rude brat.

593
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:20,089
I protected you from being kicked out

594
00:54:20,114 --> 00:54:22,557
by my son,
so how dare you pull this stunt on me?

595
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:27,565
Spill it right now. What did you find out?

596
00:54:28,635 --> 00:54:32,533
If I dig into it myself and find
something, you'll be the first one to die!

597
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:38,971
The facts we can find out
with money are meaningless.

598
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:43,704
- What?
- They're useless.

599
00:54:44,736 --> 00:54:51,993
Yoo Ji-na is no longer a popular star who
can be struck down with just a few rumors.

600
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:58,134
What we need right now
aren't other people's words.

601
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:05,009
Then are you saying the only thing you know
is what you haven't heard from others?

602
00:55:05,767 --> 00:55:07,884
I found this out by using my brain.

603
00:55:08,689 --> 00:55:12,054
To be more exact, I was using my brain
for something else, but coincidentally enough,

604
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,400
I found out about this and was
able to kill two birds with one stone.

605
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:21,462
- And what's that?
- So please choose.
Is it number one or number two?

606
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:24,837
Don't you think you're a bit empty-headed?

607
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:27,767
What are you trying to do against me?

608
00:55:28,399 --> 00:55:31,446
I'm not empty-headed. It's
because there's no time.

609
00:55:32,017 --> 00:55:34,548
This card becomes less
effective as time goes on.

610
00:55:35,111 --> 00:55:38,642
We won't be able to use
it for either me or you.

611
00:55:39,994 --> 00:55:45,407
I'm sure she knows something crucial.

612
00:56:07,111 --> 00:56:08,681
Where are you going at this hour?

613
00:56:10,681 --> 00:56:12,829
I can't go to sleep, so
I'm going for a drive.

614
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:14,821
Seems like you're not drinking lately.

615
00:56:16,986 --> 00:56:18,119
What's it to you?

616
00:56:18,314 --> 00:56:19,642
How tear-jerking.

617
00:56:20,244 --> 00:56:25,540
You wanted to be his woman so badly, so
why did you refuse him in the beginning?

618
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:29,954
Mind your own business. I won't
answer any of your questions.

619
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:13,755
Do you remember the name Kim Hae-jung?

620
00:57:14,451 --> 00:57:19,088
I repeated the name a thousand times to
myself so that I wouldn't forget it.

621
00:57:19,818 --> 00:57:24,802
I thought I would find you one day
as long as I remembered that name.

622
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:30,513
That's why, even when I was little,
I knew I shouldn't forget it.

623
00:59:07,904 --> 00:59:09,349
You two can never be together.

624
00:59:10,185 --> 00:59:13,653
Don't regret by falling in love with
each other more and break up with him.

625
00:59:13,873 --> 00:59:18,485
You should give me a reason before
you say that. Am I that easy to you?

626
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:24,220
Am I just someone who should do as you say?

627
00:59:25,548 --> 00:59:27,588
Since I was able to make
a living because of you?

628
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:30,095
Since I'm still making a
living because of you?

629
00:59:33,876 --> 00:59:35,048
Let me make myself clear.

630
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:40,921
- Kyung-soo and I won't break up.
- What?

631
00:59:41,155 --> 00:59:47,040
- What right do you have to get worked up?
- Who are you to always meddle in my life?

632
00:59:48,236 --> 00:59:51,688
I shudder because of you! I wake up in
the middle of the night because of you!

633
00:59:52,314 --> 00:59:54,188
Please disappear from my life! Please!

634
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:11,962
You have the same voice as someone I know.

635
01:00:13,259 --> 01:00:16,571
You have the same voice as someone
I know when she was younger.

636
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:22,899
Especially your singing voice.

637
01:00:40,892 --> 01:00:46,303
The one who has the same singing
voice as me is your mom, right?

638
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:18,439
Why are you here?

639
01:01:19,236 --> 01:01:21,345
- Is your father home?
- What do you want?

640
01:01:21,603 --> 01:01:26,156
I wanted to apologize for what happened
last time. The money envelope incident.

641
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,517
- He went to the gas station.
- Where is it?

642
01:01:30,782 --> 01:01:33,735
I'm just going to apologize to him and go.

643
01:01:37,087 --> 01:01:38,087
Good-bye!

644
01:01:43,452 --> 01:01:44,452
Welcome!

645
01:01:47,244 --> 01:01:49,157
Did you have a good time at the event?

646
01:01:49,423 --> 01:01:51,720
I got a lot of greens at the
Wild Edible Greens Festival.

647
01:01:51,745 --> 01:01:53,446
I wanted to give some to your employees.

648
01:01:53,471 --> 01:01:58,188
Oh, really? Good thinking. Mr. Kim,
come here! I have greens for you!

649
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:02,548
Gather around!

650
01:02:02,573 --> 01:02:05,938
Goodness. Why is there so much?

651
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:09,493
Wild edible greens? What
wild edible greens?

652
01:02:13,353 --> 01:02:15,001
Isn't she the singer Yoo Ji-na?

653
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:23,556
Why are you here?

654
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:26,892
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

655
01:02:28,673 --> 01:02:32,274
- What bought you here?
- I have something to tell you.

656
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,157
Okay, then. Come in for a bit.

657
01:02:35,564 --> 01:02:39,665
No. I think it would be better
if I just told you here.

658
01:02:41,369 --> 01:02:42,798
What did you come here to say?

659
01:02:43,353 --> 01:02:45,620
How did you educate your daughter?

660
01:02:46,947 --> 01:02:47,947
Pardon?

661
01:02:48,369 --> 01:02:49,751
What are you trying to say?

662
01:02:49,947 --> 01:02:54,157
- She may be a performer at a nightclub...
- My daughter is a singer.

663
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,985
That's wrapping it up nicely. Do
you really think she's a singer?

664
01:02:57,251 --> 01:02:59,001
She's no different than a nightclub dancer.

665
01:03:01,267 --> 01:03:04,385
No matter how desperate you
are for money, are you just

666
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:07,526
going to watch your daughter
hit on every man she meets?

667
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,446
What do you think you're doing?

668
01:03:10,697 --> 01:03:12,564
Please come inside and talk.

669
01:03:12,697 --> 01:03:16,074
There's a rumor in the industry
that she's in an inappropriate

670
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:19,368
relationship with the agency CEO
just to succeed as a singer.

671
01:03:20,681 --> 01:03:25,211
What's so inappropriate about a single
man and a single woman being together?

672
01:03:25,517 --> 01:03:28,743
So are you thinking of getting
her married to Park Hyun-joon?

673
01:03:29,869 --> 01:03:35,343
- That's not the case, but...
- I heard she's marrying a different man.

674
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:36,470
Is that not true?

675
01:03:41,392 --> 01:03:45,827
I came here because the industry
people told me to warn her

676
01:03:45,853 --> 01:03:50,361
about her inappropriate behavior
when she's singing my songs!

677
01:03:51,173 --> 01:03:52,681
Do you understand what I'm saying?

678
01:03:54,556 --> 01:03:55,556
Follow me.

679
01:03:57,290 --> 01:04:01,321
No matter how poor you are, shouldn't you
teach your daughter some proper manners?

680
01:04:01,346 --> 01:04:02,346
Come here!

681
01:04:10,486 --> 01:04:16,243
I clearly told you before. You can mess
with me, but you can't mess with my family!

682
01:04:16,509 --> 01:04:18,813
I told you to break up with him.
Why aren't you doing it?

683
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:21,834
Fine. It's my sin for making a living from

684
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:25,064
singing your songs,
so I should listen to you.

685
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:28,902
However, what did my father do so wrong
that you had to create a scene back there?

686
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,681
- So break up with him.
- Let me ask you one last time.

687
01:04:33,392 --> 01:04:36,134
Why are you so desperate to
break Kyung-soo and me apart?

688
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:42,524
Is Kyung-soo your son?

689
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:47,313
Is he the son you gave
birth to and abandoned?

690
01:04:48,783 --> 01:04:54,751
If you know that, you must realize that
you and Kyung-soo can never be together.

691
01:05:05,158 --> 01:05:07,985
- Why not?
- Are you seriously asking me that?

692
01:05:09,564 --> 01:05:13,071
You were with Jo Sung-taek like
a married couple for ten years,

693
01:05:13,759 --> 01:05:15,774
so how can you marry my son?

694
01:05:16,767 --> 01:05:17,767
Why can't I?

695
01:05:20,868 --> 01:05:23,774
Did you forget what kind of relationship
Jo Sung-taek and I were in?

696
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:27,329
No. I remember very clearly.

697
01:05:28,054 --> 01:05:29,407
However, why does it matter?

698
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:36,337
- Kyung-soo doesn't acknowledge you
as his mother anyways.
- What?

699
01:05:37,126 --> 01:05:39,223
He told me you have nothing to do with him.

700
01:05:40,986 --> 01:05:42,999
He told me you will have
nothing to do with him.

701
01:05:43,236 --> 01:05:44,806
Do you think that makes it true?

702
01:05:44,962 --> 01:05:46,427
I'll have no reason to see you,

703
01:05:47,587 --> 01:05:50,946
so I just have to keep this
buried in my heart forever.

704
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,860
- What?
- Then you tell him yourself.

705
01:05:55,587 --> 01:05:59,927
That you told the woman who lived off of your
songs to give up her husband-like boyfriend

706
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:04,454
so you can live with him for fun
as a means of repaying her debt to you!

707
01:06:08,134 --> 01:06:09,985
All the insults I suffered from you.

708
01:06:11,705 --> 01:06:13,790
All the humiliation I felt because of you.

709
01:06:15,603 --> 01:06:17,376
Now I can pay you back for all of that.

710
01:06:19,907 --> 01:06:20,907
Because now...

711
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:26,150
I'm your son's woman.

712
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,634
(You Are Too Much)

713
01:07:03,845 --> 01:07:05,610
I have no intention of giving Kyung-soo up.

714
01:07:05,635 --> 01:07:08,508
Should I get on my knees?
There's nothing I can't do for my son.

715
01:07:08,533 --> 01:07:11,142
Just crush me with power instead.
That suits you more.

716
01:07:11,167 --> 01:07:13,651
If you want to live as my mother,
you need to accept Hae-dang.

717
01:07:13,675 --> 01:07:16,486
How can you say that
to me when you're my son?

718
01:07:16,512 --> 01:07:18,721
I became spiteful because
I was born as your son.

719
01:07:18,745 --> 01:07:21,229
What kind of person will
you remember me as?

720
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:23,892
As someone I was always sorry to.
Thank you for everything.

721
01:07:23,917 --> 01:07:26,673
How dare you show off when you can't
even handle your own husband?

722
01:07:26,698 --> 01:07:28,884
She scolded me!

723
01:07:28,909 --> 01:07:30,665
Apologize to my daughter-in-law!

724
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:34,204
Are you mocking me?
Grandmother, I can't eat the noodles.

725
01:07:34,229 --> 01:07:36,712
Get up. Don't you even dare lift
your face up in front of her.

726
01:07:36,737 --> 01:07:39,704
You're annoyed she had indecent
desires for Hyun-joon, right?

727
01:07:39,729 --> 01:07:40,774
You get up, too.

728
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:44,032
You insolent thing.
Tell me what you know right now!

729
01:07:44,172 --> 01:07:46,351
I must meet your son.

730
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:48,375
