00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,790
This looks great on you.

4
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,310
This color looks amazing on you.

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,090
I like it.

6
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,000
When did you get here?

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,780
Good luck.

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,160
- Did you enjoy the food?
- Yes, it was good.

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,810
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

10
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,560
Gosh, I'm busy.

11
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,740
- Hey, it's your turn. Go ahead.
- Okay.

12
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,080
Hey, hurry.

13
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,770
Come on, hurry up.

14
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,030
Thank you.

15
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,830
- Yes?
- We're going to start shooting.

16
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:47,780
<i>You don't need to tell me.
I can already feel it.</i>

17
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:55,840
<i>Your sad eyes said everything.</i>

18
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,340
Next up is the famous pop singer
Yoo Ji Na's impersonator, Yoo Jui Na.

19
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,510
Let's give it up for her!

20
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,760
Hi, guys!

21
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,190
I'm the fake Yoo Ji Na, Yoo Jui Na.

22
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,160
Wish me luck, guys.
Hope you have fun tonight.

23
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,330
<i>That's right, everything has changed,
just like that.</i>

24
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,270
<i>You knew that the end was coming.</i>

25
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,230
<i>But that's okay. Our love and the
beautiful time we spent together. </i>

26
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,980
<i>I'm already grateful for that.</i>

27
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,420
<i>Before you see tears
running down my face</i>

28
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,240
<i>please go away and leave me.</i>

29
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,360
<i>Or I might hold onto you.
I might beg you.</i>

30
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,030
<i>I'm afraid, to tell you the truth.</i>

31
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,340
<i>Kiss me for the last time,
and hug me for the last time.</i>

32
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,200
<i>I will wait for you forever</i>.

33
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,400
<i>Even if you are far from me,
I can still feel you.</i>

34
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,290
<i>I will only love you. Forever.</i>

35
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,970
How was I? Just like her?

36
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,820
You were just like her!

37
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,460
Let me do the face that
Yoo Ji Na is best known for.

38
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,870
With your eyes half open like this...

39
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,770
To put it bluntly, just like
when you're on drugs.

40
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,680
How do I look? Sexy?

41
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,560
The real trick here is to make your eyes
look as dreamy as possible.

42
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,970
If you really think about it, guys are
attracted to women who look tipsy.

43
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,260
- Is that right? Do you agree, mister?
- I love it!

44
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,490
He really likes it.

45
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,840
You just love watching me, don't you?

46
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:04,360
God forbid my family finds out this is
how I make money to support myself.

47
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,130
Next up is a new song.

48
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,610
A fake singer has a new song, too.
Yoo Jui Na's brand new song.

49
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,170
A masterpiece rip-off
of Yoo Ji Na's new song.

50
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,010
I'm going to sing "Emerald."
Let's go!

51
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,130
Enough with the fake one!
Get me the real one!

52
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,000
Yoo Ji Na, my ass!

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,960
How dare you try to fool us?

54
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,450
I wish you'd thrown money
at me instead.

55
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,990
Because if you did, I'd have shown
you a really hot performance.

56
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,300
Anyway, thanks for the banana!

57
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,000
What? Are you teasing me?

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,320
Come here!

59
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,610
Hey!

60
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,400
She's teasing me!
Tell her to get over here.

61
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,460
Please...

62
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,690
<i>With tears... I'm breaking up
although I love you.</i>

63
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,730
<i>I can forget all of our memories.</i>

64
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,100
<i>What we had didn't mean
anything to me.</i>

65
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,520
<i>You never made me happy.</i>

66
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,910
<i>I cried all night.</i>

67
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,760
<i>I held onto you, asking you
how I'm going to live without you.</i>

68
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,780
<i>But all you say in return
is "cheer up."</i>

69
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,780
<i>Such a cliche.</i>

70
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,870
<i>[The 32nd Graduation Ceremony
of Dong Soong University]</i>

71
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,930
Ta-da! Congrats on your graduation,
my baby sister-in-law!

72
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,710
Congrats!

73
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,230
Do you want to take a picture
with this cap on?

74
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,410
Sure, why not?

75
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,180
Wow.

76
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,270
Do I look cool?

77
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,310
You look like a college president.

78
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,400
Me too, me too!
Congrats, my baby girl!

79
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,700
Mom, this is your son's sister-in-law's
graduation. Why are you making a fuss?

80
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,970
Get back here!

81
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,120
- Why?
- Just come here.

82
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,980
What's the matter with you?

83
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,230
By the way, where's your big sister?
Why don't you call her, honey?

84
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,310
All right.

85
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,810
Should we just take a picture without her
and tell her to meet us at the cafeteria?

86
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,940
Of course not. We'll wait for her.

87
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,260
It is because of her that
we have this glory today.

88
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,370
- She's right there!
- Sister-in-law! Right here!

89
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,700
Auntie!

90
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,500
- Sorry, sorry.
- Come here.

91
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,710
Gosh, the traffic was awful!

92
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,890
I got off at the intersection
and ran up here.

93
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,980
Hae Soo, congrats on graduating.

94
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,120
It's all on you, big sis.

95
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,240
Now that I've seen
my baby sister finish college

96
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,430
I feel like all of my wishes
have come true.

97
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,320
Do you want to take a picture
wearing this cap?

98
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,640
I'm good. I already took pictures on
Hae Jin and Hae Sung's graduation day.

99
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,580
How could you say that?

100
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,240
You were like a mother to them.

101
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,550
There you go.

102
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,640
What are you doing? Take a picture.

103
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,310
All right. Please look at me.

104
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,590
One, two, three...

105
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,550
- With me, too.
- Me too, me too!

106
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,900
Okay, stand close to each other.

107
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,690
Okay, here we go.

108
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,720
One, two, three.

109
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,980
Cheers!

110
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,900
When you guys get older

111
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,730
don't ever ignore your big sister
because she didn't go to college.

112
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,370
That'd make me turn in my grave.

113
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,350
Come on, Dad...

114
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,200
She couldn't even go to college herself.

115
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,590
But because of her pathetic father,
she had to support all of her sisters...

116
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:29,020
Father-in-law, why do you say
something like that on a day like this?

117
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,760
All right, all right.

118
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,410
Then let's have a moment of silence
to appreciate everything

119
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,410
Hae Dang has done for us.

120
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,920
A moment of silence?

121
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,170
Did someone die or something?

122
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,750
Huh? Oh... right.

123
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,840
Okay, then. The lunch is on me today!

124
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,340
Actually, I mean...
today, Hae Sung...

125
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,180
Hae Sung will treat us today!
Let's give it up for her!

126
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,160
Why are you dragging me into this?

127
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,250
That's right. Today, you should
pay for the food.

128
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,760
I hear that high school teacher is
the most popular job these days.

129
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,730
A high school teacher,
and a college professor.

130
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,800
It is true that
"happiness starts at home."

131
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,970
Am I using this expression correctly?

132
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,490
Why don't you stop talking and eat?
Before the meat is all gone.

133
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,350
You've also helped us a lot, Mrs. Baek.
You know I'm always grateful, right?

134
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,340
There's no need to thank me.

135
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,000
But since we're on that topic...

136
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,960
Who made breakfast for you
every morning instead of your mother

137
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,300
when you were a senior in high school?

138
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,620
It was me who made you
breakfast every morning.

139
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,530
Isn't that true, Mr. Jung?

140
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,890
Of course it is, Mrs. Baek.

141
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:49,080
Chiming in whenever you get a chance...
You are the Queen of Immodesty.

142
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,190
Immodesty?

143
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,950
We are grateful for your service.

144
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,300
Happy now?

145
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,400
"Happy now?" That's how you
talk to your daughter's in-law?

146
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,480
Even when we were in grade school

147
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,300
she offered me half of her bread
and rattled on about it for a year!

148
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,540
"Rattled on"?

149
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,730
Are you done talking, Mr. Jung?

150
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,030
Of course I'm not done yet, Mrs. Baek.

151
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,410
After lending me her crayons in
art class, she talked about it

152
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,040
until graduation. Complaining that
I used all of her crayons.

153
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,960
Did I say anything that's
not true, Mrs. Baek?

154
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,140
When did I do such things?

155
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,420
Gosh, that's enough, you guys.

156
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,610
You all did a great job.

157
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,860
Great job, Father-in-law.
And great job, Mom.

158
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,000
And especially Hae Dang!
You've been an amazing sister to them.

159
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,080
It's hard to find a big sister
like you these days.

160
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,640
Okay, we should fill our glasses.

161
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,530
Mom.

162
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,540
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

You have a dinner appointment
with Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

174
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,560
Next time, just come up with an excuse
and don't make appointments.

175
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,380
What are we getting out
of it anyway?

176
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,830
He's a prominent figure
in the business world.

177
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,050
Maybe he'd be able
to help you with something.

178
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,530
You've become too talkative.

179
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,210
I'm sorry.

180
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,930
Welcome.

181
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,910
Did I keep you waiting for too long?

182
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,040
It wasn't long enough to make me bored.

183
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,740
Fans are supposed to wait
for the star, no?

184
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,010
I'm a huge fan of yours, Ji Na.
A huge fan.

185
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,750
It's an incredible honor to be loved
by someone like you, Chairman.

186
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,080
Let's keep talking as we eat.
I'm hungry.

187
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,760
Please start serving the food.

188
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,240
Thank you for treating me with
amazing meals every time.

189
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,060
Oh, this is nothing.

190
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,060
As long as it isn't inconvenient for
you, I can arrange this anytime.

191
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,150
But it is inconvenient for me.

192
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,390
I'm not the type of person who
likes coming to such a fancy place

193
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,010
just to have a meal.

194
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,040
You are really something.

195
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,740
I'm not a very fancy person.

196
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,170
After a meal like this, I usually
go home and eat kimchi and rice

197
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,700
to comfort my stomach.
My stomach can't handle greasy food.

198
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,410
Oh.

199
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,000
Please take a look.

200
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,650
I'm not sure if it'd be useful.

201
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,790
My goodness! What is this?

202
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,880
This could easily cost
the price of an apartment.

203
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,430
I heard this is a very rare item.

204
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,710
But I got it because I thought
it'd look great on you, Ji Na.

205
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,770
So, do you like it?

206
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,080
It's not too bad.

207
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,510
But I think
it'd look better on your wife.

208
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,280
I think it would make me look
a bit too old, don't you think?

209
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,770
Oh, you really had to go there,
didn't you?

210
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,660
How is your wife doing?

211
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,290
You mean, "why is this
married guy hitting on me?"

212
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,200
Her health was getting worse,
so she moved to our summer house.

213
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,830
She is in critical condition.

214
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,280
I have to be somewhere.
Thank you for the meal.

215
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,400
Why are you taking things
so seriously? We aren't that young.

216
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,740
Why can't you just
take it as it comes?

217
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,270
As it comes?
What do you mean by that?

218
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,770
Stop playing hard to get.
You're already cute the way you are.

219
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,780
It's been over 10 years
since I slept with a guy.

220
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,710
I don't think I can help you.
Sorry about that.

221
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,210
I'm... someone who
gets what I want in life.

222
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,870
You think I'm just saying sweet things
to women because I can't force them?

223
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,810
Force them?
How would you do that?

224
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,510
Oh, boy.

225
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,480
Why do you hate me so much? Why?

226
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,290
Thank you for taking the time
to meet me. Sorry I'm leaving so early.

227
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,920
So tired.

228
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,890
I said not to follow me,
just go home.

229
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,500
- What are you going to do?
- I need to go somewhere.

230
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,640
Where are you going?

231
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,580
Did I commit a crime or something?
Why do you have so many questions?

232
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,670
Where are you going alone at night?

233
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,580
Those paparazzi keep
taking photos at night...

234
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,700
I told you
you've become too talkative.

235
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,260
I'll come pick you up tomorrow.

236
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,560
<i>Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.</i>

237
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,030
<i>Happy birthday to Kyung Soo.</i>

238
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,810
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

239
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,150
Blow it out.

240
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,660
Happy birthday, Kyung Soo.

241
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,160
Happy birthday!

242
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,730
Mom, are you happy that
I'm your son?

243
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,120
Of course I'm happy.

244
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,080
I'm also really happy that
you're my mom.

245
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,500
Come here, my pumpkin.

246
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,280
<i>Kyung Soo, happy birthday!</i>

247
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,210
<i>My baby, I love you so much!</i>

248
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,810
<i>Love you too, Mommy.</i>

249
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,050
<i>I love you!</i>

250
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:15,310
<i>Mom, is it day or night right now?</i>

251
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,270
It's night.

252
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:24,440
Mom, I can't see anything.
I'm so scared.

253
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,540
All right, come here.

254
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,120
Let's take a nap.

255
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,510
- Mom, please sing for me.
- Sure.

256
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:48,400
<i>The leaf boat I left in the well</i>

257
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:55,740
<i>when I was playing during the day</i>.

258
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:05,800
<i>When I lie down next to my mom</i>

259
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,350
<i>I keep thinking about it.</i>

260
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:20,900
<i>Mom, do you think that leaf boat
is still floating in the well?</i>

261
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,150
<i>I think so.</i>

262
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,200
<i>Really?</i>

263
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,790
For how long?
For a really long time?

264
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,850
Sleep. Picturing that leaf boat
in your mind, sleep.

265
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,800
I'll sing for you.

266
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,900
<i>Mom, please don't leave me.</i>

267
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,600
<i>Of course I won't.
Where would I go?</i>

268
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,400
<i>I'm not going anywhere. I'm going
to stay right next to you.</i>

269
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,320
Hey, isn't Yoo Ji Na hot?

270
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,660
How is it that
she gets sexier as she ages?

271
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,600
She was famous in Gwangju
since she was in high school.

272
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,330
I have a senior who's from Gwangju.

273
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,840
He says she was a total fox
even back then!

274
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,300
She had a fling with him
back in the day.

275
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,820
And I hear she was really naughty!

276
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,730
- I'm jealous.
- Same.

277
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,270
Have you guys heard of this?
Yoo Ji Na has a secret fan club.

278
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,370
A fan club? What do you mean?

279
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:16,330
If you pay the membership fee,
maybe you'll get to meet her.

280
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,020
- So?
- You know what I mean...

281
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,920
Oh, I know what you mean!

282
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Oh, I hear it's totally worth the money.

283
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,640
I hear she's mind-blowing.

284
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,030
Mind-blowing? How so?

285
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,040
You punks, she has that
mind-blowing look!

286
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,320
Right.

287
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,010
Have you guys seen her
in real life or what?

288
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,510
And you! What?
She's famous in Gwangju?

289
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,840
Yoo Ji Na is not from Gwangju.
She went to high school in Cheongju!

290
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,720
How dare you talk such
absolute bullshit with that filthy mouth!

291
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,210
Who the hell are you?

292
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,720
I see you guys are all
losers with sad lives.

293
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,900
Does it make you feel better
about your shitty lives

294
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,690
when you talk such bullshit while
sitting in a bar like this?

295
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,390
Does that make you feel
better about your lives? Huh?

296
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,880
You wouldn't even have the guts
to make eye contact with her

297
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,280
if you met her in person!
You think Yoo Ji Na is your toy?

298
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,510
You think she's a toy you can
just use for your entertainment?

299
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,870
We get it. That's enough!

300
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,120
What's enough?

301
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,500
Why are you flipping out over
something that doesn't concern you?

302
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,300
How the hell do you know
if it concerns me or not?

303
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,570
You... What is wrong with this woman?

304
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,920
Also, how old do you think
Yoo Ji Na is? A secret fan club?

305
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:44,350
I see you are penniless fellows,
ignored by other ladies...

306
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,810
I said that's enough!

307
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,330
So what are you going to
do now, looking at me like that?

308
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,510
Oh... you're going to hit me?

309
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,050
Okay, go ahead! Hit me!

310
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,670
I don't want to sing so hard
to make money, either.

311
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:02,420
Let me make some easy money!
Hit me! Hit me if you want!

312
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,500
So annoying! Also, it is true that
Yoo Ji Na went to school in Gwangju.

313
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,230
- It's Cheongju!
- It's Gwangju!

314
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,820
- I said it's Cheongju!
- I said it's Gwangju!

315
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,620
It is Cheongju.

316
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,770
The 16th graduating class of Jae Il
Women's High School in Cheongju.

317
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,180
Who's this? Isn't this Yoo Ji Na?

318
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,430
It's Yoo Ji Na.

319
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,590
Yes, I am Yoo Ji Na.

320
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,100
Hey... autograph!
Let's get her autograph!

321
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,440
What are you doing?
Get a pen and paper, hurry!

322
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,050
It's such an honor!
I'm a huge fan! A crazy fan!

323
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:46,870
You look even prettier without makeup.
You're a goddess! A goddess!

324
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,000
A picture, picture, picture!
Phone! With mine, mine!

325
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,020
- No, let's take it with mine!
- No, with mine!

326
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,450
This card was declined too.

327
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,150
I'll pay in cash. How much was it again?

328
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,070
40,000 won.

329
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,590
- I'm getting her check.
- Okay.

330
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,350
No, please don't. I've been
basically living off you all my life.

331
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,460
This can't be real life.

332
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,510
This can't be.

333
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,340
Then I'll wire the money to you.

334
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,780
Don't worry about it.

335
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,860
Don't say that. I'm the one
who's supposed to treat you.

336
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,170
Please give me your number
and your bank account number.

337
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,730
It's fine.

338
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,620
Please don't say that.

339
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,140
It's just that more of a hassle for me
to give you my number and account number

340
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,420
over just 40,000 won.

341
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,500
Oh, I see what you mean.

342
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,470
I'm sorry for having been
a nuisance to you!

343
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,690
What do you mean
you've been a nuisance to me?

344
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,990
Thanks for the drink.

345
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,110
It was an honor to have met you.

346
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,840
Thank you.

347
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,260
Goodbye! Take care!
I'll work hard!

348
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,830
Watch out!

349
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,120
Hey! Stop right there!

350
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,060
What an ignorant bastard!

351
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,590
How could he just leave
without saying sorry?

352
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,380
Are you okay? Are you not hurt?

353
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,500
No, I'm... I'm fine.
Please go ahead, you must be busy.

354
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,700
Really, you can go.
I just have a sprained ankle.

355
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,940
Do you usually get so worked up
about other people's affairs?

356
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,680
Well, you're not someone
who's completely irrelevant to me...

357
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,520
What do you mean?

358
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,240
You're my inspiration and my role model.

359
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,120
You're the person that's in my mind
from the moment I wake up

360
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,560
until the moment I fall asleep.

361
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,680
Since I'm a nuisance to you, I feel like
I should return your favor some day.

362
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,160
And it's a real honor to meet you...

363
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
All right, all right.

364
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:31,220
I get that it's an honor. But are you
sure you don't need to see a doctor?

365
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,690
A doctor? Over something like this?

366
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,040
I'm someone who recovers from
most things after a good night's sleep.

367
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,110
You're a ridiculously
positive person.

368
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:46,690
Anyway, I'm so grateful that
you stood up for me at the bar earlier.

369
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,700
Really? You're really grateful?

370
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,350
Of course I am.

371
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,650
If you are really grateful,
let me ask you for one last favor.

372
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,170
Now what?

373
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,410
Do you want to come inside
for a cup of tea?

374
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,900
Go where?

375
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,450
You want me to go to your house?

376
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,280
That's taking it too far.
Too far. Nonsense.

377
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,680
I'm not even wearing any makeup.

378
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,700
You're like family to them.
You don't need to wear makeup.

379
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,610
I'm like family?

380
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,620
You're like family to us.

381
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,590
My family might faint
because of excitement.

382
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,930
Anyway, that is ridiculous.
That's just not something I do.

383
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,230
Please, it's my wish.

384
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,440
When you're having a drink at night

385
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,960
spicy sea snail salad
goes best with the drink!

386
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,130
Cut up the sea snails
into smaller pieces.

387
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,930
- It's fine to just eat them like this.
- What do you mean it's fine?

388
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,830
If you eat all of them,
there's nothing left for me to eat.

389
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,140
Okay, okay. I'll just eat
the veggies, then.

390
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,810
You never said you'll eat
sea snails when you ate them.

391
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:59,360
You always tell me you'll eat
only the scallions and end up

392
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,820
finishing the sea snails secretly...

393
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,200
Okay, I won't eat them!
Gosh, Dad...

394
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,080
Is that what you tell
your students in school?

395
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,340
Do you say they should finish all the
sea snails before their dads eat them?

396
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,950
Dad! You can have
all the sea snails you want!

397
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,210
Come out, come out!

398
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,230
Huh?

399
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,080
- Dad, come out!
- Why?

400
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,730
Just come out, quickly! Hurry!

401
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,090
What is it?

402
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,170
Who is it?

403
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,530
Dad, please say hello.

404
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,920
My goodness!

405
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,930
Who is this?

406
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,830
Isn't this Yoo Ji Na?

407
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,170
What brings you to this neighborhood?

408
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,740
- Pleased to meet you.
- Of course.

409
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,920
We've always been so grateful
and hold you in high regard.

410
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,730
We had hoped to meet you one day.

411
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,540
We're even more honored that you
came to see us at this late hour.

412
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,050
Dad, that sounds rather strange.

413
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,700
Does it? I must've been too excited.

414
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,960
Anyhow, we got a chance
to meet you in person.

415
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,530
Come on in.
Pleased to meet you!

416
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,470
I hope my presence isn't
too much of an inconvenience.

417
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,100
- No!
- Of course not!

418
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,050
- Upstairs. Upstairs!
- I'm on it.

419
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,600
Yes.

420
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,710
Maybe it's because I had an early dinner.
I'm getting kind of hungry.

421
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,190
You always seem to say that
right after all the dishes are done.

422
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,320
Just go to bed. It's a pain.

423
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,980
It's about time for Father-in-law
to have his usual nightcap.

424
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,840
- Bong Soo!
- What's wrong?

425
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,930
- Come downstairs. All of you.
- Huh?

426
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,250
- Why?
- Something the matter?

427
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,040
It's just that--

428
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,590
Hurry, hurry!

429
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,440
- What is it?
- Just come!

430
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,140
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

431
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,910
- Come on.
- Let's go.

432
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,480
What could it be
that you're rushing us--

433
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,010
Goodness, what's going on?

434
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,290
- Whoa!
- What in the world? Who is this?

435
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,820
Isn't this Yoo Ji Na?

436
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,030
What in the world?
How could this be?

437
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:12,290
Welcome. It's good to have you here.
Oh my goodness.

438
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,930
You look so doll-like.

439
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,900
Your face is so small.
Hae Dang's face is so big.

440
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,100
We're all big fans, you see.

441
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,470
I'll take a picture!

442
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:30,210
Wow! The very first thing I do when I
wake up is look you up on the Internet!

443
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,470
I look to see if any scandals
popped up in the middle of the night!

444
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,950
News articles about me?

445
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:39,350
Hae Dang is an impersonator.
You know what an impersonator is, right?

446
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,780
Yes.

447
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,420
My word.

448
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,310
What is all this?

449
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,170
What's the stage name you use?

450
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,140
- Yoo Jui Na.
- Yoo Jui Na?

451
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,830
It sounds like the word you use
when your foot falls asleep.

452
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,510
So I'm Yoo Ji Na and you're
Yoo "Foot Falls Asleep"?

453
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,140
I'm sorry for being a nuisance.

454
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,550
Apologizing again?
That's quite a habit you have.

455
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Even if my coworkers refer to you
by name without the "miss"

456
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,880
then I don't talk to them
for three days straight.

457
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,150
Even though they won't be
missing out on anything

458
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,450
but that's how much I respect you--

459
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,970
I'm sorry that this is
all we can offer you.

460
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,080
Goodness. They're kimchi fried pancakes.

461
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,060
I enjoy these a great deal
because I grew up in the countryside.

462
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,010
Allow me. Here you go.

463
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,200
Thank you.

464
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,880
It's delicious.

465
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,060
Does it suit your taste buds?
What a relief.

466
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,740
The pancakes are good
because the kimchi is delicious.

467
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,000
So you enjoy this type of kimchi.

468
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,380
Wrap some up.
Wrap some up for her.

469
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,440
- Okay.
- Oh, no. No, it's fine.

470
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,580
Money can't buy kimchi
you particularly enjoy.

471
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,100
<i>Go on.</i>

472
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,090
All right.

473
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,430
I came here empty-handed--

474
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:34,980
Don't mention it. You're with family,
so who cares if you're empty-handed?

475
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:39,850
We consider you family,
so there's no need to tiptoe with us.

476
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,150
Although we don't know
if you think otherwise.

477
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,080
Why would I?

478
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:51,550
You may find it burdensome that
my daughter is an impersonator of yours

479
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:56,580
but she's doing it to support this family
because her father isn't good enough.

480
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,120
I hope that you will still look
kindly upon our poor family.

481
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,270
Now that you're here, allow me to
thank you again on behalf of our family.

482
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,740
Please accept this bow of gratitude.

483
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,390
- Oh my.
- Hold on!

484
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,470
Father-in-law, I think
this is going overboard.

485
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,670
Even if you're grateful,
this is a bit too much.

486
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,410
What do you mean, "overboard"?

487
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,170
We're practically beggars.

488
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,580
She's the reason why
we've been able to get by.

489
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,670
You have to think of the point of view
of the recipient of the bow.

490
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,400
How uncomfortable would she feel
that an older man is bowing to her?

491
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,820
Mm, then you do it.

492
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,100
- What? Me?
- Yeah, you should do it.

493
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,940
- Do it.
- Hold on.

494
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,190
Thank you, Goddess Ji Na.

495
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,460
Oh no!

496
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,670
Don't worry about him. He'll be fine.

497
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,530
I begged them to let me
become a singer.

498
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:04,930
My mother helped me scrape up the funds
for an album by taking out some loans.

499
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:09,240
But all that money went down
the drain when the album was a bust.

500
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,230
In order to pay off that debt

501
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,900
my mom worked as a dishwasher
at a restaurant and a housekeeper.

502
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,680
She did any and every job she could get.

503
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:28,140
It must have been so taxing
on her body that one day...

504
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,530
she died in her sleep.

505
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,120
She forgot to take her medication
for her heart pressure.

506
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,200
I didn't even know
she had high blood pressure.

507
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,770
Because... I never went
to the hospital with her.

508
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:52,670
My mother, up until
the day before her death...

509
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,630
she always made sure to cook me
three square meals a day.

510
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:02,600
Even on the night she died, she wandered
the whole neighborhood looking for pork

511
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,630
and returned home quite late.

512
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,340
You could almost say that
she died because of me.

513
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,530
So you gave up on your dream
to become a singer

514
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,160
to make sure your siblings
would go to school

515
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,830
and you became an impersonator
because there was money to be made?

516
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,250
Because I worked to the bone every day
with the vow that I wouldn't die

517
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:27,380
even if I had cancer
until they all graduated from college.

518
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,180
I thought that you just
had a bright personality.

519
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:38,130
Because I wouldn't have been able
to survive if I wasn't optimistic.

520
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,800
There's nothing I'm particularly good at.

521
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,720
So I need to make a living
in order to survive.

522
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,290
If I don't keep a smile on my face
while being a burden to others

523
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,260
that would be too shameless.

524
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,300
Your father seemed like a good man.

525
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,190
It made me think,
"So that's how people live their lives."

526
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,380
It was nice being around
warm people for once.

527
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,750
I'll send over some concert tickets,
so bring your family.

528
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,910
Really?

529
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,640
Are you sure your father won't
try to bow to me at the concert?

530
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,450
Thank you.

531
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,470
I also have a favor to ask.

532
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,490
It's because you keep referring
to yourself as a burden to others.

533
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,550
That's not a nice thing
to say about yourself.

534
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,690
Whose life would ever be
a burden to other people?

535
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,600
Everyone accepts the hand that
they're dealt in life and works hard.

536
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,070
I thought you were a cool-headed person.

537
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,130
But I feel at ease knowing that
you're a warm-hearted person.

538
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,220
No. I am cool-headed.

539
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,760
What do you think?

540
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,870
Wasn't that performance
better than the real thing?

541
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:33,010
Yoo Ji Na always wears
this expression on her face.

542
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,600
She casts an alluring gaze

543
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,830
or in other words,
as if she's in a drugged daze.

544
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,260
Wow, that's exactly the same!

545
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,090
Spot on!

546
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,910
The way she opens her eyes
is what you want to focus on.

547
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:52,340
If you take a close look,
it's as if she's bewitched you.

548
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,330
Is that right?

549
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,280
- Is that the same for you?
- Try something different.

550
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,940
Should I do that?

551
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,260
You must come here all the time, sir.
Do you like me that much?

552
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,060
- Change up your material!
- Yoo Jui Na, you're the best!

553
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,940
Oh, so you're a fan of Yoo Ji Na!

554
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,200
So you prefer eating
a cornish hen over a pheasant?

555
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,450
Does pheasant taste better?

556
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,770
Raise your hands
if you've had pheasant.

557
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:22,960
See? There aren't any.

558
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:26,890
Stop looking for opportunities
to compare me to the pheasant

559
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:32,640
but enjoy the performance by
the voluptuous and yummy cornish hen.

560
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,630
Yoo Jui Na, the perfect knockoff
impersonator of Yoo Ji Na.

561
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:40,190
I'll continue my performance
and give it my all!

562
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:45,220
Yoo Ji Na's latest single "Emerald."
Let's go!

563
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:00,790
<i>Who was I hoping to beat</i>

564
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,000
<i>that I would sit here alone?</i>

565
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,370
<i>Who was I trying to sell my smiles to?</i>

566
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,750
Hey, what is this?

567
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,210
What's this?

568
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,440
Those? Some woman dropped by
and asked that they be given to you.

569
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,490
Who?

570
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,200
I couldn't see her face because she was
wearing these huge, dark sunglasses.

571
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,750
Get ready for the next show.

572
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,580
<i>I don't wear these outfits anymore.</i>

573
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,930
<i>Plus, the cost adds up when you
have to buy your own dresses.</i>

574
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:36,800
<i>Don't feel so grateful.
I hope they help you out.</i>

575
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,680
Wow!

576
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,650
Be more confident!

577
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,770
Here we go.

578
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,200
Hold on.

579
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,330
You need to look more brazen here.
Raise your chin slightly.

580
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:13,310
An ambiguous gaze.

581
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:19,960
That's not ambiguous,
but like someone in a drugged daze.

582
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,040
Oh, you heard that?

583
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,250
You chewed me out like a bar snack
to the crowd that night.

584
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,650
I'm sorry if those words upset you.

585
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:35,430
Even if you are younger than me,
you are still past your prime.

586
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,230
They can't tell how old I am
because the club is so dark.

587
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,550
Thanks.

588
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,990
But does an amateur who isn't famous
really need to deliver such cheesy lines?

589
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,540
I have to be pretty blatant about it.

590
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,030
Since a woman does have
to act like this.

591
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:02,880
Look one way, say another word,
look another way, say another word.

592
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,840
All right. I understand. Stop.

593
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,060
I have to make a living, after all.

594
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:13,530
Seeing you work so hard reminds me
of the early days of my career

595
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,900
so I feel encouraged.

596
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,610
Really?

597
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,560
Let's try it one more time
and call it a day.

598
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,650
Okay.

599
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:21,790
Careful of your posture.

600
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,870
Pose. Pose. Spin.

601
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:39,430
Here we go.

602
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:44,230
<i>Before I show you my tears...</i>

603
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:50,500
<i>Before I show you my tears...</i>

604
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,990
<i>Before I show... I show...</i>

605
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,900
Give it a rest already and move on.

606
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,790
You keep singing
the same line over and over.

607
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,970
No, no. There's something more to this.

608
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,460
What could be the problem here?

609
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,840
What else could I do so that
it feels just like her performance?

610
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:14,060
Try this then.

611
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:19,340
Instead of focusing on your eyes,
just like when you fuss over something...

612
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,190
Like this. Shoot your eyes
to your 11 o'clock. Like this.

613
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,700
Like you're staring at them.
Just a little bit.

614
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,680
This 11 o'clock is what's important.

615
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,660
Don't just shoot them
up to the sky. Look.

616
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,370
<i>Before I show you my tears...</i>

617
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:40,810
Just sit down and continue
putting rollers in your hair.

618
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:45,170
Try this on stage!
You'll get a round of applause!

619
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:48,670
You think impersonators just have
to make fun of the celebrities?

620
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,240
They all have their own know-hows.

621
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,690
Know-how?

622
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:55,220
Think carefully about when
people will burst into laughter.

623
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,910
Use their weaknesses for emphasis.

624
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,890
Don't make it unpleasant.

625
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:05,230
Who would ever go to a show where
the performer only picks out the obvious?

626
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,340
They'll just say, "Oh, you're good."

627
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:11,740
Well, it's not like she's that good
at the obvious mannerisms.

628
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,700
You've become quite the expert
while watching me practice at home.

629
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,000
Then you should do this instead!
The wave!

630
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,180
The sexy, continuous wave!

631
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,770
<i>Before I show you my tears...</i>

632
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,210
Why is that considered a weakness?

633
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,360
Yoo Ji Na has gained weight
over the years.

634
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,650
Ah, okay.

635
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,850
That was it.

636
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,050
It's because I was too skinny that you
couldn't feel that in my performance.

637
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,790
Oh, good.

638
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:42,500
Go and make some bibimbap.

639
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,760
At this hour?

640
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,020
I have to eat some before I go to bed
so I can gain some weight.

641
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,980
When was it that you said you needed to
lose weight because Yoo Ji Na was skinny?

642
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,860
You would skip your meals back then.

643
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,820
If Ji Na loses weight,
I need to lose weight.

644
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,580
And if Ji Na gains weight,
then so do I.

645
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,990
You think being an impersonator is easy?

646
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,690
Even I want some now.

647
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,270
I'll gain weight if I eat now.

648
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,860
I'm going to eat a spoonful.

649
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,430
Sounds good.
The diet starts tomorrow!

650
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,970
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Let me have a spoonful.

651
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,880
It's good!

652
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,590
It's mixed really well.

653
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:31,060
Hey, stop eating!
There won't be enough for me!

654
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,960
- Hand it over.
- Hae Dang, let us have some!

655
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,710
It's really good.

656
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,250
Isn't it mixed really well?

657
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,830
I won't say a word.

658
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:46,580
I want to see how women like her live.

659
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,050
She probably thinks I came alone.

660
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,970
Come on in.

661
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,820
Wow. It looks like
those houses you see on TV!

662
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,110
Oh, this. It's the kimchi.

663
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:08,770
We couldn't buy anything.
You seem like you have everything, too.

664
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,960
I'll enjoy eating it.
I ran out of kimchi.

665
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,310
These are Korean blood sausages.

666
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:20,310
It's hard for you to go buy these
yourself even if you wanted some, right?

667
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,450
I can usually send my manager
to go get me some.

668
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:26,270
There's liver in here too.
Do you... like liver?

669
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,240
I'll enjoy them.

670
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,860
Wow. How nice.

671
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,040
You came here to visit, not to work.

672
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,830
I do have a housekeeper.

673
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:43,200
You need to draw a line when you
entrust your home to someone else.

674
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,690
It doesn't feel like your own home.

675
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,770
Even when I open up the refrigerator,
it needed so many things.

676
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,270
So I made sure to pack
lots of things in it.

677
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:51,570
Thank you.

678
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:55,310
Oh, and the cabinets above the sink.
I took everything out and cleaned them.

679
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:58,940
Isn't my house a mess because I only dust
wherever I see the dust collect?

680
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,380
I feel so ashamed as a woman
who lives here by herself.

681
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,400
Why would you feel ashamed?

682
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,210
You're no different than family.

683
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:15,420
Call me whenever you have work
for me to do, okay?

684
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,090
Would you... excuse me for a moment?

685
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:30,440
I've only worn this twice.
It's too big for me.

686
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,080
Would you like to take this with you?

687
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,860
Oh.

688
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:40,840
This is the same coat you wore...
when you visited our home, isn't it?

689
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,250
My goodness.

690
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,080
I've never worn such a nice coat
in my whole life.

691
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:56,250
- What do you think?
- Fits you perfectly. It looks good.

692
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:59,550
- I should've bought you a new one.
- What do you mean?

693
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,970
I like used clothes.

694
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:03,660
Wait a second.

695
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,360
There we go.

696
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,410
- Wear it out.
- I should save it.

697
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,340
Do you have a spare shopping bag?

698
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,870
What do you think?

699
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,360
Do I look luxurious?

700
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,290
Take it off. Let me try it on.
I think it would fit me, too.

701
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,630
Hold on. There's something in the pocket.

702
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,530
What's this?

703
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,690
Thank you. You went out of
your way to give this to me?

704
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,630
I was on my way to a promotional
event in the countryside.

705
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:46,100
I'll see you again.

706
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,440
Please excuse me.

707
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:06,530
That was the first time
you saw her in person, right?

708
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,160
- Yeah.
- She's prettier in person, right?

709
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,810
Not sure. I didn't take
a good look at her.

710
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,900
You should have.

711
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,590
If you look at her up close,
her nose is high and perfect.

712
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:20,730
Celebrities sure are attractive
in person, don't you think?

713
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,540
- You're a celebrity, too.
- As if.

714
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:30,820
I don't even hold a candle
to her looks and talent.

715
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,900
What are you talking about?
I think you're pretty.

716
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,420
Really?

717
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,860
A woman should be as pretty as you.
What else would she wish for?

718
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,710
This is why I like you.

719
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,050
<i>You really can't see?</i>

720
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,140
<i>Take a good look at me.</i>

721
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,520
Look at me.
You really can't see anything?

722
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,450
No, I don't see a thing.

723
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,390
Don't go anywhere, Mom.

724
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,810
Kyung Soo.

725
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,650
Oh, Kyung Soo.

726
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,120
What are we going to do, Kyung Soo?

727
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,900
What am I going to do?

728
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,380
What am I going to do?
You poor thing.

729
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:23,960
What are we going to do, Kyung Soo?

730
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,420
Kyung Soo.

731
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,380
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?

732
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,960
What are we going to do?

733
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,750
You poor thing.

734
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,700
<i>If I am ever to depart from this world</i>

735
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:50,520
<i>please make sure that the enclosed letter
is delivered to my son, Park Hyun Joon.</i>

736
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,550
<i>No matter what, it must be
delivered to him by hand.</i>

737
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,410
<i>[Choi Kyung Ae]</i>

738
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,130
<i>[To: My son]</i>

739
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,080
<i>Your mother has left this world.</i>

740
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,630
<i>Come back as soon as
you can with Yoon Hee.</i>

741
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,110
She took her own life?

742
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:38,360
No matter how much
I think about it, I don't believe it.

743
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,500
Be quiet.

744
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,710
What is this when the wedding
is just around the corner?

745
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:46,420
My family has to move things
ahead of schedule.

746
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,840
Didn't you hear me
telling you to be quiet?

747
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:08,200
Have you just arrived?

748
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,310
<i>[Choi Kyung Ae]</i>

749
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,760
No.

750
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,700
This can't be.

751
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,980
I can't send you away like this, Mom.

752
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,120
I can't send you away like this.

753
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,810
Mom!

754
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:41,240
Mom! Mom...

755
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,530
I can't send you away like this, Mom.

756
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:47,020
Mom... Mom!

757
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,610
Mom, I can't send you away like this!

758
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,310
Mom...

759
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,630
How could you send away
my poor mother like this?

760
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:01,750
How could you send her away
in such a pitiful manner?

761
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,810
Lower your voice.

762
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,430
Take me with you.

763
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:13,100
Mom! Take me with you!

764
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,960
Take me with you! Mom, Mom!

765
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,670
Mom... take me with you...

766
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,540
Mom, you can't be gone...

767
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,250
Mom...

768
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,360
Do not be so aggrieved
when she lived a full life.

769
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,660
- A full life?
- She was quite blessed.

770
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,020
- Grandma!
- Sit down.

771
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,280
How dare you raise your voice
at your grandmother.

772
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,050
Would she take her own life
if she had a full life?

773
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,340
She was someone who was neat
in every aspect of her life.

774
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,010
The way she went in for her treatments

775
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:07,110
she didn't want to show her
long suffering to her children.

776
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:08,540
Grandma.

777
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,630
I know you didn't like my mother.

778
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,210
But how could you speak of her that way?

779
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:18,980
Then how should I speak of her
that will shut you up?

780
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,210
What did you say?

781
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,600
Grandmother is much more
cool-headed than I expected.

782
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,990
She's always been cool-headed.

783
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:33,600
From what I heard, everyone has been
whispering that this happened because

784
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,350
Hyun Joon's mother suffered from
depression ever since she got married.

785
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,860
Yoon Hee.

786
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,250
Aren't you going to be
a part of this household soon?

787
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,250
You should watch what you say.

788
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,240
In that case, I would hold
a higher place in this family.

789
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,000
Then who would you be
to say something?

790
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:56,290
I'm sorry.

791
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:59,280
You'll need to be the one
to watch what you say with me.

792
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:05,470
We need to express our gratitude
to everyone who attended the funeral.

793
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:07,260
You take care of it.

794
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:11,250
Do you already have the right
to take care of other people?

795
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:14,030
Because it's something that must be done,
no matter who it may be.

796
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:17,040
Make sure no one will nitpick.

797
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,080
There will be many people who will
talk about how she killed herself.

798
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:25,770
She should've thought about what would
be good for the people she left behind.

799
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:31,450
Even in her final moments,
she was of no help.

800
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,500
No help?

801
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,880
Who are you saying
was of no help?

802
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,110
My mother was the original
owner of this home.

803
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,980
She inherited the company
from my maternal grandfather!

804
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:44,560
Have you forgotten because
it was so long ago?

805
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:49,050
Or perhaps you got so comfortable
living a wealthy lifestyle

806
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:51,070
that you are deceiving yourself now?

807
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,060
There is no limit to
the horrible things you say!

808
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,650
What insolent words to say
to your grandmother--

809
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:01,080
He's thoughtless,
just like his dead mother!

810
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,420
Go to the office, Hyun Sung.

811
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:12,290
It's not like the deceased will return
to us if we're just sitting around.

812
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,890
They sound like people who were waiting,
as if prepared for this event.

813
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,220
Prepare my things because
I'm heading out to the office.

814
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:38,160
Brother-in-law.

815
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,680
You must be tired from your flight.
Get some rest upstairs.

816
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:50,630
You should go upstairs
and take a nap, too.

817
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:05,110
You'll attend to company affairs
even before you dry your tears?

818
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:09,830
He's helping his father with matters
both at home and in the office

819
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:11,650
so he has much to do.

820
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:37,410
Leave me. I wish to drink alone.

821
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,790
When will you bring me into the company?

822
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,300
When I have need for you.

823
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,050
Who will decide that?

824
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:50,720
How awful could you be
that you would not think

825
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,880
to go out into the world
and best them?

826
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,880
Instead, you've dedicated
your life to besting me.

827
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,680
Because I hate the very idea

828
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,770
that I am Chairman Park Sung Hwan's son.

829
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:07,040
As do I.

830
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,860
I hate you too.

831
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,710
If you understood my point...
leave me.

832
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,780
Does this look like something
your late mother would want?

833
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:32,900
Someone else is getting
the treatment that you deserve.

834
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,130
Don't you find it unfair?

835
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,720
Tell them to think whatever they like.

836
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,920
I feel so suffocated

837
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,430
that I can't stand to
stay in this country for another second.

838
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:42,480
I won't leave.

839
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,640
I think I at least need to
stay here in your stead.

840
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:05,550
<i>I must see you
and deliver this to you by hand.</i>

841
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:07,220
What is it?

842
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,080
<i>It's a letter.</i>

843
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,530
What does it say?
Give me a general idea.

844
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:18,650
<i>I'm blind, so if it's not in Braille,
I cannot read it.</i>

845
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:23,140
I can't even take a photo for you to send
since I don't use a smartphone.

846
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,680
But this is a matter I can't
entrust to someone else.

847
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,890
Send it to me by mail then.

848
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,880
She instructed me
to deliver it by hand.

849
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,080
If I return to Korea,
I'll call you back at this number.

850
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,770
Goodbye.

851
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,810
<i>[Locket Contains Picture of Yoo Ji Na.
But Who Is the Boy?]</i>

852
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:53,620
What's with you, Bong Seon?

853
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,060
How are you so thoughtless?

854
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:00,130
You could've just given back the locket.
Why did you take a picture of it?

855
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,390
Or you should've stopped there.

856
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,680
What is there to brag about that
you would upload that picture? Why?

857
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,600
I'm sorry.

858
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,110
- What are you going to do?
- I said I was sorry.

859
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:12,240
You make my life
such a pain, Bong Seon!

860
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,880
Give it a rest!
That's enough.

861
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,210
Even if she was thoughtless,
she's still your sister-in-law.

862
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,530
How can you speak to an elder like that?

863
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,870
How are you going to look
Yoo Ji Na in the eye?

864
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:25,510
She's been so nice to Hae Dang!
We've made such a mess!

865
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:28,250
People are bound to step on
each other's toes in life!

866
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,900
How could you speak that way?

867
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,440
Do you have no understanding
for familial hierarchy?

868
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,940
Honey, go on inside. Huh?

869
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:37,460
Go on. Go.

870
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,980
Gosh.

871
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:45,790
You.

872
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:48,660
Who do you take after
that you would be this dense, huh?

873
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,150
How is she going to face
our relatives who live downstairs?

874
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,730
My goodness.

875
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,710
I can't live under the same roof
as your family anymore.

876
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,220
"Your family"?

877
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,590
Even so... how can you
speak of them like that?

878
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:07,280
We live in a cramped second floor

879
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,360
your mother is suffocating,
and your sister is obtuse.

880
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,000
We're just freeloaders
who don't contribute to rent.

881
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,280
What are we doing, with your mother
and your sister, all of us freeloaders?

882
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,380
Who are you calling freeloaders?

883
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,870
Do you know who takes care
of all of the household chores?

884
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:25,460
So you plan on living this way?

885
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,350
This is why you should never get close
to people who have nothing to lose.

886
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,960
Because they aren't discreet.

887
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,830
I'm sorry.

888
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:47,600
Resolving this with compassion
will only lead to the end of my career.

889
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,330
Miss Yoo Ji Na...

890
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:55,560
do you have any inkling of what
I've been through to get to where I am?

891
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,940
Do you have any idea...

892
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:05,170
how I felt keeping my tears in check
to get to where I am?

893
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,080
Who do you people think you are?

894
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,830
How dare you destroy
my entire life in one fell swoop?

895
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,940
Destroy?

896
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:15,180
Are you asking because you don't know
how fast people on the Internet work?

897
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:20,790
They'll dig and dig and dig...

898
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:23,350
What will you do
if they discover the truth?

899
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:28,180
Who is... that boy?

900
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:30,520
Wasn't he your nephew?

901
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:36,100
Don't breathe another word.

902
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:39,470
Turn on your heel
and leave through that door.

903
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,930
If you are to impersonate me,
then make me into a laughingstock.

904
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:51,130
I won't care if you earn a living
off of my hit singles

905
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:55,150
or you build off of my career.

906
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:57,110
So don't you dare
show yourself before me again.

907
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,850
Get out immediately.

908
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,430
I said get out!

909
