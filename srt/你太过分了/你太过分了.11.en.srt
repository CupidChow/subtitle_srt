<i>[Episode 11]</i>

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,430
<i>[Pop singer, Yoo Ji Na
and wealthy chairman...]</i>

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,180
It was you, wasn't it?

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,480
Have a seat.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,650
What were you thinking?

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,970
Are you trying to ruin my career?

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,510
People saw us together at the party.

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,130
Do you think I only attend your parties?

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,590
You released this article just
because I went to your party?

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,210
This can only benefit you.
It will not harm you.

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,680
You think you can have me as your woman
just because you released an article?

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,470
At least you won't be my son's.

14
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,900
What did you say?

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,030
If I don't want people to call
me crazy, I should listen to you?

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,230
Is that what you're saying?

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,330
I have a duty to protect you.

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,590
Says who?

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,270
Says me.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,340
I protect my women.

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,800
Who says I'm yours? What did
we do that you think I'm yours?

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,000
If I love you, that means you're mine!

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,230
This is why you can never have me.

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,350
Because you're willing to do
terrible things to get what you want!

25
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,310
Listen to me.

26
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,100
He has gone mad with
the idea of ruining my life.

27
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,680
He is not thinking about you at all.

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,650
Worry about yourself.

29
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:54,340
You want to jump in the fire when
you know what kind of guy he is?

30
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,990
Whether I jump in the fire or
turn into dust and disappear

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,980
you have no business
in my life anymore.

32
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,710
As soon as I step away from your life

33
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,610
you won't be able to see him.

34
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,150
- I'm certain of that.
- You shouldn't be so certain

35
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,120
of other people's lives.

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,380
What is the meaning
behind that expression?

37
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,020
Even after the article was released

38
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,530
are you still going to run to him?

39
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,020
That's up to me.

40
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,190
Unfortunately.

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,260
What are you trying to do?

42
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,200
What were you thinking
to release this article?

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,680
<i>[Pop singer, Yoo Ji Na
and wealthy chairman...]</i>

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,200
I'm trying to publicly humiliate you.

45
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,620
- What?
- I humiliated you enough at home.

46
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,890
Don't you think
it's only appropriate

47
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,970
for me to go out into the world
and humiliate you?

48
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,300
You...

49
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,480
Even after this article, I know she's
going to run to me if I tell her to.

50
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,400
- You want to bet?
- Stop this right now.

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,280
If all goes well, a scandal
could happen. With your son.

52
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,910
How entertaining would that
be for the whole world?

53
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,870
Do you think you will be able to show
your face for the rest of your life?

54
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,100
Are you sure you are my son?

55
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,720
How can you think of such things?

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,590
You dragged Mom to the cliff because
you didn't want to lose Yoo Ji Na?

57
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,880
- What?
- Did you run out of patience

58
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,030
waiting for Mom
to get sick enough to die?

59
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,090
I told you it wasn't like that.

60
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,370
I'm going to humiliate you

61
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,410
and that woman you care so much about.

62
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,680
What wrong did she ever do to you?
Aren't you being cruel?

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,610
Yeah! I'm a cruel bastard.

64
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,910
Like father, like son.

65
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,100
You can do whatever you want to me.

66
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,450
But don't lay a finger on her.
She's innocent.

67
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,790
What you just said is too romantic
to have come out of your mouth.

68
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,030
You're telling me you want to protect her

69
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,270
after what you did to Mom?

70
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,860
If you're worried about her,
then go to the police right now.

71
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,570
Go!

72
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,490
And reveal the truth!

73
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,780
There is no truth to reveal anymore.

74
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,470
How many times do I have to tell you?

75
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,880
There is no truth to reveal?

76
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,100
Ask anyone on the streets

77
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,240
and see if they say they would jump
off a cliff with someone next to them!

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,490
Was it you?

79
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,120
Father.

80
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,930
The person who told Hyun Joon
about the night of the incident.

81
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,940
It wasn't me.

82
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,950
- Then was it your husband?
- Of course not.

83
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,490
Then are you saying
that my mother told him?

84
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,250
No. It wasn't me.

85
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,880
It was you.

86
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,790
You're the only one in this house
who would plot a scheme like this.

87
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,030
- Father.
- From now on...

88
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,560
I'll be watching you.

89
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,500
Don't take my words lightly.

90
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,510
He asked me if I was the one who
told Hyun Joon about the incident.

91
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,370
- Father did?
- So what if he asks?

92
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,630
There are only two sons.

93
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,710
At this rate, you might stay attached
to this issue until your dying day.

94
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,470
Do you know who the scariest
person in the world is?

95
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,880
Someone who has nothing left to lose.

96
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,430
What are you thinking about?

97
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,050
You probably saw the article
that Chairman Park released.

98
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,770
Even after I spent all day
talking to the reporters

99
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,880
and released opposing articles...

100
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,350
I don't think anyone believes me.

101
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,060
People will believe
what they want to believe.

102
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,870
You don't know that after working
in the business for so many years?

103
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,610
All my hard work of trying
to prevent a scandal...

104
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,800
is about to go to waste.

105
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,430
How unfortunate.

106
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,540
I'm so disappointed in your father.

107
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,330
I have no idea how someone
like him has a son like you.

108
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,770
I am who I am because
he is the way he is.

109
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,350
I released that article.

110
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,720
What?

111
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,120
- Why?
- Because

112
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,940
I felt that you would
still come running to me.

113
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,910
What did you say?

114
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,560
Do you understand now?

115
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,910
How insignificant you are to him?

116
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,310
Even in this moment, the fact that
I have no desire to give up on you...

117
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:53,720
What a petty thing it is to love.

118
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,820
Why did you try to take
the blame for the article?

119
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,610
At least if you thought that I released
the article to win you over

120
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,810
you would have been mad,
but you wouldn't have been hurt.

121
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,180
But if you knew that he looked
down on you and used you...

122
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,460
How painful was that for you?

123
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,300
This path is going to ruin you too.

124
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:51,650
Is it worth it to ruin your life
over me and your father?

125
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:56,450
Why are you so confident that you think
you can treat me however you want?

126
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,970
Your eyes shake
every time you look at me.

127
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,400
I'm pretty tactful
when it comes to women.

128
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,980
I could even write a thesis about it.

129
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Like my father.

130
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,100
I'm sure your late mother

131
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,160
would not wish for you to waste
your one and only life like this.

132
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,870
You're still pretending that
you're concerned about me.

133
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,830
Are you going to trick yourself
into believing that too?

134
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,610
Trick myself?

135
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,690
You're pitying me because
I was cast aside by my father

136
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:38,460
as a kind gesture?

137
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,380
You think I'm a rookie who
can't tell the difference?

138
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,360
Your eyes shook
the very first time you saw me.

139
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,120
I saw everything. No?

140
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,160
What? Are you afraid?

141
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,830
You don't even know
where to run and hide.

142
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,650
What have I done?

143
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,380
Why did I quit my job at the school?

144
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,640
Why am I so tired?

145
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,330
Hey! Are you trying
to get full from coffee?

146
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,980
Who drinks coffee like that?
What if you upset your stomach?

147
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,510
It's not a waste to sacrifice
health for one day.

148
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,050
Go here. It's a training
institute for screenwriters.

149
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,250
There's a place like that?

150
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,010
If you're going to put your life on
the line, you should at least research

151
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,390
and know how to walk
in the most efficient way possible.

152
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,380
Thank you!

153
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,130
You're officially letting me do this now!

154
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,770
Hey! When was the last time
you washed your hair?

155
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,800
Your hair is a big stinky ball of grease!

156
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,230
Because my hair is all greasy,
don't you think my part looks perfect?

157
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,120
- What?
- I don't even have time to wash my face.

158
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,300
I'm fighting against the clock.

159
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,410
Are you sure that you won't
regret quitting your job at the school?

160
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:14,070
<i>Love, ideals, and
everything else are demanding.</i>

161
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,180
<i>It's lonely to go all in.</i>

162
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,820
Have you ever seen a hyena prowling
at the foot of the mountain for food?

163
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,590
She is definitely younger than me.

164
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,470
She wants to put her life on the line
for something that makes little money.

165
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,930
Cleaning the sink! La, la, la!

166
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,820
How? Wiping off the dust, la, la, la!

167
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,870
Destroy everything!

168
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,280
What are you doing, Hae Soo?

169
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,230
Mrs. Baek!

170
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,760
Do you have anything to say to me?

171
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,440
- No.
- You really have nothing to tell me?

172
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,880
I really have nothing to say.

173
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,020
Nothing?

174
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,340
There is really nothing.

175
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,740
Really?

176
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,130
Have you heard this before?

177
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,960
Short term memory loss.

178
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,910
Short term memory loss?

179
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,940
You see that in movies.

180
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,760
You go to sleep and forget everything
that happened yesterday when you wake up.

181
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,450
I've been having
similar symptoms recently.

182
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,580
Either way, thank you.

183
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,920
I'm not sure what you mean...

184
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,670
I'm so embarrassed to even look at you.

185
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,610
Mrs. Baek, wait! Just wait!

186
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,420
- This is octopus.
- Octopus?

187
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,660
I bought it because my dad
really wanted to eat some.

188
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,670
But I completely forgot I had bought
some, so I bought some more.

189
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,700
How long do you think your
symptoms are going to last?

190
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,560
At least until the next pay day.

191
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,310
I'm embarrassed to even take it.

192
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,660
But I'm in no position to say no.

193
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,460
- Enjoy!
- I will!

194
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,380
She is so thoughtful.

195
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,810
I should have
a daughter-in-law like her.

196
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,850
But everyone is so busy being picky about
school, jobs, and unnecessary things.

197
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,730
University professor?
It just sounds great.

198
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,510
- What is this?
- Octopus.

199
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,190
You said you didn't have any money.

200
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,590
I was just walking outside
when it fell straight from heaven.

201
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,500
You're eating so well.

202
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,290
- Is it good?
- Yeah. It's really good.

203
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,140
But it's really spicy. You should
have made clam soup too.

204
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,910
It would have tasted better if
there were soup to go along with it.

205
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,430
You want everything.

206
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,010
Isn't octopus expensive?

207
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,810
It is.

208
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,130
Why are you staring at me like that?

209
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,770
I just think it might be hard
to last until the next paycheck.

210
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,110
If you're that worried, then give
me some money in advance.

211
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,070
What do you mean in advance?

212
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,960
There are so many things to spend
money on when the next check comes in

213
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,050
but I only have 10,000 won left.

214
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,540
H... Honey...

215
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,260
Where did you spend all that money?

216
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,900
You think I wanted
to spend all that money?

217
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,610
Bong Soo, can you
come inside for a minute?

218
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,180
But... I'm eating right now.

219
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,320
Eat later.

220
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,730
I mean... It doesn't taste
good when it's cold.

221
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,590
What did I say?

222
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,370
Didn't I say she was going to spend it
all if we gave her the entire allowance?

223
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,230
The month isn't even over yet!

224
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,480
Oh my.

225
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,920
- Man... Mother...
- Your mother is always like this.

226
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,330
She got so excited that she had all
that money and she spent it all!

227
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,140
Mom, let me see you for a minute.

228
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,300
I'm eating right now. Can't you see?

229
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,020
How do you think this
makes me look in front of her?

230
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,740
I gave you the entire allowance
without her permission.

231
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,140
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry is not going to solve this.

232
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,170
Let's talk about this after we eat.
We're eating right now... Jeez.

233
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,360
I'm going to lose my mind!

234
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,040
Seriously!

235
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,980
Did you have a good dinner?

236
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,200
Why are you out at this hour?

237
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,380
I ate early.

238
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,080
What's wrong?

239
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,540
- Were you fighting again?
- My mother

240
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,710
spent all her allowance already.

241
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,430
What?

242
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,680
The next pay day is still far away.

243
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,080
I'm too embarrassed to
even look at my wife's face.

244
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,360
And with that temper of hers...
I bet things are a mess.

245
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:48,410
Where did you spend
all that money anyway?

246
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,020
Where do you think I spent it?
I spent it on groceries.

247
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,810
It's not like we had grand meals.

248
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,740
We had spicy braised chicken,
spicy pork, and octopus.

249
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,880
Are you trying to be funny right now?

250
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,420
Even after all that,
where did the rest of it go?

251
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,210
You said you only have 10,000 won left.

252
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,270
How would I know?
Maybe it grew feet and ran away.

253
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:16,090
She's been keeping track of all
the food that's been on the table.

254
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,720
What?

255
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,320
Oh my gosh... What a smart girl!

256
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,300
If she is such a smart girl,
why is she still paid hourly?

257
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,500
She can't even pay for her own books,
and she has me doing all the housework!

258
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,220
This is not the time to argue about that.

259
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,250
Did you... get scammed?

260
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,240
- What?
- You know, for health products.

261
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,350
Did you get scammed by
people that sell those?

262
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,820
- Am I you?
- Then where did all that money go?

263
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,880
Why are you interrogating me when
you only gave me so little to begin with?

264
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,440
For only 1.5 million... She what?

265
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,310
She wrote down everything
that was on the dinner table?

266
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,290
- What does she take me for?
- Mom! Mom!

267
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,230
Mom! Mom!

268
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:05,260
If you touch her
right now, it's a divorce!

269
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,350
My gosh!

270
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,210
I'm going to explode!

271
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,120
<i>[Standard exclusive contract]</i>

272
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,330
You won't have anything
to do with Yoo Ji Na

273
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,910
and the conditions are realistic.

274
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,200
So just sign with me.

275
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,310
You think I would scam you after I met
your father and the rest of your family?

276
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,120
I'm just worried I'm
going to cause trouble.

277
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:36,730
That's okay! My life is stable
enough to handle that much.

278
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,570
- You're going to be disappointed.
- You can't disappoint me.

279
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,980
You might not know this,
but I've seen all kinds of things.

280
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,850
I don't get disappointed easily.

281
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,040
I'll deposit the money listed
on the contract tomorrow

282
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,900
so check your account, then come
to my office and sign the contract.

283
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,120
You really don't have any
celebrities that want you?

284
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,100
That's right, I don't!

285
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,250
I set up my office, but I might
not even be able to pay rent!

286
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:07,510
So you should come and support me.

287
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,150
But what if both of us go bankrupt?

288
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,710
If that happens

289
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,480
then let's run away together!

290
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,960
Forget about the rent and let's run away!

291
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:27,960
Are you thinking that
running away is a better deal?

292
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,950
What?

293
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,570
What about Grandmother?

294
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,430
She said she doesn't
feel well and will eat later.

295
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,390
Let's eat.

296
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,590
I'm going to eat breakfast
with you from now on.

297
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,200
Okay.

298
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,050
Last time, you asked me to sign
Yoo Ji Na to my company, right?

299
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,310
Just eat.

300
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,730
Tell her to show up by two o' clock.

301
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,370
I'd like to talk to her
about the contract.

302
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,260
Or should I ask her?

303
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,280
I said just eat.

304
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,850
You should at least tell her,
so she knows that you asked.

305
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,770
You went through so much
trouble to ask me that favor.

306
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,590
The soup is very refreshing.

307
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,200
It's good.

308
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,090
War is imminent.

309
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,040
It's at the tipping point.
It's hard to watch.

310
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,770
They say a bystander can
get hurt in a fight.

311
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,830
Don't get involved too much.

312
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:57,270
Don't forget to cancel your dinner with
Chairman Jo's daughter before you leave.

313
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,750
Are you not feeling well?

314
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,460
Can't you tell?

315
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,300
I'm leaving for work.

316
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:19,150
I will not be able to go
to dinner with Yoo Jin.

317
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,360
Is that up to you to decide?

318
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,590
I'll be going now.

319
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,220
No one is going to listen
to what I say now? Is that it?

320
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,610
Have a good day at work.

321
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,220
Okay.

322
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,710
Let me see you before you leave.

323
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,460
<i>[Pop singer, Yoo Ji Na
and wealthy chairman...]</i>

324
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,500
Who released this?

325
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,880
I think someone heard
something and wrote it.

326
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,610
You didn't do it?

327
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,920
- Why would I...
- To put that uncivil thing

328
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,790
- next to you.
- No.

329
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:33,170
Things like this are the cause
of the mess this family is in!

330
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,700
- You have contributed to it as well.
- What?

331
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,620
As soon as you open your mouth,
you criticize everything.

332
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,750
How could you hit your
future daughter-in-law?

333
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,950
Who's going to be
my future daughter-in-law?

334
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,490
Future daughter-in-law?

335
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:54,230
Okay fine! Then you tell me
with your own mouth.

336
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,770
Is she my future daughter-in-law
or my future granddaughter-in-law?

337
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,210
Where did you hear such an absurd thing?

338
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,020
What do you mean where?
She lives right here in this house!

339
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,950
You blatantly told people
what happened, is that it?

340
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,800
- No.
- Then, how does he know?

341
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,110
Hyun Sung heard it from me.

342
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,850
What?

343
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,660
I cooked porridge because
you weren't feeling well.

344
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,220
I was about to go to your room,
but would you like to eat here?

345
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,100
You have been quite busy
these days, haven't you?

346
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,250
- What?
- You pitted my son and Hyun Joon

347
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,260
- against each other, right?
- No.

348
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:53,850
Then, how come he took her out for
lunch when he hates even looking at her?

349
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,270
Yoo Ji Na probably seduced him.

350
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,600
You think he would fall for her
because she seduced him?

351
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,440
Didn't he take her out
to infuriate his father?

352
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,350
I wouldn't know.

353
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:10,190
Why don't you know?
Someone as smart as you?

354
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,130
You think you can survive
by holding onto just Hyun Sung

355
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,180
after flipping our house inside out?

356
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:23,440
You told Hyun Joon that my son
was at the cliff with her, didn't you?

357
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,250
Of course not. How could I even
dare to think such a thing?

358
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,480
You think I don't know what's
going on around the house

359
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,830
because I stay in my room all day?

360
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,770
Of course not. Not at all.

361
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,560
You dreadful thing.

362
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:48,020
I need to take care of you first
before that wench at the other house.

363
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,400
Grandmother, what about your meal?

364
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,180
<i>The old lady is acting
like quite the fortune teller.</i>

365
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,090
<i>Quite the fortune teller.</i>

366
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,890
This is so pretty!

367
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,030
Jewelry designers sure know
how to make masterpieces.

368
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,870
Oh my goodness.

369
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,640
This is beautiful.

370
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,410
I know Grandmother is not someone
who's stingy about these things.

371
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,790
I'm sure you already have so much

372
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,190
but you can never have enough jewelry.

373
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,560
Of course. I agree.

374
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,350
But why are you giving this to me?

375
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,460
You really don't know? You're not
someone who wouldn't know.

376
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,550
See? You definitely need
someone on your side.

377
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,980
Otherwise, it's easy to become a fool.

378
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,150
Did you see the news?

379
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,870
Of course. How could I not?

380
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,150
You feel better now, right?

381
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,170
What?

382
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:16,820
Did Hyun Joon's attitude not change
even after that article was published?

383
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,790
Do you not like the bracelet?

384
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,370
Of course I do.

385
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,290
Who would understand your
situation better than me?

386
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:29,180
Feel free to tell me anything.

387
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,960
Feel free to tell you anything?

388
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,940
Tell you what?

389
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,760
- What?
- What are you imagining right now?

390
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,150
What do you mean?

391
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,060
I'm just worried about you.

392
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,200
- Is Grandmother in her room?
- Yes.

393
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,980
Grandmother! I'm here.

394
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,050
<i>People's lives can change
in just one moment.</i>

395
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,520
<i>And I thought it was the end of me.</i>

396
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,030
Be careful with that fox outside.

397
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,930
- Yes.
- She is not normal.

398
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,330
- I know.
- When she first came to the house

399
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,740
she was so obedient.

400
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,390
I had no idea what I was
bringing into the house.

401
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:33,250
She has such a nice face, but she has
at least a dozen snakes inside her.

402
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,610
She probably learned a thing or two
from me while she lived here.

403
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,070
She learns fast, but her
judgment can be rash.

404
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,690
An opportunity will come.

405
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,430
If it doesn't, I'm just going
to toss her out of the house.

406
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,350
- Toss her out of the house?
- I'm keeping her around

407
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,510
because I think she
might still be useful.

408
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,600
It's true what people say. She probably
tortured a dozen daughter-in-laws.

409
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,930
Now that the article has been released

410
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:11,080
she is officially
your father's woman, right?

411
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,620
You released that article, didn't you?

412
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:21,960
Even before you joined our family,
was that the first thing you learned?

413
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,060
There are so many pros in this house.

414
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,110
I have to go. I have a meeting.

415
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,440
I was planning on eating lunch with you.

416
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,500
Park Hyun Joon said that?

417
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,110
He said

418
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,610
for you to come to his office
to discuss the contract.

419
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,980
Are you going to go?

420
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,220
- I'll think about it.
- You're going to think about it?

421
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,960
He said it in front of Hyun Sung

422
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,950
like he was declaring war.

423
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,900
But you still want to go?

424
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,960
I said I'll think about it.

425
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:19,840
You want to be near him
after that article was released?

426
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,600
Business is business.

427
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,030
You think I told you this
for you to think about it?

428
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:33,160
<i>You know exactly what he
is scheming... Is this all you are?</i>

429
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,110
You have a visitor.

430
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,920
- A visitor?
- Yoo Ji Na is here.

431
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,380
Oh well. Please prepare some tea.

432
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,090
I heard that you wanted
to discuss the contract.

433
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,780
I have an urgent contract
to take care of first.

434
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,700
We can discuss after that.

435
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,110
You're going to sign
a contract with someone?

436
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,700
It's only going to be a headache if you
have just anybody join your company.

437
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,320
Welcome.

438
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,980
Hae Dang.

439
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,170
Should I come back later?

440
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,010
Why would you come back later?

441
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,600
Come over here.

442
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,940
How have you been, Hae Dang?

443
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,160
What brings you here?

444
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,910
I told you earlier I had someone
coming to sign with me.

445
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:09,760
That was Hae Dang?

446
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,100
The deposit went through, right?

447
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,390
Yeah.

448
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,320
You ended up signing a contract with him?

449
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,970
That's good. Congrats.

450
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,340
I heard you're getting married.

451
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,520
Ah... That.

452
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,790
- That was a false report.
- Is that so?

453
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:36,180
If celebrities married every
time the news announced a marriage

454
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,070
we would all get married
three or four times.

455
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,050
Even if he is from a wealthy family,
a dating scandal

456
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:45,550
with someone
who is 18 years older than you

457
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,110
must have made a dent in your image.

458
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,250
You wanted a contract with
our company, but in our position

459
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,460
we can not give up our
contract with Jung Hae Dang.

460
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,990
In the end, we have decided
to decline your request.

461
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,990
- Is that so?
- I'm sorry.

462
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,660
No need to be sorry.

463
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,610
I wasn't that desperate to sign
a contract with this company.

464
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,770
It's not like I don't have
other places that want me.

465
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:23,530
Then why did you ask the chairman
you had the scandal with

466
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,340
to ask me to accept you?

467
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,140
- Mr. Jang.
- Yes.

468
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,870
Please bring Jung Hae Dang's contract.

469
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,420
Yes.

470
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,650
Can we talk for a second over there?

471
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,240
Talk?

472
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,310
Just sign the contract with Yoo Ji Na.

473
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:56,520
You wanted Yoo Ji Na from the start,
but I was just being stubborn.

474
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,520
You don't have to worry about that.

475
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,180
It's fine. Just sign with her.

476
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,190
I would just feel better
if you did that instead.

477
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:09,340
You're just starting out.
It will help your company

478
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,170
to have a big celebrity like Yoo Ji Na.

479
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,360
You don't have to try so hard, Hae Dang.

480
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,520
It looks like you heard most of it,
so I don't have to explain.

481
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,460
What should I do?

482
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:30,490
Hae Dang is asking me
to take you in as well.

483
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,050
Do you want to sign with me?

484
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,640
Does that mean you're
getting in the way this time?

485
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,230
I'll decline, President Park Hyun Joon.

486
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,390
Really? That's good to hear.

487
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:47,090
As part of our company image,
we don't need a celebrity

488
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,480
who has a scandal with
a chairman she's living with.

489
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,860
Hae Dang, let me see you for a minute.

490
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,520
What's wrong with you?
You're a new company.

491
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,100
Isn't the company's most important
job to protect its artists?

492
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,560
Congratulations on signing
a contract with a company.

493
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,230
Some of it is thanks to you.

494
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,070
I wanted to ask you one thing.

495
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,740
What is your relationship
with Park Hyun Joon?

496
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,340
What?

497
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:38,100
Why are you curious about that?

498
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,480
Rather, I would like to ask you.

499
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,320
Why would a top celebrity like
you come to a start-up company

500
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,630
to be humiliated?

501
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:54,630
Come to think of it,
you have an incredible talent.

502
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,080
You have a way of getting people

503
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,970
to be on your side
with your innocent face.

504
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,460
If I had that kind of talent

505
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,460
then I would not have
lived my life imitating you.

506
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,110
President Park Hyun Joon and
I are simply business partners

507
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:21,170
so you don't have to worry about me.
You can do whatever you want.

508
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:26,160
Is that what you wanted
to hear, Yoo Ji Na?

509
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,780
It's all set. Please wait.

510
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,880
You are finally my celebrity artist!

511
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,460
From now on, I will take care
of your singing activities

512
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:21,540
but also your health, your image,
and everything else.

513
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,320
I'm like your guardian.

514
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,850
From what I've seen so far,
I can't say that I trust you.

515
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,610
I feel like your company
is going to go bankrupt soon.

516
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:36,080
Then, before it goes bankrupt,
let's go out to eat with your family.

517
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,990
I wanted to take your
family out for a meal.

518
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:59,490
No! You signed a contract with her,
so we should be the ones treating you.

519
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,610
Isn't this too much?

520
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,290
It's not as expensive as it looks.

521
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,820
Eat a lot while you can.

522
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,570
We might not even be able
to have soup for a while.

523
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,980
We have a guest here...

524
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,340
Oh, right.

525
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,100
Sorry.

526
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,180
Our family is having a bit of
a food emergency these days.

527
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,570
This restaurant is nice!

528
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,680
Eat quickly and then go get more food.

529
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,040
Eat as much as you can
so we can get our money's worth.

530
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,740
Okay...

531
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,940
I said eat quickly!

532
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,150
How can eat quicker than this?

533
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,260
Anyway, congratulations Hae Dang!

534
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,000
Thank you.

535
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,850
If you get famous and win an award

536
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,820
then make sure to say in your speech

537
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,230
that it was all thanks to
my wonderful housework!

538
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,640
- Okay!
- Yeah, yeah!

539
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,490
I hope that day comes.

540
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,380
We have to make that day come.

541
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,580
That's what an agency does.

542
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,960
- Please take care of her.
- I will do my best.

543
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,880
You can speak casually to me.

544
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,620
- I don't know if I'm ready to do that.
- I said to speak casually to me.

545
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:31,280
If you look closely,
he has a lot of cuteness.

546
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,090
Hyun Joon.

547
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,140
So cute!

548
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,750
Eat your food.

549
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,920
Hoon!

550
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,950
- Let's go get dessert.
- Okay.

551
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,090
I told you not to run
around the restaurant.

552
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,150
I'm going to eat later.

553
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,840
Let's go.

554
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,410
Come play with Mommy.

555
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,640
Let's go!

556
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,580
Hoon, look! What is this?

557
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,250
Wow! It turns!

558
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,070
You're going to eat all that?

559
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:18,060
You don't even get fat...
Where does it all go?

560
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,470
That's why my body is a gift from heaven.

561
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:24,640
- Hey! Shaved ice cream!
- Me too! Me too!

562
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,450
Please take care of my daughter,
President Park Hyun Joon.

563
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:34,480
Starting now, I will be taking
care of Hae Dang from head to toe.

564
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,180
Oh, really?

565
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,910
When you say it like that,
you sound like my son-in-law.

566
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,310
- Dad!
- There are a lot of celebrities

567
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,230
who are like that with their presidents.

568
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,130
My daughter knows so much.

569
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,530
I am an expert in this area!

570
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:55,210
How many years have I been
looking at Yoo Ji Na's articles?

571
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:59,440
I hope there's a day when I read
an article about Hae Dang!

572
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,760
I'm sure you will.  If you
believe it, it will happen.

573
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,270
Cheers!

574
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,780
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

575
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,450
<i>I leave the house around 8 o' clock.</i>

576
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:32,340
<i>I have to get ready at the club.</i>

577
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,790
My goodness!

578
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,820
Thank you!

579
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,270
You've done so much for us.

580
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:03,210
We were going to pay for the dinner.

581
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,930
It's cold. Please hurry and go inside.

582
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,610
Okay.

583
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,510
Is... Is it okay if I hug you?

584
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,980
- Of course.
- Thanks.

585
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,040
You are a dependable person.

586
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,900
I didn't know because
I only have daughters

587
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,620
but hugging you sure feels different.

588
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,880
You are a trustworthy person.

589
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,100
Goodness.

590
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,590
Thanks.

591
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,000
Why is she so angry after
such a nice dinner?

592
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,350
Why is your mother doing this?

593
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,910
What is it this time?

594
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,500
Was that her first time at a buffet?

595
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,760
"Eat quickly! Eat quickly!
We have to get our money's worth!"

596
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,300
She just got a little excited
because it's been a while.

597
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,440
"Eat a lot while you..."

598
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,110
Are we beggars?

599
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,670
Beggars?

600
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,150
Wh... What are you saying?

601
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:40,050
It wasn't just family,
there was a guest at the table!

602
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,420
He doesn't seem like
the kind of guy to say something.

603
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,610
It was embarrassing! Embarrassing!

604
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,540
Embarrassing?

605
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,700
Last time you were embarrassed of me
and called me your youngest uncle

606
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,920
and now you're embarrassed of my mother?

607
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,710
And I'm sure you're
embarrassed of my sister.

608
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,250
What did she do with all our money?

609
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,680
And then she had the gall
to say that at the restaurant?

610
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,120
I hate this... I hate all of this!

611
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,360
- I heard everything.
- You did?

612
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,800
Didn't you say it
loud enough for us to hear?

613
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,130
So, what would you like us to do?

614
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,390
You're embarrassed of your husband

615
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,320
your mother-in-law,
and your sister-in-law.

616
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,850
What would you like us to do?

617
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:40,080
Persuade him to give me a divorce.

618
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,070
- What?
- Will he do it if I ask for one?

619
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:48,260
So you can tell him.

620
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,480
Is that something you should
say to your mother-in-law?

621
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,070
Think about it from my perspective.

622
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,030
If I were your daughter

623
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:02,740
would you be able to tell me
to live happily ever after

624
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,200
with my husband's family?

625
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,190
Stop it and go inside.

626
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:15,120
I'm sorry that I acted so
improper in front of a guest.

627
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,850
<i>Come outside.</i>

628
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,110
Here is the allowance envelope.

629
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:57,270
I'm sorry I only left
10,000 won in there.

630
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,710
You don't have to give
it to me next month.

631
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,470
After doing it, I realize
it only hurts my head.

632
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:07,660
I think it will be better
for me to get just a little at a time.

633
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:12,370
Well... You're not upset?

634
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,700
I'm not upset.

635
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,030
I ran out of money a long time ago.

636
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,790
The spicy braised chicken, the spicy pork

637
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,660
and the octopus that you
ate all came from downstairs.

638
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,420
That's not all.

639
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,610
The soy sauce, red pepper paste,
shampoo, tissues

640
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:32,510
and everything else we used
recently I brought from downstairs.

641
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,410
After doing that, what right do I have
to hold our allowance money?

642
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,980
So...

643
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,240
Where did I spend all the money?

644
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,290
I fixed her teeth.

645
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,400
She divorced her husband after he cheated

646
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,540
and has been living
with her brother's family.

647
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,420
I felt terrible for her. She couldn't
say a word because she couldn't afford it

648
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,660
even though her teeth
were bothering her all night.

649
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,380
So I did it for her.

650
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,810
I'm sorry...

651
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,660
That I used the money without permission.

652
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:17,900
Anyway, it is what it is,
so starting next month

653
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,620
you don't have to give it to me.

654
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,620
<i>[Ji Hoon's snack: 70,000 won;
Bong Seon's teeth: 1,000,000 won]</i>

655
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,260
Are you sad?

656
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,340
Why would I be sad?

657
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,580
You are!

658
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,910
Even when your father was alive

659
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:52,480
he would give me money whenever he could

660
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,180
but it was hard to keep
event 100,000 won in our wallet

661
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:59,020
because of how much we owed.

662
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,970
This is how my life is.

663
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:06,600
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

664
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,890
At least I got a chance to have
a fat wallet in my pocket.

665
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,850
That's good enough for me.

666
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:20,590
I don't know. Let's sing a song.

667
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,380
<i>A soft pink dress flutters</i>

668
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:34,700
<i>against the spring breeze.</i>

669
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:40,550
<i>As I walk and chew
on my coat string today</i>

670
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:45,710
<i>I will pray to the shrine
where swallows fly by.</i>

671
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:51,810
<i>I will smile when the flower blooms.</i>

672
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:58,250
<i>I will cry when the flower withers.</i>

673
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:03,470
<i>To my frugal vow...</i>

674
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:09,360
- Mom.
<i>- Goodbye spring.</i>

675
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,860
I'm sorry, Mom.

676
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,840
I'll just keep the car I'm driving now.

677
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,550
No way.

678
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,240
It'll be more comfortable for me.

679
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,340
You are so stubborn. Do whatever
is comfortable for you.

680
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:40,160
At first, I didn't think
I would ever see you again.

681
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:46,560
I know. I still remember the first
time I went to go visit your father.

682
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,260
It's uncomfortable the way
my dad treats you, right?

683
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,550
- Sorry.
- No.

684
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,760
I actually find it relaxing.

685
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:00,500
I enjoy spending time
eating and laughing with your family.

686
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,610
I love that.

687
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,970
My family's current
situation is not like that all.

688
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,010
As soon as you walk into the house

689
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:14,310
you can't breathe.

690
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,170
<i>Kyung Soo, I signed with a company.</i>

691
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:41,460
<i>I have an agency now.</i>

692
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,110
<i>Are you doing well, Kyung Soo?</i>

693
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,860
What does he do?

694
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,130
What? Who...

695
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,380
I saw him when I was passing by.

696
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:12,080
It looked like the whole family
had just gotten back from somewhere.

697
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,800
The whole family?

698
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,780
Isn't he the man Hae Dang is dating?

699
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:23,070
They're not dating. My sister just
signed a contract with his company.

700
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:26,690
- His company?
- He's the company president.

701
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,710
I see.

702
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,720
<i>[Adult Nightclub]</i>

703
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:13,610
<i>There’s only the typical answer,
“Cheer up!”</i>

704
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:24,440
When you say Yoo Ji Na,
this is her signature face.

705
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,550
Like you just ate medicine.

706
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:33,460
What do you think? Do you think I'm sexy?

707
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:43,220
Hey! Stop scamming us and
bring the real one! The real one!

708
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:48,050
Oh, hey! It's been a while!

709
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:52,270
We saw each other
last time on the streets.

710
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,150
But why did you pretend
you didn't know me?

711
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:58,660
Did you ignore me because
you were scared that your wife

712
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,540
would find out that you come here?

713
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,610
Are we buddies when you're here,
but strangers when you're not?

714
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,700
I'm disappointed!

715
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,880
If we keep this up,
we might become friends!

716
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,590
Anyway! Sing us a song!

717
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,220
Okay!

718
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:24,410
Yoo Ji Na's perfect imitator, Yoo Jui Na.

719
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:28,620
Let's have some fun tonight
like there is no tomorrow!

720
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,460
Let's go!

721
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,640
<i>I’m left alone on this road again.</i>

722
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,050
<i>I am sitting here staring blankly.</i>

723
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,530
<i>For what reason exactly</i>

724
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:11,740
<i>am I selling myself for laughter?</i>

725
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:20,130
<i>I can’t see the end of the road
that escapes the darkness.</i>

726
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:28,830
<i>I thought I would be okay
if this were love.</i>

727
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,130
Kyung Soo.

728
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,470
I told you I would go
anywhere to find you.

729
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,460
How have you been?

730
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:07,690
Why are you here?

731
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,150
It was fun.

732
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,990
You were good.

733
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:21,290
Now that I've seen everything,
you have no reason to avoid me.

734
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:25,960
Do you know what I was
thinking when I saw you?

735
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,480
"He is so heartless
to come visit me so late."

736
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,650
Something like that probably.

737
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:45,070
"He looks too pure
to be standing in this filthy club."

738
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,680
You looked like a student.

739
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,170
A student?

740
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:56,160
That hurts my pride a little.
I'm a man, you know.

741
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,500
Guys hate it when they
hear that they look like a kid.

742
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:05,310
Especially from a woman they like.

743
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:09,510
Kyung Soo, do you know
our age difference?

744
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,650
I don't care.

745
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:16,830
You're the only girl I see in this world.

746
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,400
I'm not kidding.

747
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,120
I thought you were dating someone.

748
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,700
It was driving me crazy.

749
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:28,540
You were thinking about me that much?

750
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,720
You should've just
accepted it and moved on.

751
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:39,270
I missed you.

752
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:42,150
Just sitting next to you

753
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:46,320
I feel like I have
everything I need in this world.

754
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,610
How can I forget about you?

755
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,770
Yoo Ji Na is not her real name.

756
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:04,090
I see. What is her real name?

757
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,310
It's Kim Hae Jung.

758
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,860
Kim Hae Jung.

759
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:20,790
Research everything about Kim Hae Jung
and don't leave out any details.

760
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:22,150
Yes.

761
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:26,290
When and where was she born?
What school did she attend?

762
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:30,060
Who did she meet and what happened?

763
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:34,850
Find out everything about
her life before her debut.

764
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:37,420
Yes. I will.

765
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:50,110
<i>Someone who acts this way because his
pride was hurt in front of his family...</i>

766
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:54,250
<i>You what? You won't deny me
no matter what happens?</i>

767
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,500
<i>You will be the first person who runs
away when you know who I really am.</i>

768
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:07,450
<i>When you know everything about me,
you won't be able to handle me.</i>

769
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:25,790
<i>The item I want to give to you, Hyun Joon</i>

770
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:31,900
<i>is buried under the tree
that only you and I know about.</i>

771
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,820
What are you doing?

772
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,920
I dropped something,
and I was looking for it.

773
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,840
What did you drop?

774
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:08,070
Were you looking for it
standing up like that?

775
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,430
You looked like you could see.

776
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:14,100
I was trying to use this,
but it's not working.

777
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,080
What did you lose?

778
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:37,840
I thought I dropped
something but I guess not.

779
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,870
So... I'll be going.

780
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:49,280
Welcome. I should've
just sent a car to you.

781
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,260
That's okay.

782
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,610
I'm not using my car
when I'm not working.

783
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:55,290
I'll send it next time.

784
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:58,260
That's too much. Don't worry about it.

785
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,960
Is that so?

786
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,000
Let's have something to drink.

787
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:17,520
If you'd like, you can stop by our house
and have some snacks before you go.

788
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,570
You can come whenever you'd like.

789
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:21,330
Thank you.

790
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:33,000
Are you staring at something right now?

791
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,500
What?

792
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:39,030
I was staring at the fruit.

793
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:47,650
Why? Do you find it uncomfortable
when people stare at you?

794
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:50,220
I can't see the person
who's staring at me.

795
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:55,500
I have no idea what facial
expression that person is making.

796
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,680
I feel like I'm being attacked
when I'm defenseless.

797
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:03,370
You hate it that much?

798
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:09,280
People who are not handicapped don't
know how it feels like to live this way.

799
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,720
Why are you not married yet?

800
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,580
I don't know.

801
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:29,330
You never wanted a child?

802
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:36,590
I heard that women might not want
to be in a marriage, but do want a child.

803
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,330
Oh... Not really.

804
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:44,720
I never thought about it.

805
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:49,100
Should we move to the piano?

806
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,690
I feel proud just sitting next to you.

807
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,680
And you're not even my son.

808
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:13,750
Can I just think of you as my son?

809
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:18,220
Because it's not your first time playing

810
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,010
I brought this song that
I think you can play.

811
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:23,210
<i>["Tree Leaf Boat"]</i>

812
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:28,830
I will play it first.

813

<i>Playing during the day.</i>

814
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:56,380
<i>I left it behind.</i>

815
01:03:56,380 --> 01:04:00,910
<i>The tree leaf boat.</i>

816
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:08,580
<i>By my mom's side. Lying beside her.</i>

817
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:13,140
