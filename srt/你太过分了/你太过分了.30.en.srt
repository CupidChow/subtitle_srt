4
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,390
Wait a minute.

5
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,710
I'll go inside.

6
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,400
- You two can talk.
- I have nothing to say.

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,380
Of course you have
something to say.

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,500
You can come in after you are done.
I'll wait in the living room.

9
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,880
Do you live here now?

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:10,750
I didn't think... I would see you here.

11
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,800
Did you get hurt because
Hyun Joon and I showed up here?

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,420
It's not like
I can be with you anyway.

13
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,310
Are you doing well?

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,160
Don't worry about me.

15
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,750
Why won't you look at me?

16
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,820
It's not because I'm angry.

17
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,160
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,750
Why do you say that?

19
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,950
I was so worried when I left you alone.

20
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,340
I don't care what happens to me
as long as you are happy.

21
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:16,320
So don't act like you know me
when you come here.

22
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,530
Your face is gaunt.

23
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,690
You don't feel comfortable
living here, do you?

24
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,110
You should go in.
Hyun Joon will get worried.

25
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,140
Do you feel better after getting
some fresh air?

26
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,010
Were you crying?

27
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,030
No... I wasn't.

28
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:15,560
It's okay. I knew it would be hard
to make up your mind overnight.

29
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,080
I need to talk to you.

30
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,270
About what?

31
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,410
You might want to stay here.

32
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,700
Don't worry and just wait here.

33
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,950
If you have something to say,
then say it already.

34
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,540
Pardon?

35
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,280
Don't you have anything to tell me?

36
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,770
Are you thinking,
"Why would I even bother talking to you?"

37
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,220
Is it because Hyun Joon does
everything for you anyway

38
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,850
even if you don't say a word
and just stand there?

39
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,300
I'll let it go this time as if
my husband cheated on me.

40
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,970
I don't ever want to see your face again.

41
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,610
He told me that he was engaged.

42
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,170
Then what?
You heard and what?

43
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,310
There is nothing for me to say.

44
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,660
Then you should just give up on him.

45
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,070
I should probably say I'm sorry,
but I think you will be unhappy.

46
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,730
So I won't say it.

47
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,450
I see that you are quite a character.

48
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,810
You are the type of person
who pretends to be polite

49
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,250
and then drives other people nuts.

50
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,430
How did you meet him?

51
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,020
Is there a reason you need to know?

52
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,470
I asked you how you met him!

53
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,270
How do you feel after seeing my face?

54
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,990
Do I look like someone from whom
you can easily steal a man?

55
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,370
Don't act up and stay away from me.

56
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,260
What are you doing?

57
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,460
Are you okay?

58
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,490
Can you take your hands off her?

59
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,770
What are you doing? I'm right here!

60
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,430
Why didn't you just wait
in the living room?

61
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,410
Let's leave.

62
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,900
What? She hasn't left yet?

63
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,410
Why don't you send her home?

64
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,680
I'm sorry for visiting you
with no notice.

65
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,330
It's okay. It would be best
to go home today.

66
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,180
- Take care, Grandmother.
- Okay. Please leave.

67
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,150
Where are you going?

68
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,820
I'm going to take her home.

69
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,410
How could you say that
in front of Yoon Hee?

70
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,410
Go upstairs right now!

71
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,540
- Let's go.
- Don't take one more step!

72
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,460
Mr. Park Hyun Joon.

73
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,850
What happened to your clothes?

74
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,750
Did something happen?

75
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,430
Let's go.

76
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,370
How unfortunate!

77
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,530
You got to dress up but you are
getting kicked out of the house

78
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,820
with a cocktail dripping down your dress.

79
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,820
I dare you to say one more word.

80
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,360
Listen to me carefully.
She is the person I'm going to marry.

81
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,890
You should watch your mouth.

82
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:34,600
"Watch my mouth"?
This is a total mess!

83
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,120
Who is telling whom to watch their mouth?

84
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,000
Jung Hae Dang!
Did you sense it today?

85
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,930
How dare you show up here?

86
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,950
Did you think you
could impersonate me here, too?

87
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,800
Did you come here
because you forgot yourself?

88
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,680
- Cut it out!
- Why are you yelling at me?

89
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,510
Let's go.

90
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,040
What were you doing there?

91
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,210
Were you watching Hae Dang leave
because you were worried about her?

92
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,010
Did you see? How could she show up
here with Hyun Joon

93
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,370
only a few days after
she broke up with you?

94
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,840
Did you say you would die
for that shallow woman?

95
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,530
- I don't think I can live here anymore.
- What?

96
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,100
If Hae Dang marries Hyun Joon

97
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,340
then how can I live with them
in the same house?

98
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,030
Hae Dang would feel so uncomfortable.

99
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,470
So... are you saying
you will leave the house

100
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,910
so that Hae Dang can live comfortably?

101
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,870
Don't worry. How could Hae Dang become
a daughter-in-law of this family?

102
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,610
Your family will be worried
because of the stain on your clothes.

103
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,780
I will just say I spilled it
while drinking

104
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,730
because I was so nervous.

105
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,360
- I'm sorry.
- I'm the one who should be sorry.

106
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,690
You had a hard time in front of
your family because of me, didn't you?

107
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,860
That's fine.
Let me hug you.

108
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,510
Just the fact that I can hug you
whenever I want as my woman

109
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:07,800
already makes me feel like
I'm on top of the world.

110
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,710
Don't think about your worries
before you go to sleep.

111
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,830
You... really have an open mind.

112
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:25,580
No. I have a violent temper
and I'm a very strict guy.

113
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,110
I'm only acting like a cool man
in front of you.

114
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,370
Thank you for acting generously
in front of Kyung Soo today.

115
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,800
I guess we eventually
have to talk about Lee Kyung Soo.

116
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,090
Were you thinking about him
all this time?

117
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,570
You are worried about him,
aren't you?

118
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,670
Please be honest.
You can tell me anything.

119
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,790
I promised him that I would always
remember him even if I didn't see him.

120
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,030
What else?

121
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,550
What else?

122
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,810
I'm sorry.

123
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,240
Please talk about him until
I ask you to stop talking about him.

124
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:30,730
You can't talk about him when I ask you
to stop talking about him.

125
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,480
I will make sure that
you forget about him.

126
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,300
I'm definitely going to do that.

127
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,460
I'm going to marry her.

128
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,710
Oh! She is here.

129
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,950
How was it? Did you do well?

130
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,160
Yes.

131
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,580
What happened to your dress?

132
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,050
I got so nervous that
I spilled my cocktail.

133
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,030
Oh yeah! Was the house nice?

134
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,440
Who cares about the house?

135
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,870
They are wealthy.
Of course they have a nice house.

136
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,330
Did anyone put you to shame?

137
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,220
They were all gentle and well-mannered.

138
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,900
I'm going to get some rest now.

139
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,810
- Okay.
- Okay.

140
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,960
Oh geez. Why doesn't she tell us more?

141
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,870
Maybe she was just saying that nothing
happened so that we wouldn't worry.

142
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,920
Do you think someone might have
poured a cocktail on her?

143
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,190
You still haven't left yet?
It's late.

144
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,330
I already bought furniture and our
wedding invitations will come out soon.

145
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,730
Are you kidding me?

146
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,630
How could you follow her
when I was standing next to you?

147
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:01,500
Do you want to see me go insane?
Do you really want me to go mad?

148
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,200
I'm the one who is about to insane!

149
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,720
Do you want to know the truth?

150
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,960
I did all that I could whenever you
wanted me so that I didn't humiliate you!

151
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,280
What?

152
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,890
"All that I could"?

153
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,650
So did you think of her
so that you could do all that you could?

154
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,970
Grandmother!

155
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,280
Grandmother!

156
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,310
Grandmother!

157
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,190
Grandmother!

158
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,530
Let's go upstairs.
Let's go and talk upstairs.

159
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,780
Grandmother, please call my parents.

160
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,390
What? At this hour?

161
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,240
Grandmother, I can't stand this anymore.

162
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,090
I can't stand this
because he hurt my pride so much.

163
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,090
Grandmother, please call my mom.

164
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,860
Mom! Mom!

165
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,860
What is wrong with her?
What in the world did you say to her?

166
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,960
- Grandmother!
- Yes.

167
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,040
- Please call my mom.
- Okay, Yoon Hee.

168
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,140
Calm down. Okay?

169
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,980
Grandmother! He's crazy.
He is crazy!

170
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,110
Yes. I know he's crazy.
You didn't know he was crazy?

171
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,010
My cell phone. My cell phone.

172
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,850
Here.

173
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,130
Mom! Come and pick me up.

174
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,130
Come with Dad to take me home!

175
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,240
No. No.
There is nothing to worry about.

176
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,250
You shouldn't come here so late.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

177
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,790
Yes. I'll have her sleep here tonight
and send her home tomorrow.

178
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,770
I'm sorry. Yes.
I'm sorry.

179
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,210
You should've said you didn't want
to get married in the beginning then!

180
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,130
- How could you do this now?
- You're the one who arranged it.

181
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,020
At that time, I accepted any woman
who approached me.

182
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,480
Any woman?

183
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,270
I didn't really want to live.
But I didn't want to die, either.

184
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:17,240
I just ate and drank and
lived mindlessly from day to day.

185
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,230
Then continue to live mindlessly!

186
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,210
Don't try to pull yourself together
to make things complicated!

187
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,660
I never promised her I would marry her.

188
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,340
But I still did my best
to save a person's life

189
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,020
because I heard that
she tried to kill herself.

190
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,320
But I can never live with Yoon Hee,
Grandmother!

191
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,340
Why can't you? All women are the same
once you get married.

192
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,470
You will know what I mean as time passes.

193
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,240
Hae Dang is the one who made me
regret living mindlessly.

194
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,870
After I met her, I realized I should've
been more considerate of myself.

195
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,310
She can call me a bastard. But I still
want to live with Hae Dang until I die.

196
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,930
Where are you going?
You should take her home.

197
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,660
Please bring me my bag
from upstairs.

198
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,970
You should just go sleep
with Grandmother tonight.

199
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,270
You can't drive home like this.

200
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,560
What are you all doing?
Take her to the room.

201
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,120
Yes, Father.

202
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,110
Why are you staring at me now?

203
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,630
This is all because you are unlucky.

204
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,910
Why are you blaming me for no reason?

205
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,000
Hae Dang is your impersonator.

206
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,350
He met her while trying to bring you
into his company

207
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,470
to make his father angry.

208
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,740
It's not like he would go to a cabaret.

209
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,870
So are you saying this is all my fault?

210
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,510
Then whose fault is it?

211
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,330
Please don't be obstinate and go to bed.

212
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,130
Elderly people can have unfortunate
things happen to them while sleeping

213
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,790
if they get so upset
before going to sleep.

214
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:21,390
Please calm down
and sleep well, Mother.

215
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,680
You little... How could you say
those words?

216
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,240
Don't you see that the family is
getting ruined because of you?

217
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,040
What do you think of the lady
Hyun Joon brought over?

218
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:05,450
Is there a need to say?
She is sly and cunning.

219
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,410
I actually thought
there was more than that.

220
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,370
What do you mean there is more?

221
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:16,790
She might have been born into a poor
family, but she seemed pure and elegant.

222
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,900
Did you say "elegant"?

223
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,210
Hyun Joon didn't go to bars here

224
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,400
because he studied in America.

225
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,680
If you go to Gangnam, there are
literally tons of girls

226
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,580
who are as pretty as she is.

227
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,290
Why are you being so sensitive?

228
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,580
She is clearly not on the same level
as Hyun Joon.

229
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,730
Since when have you been
so worried about Hyun Joon?

230
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,150
They were supposed to get married.

231
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,200
For Yoon Hee, this is the same as
getting struck by lightning.

232
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,290
Since when have you been
so worried about Yoon Hee?

233
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,540
What?

234
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,800
Go make a cocktail for me.
I'm going to drink it before I go to bed.

235
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,630
That's good enough.
You should give her up.

236
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,790
You are going to hurt her feelings more.

237
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,710
For whom should I give up?

238
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,200
What? Did Lee Kyung Soo say he doesn't
want to live in the same house

239
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,170
if I get married to Hae Dang?

240
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,000
How could such a well-mannered son
be born to a mother like you?

241
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,130
- What did you say?
- You are doing all this for nothing.

242
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,680
Lee Kyung Soo
will do anything for Hae Dang.

243
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,080
So you know my son so well, huh?

244
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,500
Your life is eventually
going to be ruined because of your son.

245
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,610
So get out of my way
instead of spouting hot air.

246
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,870
I have a lot to think about besides you.

247
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,000
You are not even going to have breakfast?

248
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,800
You probably aren't in the mood to sit
down with the family and eat breakfast.

249
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,100
Please tell Father that I left.

250
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:31,080
I was impressed when he said
he accepted any woman who approached him.

251
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,760
Weren't you?

252
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,900
Do you tolerate hearing that from a man?

253
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,320
Is that what the ladies
from wealthy families do?

254
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,170
Don't stare at me.
I'm on your side.

255
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,070
I don't want to take Jung Hae Dang
as my daughter-in-law, either.

256
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,570
You should compromise
when you are in that situation.

257
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,410
Aren't you pressed for time?

258
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,630
She always acts so arrogantly

259
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,140
when she doesn't even know
if she will win or lose.

260
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,160
You change sides readily.

261
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,970
It is a skill.

262
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,360
Anyway, it serves her right!

263
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,750
She was acting up by relying on
her wealthy family.

264
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,260
Are you on Hae Dang's side then?

265
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,390
Do you think a woman like her
is suitable for this family?

266
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,770
I am on Jung Hae Dang's side.

267
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,940
Really?

268
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,440
Ah. You want to have
at least one person below you.

269
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,280
I know you have a family complex.

270
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,660
In that case, I wouldn't have
one person below me.

271
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,580
- What?
- It would be two.

272
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,600
What?

273
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,530
Do you know Jung Hae Dang's phone number?
Yoon Hee told me you would know.

274
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,670
I do. Why?

275
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,950
Grandmother needs the phone number.

276
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,800
Hae Dang wouldn't bat an eye
even if Grandmother met her in person.

277
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,330
She is quite spiteful.

278
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,680
Tell Grandmother to meet her father.

279
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,400
Her father?

280
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:38,070
Can I please speak to Mr. Jung Kang Shik?

281
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:43,140
I am Jung Kang Shik.

282
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,380
His grandmother wants to meet me.

283
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,860
She gave me the place
and the time to meet her.

284
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,550
Who is his grandmother?

285
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,340
Who would it be?
She's Yoo Ji Na's mother-in-law.

286
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,110
Ah. That's right.

287
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,470
What should you wear? Should we go
to the mall and buy new clothes?

288
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,760
Why would I buy new clothes?
I'm just going to be myself.

289
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,100
I feel uneasy that CEO Park's grandmother
wants to meet you instead of his father.

290
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,400
Right? If anyone from the family
wanted to have a meeting with Father

291
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,440
then it should've been his father.

292
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,360
I don't think
Hae Dang heard anything yet.

293
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,640
Should I tell CEO Park?

294
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,150
There is no need.
He would just get worried.

295
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,520
I should go meet her if she is
coming out to break them up.

296
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,810
Oh gosh. You don't have
the right to do that.

297
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,230
I guess you are right.

298
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,430
I wouldn't be able to say anything
if she asked me why I was there.

299
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:51,680
<i>I’m left alone on this road again.
I am sitting here staring blankly.</i>

300
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:59,230
<i>For what reason exactly
am I selling myself for laughter?</i>

301
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,720
You should sing it well!

302
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,360
What are you doing right now?
Yoo Jui Na, my butt.

303
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,850
No one likes Yoo Ji Na anyway.

304
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,340
So who would want to watch
the impersonator, Yoo Jui Na?

305
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,540
Get rid of her right now!
I don't like you!

306
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,730
I said, I don't like you!

307
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:40,720
<i>I cried every night. Drunkenly holding
on to it, asking how I can live.</i>

308
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,810
<i>But what use is it to ask? There’s only
the typical answer, “Cheer up!”</i>

309
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,630
How did you find out about this place?

310
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,370
Yoo Ji Na kindly told me.

311
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,440
I'm sorry about last time.

312
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,990
I was taken aback.

313
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,420
I understand.

314
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:17,880
Same as before,
there is nothing for me to say.

315
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,900
Ah. I brought this for you
in case you need it.

316
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,310
It's my wedding invitation.

317
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,130
Would you like to come to my wedding?

318
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,820
Do you want to come and congratulate us?

319
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:44,180
It's polite to open something
someone gives you.

320
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,340
<i>[Groom: Park Hyung Joon
Bride: Hong Yoon Hee]</i>

321
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:01,460
Do you finally realize
what you are doing to me now?

322
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,710
Why don't you answer me?

323
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,270
I already said I'm sorry.

324
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,990
I'm begging you. Please give up on him.

325
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:19,630
What you are doing right now is
completely ruining one woman's life.

326
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,060
You are a woman, too.

327
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,930
Do you think you can live happily
after hurting me so badly?

328
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:33,540
I'm really sorry but this is not
something I can decide by myself.

329
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,860
You should talk to Hyun Joon.

330
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,680
You really are the type of person
who can't communicate nicely.

331
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,950
It was nice watching you
dance in the cabaret.

332
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:54,380
You and I would never run into
each other if it weren't for this.

333
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,750
Even if we ran into each other
on the street

334
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,120
you wouldn't even be able
to look me in the eye.

335
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,600
How dare you interfere in my life?

336
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,410
I guess I really love Park Hyun Joon...

337
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,170
since I am talking to a person like you.

338
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,720
"A person like me"?

339
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,700
You belong to a smelly and dirty town.

340
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,570
Is that so?

341
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,830
You should give up
when I'm asking you nicely.

342
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:33,140
I'm sorry but I'm
going to believe Hyun Joon.

343
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:40,400
Hyun Joon would've stayed
with you if he had to.

344
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,520
What?

345
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,590
He probably considered the circumstances
and decided it was okay to leave you.

346
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,330
I'm sure he did.

347
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,070
I trust Park Hyun Joon.

348
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,280
What?

349
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,330
I actually started to feel comfortable
after seeing you.

350
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:06,630
I don't think the fact that I'm going
to marry him is only for me.

351
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,820
What?

352
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,810
<i>[Groom: Park Hyung Joon
Bride: Hong Yoon Hee]</i>

353
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,360
I'm quite disappointed, Hong Yoon Hee.

354
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,380
I don't think I will need this.

355
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,750
What is going on? You don't usually
call me on the way home from work.

356
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:58,420
We're going to be in-laws soon.
We should grab a drink and talk.

357
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,060
- Sure.
- Yes.

358
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:19,080
By the way... what kind of person
is your grandmother?

359
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,330
Why are you asking
about my grandmother all of a sudden?

360
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,150
- Is she a scary person?
- She certainly is.

361
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,490
She is?

362
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,640
I think she might be
the scariest grandmother in the world.

363
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,470
The scariest grandmother?

364
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:38,980
She has a gift for putting others down.

365
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,140
Ah. I guess she puts others down a lot.

366
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,570
She is ruthless. Normal people wouldn't
even be able to imagine how she is.

367
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:50,160
They wouldn't be able to imagine?

368
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,650
What?

369
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:56,610
Is that so?
She is a typical wealthy old woman.

370
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:01,950
She can easily
completely humiliate someone.

371
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,070
What do you mean?

372
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:07,280
- I think I should go with him.
- That's a good idea.

373
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,980
You can fight with anyone,
including a rich woman.

374
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:17,770
But the old woman pick on you
for going out with an in-law.

375
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,630
- I think you are right.
- Should I go with you?

376
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:24,900
You are especially banned. You have a
bad temper, so you could ruin everything.

377
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,290
Should I go with him?

378
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,750
Oh gosh. You can't say a word,
especially when you should.

379
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:35,680
I think I should take a day off
to go with him.

380
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,030
Oh! You can't go.
You look too poor.

381
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,260
What?

382
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,120
We are worried that
she will look down on us.

383
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,980
Why would you show your face to her?

384
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,790
There is no need!
I'm going to go meet her by myself.

385
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,310
You seem nervous already.

386
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:58,710
I'm not nervous!
It's do-or-die.

387
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,610
Do you have a hand tremor?
Your hands are shaking.

388
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,460
Why are you filling your stomach
with water when we are about to eat?

389
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,490
Ah. You are right.

390
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,540
I know this is off-topic,
but how old are you?

391
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,980
Ah. How old am I?

392
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,860
I'm 61 years old.

393
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,850
You are two years younger than my son.

394
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,320
Is that so?

395
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,220
61 years old is considered young
these days.

396
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,520
But you don't look like that.

397
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,190
You look like my son's older brother.

398
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,150
I'm sorry.

399
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,530
Why are you sweating so much?
Are you hot?

400
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,490
I think they cranked up
the air conditioner in here.

401
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:03,410
It's because... I'm a little nervous.

402
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:06,210
What is there to be nervous about?

403
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,100
You can just answer the questions I ask.

404
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:16,080
Okay. Please ask me
if you have anything to ask.

405
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,570
Are you scared of me?

406
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,320
Ah. Yes.

407
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,240
I think you look scary, just as I heard.

408
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,140
Where did you hear about me?
And what did you hear?

409
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,470
Pardon?

410
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:36,750
Did you hear from Hyun Joon that
I'm the scariest person in the world?

411
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,950
Um...

412
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,060
How scary could a person
like your mother be?

413
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,790
Why are you sweating so much?

414
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,920
Here. Please wipe your sweat.

415
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,110
Ah. Okay.
Thank you.

416
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,830
I heard you work at a gas station.

417
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,950
- Yes.
- Why?

418
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,320
What do you mean why?
Why would I work there?

419
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,640
I'm just doing that so I am
less burdensome to my children.

420
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,740
I've always caused them trouble.

421
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:20,690
But my children
take care of me so well...

422
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,720
I always feel indebted to them.

423
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,360
I'm sorry.

424
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,920
You don't need to say sorry to me.

425
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,800
They say, "There is no such thing
as a high or low job."

426
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,550
Even if there were such a thing as a high
or low job, this job fits me perfectly.

427
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,320
It's rewarding
and it makes me feel comfortable

428
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,670
when I get paid after a day is over.

429
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:48,580
I caused trouble for my children
by trying to run many businesses.

430
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:56,990
But Hae Dang is so nice that
she has never made me feel useless.

431
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,860
People would never believe me.

432
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,910
She is the most considerate
and patient person I know.

433
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:08,260
I know my daughter.

434
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,190
I get it. Please eat now.

435
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,920
Okay.

436
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,850
You are holding the chopsticks backward.

437
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,280
Oh... Okay.

438
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,760
The food here is good stuff.

439
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,060
Please enjoy all of it and eat slowly.

440
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,140
Okay.

441
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:45,540
Excuse me...
Can I go use the restroom?

442
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,920
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

443
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,690
How come he is so weak?

444
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,510
He doesn't seem like a bad person.

445
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,360
He can't even act badly.

446
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,150
He looks like he can't even
earn enough to eat.

447
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:10,400
Grandmother, you're treating him
so much nicer than I expected.

448
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,260
Do you think I act spitefully
to everyone?

449
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,560
Gosh.

450
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,660
It's because I lost the will to fight.

451
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,170
Oh gosh. This is just ridiculous.

452
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,410
A cabaret singer!

453
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,950
I want to cry.
I want to cry.

454
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,140
He's home!

455
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,210
How... did it go?
Did you meet her?

456
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:50,220
- Oh, yeah. I met her.
- What did she say?

457
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,980
She didn't really say much.

458
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,560
She didn't really say much?

459
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,230
But she must have wanted
to say something

460
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,420
- because she wanted to meet you.
- I'm not so sure.

461
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,490
Maybe she wanted them to break up?

462
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,170
She didn't really say that.

463
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:08,360
Then maybe she approved their marriage?

464
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,270
She didn't really say that, either.

465
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:15,480
Then why did she want to meet you?

466
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,480
- I'm not sure.
- Was she scary?

467
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,500
Not really.
She wasn't really scary.

468
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,200
Did you really meet her?

469
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,460
Of course!

470
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,940
How come he looks like
his mind is somewhere else?

471
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,480
Do you think he got his arm twisted?

472
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,750
Maybe she told him not to tell anyone
about their conversation.

473
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,970
Ah. You are probably right.
That's why he can't say anything.

474
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,010
Oh gosh. What is going on?

475
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,760
What did you think of the person?

476
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,110
The only thing wrong with him
is that he is poor.

477
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:01,890
He is not a mean
or cunning type of person.

478
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,490
I'm sure he raised his children well.

479
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,870
I see.

480
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,300
Can you tell all that
from meeting him only once?

481
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,930
I can tell.

482
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,610
Then are you going to approve them?

483
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,310
Of course not!
What about Yoon Hee?

484
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:19,350
Hyun Joon doesn't seem to be
interested in Yoon Hee at all.

485
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:25,610
I think it might be best to just
pair him up with someone he loves

486
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,770
and let him live like other people.

487
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,490
He is already 37 years old.

488
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,040
Oh, my head aches.

489
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,730
I'm sure he got his fingers badly burnt.

490
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:43,140
I'm sure Mrs. Sung Kyung Ja
proved her real worth.

491
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,050
She said he probably
raised his children well.

492
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,510
What?

493
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,820
So she is actually
thinking about accepting her

494
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,130
as her granddaughter-in-law?

495
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,730
No way!

496
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,200
You should stop her.

497
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,550
It seems like you can't stand her
more than you can't stand Yoon Hee.

498
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,250
Who? Me?

499
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,340
Yoon Hee will never be loved
by Hyun Joon.

500
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,030
But is Hae Dang on your mind
since she is loved by Hyun Joon?

501
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,740
Why do you keep talking like that?

502
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,850
You are getting unreasonably upset.

503
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:30,630
You should add a comment when people
mention Hae Dang at the dinner table.

504
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,770
Add what?

505
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,790
Say something like, "She seemed decent."

506
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,820
What is there to add?

507
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,590
For both of us, she is
so much better than Yoon Hee.

508
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,680
Honestly speaking, half of the reason why

509
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,140
Hyun Joon is being treated so well at
home is because of Yoon Hee's family.

510
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,590
He would be powerless without Yoon Hee.

511
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:58,700
If Jung Hae Dang got married to him,
then you would become more powerful.

512
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,020
My family is not any poorer than hers.

513
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,600
Do you think you are
not being treated well

514
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,450
only because
you weren't born into wealth?

515
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,180
What?

516
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:17,500
If Hyun Joon got his marriage arranged,
then he would get divorced in a year.

517
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,880
If he got married, then he wouldn't
get divorced easily.

518
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,230
How do you know that?

519
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,930
Why wouldn't I know that?
I'm tolerating mine, too.

520
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,090
What?

521
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:38,400
Hyun Joon must be on a date
with that lady.

522
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,590
He shouldn't go on a date with another
woman when he's getting married soon.

523
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,600
Didn't you think the lady and Hyun Joon
looked compatible?

524
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,340
Hyun Joon also said that.

525
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,870
He said he regretted living mindlessly
after meeting her.

526
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:02,240
His wife needs to be calm
so that she can stand his hot temper.

527
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,890
Yoon Hee can become somewhat bothersome
although she doesn't seem like it.

528
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,380
Since when did you have
so much to say at the dinner table?

529
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,840
What?

530
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,750
How can you let someone
so obviously shrewd

531
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,250
- into this household?
- Look who's talking!

532
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,930
I won't approve Jung Hae Dang.

533
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,450
Who do you think you are
to interfere in this?

534
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,070
Of course I have a right,
since it's my daughter-in-law.

535
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,590
You can pick your daughter-in-law
all you want when he gets married.

536
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,240
Please find some.

537
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
What?

538
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,210
You must know a lot of granddaughters
from wealthy families.

539
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:43,250
Oh my goodness.

540
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,240
You should just eat.

541
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,040
I'm sure your own child
will laugh at you.

542
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,000
Thank you.
Please excuse me.

543
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,990
You didn't even finish eating.

544
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:06,560
Why did you get up when you didn't
even finish your dinner?

545
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,340
You should've talked to Chairman Park
while drinking tea or something.

546
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,700
- What should I talk to him about?
- There are so many things to talk about!

547
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,310
You have never even
called him "Father", have you?

548
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,920
Father?

549
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,650
You don't have to call me "Mother"
but call Chairman Park "Father."

550
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,350
- What kind of logic is that?
- What logic?

551
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,530
Listen to me carefully.

552
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,400
If Hae Dang marries Hyun Joon

553
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,270
then I'll want Hyun Joon to be
the successor of the company.

554
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,600
What?
Why?

555
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:47,270
You are going to make Jung Hae Dang
the wife of the owner of the company?

556
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,420
Don't even think about that!

557
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,780
If she marries Hyun Joon,
then I will eat my hat.

558
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,950
- Did Hyun Joon come home?
- Yes.

559
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:22,020
I have something to ask you, Hyun Joon.

560
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,030
Are you going to come work
for the company

561
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:28,040
if I allow you to marry Hae Dang?

562
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,560
Grandmother!

563
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,010
Are you going to come work
and be trained by your father

564
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,460
to get yourself ready
to take over the company?

565
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,450
Stop this nonsense!

566
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,400
So you are going to accept
Jung Hae Dang as Hyun Joon's wife?

567
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,170
And you are going to
hand the company over to Hyun Joon?

568
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:54,250
Stop this nonsense!
This is all nonsense! Nonsense!

569
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:58,920
What is wrong with you?

570
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,660
You really can't stand to see him
getting married, can you?

571
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,960
She said Jung Hae Dang
and Hyun Joon are getting married

572
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,500
and Hyun Joon is taking over the company.
Do you think that makes any sense?

573
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:15,400
How could you shamelessly be interested
in who's taking over the company?

574
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,740
What?

575
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,960
I'm really embarrassed
in front of my mother and children.

576
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,730
Could you please watch
what you are saying?

577
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,240
I can never let that happen!

578
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,400
I can't let Jung Hae Dang become
the wife of the owner of a company.

579
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,620
That's impossible.
That should never happen!

580
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,200
You are crazy.

581
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,810
You really are crazy to the bone.

582
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:43,350
I will never let Jung Hae Dang
in this house!

583
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,460
I won't let that happen!

584
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,330
If you don't want to see it, then just
leave this house. It's that simple.

585
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:52,230
How dare you say
you won't let it happen?

586
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,060
I'll never let that happen!

587
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,110
What?

588
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:00,290
Oh gosh. This is just ridiculous.

589
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,760
Oh gosh.

590
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,590
Congratulations.

591
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,980
I'm not sure if I should
receive congratulations from you.

592
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,080
But thank you.

593
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,260
Do you feel uncomfortable
about me staying in this house?

594
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,760
Would you leave the house
if I said I was?

595
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,190
I understand your situation.

596
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:37,730
Is it true that
your grandmother accepted me?

597
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:39,320
It is!

598
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:43,970
You came all the way here
at this hour because of that?

599
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,800
How could I tell you such happy news
over the phone?

600
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,950
I can't believe it.

601
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:51,380
Actually, I can't make sense
of what is going on either.

602
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,090
You surprised me again

603
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,020
because this means that
my grandmother liked you.

604
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,820
You don't know
what kind of person she is.

605
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:04,420
Let's officially tell your family
when my marriage issue gets resolved.

606
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,340
Your family will be happy, too.

607
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,220
I'm sure they will be.

608
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:17,130
You can achieve anything
if you sincerely want it.

609
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:21,090
I persisted but I was still skeptical.

610
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:25,480
I can finally make you my wife.

611
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,810
My family will hear.

612
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:31,710
You can't go anywhere now.
I won't let you go anywhere.

613
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,960
<i>[Groom: Park Hyung Joon
Bride: Hong Yoon Hee]</i>

614
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,050
I have the wedding invitation,
Grandmother.

615
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,500
Did you already
give these out to your guests?

616
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,390
- No. I haven't.
- That's good.

617
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:19,180
What's good?

618
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,330
Yoon Hee...

619
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,970
I'm saying this to you because
I'm also worried about your life.

620
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:29,810
I don't think you and Hyun Joon
are meant for each other.

621
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:31,890
What?

622
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:37,360
It's not too late since
you haven't given out the invitations.

623
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,420
Let's think about this a little more.

624
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,180
Think more about what?

625
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:45,630
Wouldn't it be a shame if the groom
didn't show up at the wedding?

626
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:46,960
Grandmother!

627
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,720
And if that happened,
then you wouldn't be able to get married

628
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,470
to another man from a decent family.

629
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:57,520
What are you talking about now?

630
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,670
Why are you getting up so suddenly?

631
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,900
I didn't know you would change
like this. I believed you!

632
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,000
Yoon Hee...

633
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,980
That won't happen!

634
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,240
I'm going to wait for Hyun Joon
on my wedding day.

635
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,000
- What if he doesn't show up?
- He is going to show up.

636
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,450
I'll see you at the wedding.

637
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:25,780
Oh gosh. I didn't know
she had a side like that.

638
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,420
What is the matter?

639
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,460
- It's very urgent.
- What is?

640
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,250
I heard that the National Tax Service
started investigating

641
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,040
the company's taxes from last year.

642
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,260
What?

643
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,210
Why all of a sudden?

644
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:58,030
Maybe Yoon Hee's family made a move.

645
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:00,820
What?

646
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,750
Yoon Hee's grandfather is
the president of a university.

647
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,630
But the problem is her mother's side.

648
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,130
Her mother's side?

649
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:13,010
Her maternal grandfather and uncles
are senior politicians.

650
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,340
Really?

651
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:19,400
That's why Grandmother is all over her,
calling her "Yoon Hee."

652
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:25,250
But then a daughter of
someone who works at a gas station

653
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,950
is trying to push Yoon Hee out?

654
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,440
What do you mean?

655
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,390
The fact that the National Tax Service
started an investigation

656
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,000
means they are trying to scare us.

657
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,910
They are warning us that they could
conduct an actual investigation.

658
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,330
Are you sure that Yoon Hee's
mother's side did all this?

659
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:42,810
That's what I have found
based on my research.

660
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:47,920
Oh gosh. What should we do now?

661
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,890
Oh my goodness.

662
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,300
You are in a situation
where you have no choice.

663
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:02,970
If they intentionally go after us,
then we have no power to endure.

664
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,900
This is declaration of war!

665
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:12,630
Hyun Joon!

666
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,170
What brings you here?

667
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,420
Hyun Joon's grandmother
wanted to see me.

668
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,680
Why?

669
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:11,500
Hi.

670
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,890
Hello.

671
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,320
Please have a seat.

672
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,120
Will you stay out of this?

673
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:35,010
- I want to hear, too.
- Go inside!

674
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,480
I'll keep this short.

675
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,840
I think I need
Hyun Joon to marry Yoon Hee.

676
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,710
You know who Yoon Hee is,
don't you?

677
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,920
Yes.

678
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:08,710
The company might suffer greatly
if he doesn't show up at his wedding.

679
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,320
Pardon?

680
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:16,490
So please tell Hyun Joon
to show up at the wedding.

681
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:17,950
Grandmother.

682
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:23,490
I don't think Yoon Hee is
someone you can fight.

683
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,250
Also, it is not right to interfere in
someone's wedding so close to the date.

684
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:32,410
I'm sorry.

685
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:38,110
If you are sorry, then please make sure
to bring Hyun Joon to the wedding.

686
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:39,370
I should do that?

687
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:42,230
He won't listen to anyone else.

688
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,150
How can I do such a thing?

689
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,570
That's why I am asking you to do it.

690
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:49,730
Grandmother.

691
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,570
We are in big trouble right now.

692
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,770
What's wrong?
Did Grandmother scold you?

693
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:16,370
I'd rather be scolded.
I would feel better that way.

694
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:18,340
Why? What did she say?

695
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:24,360
I think Hong Yoon Hee's family is
somehow putting pressure on the company.

696
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,030
Are you serious?

697
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:31,390
So they are going to have Hyun Joon
marry Yoon Hee?

698
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,500
I think they have no choice.

699
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,770
Then what's going to happen to you?

700
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:41,550
I think this was an impractical idea.

701
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:10,060
How much longer are you going
to stand there and watch her?

702
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,100
How much longer
are you going to watch her?

703
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,220
I heard that you
are going to marry Yoon Hee.

704
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,670
Why are you letting that happen?

705
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,490
I'm never going to that wedding.

706
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:32,780
She told Hae Dang
to bring you to the wedding.

707
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,260
- How brutal is she to ask that?
- Who said that?

708
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,950
If you were insisting on
marrying Hae Dang

709
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:39,710
when you couldn't even handle it,
then I will never forgive you.

710
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:44,930
Do you still have the right
to forgive me?

711
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:48,540
If you decided to hand her over to me

712
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,860
then you should stay out of this.

713
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:02,040
Just stay there.
I'll bring my car.

714
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:24,270
I think it was an unreasonable idea
when you already had a fiancee.

715
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,840
So are you telling me to marry Yoon Hee?

716
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:34,430
- We have no choice.
- Then what about you?

717
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,800
You!

718
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,280
- Hyun Joon.
- What?

719
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:44,140
Did you change your mind since
Lee Kyung Soo lives in the house?

720
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,180
Do you now want to give up on
revenge for your sister's death

721
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:50,210
because you don't want
Kyung Soo to get hurt?

722
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,310
Hyun Joon...

723
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:58,440
Don't worry. I'm never going to a wedding
with a woman other than you.

724
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,550
Are you really that confident?

725
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:05,010
I'm not enduring because I'm confident.
I'm enduring because I have to.

726
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:07,700
So please don't say anything
to let me down.

727
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:12,140
I feel like I put a burden
on your shoulders.

728
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,990
I said it was fine!

729
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:19,210
It's okay! I can sink
under any burden you give me.

730
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,760
If it's not because
you don't want to see Kyung Soo get hurt

731
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,680
then please do as I say.

732
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:29,500
Please don't hurt my pride anymore.

733
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:35,720
- You look so pretty.
- You look really pretty today.

734
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,220
- Congrats!
- Congrats, Yoon Hee!

735
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:41,450
- You look so pretty.
- Can we take a picture?

736
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,680
- Should I go on this side?
- Sure.

737
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,060
Congratulations.

738
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,410
Thank you.

739
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:51,800
Thank you.

740
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,630
What...

741
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,260
Thank you.

742
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,440
Congratulations.

743
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:23,450
Hyun Joon is still not here yet.

744
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,460
We only have 15 minutes.

745
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,990
I thought you wanted
to go shopping at the mall.

746
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:37,950
Are you sure you are going to the mall?

747
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:41,710
I told you to come out by 1 p.m.
Why did you come out 30 minutes late?

748
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:45,100
Where are you going?
You didn't even let me drive.

749
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,810
Just be quiet.

750
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,660
Where are you going?

751
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:53,130
I'm risking our lives and driving
right now. So don't talk to me.

752
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,110
Oh gosh. We're late.
We need to be there by 2 p.m.

753
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,350
By 2 p.m.?

754
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,220
Are you perhaps taking me to the wedding?

755
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,620
Are you going to watch
your company just collapse?

756
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,820
Are you insane?

757
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,610
I don't even have time to think
about whether or not I'm insane.

758
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:11,100
Pull over. Pull over.

759
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,760
Be quiet.

760
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,140
I said, pull over!

761
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,160
Is the groom not here yet?

762
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,570
We are 20 minutes late already.
We can't delay it anymore.

763
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,560
He is still not here yet.
What should we do?

764
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:53,620
Oh, no. What should we do?

765
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,320
I need to talk to someone
from Hyun Joon's family.

766
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:29,500
Hi, this is Jung Hae Dang.

767
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:35,090
I was driving Hyun Joon to the wedding...

768
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:39,070
Really?
Okay.

769
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,690
Okay. Bye.

770
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,590
Grandmother, I need to talk to you.

771
01:00:56,290 --> 01:01:00,070
Jung Hae Dang was driving
Hyun Joon to the wedding...

772
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:04,650
and then he got out of the car
at a red light and just ran away.

773
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:16,580
This guy wants me to die.

774
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:20,990
What should we do now?

775
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:39,790
What are we going to do
if he doesn't show up?

776
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:41,880
How could you let this happen?

777
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,800
What is Yoon Hee going to do now?
Everyone is waiting.

778
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,730
If he doesn't show up,
how is Yoon Hee going to live?

779
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:57,060
I'd like to sincerely apologize.
I'm sorry.

780
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,250
How can you say that?

781
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:04,080
I feel dizzy all of a sudden.

782
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,040
- Grandmother!
- Mother!

783
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,780
Mother!

784
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,990
- Mother!
- Grandmother!

785
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:20,700
What are you doing?
Call an ambulance!

786
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:25,550
What about the wedding?

787
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:29,410
How can we have a wedding
when Mother is about to pass away?

788
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:31,030
Call an ambulance!

789
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:36,400
Mother! Wake up! Mother! Mother!

790
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:38,370
Mother!

791
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,110
Mother!

792
