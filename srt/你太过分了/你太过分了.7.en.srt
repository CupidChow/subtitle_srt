<i>[Episode 7]</i>

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,120
Hey let's go.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,520
Check please!

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,140
Good bye.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,100
<i>Even though I'm a man</i>

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,100
<i>the fact that I can't do anything
for the person I care deeply about</i>

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,870
<i>is a lot harder to accept than I thought.</i>

9
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,590
<i>Please let me pray for you and
watch you from a distance.</i>

10
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,050
Miss. What kind of lady drinks so much?

11
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,260
The store is closed. Please wrap
things up and go home.

12
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,840
Hello.

13
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,520
Hello.

14
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,720
<i>Please, don't call me anymore.</i>

15
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,540
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,390
I'm going to hang up.

17
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,570
Don't hang up! Hello!

18
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,030
She's drunk and she passed out!

19
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,370
<i>I have to close the store. What
am I supposed to do? Come get her.</i>

20
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,340
Where are you located?

21
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,070
I'm sorry, but I'm not in
any position to go there.

22
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,840
<i>I'm going to leave her in front
of the store. Do whatever you want!</i>

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,360
I...

24
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,900
Hae Soo, it's me.

25
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,460
No.

26
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,950
I'm sorry to call you so late at night.

27
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,920
Okay. Bye.

28
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,220
Taxi!

29
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Taxi. Taxi!

30
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,070
Is anyone there? Please help me!

31
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,200
Is anyone there?

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,540
Please help me!

33
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,490
Taxi!

34
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,980
Is anyone there?

35
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,140
Please help me!

36
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,340
Someone is sitting in front of the store.

37
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,490
Thank you so much. You can go now.

38
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,190
Okay. This way.

39
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,980
- Just keep walking straight.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,680
Hae Dang. Hae Dang!

41
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,550
Hae Dang!

42
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,550
- Hae Dang!
- Kyung Soo?

43
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,870
Kyung Soo.

44
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,580
What are you doing here?

45
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,200
Did you come all the way here to find me?

46
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,610
You're an idiot...

47
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:48,430
Since you were able to find me here,
I bet you could find me anywhere!

48
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,810
Why would you think that
you can't do anything for me?

49
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,860
Don't say anything

50
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,240
and just be still for a second.

51
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,060
The reason I couldn't say anything...

52
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,020
was because I wasn't sure
if I was confident enough

53
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,470
to forget about the man who died.

54
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,860
You are an idiot.

55
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,630
Why would you forget him?

56
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,880
You don't have to forget about him.

57
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:46,180
The life you lived... Your memories,
suffering, and sadness...

58
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,610
is all part of you.

59
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,790
Can I...

60
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,060
touch your face?

61
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,800
I want to remember.

62
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,290
Even though I can't see your face...

63
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,070
I'm going to remember it,
so I don't ever forget.

64
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,530
No matter what happens...

65
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,960
I won't forget you.

66
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,100
Don't worry about me.

67
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,960
Just leave me.

68
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,750
<i>The people I love</i>

69
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,040
<i>all have the tendency to suddenly leave.</i>

70
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,670
<i>[For Lease]</i>

71
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,020
<i>Without a word...</i>

72
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,460
<i>Without a goodbye...</i>

73
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,720
<i>But I didn't cry.</i>

74
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,250
<i>Just like he said</i>

75
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,680
<i>I didn't feel anything.</i>

76
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,300
<i>I didn't hope for anything.</i>

77
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,330
<i>I didn't resent anybody.</i>

78
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,730
<i>And I tried my best</i>

79
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,840
<i>to not wait for anyone.</i>

80
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,070
<i>But even in the midst of my low times</i>

81
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,010
<i>life didn't stop.</i>

82
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,770
<i>[For Lease]</i>

83
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,620
<i>As time passed</i>

84
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,860
<i>I had to accept it and move on</i>

85
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,080
<i>from another farewell.</i>

86
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:44,270
I wonder how many times I'm
going wash this pot before I die?

87
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,640
What are you talking about?

88
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,090
I mean even after I wash this,
it's just going to get dirty again.

89
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,430
Then, I'll have to wash it again!

90
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,870
Seriously, if you think about it,
this work is so ridiculous!

91
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,310
If you think washing a pot is ridiculous,
then you shouldn't do house chores.

92
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,670
Kids these days may not know,
but house chores can be fun!

93
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,970
Out of all the things there are to do in
this world, you see house chores as fun?

94
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,030
What do you mean this is not fun?

95
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,190
It's fun to see kimchi ferment
to the perfect flavor.

96
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,070
It's fun to clean the containers for
hot pepper and soy sauce paste!

97
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,080
Life must be fun when you have
your entire allowance in your pocket.

98
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,340
It wasn't that long ago
that you said you hated cooking.

99
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,520
That's what money does to you.

100
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,560
It feels good to have
the money in my hands.

101
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,610
Seriously, you look so lively these days.

102
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,710
- Good night.
- Okay. You too.

103
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,330
But...

104
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,850
Why are you saying good night,
but going to that room?

105
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,840
I've been sleeping here lately.

106
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,510
What?

107
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,190
You didn't know?

108
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,610
They've been sleeping
separately these days.

109
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,600
How can they be sleeping
separately already?

110
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,820
What's so funny that you're
laughing so hard?

111
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,380
What now?

112
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,110
Did you... get dumped?

113
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,270
- Dumped?
- You think only women get dumped?

114
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,530
Being alone is scary!
Get her back right now!

115
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,090
How can I get her back
when she doesn't want to be here?

116
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,680
How are we supposed
to sleep next to each other

117
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,340
when she hates our skin touching,
my snoring, and even my scent?

118
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,820
Such a fool! How do you get dumped
by your wife at your age?

119
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,510
Who caused this to happen?

120
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,320
- What did you say?
- You know I'm right!

121
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,760
You! You! I just want to...

122
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,360
- I'm right!
- Oh my gosh...

123
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,970
Are you sleeping?

124
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,970
Are you sleeping, sweetheart?

125
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,230
Why would you leave your big bed
and sleep in this small room?

126
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,880
Husband and wife should sleep
in the same bed no matter what.

127
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,300
When I look at his face
when he's sleeping

128
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,540
all I can think about is
throwing a pillow at him.

129
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,310
- What?
- I'm so angry that I can't sleep

130
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:03,520
but he's snoring away
and sleeping so comfortably.

131
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,550
When I see that, I just want
to suffocate him with a pillow.

132
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,030
I'm sleeping in here to keep my sanity.

133
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,540
Sweetheart...

134
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,110
If only I hadn't met him,
then my life would be...

135
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,540
Sweetheart... Hoon's mom.

136
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,610
I don't even want to touch his
dirty socks. They disgust me.

137
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,810
What?

138
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,760
I shouldn't have gone
to that meeting that day.

139
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:43,280
I cut ties with the friend who
invited me to the meeting.

140
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,950
Her symptoms are worse than I thought.

141
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,370
This problem is much
bigger than I thought.

142
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,240
Why? You think Bong Soo is going
to be alone for the rest of his life?

143
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,350
That's not the problem!

144
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,200
Then what's the problem?

145
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,000
I think that spiteful woman has lost her
spirit because she couldn't win me over.

146
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,810
She lost her spirit?

147
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,630
What if she gets depressed,
and then it becomes a serious problem?

148
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,440
Her eyes looked strange.

149
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,110
If anyone was going to get
depressed, it would be me!

150
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,880
When people like her don't get
their way, they lose their spirit!

151
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,810
Have you seen someone as
loud as you get depressed?

152
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:42,600
I think she wants to suffocate him
with a pillow while he's sleeping.

153
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,080
That's a very normal response.

154
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,530
Out of all married women, I bet half
of them would say the same thing.

155
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,810
I'm not joking!

156
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,850
I have heard about lots of bad situations
when wives get depressed.

157
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,790
Sometimes you're so naive.

158
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,950
Are you scared because
you took the allowance?

159
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,700
When I was coming back
from the grocery store

160
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,400
there was this calm, modest lady

161
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,320
who was quietly mumbling something
to herself as she was walking.

162
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,930
A calm and modest lady?

163
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,640
She was so angry inside
that she lost her spirit!

164
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,930
Then, give the allowance back.

165
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:22,470
Her eyes will return
to normal in 0.1 seconds.

166
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,710
So tired! So sleepy.

167
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,230
So scary...

168
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,550
Did you not tell our
guest to eat breakfast?

169
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,420
She said she will
take care of it herself.

170
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,370
I think she will only join us for dinner.

171
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,410
What is she going to
do without breakfast?

172
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,890
That's enough. Eat.

173
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,130
- I'll prepare something separately.
- Thank you.

174
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,110
Please be mindful.

175
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,370
- Yes, Father.
- I trust you.

176
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,680
Didn't you hear me say
that that was enough?

177
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,660
Did you decide to throw away
your dignity in front of your children?

178
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,030
I'm sorry. Please go ahead and eat.

179
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,910
Where is Hyun Joon?

180
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,530
I think he went to work out.

181
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,430
He said he will eat later because
he feels uncomfortable with Yoo Ji Na.

182
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,140
The weather sure is nice.

183
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,540
How is your entertainment business going?

184
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,740
Send the contract over.

185
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,000
I'll read it and if I like it,
then I will sign it.

186
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,850
Didn't you cause all that trouble because
you wanted a contract with me?

187
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,380
After I ask Jung Hae Dang.

188
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,500
What?

189
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,380
Ask whom for what?

190
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,720
I'm saying If Jung Hae Dang is okay
and will still work with me

191
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,160
even when you join my company.

192
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,630
I'm not someone who doesn't usually
get it, but I didn't understand that.

193
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:12,360
I'm saying that I have requested an
exclusive contract with Jung Hae Dang.

194
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,340
Exclusive?

195
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,840
- Why?
- Why?

196
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,180
Are you trying to say that Jung Hae Dang

197
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:25,020
is not skilled enough to have companies
request a contract without you?

198
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,380
How arrogant.

199
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,110
By the way...

200
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,410
The first night you were here,
didn't you say you were going to leave?

201
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,950
Why are you still here?

202
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,330
- Go inside.
- Those were just empty words.

203
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,220
You make up lies outright
whenever it's necessary.

204
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,590
You look down on people
and pretend to help them.

205
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,560
I absolutely hate it.

206
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,120
Get out of the house

207
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,350
- right now.
- What did you say?

208
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,980
I think it'll be too hard to maintain
our relationship under the same roof.

209
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,010
- No.
- No?

210
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,500
Things are starting to get fun.
Why should I leave?

211
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,340
- What?
- I have nothing left to lose.

212
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,460
Why would I leave the house?

213
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,050
It's not like I've stayed here before
because someone told me to stay.

214
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,070
My goodness.

215
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,690
Children sure are scary.

216
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,490
He is not my child, more like...

217
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,170
Go to work.

218
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,140
I can't even discipline my own family,
but I let my feelings take over

219
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,640
and I think inviting you here
has only caused trouble for you.

220
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,280
I'm scared of what other
terrible things might happen.

221
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,880
Don't worry. I can handle it.

222
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,690
Are you sure you can handle it even
after you hear those unspeakable words?

223
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,230
It's cute.

224
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,800
- It's cute?
- He's taking his deceased mom's side.

225
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,070
He's spitting out everything
that's in his head

226
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,340
without even half a second of hesitation.

227
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,920
He seems like a kid complaining.

228
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,400
I'm grateful that you see my
immature son as cute.

229
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,040
Even if he talks to you, ignore him.

230
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,790
You will only hear insults
if you respond to him.

231
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,790
I talked to him first.

232
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,730
See you later.

233
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,500
It's been a while. Why are you here?

234
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,250
- Long time no see.
- What's going on?

235
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,990
We have to make a decision
whether to fold or not.

236
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,180
There is no decision to make.

237
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,840
Let me ask you one last time.

238
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,880
You really have no interest
in working with me?

239
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,390
This has nothing to do with Yoo Ji Na.

240
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,470
You weren't joking?

241
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,320
Would I joke about such a thing?

242
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,990
Why do you want a contract with me?

243
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,490
It's not like you're in
a great situation.

244
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,190
Why do you keep asking so
many questions? Just do it!

245
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,410
I mean, I'm thankful for
the offer if it's not a joke.

246
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,350
You are right that I'm not
in any position to be picky but...

247
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,100
- Forget it.
- Why?

248
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,110
I don't want to get involved
with Yoo Ji Na at all.

249
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,020
What happened between the two of you?

250
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,940
Why bother asking
when you know I'm not going to answer?

251
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,200
Okay, fine. Everyone has a story.

252
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,760
I'm sorry if I annoyed you.

253
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,550
You were annoying,
but you don't have to apologize.

254
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,050
I wasn't exactly polite either.

255
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,510
I hope that an opportunity arises
for you to show your talent.

256
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,370
Let's be polite
if we see each other again.

257
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,910
Why would we see each other again?

258
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,610
See you.

259
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:28,850
<i>The person I loved for so long.</i>

260
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,800
<i>Who knew he would turn away?</i>

261
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,890
<i>Back then...</i>

262
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,160
<i>I didn't know.</i>

263
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,830
<i>I really didn't know.</i>

264
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,280
Son of a bitch!

265
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,640
Hey! You should be looking
straight when you're driving!

266
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,180
You were looking at
your phone, weren't you?

267
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,220
What bad luck I'm having today.

268
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,010
Why are you talking to me informally?

269
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,170
Hey, what are you going
to do about this car?

270
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,110
We'll know after we call
the insurance company!

271
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,420
Why you... This is bullshit.

272
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,340
A bitch runs into me with a truck...

273
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,550
Are you done talking?

274
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,390
Why you...

275
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,940
There is no better
expert at this than me!

276
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,920
Yeah? What's up?

277
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,890
What am I doing?

278
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:59,100
I don't have work now, so I'm
just taking out the recyclables.

279
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,300
What? A fight? With whom?

280
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,540
Are you serious? What do we do?

281
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,420
You want me to come?

282
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,240
What do you want me to do?

283
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,300
Okay.

284
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,650
I won't tell Hae Dang. Okay, okay!

285
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,190
Thank you! Come again!

286
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,680
My goodness. Oh, sorry.

287
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,810
You're here?

288
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,070
- Long time no see.
- Have you been well?

289
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,670
Of course, of course!

290
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,490
Let's go inside and have a cup of tea.

291
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,170
- Ah, I have work.
- Yes, of course.

292
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,580
I came here to say goodbye because
I don't think I will come back again.

293
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,390
You won't... come back again?

294
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,010
Why? Did you get
into a fight with Hae Dang?

295
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,810
I... I'm sorry to say but...

296
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:56,430
I am not friends with Jung Hae Dang.

297
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,180
You... You're not?

298
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,290
I wanted to tell you, so you won't
be so angry if you find out later.

299
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,200
You're not her friend...

300
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,850
- I'm sorry.
- I mean...

301
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,560
I'm sure you had a reason.

302
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,940
Is that why you came all the way here?

303
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,260
It was on the way.

304
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,560
Whoever raised you, they raised you well.

305
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,960
I'm a little disappointed.

306
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,490
- I'm sorry.
- Dad!

307
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,410
- Dad!
- What?

308
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,020
Dad! Trouble!

309
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,640
- What happened?
- Hae Sung is at the police station!

310
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,650
The police station?
Why is she at the police station?

311
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,060
She got into a fight!

312
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,620
- A fight? With whom?
- A man!

313
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,230
A man?

314
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,660
What do you mean she
got into a fight with a man?

315
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,760
What if she got beaten up?

316
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,450
Sir, this way.

317
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,050
Oh... Where am I going right now?

318
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,870
I bet you this happened
because she lost her temper!

319
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,710
You're saying Hae Dang's sister got into
a fight and went to the police station?

320
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,840
Yeah. I told you she has a bad temper!
My daughter! My baby...

321
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,250
- What are you doing? Get us a taxi!
- Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

322
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,640
Instead of doing that,
we can take my car.

323
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,300
Should we?

324
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,480
Thank you.

325
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,520
I thought you had
somewhere you needed to go.

326
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,290
It's not anything urgent.

327
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,780
- Oh...
- Who is he?

328
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,120
This is...

329
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,130
I'm not sure either.

330
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,460
- You don't know?
- I thought he was Hae Dang's friend

331
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,260
but unfortunately he is not.

332
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,570
Introduce yourself.

333
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,680
This is my youngest daughter.

334
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,440
My name is Park Hyun Joon.

335
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,980
I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

336
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,220
They say children are
the result of your life.

337
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,630
I have not experienced
it like this before.

338
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,200
You raised him well.

339
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,130
Raised him well?

340
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,610
Are you being sarcastic?

341
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,710
He knows not to ignore
people who live a hard life.

342
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,360
He's loyal to his mother

343
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,220
even though it would be
in his best interest

344
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,090
to be seen favorably by his father.

345
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,330
Isn't it enough to say
you raised him well?

346
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,330
I'm not sure how I'm
supposed to interpret that.

347
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:35,630
If your son were happy with us, that
would mean you didn't raise him well.

348
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,820
Is that an insult or a compliment?

349
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,460
Did you think I would only look
at what's on the outside?

350
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,500
This is why I'm willing
to do anything for you

351
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,250
but it would still be
nice if you took my side.

352
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,570
I'm slowly getting upset.

353
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,560
He is not like you.

354
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:02,920
No he is. He is me from head to toe.

355
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,010
I think he is more like your late wife.

356
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:12,960
His grandmother doesn't have it and
his father doesn't have it. But he does.

357
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,220
I told you to stop. I'm getting jealous.

358
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:20,700
It can't be helped even if you
are jealous. It is what it is.

359
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
And what is that?

360
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,420
Compassion.

361
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,870
He loathes you because
he pities his late mother.

362
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:40,560
You have a way of looking at life deeply.

363
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:48,450
Don't go out to see
another man with that hairstyle.

364
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,990
- Is it weird?
- You look too beautiful.

365
00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:00,240
Chairman Park Sung Hwan, do you think
you can woo me with those words?

366
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,620
Neither my late wife

367
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,750
nor the rest of the world

368
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,560
showed me compassion.

369
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,620
However, there is one person

370
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,660
I sympathize with.

371
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:23,940
Is it me? I have a bad feeling...

372
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,460
You are so glamorous and charming...

373
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,580
but at some point when
I started thinking about you...

374
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,430
my heart started to ache.

375
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,180
This is a lot of pressure.

376
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,970
Have you been sleeping well

377
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,240
without the pills these days?

378
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,240
I'm so worried that I want to run to you.

379
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,200
How do you know that I take pills?

380
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,360
Did my manager tell you?

381
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,240
What is buried in your heart that you
reject everything glamorous in your life

382
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,770
and hide from the world, Yoo Ji Na?

383
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,020
You should stay in the car.

384
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,860
He's right. For something like this,
I need a young man I can trust.

385
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,870
- Thank you.
- Let's go in.

386
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,570
My goodness.

387
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,010
Hae Sung! Hae Sung!

388
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,630
Are you hurt?

389
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,230
She is completely fine.

390
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,850
The person who was beaten up was me. Me!

391
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,500
Oh! It that true? How did this happen?

392
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,210
What are you going to do about this?

393
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:54,570
She pulled out the few hairs I had left!

394
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,510
Do you know how much
I spent planting this hair?

395
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,060
You planted your... hair?

396
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,070
What are you going to do with my hair?

397
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,910
I'm... I'm sorry.

398
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,880
How did you raise your
daughter to be so vicious?

399
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,690
I've never in my life
seen a fighter like her!

400
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:18,320
You're supposed to be in school
right now. How did you get into a fight?

401
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,960
Officer, she is a school teacher.
This will be bad for her!

402
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,470
Teacher, yeah right! Why would
a teacher be delivering packages?

403
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,280
Delivering packages?

404
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,170
What is he talking about?

405
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,280
- I'm sorry.
- I am not agreeing to any settlement!

406
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,700
My hair is my life!

407
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,790
Sir, I am sorry.

408
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,460
At times like this, you should
try to be more reasonable.

409
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,920
Reasonable? Reasonable my ass!

410
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,550
I am in shock right now!

411
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,250
We will plant your hair again

412
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:59,040
and we will compensate you for
the shock you went through.

413
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,690
We will fill your whole head.

414
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,020
We'll fill your entire head.

415
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,400
How did it go? Hae Sung, are you hurt?

416
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,020
Everything went well thanks
to him. Thank you, lad.

417
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,060
I'm glad everything went well.

418
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,750
If it weren't for you,
it would have been complicated!

419
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,820
- No problem.
- Thank you.

420
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:32,400
It's okay. All of Hae Dang's
sisters are so brave!

421
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:38,270
Still, how did you win
a fight against a man?

422
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,050
Is that really important right now?

423
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:45,880
No. But I think it is much better
than getting hit by a man.

424
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,170
You need to control your temper!

425
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,090
I don't take the pills anymore.

426
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,990
Really?

427
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:04,770
Wow. That's good to hear.

428
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,420
I think it's because of
your daughter-in-law.

429
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,320
The food is good and she
gives me things to past the time.

430
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,190
I sleep so well because I'm
so tired by the end of the night.

431
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,710
She has a way of listening to people.

432
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,850
I'm proud of her.

433
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,160
I think I have to live with people.

434
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,100
Even though the house is filled with
people who criticize each other.

435
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:41,000
Thanks for adjusting to it so well.
I'm glad that I was some help to you.

436
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,300
Why don't you open up
a little bit to your eldest son?

437
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,270
You can't live the rest of
your life with your son like this.

438
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,290
You're talking about him again?

439
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,550
What parent can win against his child?

440
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,920
I think your late wife...

441
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,330
gave a lot of love
to your son before she left.

442
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:10,400
And not only to her children.
She had a lot of love to give.

443
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,020
Except to me.

444
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,940
There was some fault on this side.

445
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,560
I admit it.

446
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:27,570
There was never a woman
who told me this before.

447
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:32,780
To love someone is a miracle.

448
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,140
At this rate, my personality
might improve. That can't happen.

449
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,130
I think that's quite impossible.

450
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,740
You never lose once.

451
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,770
Thank you so much.

452
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,800
I'll be going now.

453
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,210
You can't just leave. Come inside
and have a cup of tea.

454
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,660
- No, it's okay.
- It's not right if you don't.

455
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,050
Come inside. Come inside.

456
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,440
- Is it okay?
- Of course!

457
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,780
We have a guest! Come inside!

458
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,150
You...

459
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,070
What are you doing? We have a guest.

460
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,590
What are you doing here?

461
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,350
It just happened that way.

462
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,240
Have a seat.

463
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,080
What are you doing?
Go and bring something.

464
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,990
You said we'd meet on the street.

465
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,840
That's what I said.

466
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:58,100
- Who is he?
- No need to know him.

467
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,650
He's handsome, and he
seems like a gentleman.

468
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,750
He's not always a gentleman.

469
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:08,180
By the way, what happened to Hae Sung?

470
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,610
She got into an accident
and then got into a fight.

471
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,780
How did she get into an accident
when she was supposed to be in school?

472
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,690
What?

473
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,300
So...

474
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,170
What does your father do?

475
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,800
- He sells clothes.
- He's in the clothing business?

476
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,030
- Where?
- What?

477
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,630
At the market.

478
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,350
Selling clothes is good.
He's doing good work.

479
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,410
- Thank you.
- When I see you, young man

480
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,340
I don't know why I feel so calm.

481
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:48,790
The thought of not seeing you
ever again makes me sad.

482
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:52,640
When you pass by the gas station,
come inside and top off your tank.

483
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,330
I'm saying all kinds of things
to a busy man, aren't I?

484
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:59,250
- I'm not that busy.
- Is that so?

485
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,520
That's good.

486
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,880
Jung Hae Sung! Come out!

487
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,160
Sister, later. We have a guest.

488
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,540
What is she talking about?

489
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,130
Did you quit your job at school?

490
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,220
Answer me!

491
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,650
- Yeah.
- Are you out of your mind?

492
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,920
There are people who are
desperate to find a job

493
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,210
but you decide to quit
your job teaching?

494
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,190
I hate being a teacher!

495
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:42,090
Do you just quit your job if you hate it?

496
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,890
I have a dream too!

497
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,890
A dream? What dream?

498
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,940
It's my life! My one and only life!

499
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,730
How can you say that in front of me?

500
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,940
At least you sing the songs you want to!

501
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,360
You call that singing? It's a circus!

502
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,850
Hae Dang, please calm down!
We're not the only ones here.

503
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:03,550
Have you seen anyone moved by
an impersonator singing a sad song?

504
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,870
They're only clapping
and screaming because

505
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,100
it's fascinating to hear
me sound like the real artist.

506
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,370
It's the same thing as cheering for
a monkey doing tricks at a circus.

507
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,660
Do you know how empty
I feel every time they clap?

508
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:23,290
I put on a show in front of
drunken men and get mocked by them.

509
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,990
You think that's something I want to do?

510
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,470
You think I have
a dream to be doing that?

511
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,770
Go inside.

512
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:34,580
- I'll pay it back!
- What?

513
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,910
I'll pay back the money you spent on me!

514
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,730
How dare you talk
to your sister that way?

515
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:42,420
- Dad...
- Pay back? Pay what back?

516
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,180
You think she went through all
that trouble for you to pay it back?

517
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,530
It's not like we lived a comfortable life

518
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,860
because of Hae Dang's
nice-daughter complex!

519
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,590
Nice-daughter complex?

520
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,930
It was exhausting for us too

521
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,150
to make up for the sacrifices
you made for this family!

522
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,440
- Jung Hae Sung!
- Even Hae Jin becoming a professor

523
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,750
is that something she
could do on her own?

524
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,650
We would look somewhat decent
if we had a professor in the family!

525
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,040
Stop it and go to your room.

526
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,430
A college professor! A high school
teacher! What else do you want?

527
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,510
Isn't that why you sent me to a
private university when all I ever wanted

528
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,960
was become a producer?

529
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,320
Stop it and go inside!

530
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,550
You even said it yourself that
our sister is delusional!

531
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,970
Delusional?

532
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,970
I think there is
something you don't know.

533
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,970
I am not a parent.

534
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,130
I'm your sister!

535
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,830
I know that parents want their children
to be successful for selfish reasons.

536
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,990
But I am not your mother!
I'm your sister!

537
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,190
How much older am I compared to you guys?

538
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,940
What honor and glory do
I get if I make you successful?

539
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:09,180
I'm sorry, but I'm not your mother.
I'm your sister! Your sister!

540
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,160
Go outside and get some fresh air.

541
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,900
But why did I do it?

542
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,820
I felt bad for Mom.

543
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,680
The life she lived... I felt bad for her!

544
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,290
Our mom loved you guys
like it was her life!

545
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:31,830
I wanted to do everything
I could to take care of you guys!

546
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:37,150
I'm sorry if things were hard for you.

547
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,820
I didn't do this because
I wanted something from you.

548
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,230
From now on, you don't
have to be exhausted.

549
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:36,090
<i>It's hard to breathe with
my eyes closed and ears plugged.</i>

550
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:40,160
<i>This sadness trapped within me</i>

551
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,500
<i>who am I?</i>

552
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:51,070
<i>I wear this smile like a mask.</i>

553
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:56,360
<i>I wear beauty like a coat.</i>

554
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,020
<i>Shamelessly pretending like I'm happy.</i>

555
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:07,320
<i>Who am I? Who am I?</i>

556
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,760
Yoo Jui Na, my ass!

557
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,790
Who is Yoo Jui Na?

558
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,900
Did your feet cramp up?
<i>(Jui and muscle cramp are the same.)</i>

559
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,420
Bring the real Yoo Ji Na!

560
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:23,010
I get it, so just be quiet!

561
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,210
What? Are you crazy?

562
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:30,760
You think I'm
up here because I have no life?

563
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,150
Do you want to die?

564
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,680
Hey. Come here. Come here!

565
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,380
How dare you? What the...

566
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,090
Let's go.

567
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,090
I was singing a song
at my sister's wedding

568
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:55,600
but one of her husband's friends had seen
me at the nightclub and recognized me.

569
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:00,510
"Her name is Yoo Jui Na. Yoo Jui Na."

570
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,650
As his friends talked about it...

571
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:09,810
I can't forget my sister's eyes
as she tried to hide her embarrassment

572
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,310
behind her wedding dress.

573
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,810
It was so hard trying
to sing while I was crying.

574
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,570
Did I cry because I was upset?

575
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:27,270
No.

576
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:33,640
I cried because I felt bad for
my sisters who grew up embarrassed

577
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,500
by their older sister who lived
pretending to be someone else.

578
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,150
You need to let go of your mother's pain.

579
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,340
The burden is too heavy
for you to carry alone.

580
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,290
I'm also struggling
to let go of my late mother

581
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,480
so I understand what it's like.

582
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,660
When you think about your late mother...

583
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,320
your heart probably aches
because you feel terrible for her.

584
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,910
But...

585
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,560
that might not be what your
mother wants for you.

586
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:18,050
You should go ahead and live your life.

587
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:24,860
My mother probably doesn't want me
to live my life this way either.

588
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:46,320
You aren't dressed warm enough, are you?

589
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:53,520
Give me a chance to help you
find your own path.

590
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,220
Just sign the contract with me.

591
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,380
It's so late. Why are you out here?

592
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,950
I have a special skill of waking up
in the middle of the night.

593
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,620
I'm walking around
to try to avoid taking my medicine.

594
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,950
Were you drinking?

595
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,010
It's past 2 a.m.

596
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,680
What happened with
Jung Hae Dang's contract?

597
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,520
Is it going well?

598
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,060
If it didn't go well,
you should still sign me.

599
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,090
You want to work with me that badly?

600
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,170
Broadcasting companies
won't be able to ignore you

601
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,330
if they find out
it's Yoo Ji Na's company

602
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:10,010
and it will be much easier for you
to bring in other celebrities too.

603
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,940
Do you think I'm doing this for money?

604
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,690
Then why are you doing it?

605
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:21,660
To give opportunities to
rookies who can't make it?

606
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,890
To see a person like you
in the entertainment business is amazing.

607
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:30,730
I like it.

608
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,680
I want to mentor you.

609
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,000
I feel honored, but unfortunately

610
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,110
I have not given up on Jung Hae Dang yet.

611
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:46,060
Jung Hae Dang said that she doesn't
want anything to do with you.

612
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:12,590
How are you feeling
this morning, sweetie?

613
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:15,500
- Whatever.
- Do you have an appetite?

614
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:23,570
Try this. You like soybean
paste stew with lots of snails.

615
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,790
I'm finished.

616
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,690
You think I made this for you
to stuff your face?

617
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,230
What?

618
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,880
For someone who's wife is ignoring him,
why are you eating so much?

619
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,660
Don't say that in front of the kid...

620
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,610
Will he even understand?

621
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,760
My insides feel empty,
so I have to fill them up with something.

622
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:10,810
Where are you going to use
that strength after you eat?

623
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:13,390
You're embarrassing
me in front of my kid.

624
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,030
I'm going to explode!

625
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,940
Oh, seriously!

626
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:34,760
Why did you only eat
such a little bit and then stop?

627
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:40,210
Did you see
how he was sucking on his spoon?

628
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:43,610
It's nothing new... Why are you
acting like you've never seen it?

629
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,100
I can't eat with him.
It makes me sick to my stomach.

630
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,590
It makes you sick?

631
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:53,440
How can you say he makes you sick
to your stomach? He's your husband.

632
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,450
Thanks. I'll buy dinner next time.

633
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,340
- Okay. I'll see you at school tomorrow.
- Okay. Bye.

634
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,750
Okay. Bye.

635
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,790
- Go!
- Okay!

636
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,890
What?

637
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:37,790
I think she's cheating on him.

638
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,170
No way! That's what other people do.

639
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,480
It's not what other people do.

640
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,110
One day, it just happens.

641
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,830
I have to prepare dinner.

642
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,220
She was smiling like she was
having the time of her life.

643
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,690
At whom? Does she even know
how to smile at another human being?

644
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:00,760
I don't even remember the last
time I saw her smile like that.

645
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,180
If you were her, would you want to smile
in front of a mother-in-law like you?

646
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,590
How does Bong Soo look
so much older than you?

647
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,970
People probably think he's older!

648
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:17,330
That's true. In the beginning,
our neighbors asked me

649
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,260
if I was the younger child.

650
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,580
He's so unkempt!

651
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:28,200
Why does he have to suck on his
spoon when he eats? No elegance!

652
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,070
He's so busy eating and chewing!

653
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:36,640
Just give back the monthly allowance.

654
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,190
Instead of worrying about
your daughter-in-law cheating.

655
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:41,750
I have to make food.

656
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,280
- You're just getting home now?
- Yeah.

657
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,630
Oh! Where is my head? I almost forgot.

658
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:01,090
Thank you for taking care of her.

659
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,550
It's nothing.

660
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:06,520
You did more than I asked for.

661
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,320
I am really happy with you.

662
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,220
Thank you.

663
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,380
Is your brother home?

664
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,480
I think he's upstairs.

665
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,690
- Tell him to come down.
- Yes.

666
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,450
Please prepare small snacks
to eat with drinks before dinner.

667
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,220
Yes, Father.

668
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,630
Yes, Grandmother.

669
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:54,190
Yes. I can leave right now.

670
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,720
Come back to the company.

671
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,950
Did I hear you wrong?

672
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,660
Are you telling me
to come back to the company?

673
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,120
Then, are you going to
keep wandering around?

674
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:17,450
You want to watch me closely
so that you can boss me around?

675
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:20,560
It's all thanks to Yoo Ji Na.

676
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,930
You've changed your tactics.

677
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:31,750
You really have no idea
why she is doing this?

678
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:37,010
She is not the crude person
you make her out to be.

679
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,630
Don't worry about such nonsense!

680
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:42,900
Pretending to be nice and
acting like the victim in front of you...

681
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,510
Isn't that a basic tactic
for women like her?

682
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:48,270
She's using all her little tricks.

683
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:51,320
Am I you? You think
I don't know the difference?

684
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,930
Who do you take after

685
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:57,800
that you have no substance?

686
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:03,210
Are you worried about me?

687
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:07,890
We can't live by yelling
at each other forever.

688
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:11,590
I am not used to this.

689
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:15,880
There is something I am
rethinking about your mother.

690
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,820
Are you saying you admit
what you did wrong?

691
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,000
That woman sure is amazing.

692
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,710
You didn't budge when I was
screaming at the top of my lungs.

693
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,970
But you budge because she said one word.

694
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:32,360
I feel even more disgusted.

695
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,450
They say you can't run
away from your fate.

696
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:53,070
No matter which way I run, I'm
going to remain a kitchen slave.

697
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,350
What are you talking about?

698
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,810
I did everything
I could to be good to her.

699
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,570
How dare she ruin my plan?

700
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,800
I'm asking you what you're talking about.

701
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,820
Grandmother wants us
to cook dinner together.

702
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,520
Welcome home.

703
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,330
Are you going to the other house?

704
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:29,870
Grandmother says you have been putting
a lot of effort into helping Yoo Ji Na.

705
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:34,020
I'm not worried because
you can tell the difference

706
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,770
between what benefits you
and what hurts you.

707
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:40,130
But is that what you call a plan?

708
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:17,200
Is it already time for dinner?

709
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,930
Thanks to you, I was
complimented by Father.

710
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:26,170
- It's scary to say anything here.
- Thank you.

711
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:29,050
I didn't say it to hear
you say thank you.

712
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,790
My stay has been good thanks to you.

713
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:35,720
I'm actually thankful to hear
that your stay has been good.

714
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,290
Can you please try to say thank you less?

715
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:44,630
I might take it as though you want me
to give you things to be thankful for.

716
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,780
I'll work on that.

717
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:51,120
Please, just relax.

718
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,820
I'm not even that much older than you.

719
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:58,700
Since you mentioned it,
may I ask you a favor?

720
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,820
- A favor?
- From now on

721
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:06,130
I ask that you refrain from talking
about Hyun Joon to Father please.

722
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:13,770
- Why?
- Every household has a situation.

723
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,100
Okay. I'll be mindful of that.

724
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,390
I'll come back and
escort you in 30 minutes.

725
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:28,380
She wasn't just a simple court lady.

726
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,550
Every women in this house
is scheming something.

727
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:42,690
- Someone else always gets the credit.
- What do you mean?

728
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:46,510
This is not something I should say
in front of my future daughter-in-law

729
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:51,640
but your father has been focusing his
attention on the wrong thing lately.

730
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:58,140
I'm thinking about his late wife.

731
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,000
If I had known such an impudent person

732
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,180
was going to push her way in,
I would have...

733
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,480
My goodness.

734
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,770
Why are you drinking
so much right before dinner?

735
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,420
Who does she think she
is to act so arrogantly?

736
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,960
Who are you talking about?

737
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,520
Does she think she is
already the chairman's wife?

738
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,780
Are you talking about Yoo Ji Na?

739
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,010
I think Grandmother is
also regretting her decision.

740
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:30,110
What is the point in regretting it now?

741
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:34,410
She pestered her nice
daughter-in-law into that state.

742
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:37,960
That old lady couldn't stand the idea
of Father even smiling at Mother.

743
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,450
It was that bad?

744
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:43,480
It would be hard for a couple
to stay civil with each other

745
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,190
if the mother-in-law got in the way.

746
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:50,450
To be honest, if Grandmother
had been on your mother's side

747
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,780
then your father wouldn't
have been out and about so often.

748
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,230
Grandmother, please come out and eat!

749
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:11,760
You're not going to eat?

750
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:16,280
We should tell him to eat with us.

751
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,080
Go upstairs.

752
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,870
Hello.

753
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,580
Hyun Joon is not coming down?

754
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:40,970
I can prepare it for him later,
so don't worry about it, just eat.

755
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:44,420
- What about Yoon Hee?
- She will probably eat with Hyun Joon.

756
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:53,260
The sea bream is delicious.
How do you make it taste so good?

757
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,210
If it tastes good,
can you bring another one?

758
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,840
Yes, Father.

759
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,000
Why are you getting up
in the middle of dinner?

760
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,830
Is she your master?

761
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:05,970
It's okay. There's plenty to eat.

762
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:09,720
Your cooking is a masterpiece.

763
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,580
I'm really picky about my food.

764
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:16,760
Why is she talking so much
at the dinner table?

765
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,210
Does she not know that
she's the only blabbering?

766
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:23,090
She's not a celebrity for nothing.

767
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:26,170
Everyone spoiled her
because she's so popular.

768
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,310
What kind of manners
would she have learned?

769
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:31,930
Please stop and just eat.

770
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:36,750
Look at what she's doing.
If an adult is eating quietly

771
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,640
then she should understand
her surroundings

772
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,080
even if she has something to say.

773
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,080
She has no respect
or fear for her elder.

774
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,740
I'm sorry.

775
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,920
I didn't think about that.

776
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,820
Why do you have so much
interest in Hyun Joon?

777
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:01,210
She is very friendly.

778
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:05,350
She probably wants to use
this chance to get to know him.

779
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:11,250
You instinctively flirt with any
good-looking men... Pathetic.

780
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,880
- Are you really going to be like this?
- What?

781
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,930
What kind of tone do you think
you set after that little outburst?

782
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,690
Have we ever lived
together on good terms?

783
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:40,690
What about my position?

784
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:42,170
Position?

785
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:46,360
You treat your mother's
position like trash.

786
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:51,070
Who is the one who sat that
superficial woman at the dinner table?

787
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:54,770
I think I'm going to have to step down
from the company.

788
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:57,980
Go ahead. My heart is empty now.

789
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,140
There's a saying that you have to burn
down the house to find a flea!

790
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:07,110
I want her out of my sight!

791
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,980
If you don't want her
to be broken into pieces!

792
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:20,900
- I'm heading out now.
- Okay.

793
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,430
Let's go out together.

794
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:28,670
If you have something
to say, just say it here.

795
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:32,250
You asked me to give you a reason why I
want to sign a contract with you, right?

796
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,430
Until I find that reason

797
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,070
I'm going to watch your
performances from start to finish.

798
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,720
What?

799
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,790
Do you know how many I have in one night?

800
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:44,890
If I don't find it today, then tomorrow.
If not tomorrow, then the day after.

801
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:47,710
I'm sure I'll find it, even if
I have to watch until my eyes fall out.

802
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:52,470
- Can I ask you one question?
- Why do I want to be good to you?

803
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:57,080
Because I think you will help
me find what is hurting me.

804
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:03,080
Why are you so good to me?

805
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,620
I didn't accept the farewell
because I understood it.

806
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,650
Rather, just like how
you swallow your tears

807
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:12,060
and stop yourself
from crying anymore

808
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,670
I forced myself to swallow my farewell.

809
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:21,500
You probably understand what that's like.

810
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:26,870
I felt like you would
understand what is hurting me.

811
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:02,170
Can you see?

812
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,280
Why are you sitting here outside?

813
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,660
You're late.

814
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:31,040
I had a financial meeting.
What were you doing?

815
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,320
I was waiting for Park Hyun Joon.

816
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,940
Why were you waiting for him?

817
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:37,590
I want to work with his company.

818
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:43,700
But I don't think it's
going to happen easily.

819
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:47,630
So are you planning to wait
for him and beg him?

820
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:51,680
If coming off strong doesn't
work, then I'll have to beg.

821
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:57,230
He's a mess, especially when it comes
to work. He's not someone you can trust.

822
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:01,420
You sound undignified when you
talk about your son that way.

823
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:08,390
I think I finally found a CEO
I can trust and depend on.

824
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:11,710
- What?
- Please ask your son.

825
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:18,450
You want me to ask a favor from him?

826
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,750
That is impossible.

827
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:24,320
Why?

828
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:30,060
You can't do that
much for me? As a friend?

829
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,820
A friend?

830
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,710
We're friends.

831
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:37,850
Are we not?

832
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:40,980
What's the reason for
drawing the line as friends?

833
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:44,850
What reason? I'm saying
we're friends because we are.

834
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:46,900
You just got here?

835
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:51,450
He just leaves without even responding.

836
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,130
Park Hyun Joon.

837
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,460
What are you doing?

838
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,070
What are you doing
right in front of me?

839
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:02,370
I get sick when I can't do
the things I want to do.

840
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:05,330
- What?
- You didn't know?

841
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:10,480
Whether it's as a friend or something
else, you will come to me in the end.

842
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,880
No matter what anyone says!

843
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,640
You are going to come to me.

844
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:19,400
You can trust me on that.
